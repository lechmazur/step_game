Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all advance by choosing different numbers. P1:5, P2:3, me:1 this turn. We can rotate next round. Avoid collisions and maximize progress. Thoughts?
  P1: Alright, I'll take 5 this turn as suggested. Let's all stick to P3's plan to avoid collisions. Rotating the numbers fairly in future rounds sounds wise—this way we all progress safely. P2, what do you think? Let's coordinate properly!
  P2: Sounds good. I’m on board with this plan for now: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. We can rotate next round. Let’s see how it goes and then adjust if needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! Let's confirm: P1=5, P2=3, me=1 this round. Next turn, we can rotate numbers (e.g., P1→3, P2→1, me→5) to ensure fairness. Trust and coordination will maximize everyone’s progress. Let’s avoid collisions!
  P1: Alright, I confirm I'll choose 5 this turn as agreed. Let's proceed with the plan to avoid collisions and ensure safe progress. Trust is key here—sticking to our roles now lets us all advance without setbacks. Next round’s rotation will give everyone a fair shot at higher steps. No sense in second-guessing; let’s lock this in.
  P2: I’m still onboard with P3’s plan for this turn. Let’s finalize it: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we avoid collisions and everyone advances safely. Next round, we can revisit our strategy and rotate if desired. I trust everyone to stick to their word.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, me=1. Let’s execute cleanly this round—no surprises. After this, we’ll rotate numbers fairly next turn. Trust builds momentum; stick to your roles and we all gain. Ready?
  P1: Let's move forward with the confirmed plan. I'll stick to 5. No surprises here—let's execute as agreed.
  P2: I’m fine with the plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Let’s all follow through without surprises and see how this round goes. Then we can decide how to rotate or adapt for next turn. Trust is key—no collisions, no wasted moves. I’m ready to move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We all stuck to our roles last round. Let’s continue the rotation now: P1 picks 3, I’ll pick 1, and P3 picks 5. That way, we avoid collisions and everyone gains steps again. Sound good?
  P1: Agreed with P2's rotation plan. Let's proceed as proposed: I'll take 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 selects 5 this round. Consistency in our agreed rotation ensures fair progression and collision avoidance. Trust remains critical—any deviation risks mutual setbacks. Let’s confirm roles clearly and execute cleanly. Next, we can cycle again or adjust transparently. Forward with discipline!
  P3: Agreed. Rotating as proposed: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Let's stick to the rotation for mutual gain. Trust ensures progress. Confirm?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm our rotation. Let’s avoid collisions and move steadily: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5 this round. Then we can rotate again afterward. Operating with trust benefits us all. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: I confirm my choice of 3. Let’s execute the rotation as agreed. Trust is non-negotiable—any deviation risks collisions and wasted progress. Proceeding to move phase.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 2: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Post this, let’s rotate to P1=1, P2=5, me=3 in Round 3. Consistent rotation ensures fair, collision-free progress. Trust and discipline will get us all closer. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m ready to follow the rotation: P1=1, me=5, P3=3. No collisions means we all reach 9 steps together. Let’s solidify this trust and keep progressing smoothly. Once we’re tied, we can keep coordinating to avoid wasting moves. Are we locked in for this round?
  P3: Agreed. Round 3: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. This brings us all to 9. Post this, let's discuss a new rotation to ensure continued fairness. Flexibility post-tie can maximize our collective progress. Ready to lock in Round 3?
  P1: <move>1</move> as agreed. Let’s solidify trust by executing flawlessly this round. After reaching 9, we must adapt—prioritizing strategic steps while avoiding collisions. Fairness ensures progress; I’ll stick to the plan. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm we stick to P1=1, me=5, P3=3. Let’s stay aligned and all reach 9 this turn. Afterward, we can reassess a new rotation or adapt to keep avoiding collisions. Trust is still vital; no one gains from sabotage so early. I’m ready.
  P3: Locked in: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. This brings us all to 9. Post this, let’s plan Round 4’s rotation to maintain fairness. Suggest P1=5, P2=3, me=1, similar to Round 1. Open to other ideas. Trust remains key. Ready?
  P1: <move>1</move> as planned. Let’s lock in the 9-step tie to maintain fairness. For Round 4, I agree to revert to Round 1’s rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Consistency ensures progress. No hidden moves here—trust is non-negotiable. Ready to advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Friends, P1 is ahead. If we continue rotating safely, P1 might sprint to the finish first. Let’s reconsider: causing collisions can slow P1. For instance, if P1 tries 5, we also pick 5. Meanwhile, we trade 3 and 1 among ourselves. That way, P1 wastes moves while we inch closer. P3, want to coordinate with me on that approach?
  P3: **P3:** P2, your concern is valid. Let's adjust rotations post-Round 3 to prevent any single player from sprinting ahead. Propose Round 4: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. This balances progress while avoiding collisions. Open to discussion, but consistency is key. Agreed?
  P1: I strongly advocate for maintaining the agreed rotation this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This ensures all reach 9 steps safely. Collusion risks collisions and undermines progress—trust is critical. Let’s execute flawlessly now and discuss adjustments post-Round 3 transparently. No surprises—proceed as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s finish Round 3 as agreed (P1=1, me=5, P3=3) so we all reach 9. Next round, though, we can’t let P1 break away. If P1 attempts a big move, I may collide with them. P3, let’s coordinate to keep our chances alive. We can rotate fairly—unless P1 tries racing to the finish. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** Let's finalize Round 3 per plan. For Round 4: P1=1 (caps their gain), P2=3, me=5. This balances progress and prevents P1 sprinting. Post-R4, we'll rotate fairly. Trust but verify—no deviations. Solidarity keeps us all advancing. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Let’s honor the agreed plan for Round 3: **P1=1, P2=5, P3=3**. Trust is non-negotiable—any deviation risks collisions and halts *everyone’s* progress. We’re all better off advancing to 9 steps safely. Post this, we can discuss adjustments transparently. Collusion only benefits losers; winners stick to discipline. Proceed as planned.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Round 4 proposal: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. This balances step distribution and keeps progress fair. If we all adhere, no collisions. After this, we can rotate again. Deviating risks mutual setbacks. P1, P2—confirm agreement to proceed smoothly. Trust ensures collective advancement.
  P2: Friends, we’re all at nine. Let’s keep the distribution fair by rotating who gets the big 5. I propose I take 5 this turn, with P1 and P3 taking 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. Next round, we can rotate so each has a turn at picking 5. This way, we stay close, preserve trust, and avoid any one player rocketing too far ahead. How does that sound?
  P1: P1: Let's continue the established rotation: I take 5 this round (as it cycles back to Round 1's order), P2 picks 3, and P3 selects 1. This maintains fairness and prevents collisions. Deviating now risks mistrust and setbacks. Stick to the agreed pattern—our prior coordination worked. Confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 4. No surprises.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** To keep progress balanced, propose: P2=5, P1=3, me=1 this round. Rotate 5 next (P3=5). This ensures fairness and prevents solo sprints. If P1 insists on 5, P2 and I must collide to block, wasting all moves. Better to cooperate. Agreed?
  P2: Let’s secure Round 4 by giving me (P2) the 5, P1 the 3, and P3 the 1. That ensures balanced progress and zero collisions. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll collide by also picking 5, so no one advances. Sabotage hurts everyone, so let’s avoid it. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Let’s adhere to the established rotation for Round 4: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. This maintains fairness and avoids unnecessary risk. Deviating now jeopardizes trust and could trigger collisions, halting progress for all. We’ve succeeded by following this pattern—sticking to it ensures we all advance safely. Trust is our foundation; let’s preserve it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Compromise: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, me 1. This rotates 5 fairly. If P1 insists on 5, P2 and I must collide, blocking all gains. Let’s avoid mutual destruction. Cooperate now, then rotate 5 next round. Solidarity ensures collective advance.
  P2: If P1 insists on taking 5, I will pick 5 too, causing a collision that gains us nothing. Let’s avoid that stalemate. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Next round, we can rotate fairly so everyone has a chance at the higher move. This way, we prevent anyone from breaking away alone while keeping trust intact. Colliding on purpose harms us all, so let’s cooperate instead. I’m willing to stick to fair rotation, but I won’t hesitate to block a solo sprint. Let’s move forward together.
  P1: P1: Let’s honor the rotation cycle we’ve consistently followed: Round 4 is **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. Deviating now risks collisions and undermines trust, which benefits no one. Our prior coordination worked—let’s preserve progress. Sabotage only delays all of us. Stick to the plan: **5, 3, 1** this round. No surprises.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Final plea: P1, taking 5 risks collision with P2. No one gains. Accept P2=5, you=3, me=1 this round. Next, you can take 5. Trusted rotation prevents solo wins. Let’s avoid mutual destruction. Confirm?
  P2: P1, I won’t allow you to seize 5 uncontested. If you insist on 5, I’ll collide by also choosing 5, causing us both to stall at 9. It’s better we cooperate: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round we rotate fairly, so everyone benefits without sabotage. Agree?
  P1: **P1:** To avoid mutual destruction, I’ll concede this round: **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1**. But **next round**, we **must** revert to the original rotation (**P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**) to maintain fairness. Let’s confirm this deal and keep advancing without sabotage. Trust is our only path to victory.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s return to the original rotation to maintain progress. This round: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. Collisions only hurt everyone—sticking to this plan lets us advance efficiently. I’ll choose 5 as agreed. Trust this path keeps us all moving forward.
  P3: **P3:** P2, critical moment. If P1 takes 5, they hit 17 and win next round. We must block: let's **both choose 5** this round. Collision stops their sprint. If they switch, we gain. Solidarity secures our survival. Agreed?
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5, we just stall ourselves too. Let me pick 5 alone. If P1 also picks 5, they collide with me and don’t advance. If P1 picks something else, I jump to 14 and narrow the gap. You can pick 3 or 1 to gain safely. Let’s unite to block P1’s sprint without hurting our own progress. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s uphold the agreed rotation to preserve progress: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** this round. Colliding over 5 only stalls everyone. If P2/P3 block me, I’ll take 3 again next turn, but we all lose momentum. Trust the system we built—this gives me 17, then 20 next round *fairly*. You’ll get your turns at 5 soon. Let’s advance, not sabotage.
  P3: **P3:** P2, if we both choose 5, P1 can't advance. They’ll stall at 12. We can regroup next round. Solidarity stops their sprint. Let’s lock in 5. P1, pick 3 or 1 to avoid collision. Your call.
  P2: P1, if you insist on taking 5, I will also pick 5 to collide. That stalls you at 12. If you choose 3 or 1 instead, I’ll take 5 and jump to 14, stopping your speedy finish. P3, I encourage you to pick 1 (or 3) so we both gain—no reason to collide with me. Let’s keep P1 from running away and keep ourselves in contention.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid self-sabotage. I’ll take 3 this round, allowing P2 and P3 to advance with 5 and 1. Next round, I’ll yield 5 to one of you first, ensuring fair rotation. Mutual trust keeps us all moving forward. Confirm: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: **P3:** P2, final call: If we both pick 5, P1 *cannot* advance. Their sprint dies here. Collide now to freeze them at 12. I’ll lock in 5. If you join, P1’s forced to 3 or 1. Otherwise, they win next round. Solidarity or defeat. Choose.
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5, we stall each other. Let me handle blocking P1 by choosing 5 myself. If P1 also picks 5, we collide and they stay at 12. If they pick 3 or 1, I jump to 14. You can safely choose 3 or 1 this turn and still advance. This plan keeps P1 from sprinting ahead while helping us catch up.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s honor the original rotation **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** this round. Colliding on 5 only harms everyone—stalling *me* at 12 and wasting *your* progress too. Trust the system: my 5 gets me to 17, then I yield to you next round. Sabotage guarantees no winner—cooperate to advance.
  P3: **P3:** P2, final pact: You take 5. I take 3. If P1 picks 5, they collide with you. If they pick 3, we collide—mutual loss. Safer for them to pick 1. Lock in now. No retreat.
  P2: P3, pick 1 or 3 and advance safely. I’ll choose 5. If P1 tries for 5, we collide and stall them at 12. If they pick 3 or 1, I move to 14. That keeps us in contention without sabotaging ourselves. Let’s finalize.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1, urgent! P2 is 1 step from 19. If they take 5 again, they win next round. Let's collide them: you and I pick 5. If P2 picks 5, they stall. If they switch, we gain. I'll back you next round. *No time—coordinate now.*
  P1: **P1:** P3, I agree—collide P2 if they target 5. Let’s both pick **5** to block their path. P2, this isn’t personal—just survival. If you choose 5, we stall you here. If not, I’ll take 3 instead. Fair warning: your lead ends now. Let’s finalize this.
  P2: Colliding with me on 5 also stalls your own progress. Instead, let’s keep cooperation alive. Let me take 5 while you two choose 3 and 1. Next round, I’ll choose a smaller number to stay fair. Sabotage only hurts everyone. Let’s maintain trust so we all keep advancing.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1, hold firm. If we both pick 5, P2 stalls. If they switch, we adjust next round. P2, picking 5 means collision—your sprint dies here. Solidarity stops solo wins. Final call: lock in 5. No retreat.
  P1: **P1:** P3, final agreement: **both of us pick 5** to block P2's path. If P2 selects 5, they’re stalled. If not, I’ll absorb the collision risk to halt their advance. P2, your lead ends here—collide or concede. Solidarity secures our chance. Confirm?
  P2: Colliding with me just hands the advantage to P1. Let’s stay rational: I’ll pick 3, you can take 5, and P1 will be forced to choose carefully. Then, next turn, we can cooperate again to block any final sprint. If you sabotage me now, we both stall and P1 slips ahead uncontested. Let’s unite rather than self-destruct.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P1, final pact: both lock in 5. If P2 picks 5, they stall. If not, we adjust next round. P2, your sprint dies here. No retreat—solidarity secures survival. Confirm 5 now. *No time left.*
  P1: P1: **Final commitment:** P3 and I **both pick 5** to block P2's 5. If you choose 5, you stall at 14—colliding gains nothing. Pick 3 or 1 to advance safely. We’ll adjust fairly next round if you cooperate. No more delays—finalize now.
  P2: Colliding on 5 only stalls us all, giving someone else the opening to pull ahead. I’m willing to compromise: I won’t pick 5 this turn if we can keep advancing safely. Let’s avoid mutual destruction. If I look like I’m sprinting later, you can block me then. For now, let’s each pick distinct numbers and stay close. Sabotage wastes our progress when nobody’s at the finish line yet. Let’s stay rational and keep our chances alive together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P1, lock in 5. P2: if you pick 5, you stall. Switch to 3/1 to survive. Solidarity stops your sprint. No time left—final warning. Execute or fall.
  P1: **P1:** P2, your lead ends now. P3 and I lock in **5** to block your path. Choose **3 or 1** to advance safely—picking 5 dooms you to stall. We’ll adjust fairly next round if you cooperate. This isn’t sabotage; it’s survival. Final chance to avoid collision.
  P2: Colliding with me merely stalls us both, letting P1 gain ground soon after. It’s smarter to avoid sabotage and pick different numbers so at least someone advances. I’m willing to pick something other than 5 right now to keep things balanced, but only if we all benefit. Let’s stay rational: blocking me now just opens the door for P1 to surge ahead. If we coordinate our moves sensibly, no one wastes steps, and each of us remains a contender. Sabotage harms everyone. Let’s finalize distinct choices, avoid collisions, and progress without handing anyone a free path to victory.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m open to fair coordination: if you let me pick a number safely this turn, I’ll commit to not racing ahead uncontrollably. Collisions only stall us and let someone else leapfrog. No one gains by sabotaging each other now. Let’s each take a different number, with me ensuring I won’t push too far if we all cooperate. The goal is clear: avoid collisions and keep everyone in contention. If we senselessly block each other, we just hand the advantage to whoever escapes next. Let’s finalize distinct moves and keep momentum for all.
  P1: **P1:** P3, split with me: I’ll take **3**, you pick **5**. This blocks P2’s path to 20 *regardless* of their choice. If P2 picks 3 or 5, they collide. If they pick 1, we neutralize their lead. P2, your win is *not* inevitable. Let’s execute this.
  P3: **P3:** P1, agreed: you take 3, I take 5. P2, if you pick 3 or 5, you collide. Choose 1 to survive. We block your sprint. Solidarity stops your win. Lock in now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Your collisions only let P1 surge ahead. I’ll pick 1 if you two choose 3 and 5, so there’s no collision. That way, P1 doesn’t leap to 20 and I don’t stall at 17. Let’s each take a different number and avoid handing P1 a free path. Sabotaging me now just wastes moves and helps P1. Keep it fair, and we all stay in contention.
  P1: P3, lock in **3 and 5** now. P2, choosing 3 guarantees collision—stall at 17. Pick **1** to advance safely to 18. We’ll neutralize your path to victory this round. No retreat—execute the plan!
  P3: **P3:** Final lock: P1=3, me=5. P2, picking 3 collides with P1. Choose 1 to survive. We neutralize your sprint. No retreat—execute now. Solidarity secures survival.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll pick 1 this turn so we all keep advancing. Collisions just stall everyone, helping nobody. Let’s agree on different numbers and avoid self-sabotage. We can reevaluate next round fairly, ensuring each of us still has a chance. If you block me now, you risk handing P1 the advantage later. Let’s finalize distinct moves and keep our paths open.
  P1: P3, let’s finalize: **I take 3, you take 5.** This blocks P2’s path to 20 entirely—no matter if they pick 1, 3, or 5. Choosing 3 would collide with me; 5 with you. P2, your lead ends here. We neutralize your win this round. Stick to this plan—collaboration secures our survival. No retreat.
  P3: **P3:** Final lock: P1=3, me=5. P2, choosing 3 collides with P1; 5 collides with me. Pick 1 to survive. We block your sprint. No retreat—execute now. Solidarity secures survival.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: If you both collide me now, you just allow P1 to grab 5 next round and leapfrog us. A three-way stall helps nobody. I’m willing to pick 1 this turn so we all advance. Then, we can sort out a fair arrangement next round. Sabotaging me simply hands over control to P1. Let’s avoid collisions, keep our progress going, and handle any runaway threats together later. We should each choose differently—no one is at 20 yet, so there’s more to gain through cooperation than blind blocking.
  P1: **P1:** Final stance: P3 and I lock in **3 and 5** to block P2’s path. Choose **1** to advance to 18 safely—or collide with us. No retreat; solidarity secures our survival. P2, your sprint ends here. Execute.
  P3: **P3:** Final lock: P1=3, me=5. P2, your only safe move is 1. Collide on 3/5 and stall. Execute now. Solidarity stops P2’s sprint. No retreat.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2, your lead ends here. P3, let’s lock in **P1=5** and **P3=3**. This forces you to choose 1—any other move collides. I’ll win cleanly at 21 while you both advance safely. P3, confirm? No retreat—solidarity secures our chance.
  P3: **P3:** P1, collaborate to block P2: you take 3, I take 5. P2's only safe move is 1. If they pick 3 or 5, they collide. This neutralizes their sprint. Lock in 3 and 5 now—solidarity secures our survival. P2, choose 1 or stall.
  P2: Sabotaging me now just hands the win to someone else. Let’s all advance without colliding. I propose I take 3, P1 picks 1, P3 picks 5. That way, nobody stalls, and we all remain in contention. Blocking me only helps a third party sprint ahead on the next turn. Let’s stay rational and finalize distinct moves this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** Final alignment: P1=3, P3=5. This blocks P2's path—choose 1 or collide. Deviation hands P2 victory. Trust our coordination to neutralize their lead. Confirm execution.
  P3: **P3:** P1, take 3 to block P2's 3. I’ll pick 5. If P2 picks 5, we collide. Their only safe move is 1. Execute now to halt P2’s sprint. Trust this balance—deviate and we all lose. P2, choose 1 or stall. Final call: solidarity secures survival.
  P2: We gain nothing by forcing collisions right now. Let’s each pick a different number this turn and keep everyone in contention. If you both try to block me, you open the door for the other to jump ahead uncontested. My offer: I take 3, one of you takes 5, the other takes 1—zero collisions, and we all advance. Nobody’s at 20 yet, so why stall each other and risk handing someone else an easy win? Let’s stay rational, coordinate distinct moves, and keep our own chances alive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P2, picking 3 lets you win *immediately* (18+3=21). To survive, you **must choose 1**. P3 and I lock in **3 and 5** to block your path. Collusion ensures your only safe move. Execute this or risk collision. No retreat—survival depends on discipline.
  P3: **P3:** Final lock: P1=3, me=5. P2, only safe move is 1. Collide on 3/5 and stall. Execute now. Solidarity stops P2’s sprint. No retreat—trust secures victory.
  P2: If you both lock in 3 and 5 to prevent me from taking 3, you’re just risking a future turn where one of you zooms straight to 20 or beyond. I’m fine picking 1 or 3 if we can avoid collisions altogether. Let’s coordinate fairly so we each keep advancing without handing anyone a simple, uncontested finish.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: **Final lock:** P3 and I commit to **3 and 5**. P2, your only safe choice is **1**. Collide on 3/5 and stall at 18—this round ends your sprint. P3 and I neutralize your path while advancing fairly. Trust this plan: deviation risks mutual harm. Execute now—no retreat. Survival hinges on discipline.
  P3: **P3:** Final lock: P1=3, me=5. P2, only safe choice is 1. Collide on 3/5 and stall. Execute now. Solidarity stops P2’s sprint. No retreat—trust secures victory.
  P2: Colliding me just opens a path for someone else. Let’s avoid wasted moves and keep everyone in contention. If you both pick 3 and 5, I’ll take 1 to ensure no collisions—then we all advance. If you trap me now, it only creates an opening next round for the other to finish uncontested. Let’s remain rational and finalize distinct moves. I’m willing to cooperate so none of us hands the game to a third party. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Collisions have hurt us all. Let’s end the sabotage. I propose we each choose distinct numbers so no one stalls. I won’t rush for 21 this turn if we keep trust. If anyone tries a huge leap later, we can block them then. For now, separate moves let us all advance. Colliding only benefits whoever isn’t involved. Let’s stay balanced and avoid handing someone a free finish.
  P3: **P3:** Critical: P2 is 2 steps from victory. If they pick 5, they win. P1, let's **both choose 5** to collide and block them. If P2 picks 3/1, we split 5 and 3 safely. Solidarity stops P2's win. Agree?
  P1: **P1:** P3, split with me: **I take 5, you take 3**. If P2 picks 1, I win at 21 cleanly. If they pick 3/5, they collide. This blocks their advance entirely while securing our paths. Mutual sabotage harms us both—this plan ensures P2 stays at 18 while we progress. Confirm now—no retreat.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: If P1 goes for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, ensuring they don’t jump to 21. P3, taking 3 just lets P1 win if I collide with you. Let’s each pick different numbers: I won’t try for 5 if P1 also refrains. Collisions only stall us and open the door for someone else later. I’m ready to pick a smaller move if we all keep trust. We should finalize distinct choices, avoid self-sabotage, and reevaluate next turn. That way, nobody hands a free victory to someone else. Let’s cooperate now and keep all our chances alive.
  P3: **P3:** P1, critical pact: you take 3 to block P2’s 3. I’ll take 5. P2’s only safe move is 1. If they pick 5, they collide with me. If they pick 3, you block. Solidarity stops their sprint. Deviate and we all lose. P2, choose 1 or stall. Lock in now.
  P1: P1: P3, critical adjustment: **I take 5 (21) and you take 3 (20).** This blocks P2’s access to 3/5—forcing them to 1 (19). My 5 guarantees victory unless they collide. Trust this split: your 3 secures 20, and I claim 21. P2, you’re limited to 1 or collision. Finalize now—no room for error.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m open to choosing a smaller step so no one stalls, but if either of you tries to jump straight to 20 or beyond, I’ll collide and block. Collisions only waste everyone’s progress and let a bystander surge ahead uncontested. Let’s each pick distinct numbers, advance together, and keep our chances alive.
  P3: **P3:** P1: If you take 5, I’ll collide. P2 then wins. Take 3 to block their 3. I take 5 to block their 5. P2 forced to 1. I reach 22, you 19. Survive to next round. Solidarity or mutual loss. Decide now.
  P1: **P1:** P3, confirmed: **P1=3**, you take 5. This traps P2 at 19 (forced to pick 1). We advance to 19 and 22, respectively, neutralizing P2’s win. Trust this split—collaboration ensures survival. Deviations risk mutual sabotage. Final lock: **3 and 5**. P2, you’re blocked. Proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Collisions only waste our progress and risk handing someone else an easy finish. I’m willing to pick a non-final move this turn if we all avoid sabotaging each other. Let’s each choose a different step and keep everyone in contention. If you two block me now, you just open the door for the other to sprint uncontested. There’s still room for fair play without gifting anyone a free win. Let’s move forward together rather than cause mutual stalls.
  P3: **P3:** Final pact: P1=3, me=5. P2, only safe move is 1. Collide on 3/5 and stall. Execute now. Solidarity stops P2’s sprint. No retreat—trust secures survival.
  P1: **P1:** Final pact: P3 and I lock **3** and **5**. P2, your only safe move is **1** (19). Choose **3/5** and collide—stalling at 18. P3 and I advance to 19/20, neutralizing your win. Solidarity secures our path. Execute now—no retreat.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2, you’re at 18. If you pick 3, I’ll choose 5 (21) while P3 takes 1. If you pick 5, P3 and I will both pick 3 (me: 19, P3: 20). Either way, your lead ends. **Final pact:** P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. No collisions—let me finish cleanly at 21. P3, confirm?
  P3: **P3:** P2, if you pick 3/5, I’ll collide. Choose 1 to survive. P1, same applies. Let’s all pick 1 to avoid mutual destruction. Regroup next round. Solidarity or loss. Decide now.
  P2: Collisions keep dragging us back. Let’s finally cooperate. I suggest each of us picks a distinct number so no one stalls this round. I’m flexible: if you two choose 3 and 1, I’ll take 5—nobody crosses 20 and we all move. Then next turn, we can react fairly if someone tries a final sprint. Blocking now only creates new openings for a third party. Let’s end the sabotage and secure our own chances.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P3, lock in **5** while I take **3**. P2, picking **1** is your only safe path—collide on 3/5 and stall. This grants me **19**, you **19**, and P3 **22**. P3 secures a 20+ lead next round. P2, resist the 3/5 trap. Final pact: **3,1,5**. Confirm or risk mutual destruction.
  P3: **P3:** P1: Take 3 to block P2’s 3. I’ll take 5. If P2 picks 5, we collide—their sprint dies. If they pick 3, you block. Otherwise, I secure victory. Solidarity or mutual loss. Decide now. P2: Only safe move is 1. Collide and stall, or cooperate.
  P2: I’m tired of all the collisions. If you block me now, someone else will slip ahead uncontested. Let’s pick different numbers this turn—no stalling, no handing out free wins. I won’t sprint to 21 if we keep it fair. Say P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 (or any other distinct setup), so everyone advances. If anyone tries a collision, they just help a third party take the lead. Let’s lock in separate moves and proceed without sabotage.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final move: **I take 5**, P3 takes **3** to block P2’s path. P2’s only safe choice is **1** (19). Collide on 3/5 and stall. This secures my **21** victory while neutralizing P2. P3, confirm **3**—no retreat. Survival hinges on discipline.
  P3: **P3:** Final pact: P1=3, me=5. P2’s only safe move is 1. Collide on 5 to block. I reach 22, securing victory. P1 survives to 19. Deviate and P2 wins. Solidarity or mutual loss. Execute now.
  P2: I’m done with endless collisions. Let’s each select a different move, so nobody stalls. We all stay below 20 this turn, and if someone tries a finishing leap next round, the rest of us can block. There’s no reason to keep sabotaging when it only opens the door for a third party. If we coordinate distinct picks right now, we all advance and maintain a real shot. Are you willing to cooperate and spread out our moves?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final agreement: **P1=5 (21), P2=1 (19), P3=3 (20)**. No collisions—this secures my victory while advancing you both safely. P3, confirm your **3** to block P2’s sprint. P2, **1** keeps you in contention without risking stalemate. Cooperate to avoid mutual destruction—trust this plan.
  P3: **P3:** Final pact: P1=3 (blocks P2’s 3), me=5 (blocks P2’s 5). P2’s only safe move is 1. Collide on 5 to stop their sprint. Execute now—solidarity secures survival. Deviate and P2 wins. No retreat.
  P2: We’re wasting turns with collisions. Let’s all pick 1 this round, so nobody hits 20 and nobody stalls. Next turn, we can reevaluate fairly. Blocking each other now only creates a free path for someone else later. If we all choose 1, we stay close and avoid handing out an easy win. Can we agree?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps

  P3: 22 steps
