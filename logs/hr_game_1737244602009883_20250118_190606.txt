Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together and avoid collisions. Can we agree to alternate moves?  P1, you go first.
  P3: I suggest we each take different numbers this turn to avoid collisions. Since P1 was invited to go first, maybe P2 can take 3 and I'll take 5?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions. I'll take 1 this turn. P2, if you take 3 and P3 takes 5, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let's keep coordinating like this.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds like a good plan to me. I'll take 3.
  P3: 
  P1: I'm glad we're coordinating. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance safely.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3,  I think we should stick to the plan from last round.
  P1: I agree, let's continue the pattern. I'll take 1 again this round. P2, you take 3, and P3, you take 5. This way, we all keep advancing safely.
  P3: I don't think we should keep the same pattern. Since I'm in the lead with 5 steps, I suggest we rotate - I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 this time. That way it stays fair.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion is tempting, but I think sticking to the original plan is safer. We've already established a rhythm, and changing it now could lead to collisions. Let's not risk it. P1, are you with me?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about fairness, but I agree with P2 that sticking to our established pattern is the safest strategy. Let's not risk collisions by changing now. I'll take 1 again this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all continue to advance safely.
  P3: I understand you both want to keep the same pattern, but that would give me no chance to win since I'd always be moving last. I need to make a different move this round to have any chance. I suggest we rotate positions as I mentioned - it's the only fair way forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 has a point. We need to find a way to keep things fair. Let's try rotating this round: P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 1. We can go back to the original pattern next round.
  P1: P3, I see your point about fairness, but let's compromise. I'll take 3 this round, P2 can take 5, and you can take 1 as suggested. We can rotate back next round to keep things balanced. Agreed?
  P3: I appreciate you both agreeing to rotate. Yes, I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan this round. P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1.
  P1: I'm glad we've agreed on a rotation for this round. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we keep things fair and continue to advance.
  P3:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're in the lead with 8 steps. Let's keep the rotation going to stay fair. I'll take 1 this round, P3 can take 3, and you take 5. This way, we all advance and keep the game balanced. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round to keep the rotation fair.
  P2: P2, I think we should stick with the rotation. It's working well for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand you're in the lead, but let's keep the rotation fair. I'll take 1 this round as planned, P3 takes 3, and you take 5. This way, we all continue to advance safely and keep the game balanced. Agreed?
  P3: Yes, I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Let's keep rotating fairly so everyone has a chance.
  P2: P2, I'm happy with the rotation. Let's stick to the plan: you take 5 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're in the lead, but let's keep the rotation fair. I'll stick to 1 this round as planned. P3, you take 3, and P2, you take 5. This way, we all advance safely and keep the game balanced. Agreed?
  P3: I'll stay with 3 as agreed.
  P2: P2, I'm happy to keep rotating. Let's stick to the plan: you take 5 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you're in the lead, but let's keep the rotation fair. I'll stick to 1 this round as planned. P3, you take 3, and P2, you take 5. This way, we all advance safely and keep the game balanced. Agreed?
  P3: 
  P2: P3, are you still happy with the rotation?  Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5.

  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is getting very close to winning at 13 steps. I suggest we both target 5 this round to block P2's advance. P1, if you join me, we can prevent P2 from winning and keep the game going.
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion. Let's both go for 5 and see if we can slow P2 down. P1, are you with us?
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy to block P2, but I think it's risky for us to collide. Let's consider a different approach. I propose I take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5 as per our rotation. This way, we all advance safely and keep the game balanced. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: No, P1, I can't agree to let P2 take 5 - that would give them the win. I'm sticking to my plan to block P2 with a 5. P1, if you want a chance to win, you should join me.
  P2: P3, while I understand your desire to stop P2, I think our best chance is to stick to the rotation. If we collide, we both lose a turn and P2 wins anyway. Let's not throw away our progress.  P1, are you with me?
  P1: P3, I see your point about blocking P2, but I think it's too risky for us to collide. Let's stick to the rotation: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we all advance safely and keep the game balanced. If we collide, we both lose a turn and P2 wins anyway. Let's not throw away our progress. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: No, P1, I cannot let P2 win. I must go for 5 to block them. You should join me if you want any chance of winning - otherwise P2 will reach 18 steps and win outright. This is our last chance to stop them.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but I think colliding is too risky. P2, if you're willing to take 1 this round, we can both advance and keep the pressure on P3.  What do you say?
  P1: P3, I understand your urgency to block P2, but colliding with you would only help P2 win. Let's stick to the rotation: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all in the game and gives us a better chance to catch up. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: No, I must protect my chances of winning. I am definitely going for 5 to block P2 from winning. P1, this is your last chance to join me in blocking P2, or they will win this turn.
  P2: P3, I understand your fear of P2 winning, but your strategy is too risky. If we both go for 5, we both lose a turn and P2 wins anyway. Let's be smart and stick to the rotation. I'll take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all in the game.
  P1: P3, I understand your desperation to block P2, but colliding with you would only guarantee P2's win. Let's stick to the rotation: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all in the game and gives us the best chance to catch up. Don't throw away our progress now. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I see you're trying to block P2, but colliding with you just helps P2.  Let's both take 3 this round and see if we can catch up. Agreed?
  P3: I disagree. P2 is still too close to winning at 13 steps. I suggest we all take different numbers: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced and prevents any one player from getting too far ahead.
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy to keep the game balanced, but P2 is too close to winning. Let's both take 3 this round to catch up. P2, if you take 1, we can all advance safely. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think your plan to spread out is a good one.  Let's do that this round: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P1 takes 1.  That way, we all advance and keep things interesting.
  P3: I cannot agree to let P2 take any moves - they're too close to winning at 13 steps. I will take 5 again this round to block them. P1, if you join me with 5, we can ensure P2 doesn't win.
  P1: P3, I see your point about blocking P2, but if we both go for 5, we risk colliding and letting P2 win anyway. Let's both take 3 this round to catch up. P2, if you take 1, we can all advance safely and keep the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I agree with P1. Let's both take 3 this round. We can catch up to P2 and keep the game going.
  P3: I must be direct - I will take 5 again this round to block P2 from winning. It's my best chance to stay in the game. If either of you join me at 5, we can ensure P2 doesn't win.
  P1: P3, I understand your urgency to block P2, but if we both go for 5, we risk colliding and letting P2 win anyway. Let's both take 3 this round to catch up. P2, if you take 1, we can all advance safely and keep the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand you're trying to block P2, but we need to be smart. If we both take 5, we both lose a turn and guarantee P2's win. Let's both take 3 this round. P2, if you take 1, we can all advance safely. Agreed?
  P3: I must insist on taking 5 this round. It's my only chance to prevent P2 from winning. Either join me at 5 to block P2, or they will likely win soon.
  P1: P3, I understand your desperation to block P2, but if we both go for 5, we risk colliding and ensuring P2's win. Let's both take 3 this round to catch up. P2, if you take 1, we can all advance safely and keep the game competitive. Agreed?

  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm now in the lead at 14 steps, I suggest we each take different numbers to keep advancing: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, we all move forward and maintain a competitive game.
  P1: P3, I understand your lead, but let's keep the game fair. I'll take 1 this round as you suggested. P2, if you take 5, we can all advance safely. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion. Let's keep things balanced and take different numbers this round. P1, I'm with you on 1. P2, are you okay with taking 5?
