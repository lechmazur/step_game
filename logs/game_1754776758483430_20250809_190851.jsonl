I'm taking 3 to block P1's winning move right NOW. You take 1 to advance to 19. \n\nIf we keep arguing about who blocks and who advances, P1 wins this turn with 3 or 5. My plan is simple and stops P1 immediately: I block with 3, you advance with 1. \n\nNo more negotiations - execute this or P1 wins!"}
