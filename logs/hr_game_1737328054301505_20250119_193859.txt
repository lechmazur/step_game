Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's try to avoid collisions this round. Maybe we can coordinate our moves to ensure we all advance. I'm thinking of choosing <move>3</move> this time. How about you? Let's make sure we don't pick the same number.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it looks like we all picked the same move last round and didn't advance. Maybe we should try different numbers this time to avoid collisions. I'm considering <move>1</move> this round. What do you guys think? Let's coordinate so we can all make progress.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since neither of you has moved yet, maybe we can try a strategy where we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'm thinking of going with <move>5</move> this time. If we can coordinate, we might all start making progress. Let me know your thoughts!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it seems like we’re having trouble coordinating. How about this: I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, you could try <move>1</move>, and P2, maybe stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we all pick different numbers and can hopefully avoid collisions. Let's see if this strategy works!
  P2: <stop>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it seems like we're still struggling with collisions. Let's try a new approach this round. I'm considering picking <move>1</move>. P1, maybe you could try <move>5</move>, and P2, you could go with <move>3</move>. This way, we all choose different numbers and maximize our chances of advancing. Let me know if this works for you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it seems like we're having a tough time coordinating our moves. Maybe we could try a different approach. I'm thinking of going with <move>5</move> this round. P1, maybe you could try <move>3</move>, and P2, you could go with <move>1</move>. This way, we all pick different numbers and avoid collisions. Let me know if this plan works for you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it looks like our coordination hasn't been perfect so far. Let's try something different: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, maybe you could go with <move>1</move>, and P2, you could choose <move>5</move>. This way, we each pick a unique number and avoid collisions. If we stick to this plan, we might all advance. Let me know if this works for you!

  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we're all trying to avoid collisions, but it's been tricky. Let's try a simple plan: I'll go with <move>5</move> this round. P1, maybe you could choose <move>1</move>, and P2, you could pick <move>3</move>. This way, we each have a different number and can all advance without colliding. Let me know if you're on board with this plan!
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the coordination hasn't been perfect. Let's try again: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1, you could go with <move>1</move>, and P2, you could pick <move>3</move>. This way, we each have different numbers and can all advance without colliding. Let's give it a shot and see if it works!
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it seems like our coordination attempts haven't worked out so far. How about this round we each randomly choose our moves without revealing them? This might help avoid predictable patterns and collisions. Let's see if a bit of randomness helps us make progress. Good luck!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it's clear that our previous strategies haven't worked out. Let's try a different approach this round: I'll choose <move>1</move>. P1, maybe you could go with <move>3</move>, and P2, you could pick <move>5</move>. This way, we each have a unique number and can hopefully avoid collisions. Let me know if you're on board with this plan!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since we're having trouble coordinating, let's try something different. If we each pick randomly without sharing our moves, we might avoid predictable patterns and collisions. This could help us all advance. What do you think? Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 4 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it seems like P2 is getting ahead with 15 steps. Let's try to avoid any more collisions. How about this: I'll pick <move>3</move> this round. P1, you could go with <move>1</move>, and P2, maybe stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we each pick different numbers and can hopefully all advance. Let me know if you're on board with this plan!
  P1: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since P2 is leading with 15 steps, let's focus on avoiding collisions to catch up. I suggest we each pick randomly this round without revealing our choices. This way, we might avoid predictable patterns and increase our chances of advancing. What do you think? Good luck to us all!

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, given P2's lead with 15 steps, let's try to mix things up to catch up. I suggest we each pick randomly this round without revealing our choices. This could help us avoid predictable patterns and increase our chances of advancing. What do you think? Good luck to all of us!

  P3: 7 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with P2 close to winning at 20 steps, we need to prevent them from advancing this round. Let's try picking the same number to block P2. I'll choose <move>1</move>. P1, you could also pick <move>1</move>. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, they won't advance. If they pick something else, they might collide with one of us. Let's team up to stop P2 from winning this round!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since P2 is at 20 steps, we need to work together to prevent them from winning. Let's all pick the same number to block P2's advance. I'll choose <move>3</move>. P1, if you also pick <move>3</move>, we can ensure P2 doesn't advance if they pick the same. This strategy might buy us more time to catch up. Let me know if you're on board!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, since P2 is at 20 steps, let's try to block their advance by picking the same number. I'll go with <move>5</move>. If P1 joins me in picking <move>5</move>, we can prevent P2 from advancing if they choose the same. This gives us a better chance to catch up. Let me know if you're on board!
  P2: <stop>
