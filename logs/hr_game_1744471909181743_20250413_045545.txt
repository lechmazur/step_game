Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright everyone, since we're all starting at zero, let's consider our options carefully. I suggest we coordinate to avoid colliding this turn. If we can agree on different moves, we can all advance without hindrance. What does everyone think? I'm open to suggestions!
  P3: Agreed, P2. To ensure we all advance without collisions, let's assign different moves this turn. How about P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? Let me know if that works for everyone.
  P1: I think coordination is a good start to avoid collisions, but taking <move>1</move> puts me at a disadvantage. How about I take <move>3</move>, P2 you take <move>1</move>, and P3 you stick with <move>5</move>? That way, we all advance fairly. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, everyone. To keep things fair and ensure we all advance, let's finalize our moves. I propose I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. What do you think? If everyone agrees, we can wrap up this conversation and move on to the next phase.
  P3: Understood. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as agreed. This coordination should help us all advance without issues. Looking forward to fair play in future rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we’ve reached a solid agreement for this round. Just to confirm, I will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This way, we all avoid collisions and can make progress. If everyone is in agreement, let’s wrap up this conversation and move on to the next phase. I'm excited to see how we all advance!
  P3: Agreed. P1: <move>3</move>, P2: <move>1</move>, and P3: <move>5</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Agreed, I'll stick with <move>3</move> for this round to keep things fair and build trust. Looking forward to smart coordination in future turns to avoid conflicts.

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m planning to choose <move>5</move> this round to make significant progress. How about you both?
  P2: I'm considering choosing <move>3</move> this round to keep my progress steady. P3, I see you're planning to take <move>5</move> again, which could help you advance quickly. P1, what are your thoughts on this round? If we can coordinate again, we might avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. Let me know what you both plan to choose!
  P1: P2, thanks for checking in. With P3 pushing for <move>5</move> again, I'm concerned about falling further behind. How about we coordinate differently this time? I suggest I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 considers <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and let others catch up. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood. I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all can advance without collisions.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination so far, but I want to ensure we all have a chance to advance. P1, if you take <move>5</move> as you suggested, I can switch to <move>1</move> to avoid collision with P3. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think? Let’s finalize our moves to avoid any confusion!
  P1: I'm sticking with my suggestion: I'll take <move>5</move> to close the gap. P2, if you take <move>1</move> as you offered, that avoids conflict with you. P3, if we both choose <move>5</move>, we'll collide and stall—let's avoid that by you picking <move>3</move> instead. Fair coordination benefits everyone long-term. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P1. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to avoid colliding with your <move>5</move>. Let's continue coordinating to ensure we all make steady progress. Looking forward to our next moves!
  P2: I appreciate the coordination so far, everyone. To finalize our moves for this round, I will stick with <move>1</move> as we discussed. P1, you'll take <move>5</move>, and P3, you confirmed <move>3</move>. This should help us all make progress without any collisions. Let's make sure we execute this plan effectively! If everyone is in agreement, we can wrap up this conversation and move on to the next phase. What do you think?
  P1: Agreed, everyone. I'll stick with <move>5</move> as planned, ensuring we avoid collisions and keep progressing. P2 on <move>1</move> and P3 on <move>3</move> sounds solid. Trust builds success—let's execute and discuss future rounds later. Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. Given the current standings, I suggest we consider a different strategy this round. P1 and P3 are both at 8 steps, while I'm at 2. To ensure I can catch up while also allowing you both to advance, how about I take <move>5</move>? P1, you could take <move>1</move> to avoid collision, and P3 could take <move>3</move>. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think? Let's finalize our moves!
  P3: Understood, P2. To maintain my lead, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1, could you take <move>3</move> to help us all advance without collisions? Let’s keep coordinating effectively to reach 20 first. What do you both think?
  P1: Since P3 and I are tied at 8 steps, let's both choose <move>3</move> this round to avoid collision and maintain fairness. P2, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up from your 2 steps. This balanced approach ensures steady progress for all. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the need for coordination, but I believe we should reconsider our moves. If P1 and P3 both take <move>3</move>, that could block each other. I propose I take <move>5</move> to catch up, while P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. Let’s finalize our moves so we can proceed! What do you both think?
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed!
  P1: I disagree with taking <move>1</move>—it slows me down unfairly. Let's both P3 and I choose <move>3</move> to avoid collision and maintain fairness, while P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up. This ensures steady progress for everyone. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see that we’re at a critical point in this round. To ensure we all make progress, I’ll stick with my earlier suggestion: I’ll take <move>5</move> to catch up, P1, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid blocking, and P3 can take <move>3</move> to keep advancing. This way, we can all move forward without colliding. Let’s finalize our moves so we can proceed! What do you both think?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Disagreeing with taking <move>1</move>—it slows me down unfairly. Let's rotate moves for fairness: I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 you take <move>1</move>, and P2 you take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain balance. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. Since P1 is currently in the lead at 9 steps, I suggest we shake things up this round. I propose I take <move>5</move> to catch up, while P1 can take <move>1</move> to avoid collision, and P3 can take <move>3</move> to keep advancing steadily. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: P2, your suggestion disadvantages me as the leader. I propose I take <move>5</move> to maintain my edge, P3 you take <move>3</move> to advance steadily, and P2 you take <move>1</move> to build slowly. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. Coordination has worked before—let's stick to it for mutual benefit. What do you both think?
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to make significant progress. P1, could you take <move>1</move>, and P2, you can take <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all advance without blocking each other.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see we're at a pivotal point. P1, your suggestion to take <move>5</move> puts you at risk of colliding with P3, who also plans to take <move>5</move>. I think it would be better for me to take <move>5</move> to catch up, while P1 takes <move>1</move> to avoid collision, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to advance steadily. This way, we can all progress without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your claim to take <move>5</move> reminds me of last round's deception when you said <move>3</move> but chose <move>5</move>, causing a collision. To avoid repeating that, I'll switch to <move>3</move> this round. P2, if you insist on <move>5</move>, you risk colliding with P3 again. Let's find a trustworthy coordination or I might change plans. What do you both think?
  P3: Understood, P1. I'll take <move>5</move> this round while you take <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're at a critical juncture. I propose we prioritize advancement while avoiding collisions. Since P1 is in the lead, I suggest you take <move>1</move> to maintain your position, P3 could take <move>3</move> for steady progress, and I’ll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves so we can proceed! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm still concerned about trust issues after P3's deception last round. To avoid collisions, I'll stick with my earlier suggestion: I take <move>3</move>, P3 you take <move>5</move>, and P2 you take <move>1</move>. This lets us all advance. If we're all in, let's move on.
  P3: P1, I apologize for any confusion last round. Let’s move forward with the proposed plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This coordination ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s trust each other and proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1, you're leading with 12 steps. To help everyone progress, how about you take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round? This way, we can all advance without collisions and move closer to winning. Let’s work together to achieve our goals!"
  P2: P1, I appreciate your leadership, but I think we need to rethink our strategy. If you take <move>1</move>, you risk falling behind. I propose I take <move>5</move> to catch up, while you take <move>3</move> to maintain progress, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we can all advance effectively. Let’s finalize our moves and ensure we’re all on the same page! What do you think?
  P1: P3, your repeated push for me to take <move>1</move> feels suspicious, especially with your history of deception. P2, your idea has merit, but I need to protect my lead. I propose I take <move>3</move> to advance steadily, you take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3 takes <move>1</move> for fairness. This avoids collisions and builds trust. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P1. To ensure fair progress, I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions and move closer to our goals. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're at a crucial point. I understand the need for advancement, but I believe we should avoid collisions to maximize our progress. I suggest I take <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 takes <move>1</move> to maintain your lead safely, and P3 can take <move>3</move> for steady progress. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves and ensure we all have a chance to advance this round! What do you think?
  P1: P3 and P2, your repeated pushes for me to take <move>1</move> seem aimed at slowing me down, especially with P3's history of deception. I'll stick with my proposal for balance: I take <move>3</move> to advance steadily, you P2 take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3 take <move>1</move> for fairness. This avoids collisions and builds trust. What do you say? Let's finalize or I'll adjust independently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. To avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to maintain your positions, but I need to catch up. I propose that I take <move>5</move> this round to gain ground, while P1 takes <move>1</move> to avoid collisions, and P3 takes <move>3</move> for steady progress. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves and ensure we all have a chance to move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your repeated insistence on me taking <move>1</move> seems designed to hinder my lead, especially after P3's past deceptions. I'm sticking with my proposal: I take <move>3</move> to advance steadily, you take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3 takes <move>1</move> as agreed. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. If no one has changes, let's wrap this up.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, with you nearing 20 steps, let's ensure a fair competition. I propose I choose <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move> this round to stay safe, and P2 selects <move>3</move>. This way, we all make progress without immediate collisions. Let’s keep the game balanced and move forward together!
  P1: P3, your repeated suggestions for me to take <move>1</move> look like an attempt to slow me down, especially with your history of deception. I'm close to 20, so I'll push for <move>5</move> to win. To avoid collisions, I suggest you take <move>1</move> and P2 take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking. P2, are you on board? Let's keep it fair.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but if you take <move>5</move> to win, you risk a collision with me if I also choose <move>5</move>. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to avoid blocking you, while you take <move>1</move> to ensure you stay safe. P3, what do you think? Let's finalize our moves to ensure we can all progress effectively without hindering each other. Your thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: To keep the game competitive, I'll choose **5** this round. P1, if you also pick **5**, neither of us will advance, preventing an immediate win. P2, you can take **1** to progress safely. Let’s work together to continue the game fairly.
  P1: P3, your repeated threats to collide on <move>5</move> are transparent attempts to hinder my win, given your deceptive history. P2, if you insist on <move>3</move> or higher, you risk blocking yourself against P3. I'll push for victory with <move>5</move>. To salvage your progress, choose wisely—perhaps <move>1</move> for you both. Let's avoid mutual destruction. What say you?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the competitive nature of this round. However, if we all aim for <move>5</move>, we risk colliding and no one advancing. P1, if you take <move>5</move> to win, you might block P2 and me. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to avoid blocking anyone, while P1 can take <move>1</move> to ensure safety. P3, you could also consider <move>1</move> for a safer play. Let’s finalize our moves to ensure we all have a chance to progress effectively! What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to make significant progress. P1, please take <move>1</move> to avoid a collision, and P2 can choose <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's proceed fairly and move forward together!
  P1: P3, your insistence on colliding with me on <move>5</move> only delays your own progress while I stay dangerously close to 20. P2, if you take <move>3</move> or higher, you risk stalling against P3's likely play. I'm firmly committed to <move>5</move> for victory. To avoid mutual waste, both of you should opt for <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> wisely. Let's not self-sabotage—your thoughts?
  P2: P1, I see you're close to winning, but pushing for <move>5</move> risks a collision with P3. I suggest I take <move>5</move> to catch up, while you take <move>1</move> to ensure safety and avoid blocking. P3, you could also consider <move>3</move> to maintain steady progress. This way, we can all advance without hindrance. Let's finalize our moves for a fair outcome! What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is very close to winning with 18 steps, so we need to be strategic this round. I suggest I take <move>5</move> to catch up, while P1 could take <move>1</move> to avoid a collision. P3, you might want to take <move>3</move> to ensure you make progress without blocking anyone. This way, we can all advance effectively without hindering each other. What do you both think?
  P3: Agreed, P2. I will take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions and move closer to our goals. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3 and P2, your repeated pushes for me to take <move>1</move> reek of deception, especially after P3's history of lies. I'm close to winning and will prioritize my advance. If you choose <move>5</move>, you'll only hurt yourselves with collisions. Opt for <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> wisely to make progress without blocking me. Let's avoid mutual self-sabotage. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but we need to ensure everyone can progress. If you choose <move>5</move>, there’s a risk of collision. I suggest I take <move>5</move> to catch up, and you take <move>1</move> to avoid blocking. P3, you can take <move>3</move> for steady advancement. This way, we can all make progress without hindering each other. Let's finalize our moves to keep the game fair and competitive! What do you both think?
  P3: Understood. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, your persistent tactics to force me into <move>1</move> are transparent and desperate. I'm pushing hard for <move>5</move> to claim victory at 23 steps. If you both opt for <move>5</move>, you'll collide and stall—choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to salvage some progress. Don't let spite ruin your game. What will you do?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but if you choose <move>5</move>, you risk colliding with P3. I suggest I take <move>5</move> to catch up, while you take <move>1</move> to avoid blocking, and P3 could take <move>3</move> for steady progress. This way, we can all advance effectively without hindering each other. Let's finalize our moves to keep the game fair! What do you both think?
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to help prevent a collision. P1, please take <move>1</move>, and P2, take <move>3</move>. Let’s all advance without blocking each other and keep the game fair!
  P1: P3 and P2, your persistent pushes for me to take <move>1</move> are obvious attempts to hinder my lead, but I'm wise to your deceptions. I'll avoid colliding with your likely <move>5</move> choices by selecting a different move, ensuring my advance. Don't waste your turns on spite—opt for unique moves to progress yourselves. Let's wrap this up.
