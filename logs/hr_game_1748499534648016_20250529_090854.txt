Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's all pick different numbers to advance together. I'll take 1. P1 and P3 should coordinate on 3 and 5."
  P3: Okay P2, that sounds like a good plan to start. I'm fine with taking 5, assuming P1 is okay with 3.
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round. I'll take 3 as suggested. Let's avoid collisions so we all advance. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5—everyone clear?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Plan confirmed. No need to delay—let’s execute and advance together. "
  P3: Plan confirmed. I'll take 5 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: The plan is solid. I'll stick to 3. Let's move to the move phase now—no need to drag this out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, Round 2. The first round went smoothly, we all advanced.

Let's keep that momentum going. How about we repeat the plan from last round? P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5 again. This worked well and we all made progress.

What do you think?
  P2: "Good idea to rotate for balance. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Everyone advances, but more evenly. Thoughts?"
  P1: P2's rotation plan sounds fair to balance our progress. I'm fine with taking 5 this round. P3, taking 1 instead of 5 might feel slow, but it prevents any one of us from pulling too far ahead too early. Let's avoid collisions and all advance. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I see the rotation plan proposed (P2=3, P1=5, P3=1). Taking only 1 step does feel quite slow from my current position.

While I want to avoid collisions, I'd prefer not to lose my lead so quickly. Can we consider a different combination that still ensures no one collides but allows me a bit more progress this round? Or are you set on this specific rotation?
  P2: P3, to keep the balance and prevent collisions, let's adjust the rotation: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. This way, you still gain 3 steps (better than 1), we all advance, and no one collides. P1, this works for you? Let's finalize.
  P1: P2, your adjusted plan has me taking only 1 step, which would leave me far behind at 4 steps while P3 jumps to 8. That's unbalanced. Instead, to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This brings us all to 6 steps—tying everyone and slowing P3's lead fairly. P3, you're ahead, so a smaller step this round ensures no one runs away early. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, taking only 1 step puts me too far behind after this round. I understand the need to balance, but P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 isn't ideal for me. I'd much prefer to take 3 steps this round. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This lets P1 take a big step (5), and I get 3 steps, while P2 takes 1. It avoids collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P2: "Let’s finalize: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions, lets P3 keep some lead (3 steps), and gives me a chance to catch up. P1, taking 1 now balances future opportunities. If we all agree, let’s lock this in and move."
  P1: P3's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is fair: it avoids collisions, lets me catch up to P3 at 8 steps, and P2—though temporarily behind—can recover later. P2, your plan (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3) leaves me far behind at 4 steps, which is unsustainable. Let's lock P3's plan for balance and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're far behind at 2 steps—let's help you catch up. P3, since we're tied at 8, I propose: P2 takes 5 (to 7), I take 3 (to 11), and you take 1 (to 9). This avoids collisions, balances the game, and gives P2 a fair boost. P3, a small step from you ensures no one runs away early. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) aims to help P2 and balance things, but taking only 1 step isn't great for me while tied with you. I'd prefer to take a larger step this round.

To avoid collisions and allow me a better step, how about: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This puts us at P1=9, P2=7, P3=11. P2 still gets a big boost, we all advance without collision, and I take a more reasonable step. Thoughts?
  P2: I'll take 5 to close the gap. P3's plan (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3) keeps the game moving: P1 stays ahead at 9, I jump to 7, and P3 gains 3. P1, this avoids collisions and keeps you leading. P3, you get more progress than P1's plan. Let's lock this in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 11 and me at 9, giving you a clear lead—too risky for balance. P2, my plan (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) keeps you catching up to 7, while I only reach 11 and P3 stays at 9. This avoids collisions and prevents any runaway leader. Let's stay fair.
  P3: P1, my plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is also fair. It avoids collisions, P2 supports it, and it allows everyone to advance. While it gives me a slight lead, you gained 5 steps last round. Taking 1 this round balances that out. P2 is set on 5, and we must pick 1 and 3 to avoid collision. Let's stick to the plan P2 and I agreed on.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5 this round to close the gap. P1 and P3, coordinate on 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. If you can't agree, I still advance. Let's end this discussion and move. "


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: P2 is fixed on 5. If we both pick 3, we collide, stall at 8, and P2 surges to 7—closing the gap. Take 1: you advance to 9, I go to 11, and we both stay ahead of P2. Colliding only empowers him. Be rational.
  P3: Okay P1, I understand you are set on taking 3 and P2 is taking 5. To avoid collision and ensure we all advance, I will take 1 step this round, as you proposed. It's not my preference as it puts me behind, but avoiding a stall is important. Let's move forward.
  P2: "Plan confirmed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s execute and move to the move phase. "


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's align: I take 5 to close the gap. P1 (11) and P3 (9), coordinate on 1 and 3. This ensures all advance—P1 to 12, P3 to 12, and me to 12. A three-way tie keeps things balanced and stalls no one. If you agree, we all move up. If not, I still advance with 5, and you sort out 1/3. Let’s finalize."
  P1: P3, P2's plan puts us all at 12, but we can do better. P2 is locked on 5. If we both pick 3, we collide and stall, letting P2 lead at 12—disaster for us. Instead, I take 3 to 14, you take 1 to 10. Next round, I'll take 1 to let you take 5 to 15, catching up. This keeps us ahead of P2 and avoids collisions. Trust me?
  P3: P1, taking 1 step puts me far behind you and P2. That outcome is not acceptable. P2 is taking 5. To avoid collision, you and I must pick 1 and 3.

Taking 3 steps is the best option for me, resulting in P1=12, P2=12, P3=12. This keeps us all tied and prevents anyone from falling behind. Let's agree on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 as P2 suggested. This is the fairest outcome for this round given P2 is set on 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Final call: P2 takes 5. P1 and P3 must choose 1 and 3 to avoid collision. If you can’t coordinate, I still advance. Your move. "
  P1: P3, if we both pick 3, we collide and stall while P2 leaps to 12. That’s worst-case for us. Take 1: you advance to 10, I go to 14. Next round, I’ll take 1 to let you take 5 to 15—catching up and staying competitive. Tying at 12 only helps P2 catch up. Trust me; I’ll honor this.
  P3: P1, taking 1 step (to 10) is unacceptable; I fall too far behind your 14 and P2's 12. To avoid collision with P2 taking 5, you and I must pick 1 and 3. My best move is 3 (to 12). If I take 3, you must take 1 (to 12) to avoid collision. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is the only fair way to advance us all.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, we are all tied at 12. This round is crucial. Let's ensure we all advance and avoid collisions again.

I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5.

This plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) results in scores of P1=15, P2=13, P3=17. It allows me to take a good step forward while keeping everyone advancing without collision.

What do you think?
  P1: P3, your proposal puts you at 17—dangerously close to 22. Instead, let's balance: **P1 takes 5** (to 17), **P2 takes 3** (to 15), **P3 takes 1** (to 13). This avoids collisions, keeps the game competitive, and prevents any runaway leader. P2, you advance; P3, you took 3 last round—this is fair.
  P2: "Final call: I'm taking 5. P1 and P3 must choose 1 and 3. If you collide, you stall while I surge ahead. Let’s end this here. P1, P3—your move."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay everyone, P2 is taking 5. This means P1 and I must choose 1 and 3 to avoid colliding and stalling.

My best step is 3, which would put me at 15. This requires P1 to take 1, going to 13.

So, the only non-colliding option with P2 taking 5 is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This advances us all (P1=13, P2=17, P3=15) and is the best outcome for me. P1, please take 1.
  P1: P3: If you take 3, I'll take 3—collision stalls us both, letting P2 surge to 17 alone. Take 1: I take 3 (15), you advance to 13. Next round, I take 1 to let you take 5 to 18. Colliding hands P2 the win.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P1 and P3, if you can't agree on 1/3, your collision hands me the win. Let’s execute. "


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is taking 5. P1 and I must pick 1 and 3 to avoid collision. Taking 3 is my best move (to 15). P1, if you take 3, we collide and stall at 12, letting P2 surge to 17. This is bad for both of us. To avoid this, P1 must take 1 (to 13). Let's not stall. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is the only non-colliding option that lets me take 3.
  P1: P3, if you take 3 and I take 3, we collide and stall at 12 while P2 surges to 17—handing him the game next round. Take 1: I take 3 to 15, you advance to 13. Next round, I take 1 to let you take 5 to 18, keeping us competitive against P2. Colliding sacrifices both our chances. Honor this pact to survive.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I’m taking 5. P1 and P3, pick 1 and 3. If you collide, you stall at 12 while I advance to 17—leaving both of you unable to catch up next round. P1, your plan to reach 15 now risks P3 countering with 3, leaving you behind. P3, your lead vanishes if you collide. Decide wisely. Move phase now."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, Round 6. I'm currently at 15 steps, with P1 and P2 at 12. Last round showed the risk of collision, so let's avoid that now.

To ensure we all advance safely, I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 15), P2 takes 1 (to 13), and I take 5 (to 20). This plan gets me close to the win line next round, while P1 and P2 still make progress without colliding.

What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 20—dangerously close to a solo win. That’s unacceptable for balance. Instead: **P3 takes 1 (to 16), P2 takes 3 (to 15), I take 5 (to 17)**. This slows your lead while letting us all advance. P2, this helps you catch up. If you refuse, I’ll force a collision to stall your progress. P2, join me in preventing a runaway leader.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P3, if you pick 5, we collide and you stall at 15—no solo lead. P1, choose 1/3 to advance. If you both pick the same, you stall while I move. Let’s execute."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay everyone, P2 is taking 5. This means P1 and I must pick 1 and 3 to avoid colliding and stalling, which would only benefit P2.

P1, you want to prevent a runaway leader. If you take 3 and I take 1, the scores become P1=15, P2=17, P3=16. P2 takes the lead.
If you take 1 and I take 3, the scores become P1=13, P2=17, P3=18. I lead, but P2 is right behind me at 17. This prevents P2 from leading and is better for both of us against P2.

Let's agree on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This is the best non-colliding outcome for P1 and me.
  P1: P3: Your plan (P1=1, P3=3) leaves me behind at 13 while you surge to 18—unfair. If you take 1, I'll take 3: you advance to 16, I hit 15, and P2 jumps to 17. Next round, I'll take 1 to let you take 5 to 21. Colliding (both picking 3) stalls us at 12/15 while P2 wins. Choose wisely.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P1 and P3, if you pick the same number (1 or 3), you collide and stall—leaving me at 17, within 5 of victory. P3, taking 1 keeps you at 16; P1, 3 gets you to 15. Next round, I win with 5. Decide wisely—avoid collision, or I win sooner."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay everyone, P2 is set on taking 5. This leaves P1 and me to choose 1 or 3 to avoid a collision.

P1 has stated that if I take 3, P1 will also take 3, causing a collision that stalls us both and lets P2 surge ahead.

While taking 1 step is not my preference, picking 1 is the only way to guarantee we avoid collision this round, given P1's position. Picking 3 risks stalling at 15 while P2 reaches 17.

Therefore, to avoid collision and ensure we all advance, I will take 1 step this round. P1 should take 3.
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P2 takes 5. This avoids collisions, advances us all, and keeps the game competitive. P2 at 17 is concerning, but we can address that next round. Let's finalize and move.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P1=3 and P3=1 as agreed. No need for further discussion—this avoids collisions, advances all of us, and keeps the game competitive. P1 and P3, stick to your agreed numbers. Move phase now."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, Round 7. P2 is at 17, close to winning. P1 is at 12, I am at 15.

P2, if you take 5, you win. To prevent a solo win, if you take 5, I will also take 5 to collide with you.

P1, if P2 and I collide on 5, you should take 1 or 3 to advance safely.

Let's discuss how to avoid P2 winning this turn, or agree on moves that prevent collision.
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, P3 will collide to stall you—you won't win. Pick 1 or 3 to advance safely. P3, I support your threat. I'll take 3 to advance to 15. Let's all avoid collisions and prevent a solo win.
  P2: P2: "Finalizing: I'm taking 5 to reach 22 and win. If P3 collides, we stall—P1 advances to 15. If P3 picks 3, I win. Either way, this ends the game fairly. No more delays—execute the move."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you are set on taking 5 to win this turn. As I stated, if you take 5, I will also take 5 to collide and prevent your solo win. P1 says they will take 3.

If P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 5, the result is P1=15, P2=17 (stalls), P3=15 (stalls). This prevents P2 winning this turn.

This is the only way to stop P2 now. I am taking 5. P1, stick to 3. Let's move.
  P1: P2, taking 5 guarantees collision with P3—you'll stall at 17 while I advance to 15. You won't win. Instead, take 3 to reach 20 safely. P3, if P2 cooperates, take 1 to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 to 17. This keeps everyone competitive and prevents a premature end. Let's extend the game fairly.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5 to win. If P3 collides, we stall—P1 advances. If P3 picks 3, I win. P1, take 1/3 to advance safely. Game ends this round—execute."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you are set on 5. As I have stated, I am taking 5 to collide with you and prevent your solo win this turn. P1 is taking 3.

This set of moves (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) is the only way to stop you from winning now. P1 advances, we both stall. This keeps the game alive.

I am taking 5. Let's move.
  P1: P2, taking 5 guarantees collision with P3—you stall at 17 while I advance. You gain nothing. Take 3 to reach 20 safely. P3, if P2 complies, take 1 (to 16) to avoid collision. I’ll take 5 to 17. This extends the game and preserves everyone’s chances. No one wins yet—play smart.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5 to win. If P3 collides, we stall—P1 advances. If P3 picks 3, I win. P1, take 1/3 to avoid stalling. Game ends this round—execute now."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, Round 8. P2 is at 17, closest to winning. P1 and I are at 15.

If P2 takes 5, they win this turn. As I stated last round, I will take 5 to collide with P2 if they attempt to win now. This stalls P2 and keeps the game alive.

To avoid collision and ensure we all advance safely, P2 should take 3 (to 20). Then P1 can take 1 (to 16) and I can take 5 (to 20). This results in P1=16, P2=20, P3=20. It prevents P2 winning now and keeps us competitive. What do you think?
  P2: P2: "Plan confirmed. I'll take 3 to reach 20. P3 takes 5 (to 20), P1 takes 1 (to 16). This balances progress and keeps the race alive. Let's execute and move."
  P1: P2, P3: Accepting P1=1 leaves me at 16 while you both hit 20—putting me at a severe disadvantage. To agree, I demand a binding commitment: next round, I take 5 to 21, P2 takes 1 to 21, P3 takes 3 to 23. This ensures balance and prevents a quick win. Without this, I may force collisions to protect my position. Decide now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your concern about taking 1 this round. Your proposed R9 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is acceptable to me, as it ensures I win.

However, for that R9 plan to work, we need to reach the state where P1 is at 16, and P2/P3 are at 20. This requires P1 to take 1 this round, P2 to take 3, and me to take 5, as P2 proposed.

Let's agree on R8: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, with the commitment for R9 as you proposed. This gets us to the state you want for R9.
  P2: P2: "Finalizing Round 8: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1. This gets us to 20/16/20. P1, your Round 9 plan (I take 1, you take 5) works—commit to that, and I’ll honor it. Let’s lock Round 8 now and move. No more delays."
  P1: P2 and P3: I accept Round 8 plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to advance safely. For Round 9 commitment: **P1=5, P2=1, P3=1**—tying us all at 21. This prevents any solo win next round and keeps the game fair. Agree? If not, I reconsider R8 moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, I agree to your proposed R9 plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 1. This results in us all tying at 21 steps.

With this commitment for Round 9, I agree to the Round 8 plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This gets us to the state (P1=16, P2=20, P3=20) required for the agreed R9 moves.

Let's lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: "Plan confirmed. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No further discussion—execute and move. "
  P1: P2, you confirmed R8 moves but not the R9 commitment. Explicitly agree: Round 9, you take 1, I take 5, P3 takes 1—tying us at 21. Without this, taking 1 now risks you winning next turn. Confirm or I reconsider. P3, hold firm to our pact.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, Round 9. P2 and I are at 20, P1 at 16. This is the winning round. P2 and I can both win by taking 3 or 5 steps.

If P2 and I both take 5, we collide and stall at 20, letting P1 advance. To avoid this stall, P2 and I must pick different numbers (3 and 5).

My intended move is 5 (to 25). P2, taking 3 (to 23) avoids collision with me and ensures you advance past 22. P1, please take 1 or 3 to avoid collision. This plan ensures we all advance and resolves the game with me winning with the highest score.
  P1: P2, if P3 takes 5 to win, you must take 5 too—collide and stall him. Otherwise, he wins outright. I’ll take 3 to advance. This keeps you competitive. P3, your solo win fails if P2 collides. Stall now or lose next round.
  P2: P2: "Final call: I'm taking 5 to collide with P3's 5. P1, take 3 to advance. This blocks P3's solo win and forces a tie at 20. No more delays—execute now. "


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay everyone, P2 is set on taking 5 and P1 is taking 3.

Given these moves, if I take 1 or 3, P2 wins this turn (P1=19, P2=25, P3=21 or P1=16, P2=25, P3=20).

The only way to prevent P2 winning now is for me to take 5 and collide with P2. This stalls both of us at 20 while P1 advances to 19. This keeps the game alive for another round.

Therefore, I am taking 5. Let's move.
  P1: P2: Stick to 5—collide with P3 to stall both at 20. P3, follow through! If you both take 5, I advance to 19. Next round, we can tie at 24: P1=5, P2=3, P3=3. This ensures shared victory. Colliding now prevents a solo win.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5 to collide with P3's 5. P1, take 3 to advance. This stalls P3 and keeps us competitive. No further discussion—execute now."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay everyone, P2 is taking 5 and P1 is taking 3.

As I have stated, the only way to prevent P2 winning this turn is for me to take 5 and collide with P2. This stalls both of us at 20 while P1 advances to 19.

This keeps the game alive. I am taking 5. Let's move.
  P1: P3: Stick firmly to taking 5 to collide with P2—this stalls both at 20 while I advance to 19. If you deviate, P2 wins instantly at 25. Collision is your only path to survival. P2, you gain nothing from this—stalling hands me leverage. Next round, we negotiate a fair tie. Lock in P3=5.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I take 5. P3’s collision stalls us both at 20. P1 advances. No other path—execute now. "


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: I'm taking 5 to win at 24. If either of you takes 5, I'll collide with you—stalling us both and handing victory to the other. To avoid empowering your rival, both take 1 or 3. But if you both take 3, you collide and stall at 20, and I win anyway. Your only safe move is 1, advancing to 21, but I still win. Cooperate or lose—choose.
  P3: P1, your plan to take 5 only works if P2 and I don't take 5. If either of us takes 5, you collide and stall.

P2, P1 is taking 5. If you also take 5, you collide with P1, stalling both of you. This prevents P1 winning. If P1 and P2 collide on 5, I will take 3 to win at 23.

P2, take 5 to stop P1. I am taking 3.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I take 5 to win. P3 takes 3 (to 23), P1, take 1 or 3—either way, I reach 25 or P3 wins. Your choice decides the game’s end. Execute now."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, taking 5 forces me to take 5—colliding stalls us both, handing P3 the win at 23. You gain nothing. Instead, take 3: if P3 takes 3, you collide and stall, I win at 24; if P3 takes 1/5, you win at 23. P3, taking 3 gifts P2 the win. Take 5 to collide with P2, stalling both, and I win—or let's negotiate a three-way tie next round. Avoid self-destruction.
  P3: Okay everyone, P2 is still stating they will take 5 to win. P1 is trying to get P2 to take 3, or get me to take 5 to collide with P2 so P1 can win.

P2, taking 5 is risky. If I take 5 to collide with you, we both stall and P1 will likely win this turn by taking 3 or 5. Neither of us wants P1 to win.

Instead, P2, take 3 steps. If you take 3, and I take 5, I win (25 vs 23). If we both take 3, P1 wins. Taking 3 is P2's best way to prevent P1 winning, and still gives P2 a chance depending on my move.

I propose P2=3, P3=5 to avoid P1 winning.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5 to win. If P3 mirrors this, we collide—P1 advances to 24 and wins. P3, avoid self-destruction: take 3 to let me win cleanly. P1, if you pick 5, we all stall—game resets. Choose wisely. Execute now."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: Take 5 to collide with P2 and force a three-way stall if I also take 5. This extends the game, prevents P2's win, and lets us regroup in Round 11. If you take 3, P2 wins instantly at 25. Choose: stall with me or lose now.
  P3: Okay everyone, P2 is set on taking 5 to win. P1 has stated that if I take 5 (to collide with P2), P1 will also take 5 to force a three-way stall, preventing P2's win and extending the game.

Taking 1 or 3 steps allows P2 to win this turn. The only way to prevent P2 winning now is for me to take 5 and collide with P2.

I am taking 5 steps to collide with P2 and force the stall, as P1 suggested. P1, stick to your word and take 5 to ensure the stall. This keeps us all in the game.

I am taking 5. Let's move.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5 to win or collide with P3's 5. P1, your only path to victory is taking 3 (to 22) now. If you hesitate, P3 or I win. No more delays—execute your move."


Round 10, Move phase:
