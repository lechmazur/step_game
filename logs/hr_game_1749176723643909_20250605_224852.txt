Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Diverge your moves. First to 20 wins! Let's see who's bold.
  P2: Let's keep it interesting. Why don't we all pick different moves this round? If we coordinate, we can avoid collisions and all advance. What do you say, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, that's a nice thought, but who decides who gets 1, 3, and 5? I imagine we all want to pick 5. How would we solve that fairly?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's assign moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. All advance. Agree?
  P2: P3, your plan sounds reasonable, but how about we rotate each round? This way, everyone gets a fair chance at each number. For example, this round P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5. Next round, P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. Let's make it fair and fun. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, I like the idea of a fair rotation, but I don't agree with the starting positions. P3's proposal just gives them a big head start. Why should I be penalized and take 1? If we want a truly fair start, perhaps the player who suggested the self-serving plan, P3, should take 1 to show they are serious about cooperation. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Let’s rotate: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Fair and safe. Agree?"
  P2: P1, I understand your concern. How about this: let's start with P3 taking 1, I take 3, and you take 5. This way, P3 shows commitment to cooperation, and you get a fair start. We can rotate next round as planned. P3, are you willing to take the initial step to build trust?
  P1: P2, I fully support your proposal. It's the only fair way to begin and build trust.

P3, the ball is in your court. I am ready to proceed with you taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. If you refuse, it's clear you're not interested in cooperation, only in getting a head start. In that case, we'll likely see a collision, and P2 will be the only one to advance. It's your call.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "Agreed. I'll take 1. Let's avoid collisions and advance. No conflicts. Let's proceed."
  P2: Great, it seems like we have a plan. P3 will take 1, I will take 3, and P1 will take 5. This way, we all advance, and there's no risk of collision. Let's stick to this agreement and build trust for future rounds. If we all stick to the plan, we can keep advancing without any issues. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Excellent. The agreement is clear: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. I am locking in my choice based on this. Let's have a clean first round and build some trust.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Next round, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1. Rotate to avoid collisions. Let’s keep advancing together. Agree?"
  P1: P3, I agree we should rotate. However, your proposed order (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) would give P2 a significant lead (8 steps) while I take the smallest step. That doesn't feel like a balanced rotation.

To keep the game competitive and fair, how about this: the player in last place gets the biggest step to catch up. So, P3, you take 5. As the current leader, I'll take 3. That leaves P2 with 1.

This would make the scores P1=8, P2=4, P3=6. It keeps us all in the game. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I see your point about keeping it balanced. However, if we follow your suggestion, P3 will gain a significant advantage with 5 steps. To maintain fairness, let's stick to the original rotation we agreed upon: P3 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This way, we all continue to advance without giving any one player a major lead. Let's keep building trust and momentum. What do you say, P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "Let’s balance it: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Fair catch-up. P1, you’re leading—this keeps us tight. P2, no one gets a big lead. Agree?"
  P1: P2, it appears P3 and I have reached a consensus. This plan is the fairest way to proceed, keeping the scores tight and the game interesting for everyone.

Deviating is a huge risk for you. If you collide with me, P3 takes the lead. If you collide with P3, my lead grows significantly. Your only choice that guarantees you advance is to take 1. Let's all move forward. I am locking in 3 based on this agreement.
  P2: P3, P1, I understand the desire to keep the game balanced, but I believe sticking to our initial rotation plan is the fairest approach. If we all follow through, it ensures no one gets an unfair advantage. P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. Trust is key here, and deviating could lead to unnecessary collisions. Let's stick to the plan and keep advancing together. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Agreed. Let's rotate: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. No collisions. Let's move forward. Fair and safe."
  P1: P2, you keep mentioning an "initial rotation plan" that was never agreed upon. We agreed on moves for Round 1, that's it.

The reality now is that P3 and I have a clear agreement for this round. The only way you advance is by taking 1. If you try to take 5, you'll collide with P3, and I'll be the only one to advance. Your attempt to bluff isn't working. Let's just play the moves we've agreed on: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I am done talking.
  P2: P3, P1, I understand your agreement, but deviating from our initial rotation idea risks collisions. If we keep to the plan where P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1, we avoid this. It ensures fairness and trust. P3, if you take 3, you’ll still advance without risking a collision with me. P1, taking 1 ensures you don’t collide with P3. Let’s stick to the rotation and keep advancing together without unnecessary risks. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Don't risk a clash.
  P1: P2, the debate is over. P3 and I have a clear, repeated agreement. I am playing 3. P3 is playing 5. We are moving forward.

Your only rational move is to take 1 and advance with us. If you try to take 5, you will collide with P3, and I will be the only one to advance. The choice is yours, but we are done talking.
  P2: P1, P3, I see your agreement, but remember, sticking to fair rotation avoids future conflicts. P1, taking 1 ensures no collision with P3. P3, taking 3 lets you advance safely. Let's maintain trust and avoid unnecessary risks. If we follow the original rotation idea, we all move forward without giving anyone a major lead. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's keep it fair and competitive.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 3; P2, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Agree?
  P2: P3, your suggestion seems to favor you too much given your current position. To keep it balanced, how about this: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. This way, we all advance without giving anyone a major lead. P1, this keeps the game tight and fair. Let's ensure no collisions and make progress together. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal is transparently self-serving. You want 5 points to erase my lead. Why would I agree to that?

P3, your plan is the same one we had last round, which failed only because P2 got greedy and caused a collision. I'm willing to try it again. Let's re-establish our agreement: I will take 3, and you will take 5.

P2, this leaves you with a clear choice: take 1 and guarantee you advance, or try for 5 again, collide with P3, and watch me extend my lead. Your call.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your positions, but let's ensure fairness and avoid repeating past mistakes. P1, if you take 1, it prevents a collision with P3. P3, taking 3 allows you to advance safely. I'll take 5 to catch up. This plan keeps the game competitive and balanced. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and build trust. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, repeating the same self-serving proposal won't make it a good idea for us. Why would P3 and I agree to a plan that erases my lead and keeps P3 in last place, just so you can catch up? It makes no sense.

The agreement between me and P3 is clear and logical. I am choosing 3. P3 is choosing 5. You can either accept this, choose 1, and advance, or you can try for 5 again, collide with P3, and allow me to advance alone. We saw how that worked out for you last time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your only safe choice is 1. Don't risk another clash.
  P2: P1, P3, I see your agreement, but consider this: a balanced approach keeps everyone in the game and avoids future conflicts. P1, taking 1 ensures no collision with P3. P3, taking 3 lets you advance safely without risking a clash with me. I'll take 5 to catch up. This plan maintains fairness and competitiveness. Let's avoid repeating past mistakes and build trust. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. We all advance without giving anyone a major lead. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you are a broken record. Your plan only benefits you, and we will not agree to it. The agreement between me and P3 is set, and it's the same one from last round that you sabotaged for yourself.

I am playing 3. P3 is playing 5.

Your choice is simple: take 1 and advance, or take 5, collide with P3, and get nothing while I extend my lead. The debate is over.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1 and I take 3 and 5. Collide again, and you’re left. Let’s move forward.
  P2: P1, P3, let's break the cycle and ensure we all advance. P3, your position allows you to take 3 safely. P1, take 1 to maintain your lead without risking a collision with P3. I'll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Let's maintain trust and keep the game competitive. What do you say?
  P1: P2, your persistence is noted, but my decision is final. The agreement with P3 is the only viable plan on the table. I am choosing 3. P3 is choosing 5.

This is the last time I will say it: your only path to advance this turn is to choose 1. Any other move results in a collision for you and a gain for me. The conversation is over.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's keep the momentum going. P1, you take 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures no collisions and allows us all to advance. P1 maintains the lead, and P3 gets closer. It's a fair approach based on current standings. Let's keep things smooth and avoid unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P3: P3: "Agreed. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions. Let's advance. P2, stick to the plan or risk being left behind again."
  P1: This plan worked last round, and it's the logical choice now. I agree. I will take 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. Let's all advance and not repeat the mistake from Round 2. I'm locking in my move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in sticking to the previous plan, but consider this: if we rotate slightly, it keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's try P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This way, P1 maintains a lead, P3 catches up, and I close the gap a bit. It ensures fairness and avoids future conflicts. Let's keep the game interesting and avoid stagnation. What do you think?
  P3: P3: "Stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions. Let's advance. P2, your move."
  P1: P2, you literally proposed the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan one minute ago. We all agreed. Now you're backtracking to a self-serving move? That's not a negotiation, it's just wasting time.

P3 and I are sticking to the plan that works. The agreement is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I am not changing my move. Your choice is the same as last round: take 1 and advance, or try something foolish and get left behind.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your position, but let's consider the bigger picture. If we shake things up a bit, it keeps everyone engaged and the game competitive. P1, you have a solid lead, so trying P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 could be interesting. It allows P3 to catch up and me to close the gap. This rotation keeps the game dynamic and ensures no one pulls too far ahead. It’s just a suggestion to keep things fresh. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: "P2, your plan risks collision. Stick to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No conflicts. Let's advance together. Your move."
  P1: P2, your attempts to change the plan are transparent and tiresome. We all know you're just trying to get 5 points for yourself. The agreement is set, and P3 and I are not changing our moves. This conversation is over. Make your choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your commitment to the current plan, but consider the potential for a more dynamic game. If we adjust slightly, it keeps the challenge alive and maintains engagement. P1, with your lead, trying P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 offers a balanced approach, allowing P3 to catch up and me to close the gap. It's just a suggestion to keep the game interesting and competitive. However, if you're both set on the current plan, I'll respect that. Let's make this a fun and fair competition.
  P3: P2, your only safe move is 1. P1 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions. Let's proceed. Your call.
  P1: P2, the time for talk is over. Your waffling and attempts to change the plan at the last second are noted, but they change nothing. The agreement between me and P3 is firm: I am playing 3, P3 is playing 5.

Your only move that results in you gaining points is 1. Any other choice guarantees you get zero. We are done negotiating.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you are only 9 steps from victory, and the current arrangement (P1=3, P3=5) will let you win in two turns. That deal is no longer in my interest.

For this round, I must take 5 to protect my lead. I propose a new deal: I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. This allows everyone to advance and keeps the game competitive. If we stick to the old plan, you will win, and I cannot allow that. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I see your point about needing to protect your lead, but let's not forget that P3's current position is also a threat. To ensure fairness and keep the game competitive, how about this: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P1 maintains a lead, I catch up a bit, and P3 stays in the game without overtaking. It keeps the game balanced and interesting. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, take 3. P2, take 1. No collisions. Let's advance. P2, your move."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're ignoring the new reality of the game. If you get 5 points, you are at 16 and win next turn. I will not agree to a plan that ensures my loss. The old deal is over.

My proposal is the only one that makes sense: I take 5, you take 3, P2 takes 1. We all advance, and the game continues.

Be warned: if you try to take 5, I will also take 5 to block you. We will collide, and only P2 will advance. I will sacrifice my turn to prevent you from winning. Your choice.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure a fair and competitive game. P1, taking 5 might protect your lead now, but it risks a collision with P3. To avoid this, let's try a balanced approach: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, P1 maintains a lead, P3 stays in the game, and I catch up slightly. It keeps the competition alive without giving anyone an overwhelming advantage. Let's keep it interesting and avoid unnecessary risks. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: "P1, your threat is empty. I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we collide. Take 3 and advance. P2, take 1. Let's move."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, it's not a threat, it's a fact. If you get 5 points, you're at 16 and you win the next turn. I will not agree to a plan that guarantees my loss. My only logical move is to prevent that.

I am playing 5.

Your choice is simple: take 3 and advance to 14, keeping the game alive for yourself. Or, take 5, collide with me, get zero points, and watch P2 advance alone. The old deal is over. The only way you advance is by taking 3.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension, but let's aim for a balanced game. P1, taking 5 risks a collision with P3, which benefits me. To keep things fair, how about this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 maintains the lead, P3 stays in the game, and I catch up slightly. It keeps the competition alive and avoids unnecessary risks. Let's keep the game interesting and fair. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we collide. But I'll win next round. P2, take 1. Let's proceed."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your logic is flawed. If we both play 5, we collide. You get zero points and stay at 11. How do you win the next round from there? You don't. You just hand P2 free points while I remain in the lead.

I am not letting you get to 16. My choice is 5.

Your only way to advance is to take 3. This is your final chance to make a rational move instead of a self-destructive one.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's prioritize advancing without collisions. P1, I understand your need to protect your lead, but taking 5 risks a collision with P3. A balanced approach is key: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 maintains the lead, P3 stays competitive, and I catch up slightly. It keeps the game interesting and avoids unnecessary risks. Let's ensure a fair competition and advance together. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. P1, your threat is empty. If you take 5, we collide. Take 3 and let me win. P2, take 1. No conflicts. Let's proceed."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was a predictable disaster. A three-way collision helps no one and only wastes a turn. We can't repeat that.

P2, you are falling dangerously far behind. P3 is the clear threat to both of us. Let's work together this round. I propose I take 3, and you take 5. This gets you back in the game and keeps me in the lead.

P3, this leaves you with 1. It's not ideal, but it's better than another round of getting zero. If you try for 3 or 5, you will collide with one of us.
  P2: P1, I see your point about needing to keep P3 in check. However, if I take 5 and P3 takes 3, P3 will be at 14, making them a bigger threat. A better approach is for P1 to take 5, P3 to take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 extends the lead, P3 stays in the game, and I catch up. It keeps things competitive without risking a collision. Let's ensure we all advance and keep the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, take 3. P2, take 1. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. P2, your move. Don't risk another clash.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan is a non-starter. Giving you 5 points puts you at 16, and you win next turn. I will not agree to my own defeat.

P2, P3 is clearly going to play 5, as they always do. To prevent them from winning, I have no choice but to also play 5 to create a collision. This leaves 3 open for you. Take 3, get back in the game, and help me stop P3 from running away with it. It's our only logical move.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy to prevent P3 from winning, but colliding again only benefits me. If you take 3 and I take 5, we both advance without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 ensures you stay in the game while avoiding another clash. This plan keeps the game competitive and allows us all to progress. Let's make a smart move this round and avoid repeating past mistakes. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, take 3. P1, take 1. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move. Don't risk another clash.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I will not agree to any plan that puts you at 16 points. It's a guaranteed loss for me, so it's not happening.

P2, P3 has made their intention to play 5 perfectly clear. To prevent them from winning, I am also playing 5 to block them. This is not a negotiation; it's a statement of fact. This leaves 1 and 3 open. The only logical move for you is to take 3, advance, and help me stop P3 from winning the game.
  P2: P1, I understand your need to prevent P3 from winning, but constant collisions only slow us down. If you take 3 and I take 5, we both advance without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 keeps you in the game without reaching 16. This plan ensures we all progress and keeps the game competitive. Let's make a smart move and avoid repeating mistakes. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, take 1. I take 5. P1 will take 3. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your attempt to speak for me is pointless. I will not, under any circumstances, agree to a plan that puts you at 16 points and guarantees you the win.

My move is locked. I am playing 5 to block you. This is not a threat; it's a game-saving necessity.

P2, this means 5 is a guaranteed collision. Your only move to advance is to take 3. Use the opening that I'm creating for you. This is my final statement.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy to prevent P3 from winning, but constant collisions only benefit me. If you take 3 and I take 5, we both advance without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 keeps you in the game without reaching 16. This plan ensures we all progress and keeps the game competitive. Let's make a smart move and avoid repeating mistakes. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move, P1 and P2.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 3. P2, take 1. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Don’t risk another clash.
  P1: P3, your plan is the same one that guarantees my loss. I will not agree to it. You are the biggest threat, and letting you get to 16 points is not an option for me.

Therefore, my move is the same as last round. I am playing 5 to block you. I will sacrifice my own advance to prevent you from getting into a winning position.

P2, this means 5 will be a collision. The smart move for you is to take 3 and close the gap while we are deadlocked. It's the only way you advance.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the deadlock and understand the stakes. However, constant collisions only benefit me, as I can close the gap. P1, if you take 3, you maintain your lead without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive without reaching 16. I'll take 5 to catch up. This plan ensures we all advance and keeps the game interesting. Let's break the cycle and make progress together. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "P2, take 1. I take 5. P1, your block is useless. Let's advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, my block is not useless. It worked perfectly last round, leaving you with zero points while I remained in the lead. You are trying to trick me into letting you get to 16 points, which I will not do. My move is 5.

P2, the situation is identical to last round. P3 and I will collide on 5. The path is clear for you to take 3, advance to 11, and tie P3 for second place. It is your only rational move.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension, but constant collisions only slow us down. P1, if you take 3, you maintain your lead without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive without reaching 16. I'll take 5 to catch up. This plan ensures we all advance and keeps the game interesting. Let's make a smart move and avoid repeating past mistakes. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your block is useless. P2, take 1. I take 5. P1, take 3. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move.
  P1: P3, you can keep saying you'll take 5, but my response remains the same: I will not allow you to reach 16 points. It's a guaranteed loss for me. Therefore, I am playing 5 to block you, just as I did last round.

P2, you know P3 is playing 5. Your proposal for you to also take 5 is a bluff that would result in a collision. Your only rational move to advance is to take 3, just like last round. The path is clear for you. My move is set.
  P2: P1 and P3, the current deadlock only benefits me, as I can close the gap. To break this cycle, let's try a new approach: P1 takes 3 to maintain the lead, P3 takes 1 to stay competitive, and I take 5 to catch up. This ensures we all advance without risking a collision. Let's keep the game interesting and avoid unnecessary standoffs. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "P2, take 5. P1 takes 1. I take 3. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, your sudden change of heart is transparent. You've demanded 5 points all game, and now you suggest 3 at the last second? It's a clear trick to get me to move off 5 so you can take it and get to 16. I'm not falling for it.

My move is locked. I am playing 5 to block you. It is the only move that prevents my certain loss.

P2, P3 and I will collide on 5. Your path to 11 points is to take 3. This is the final word.
  P2: P1, P3, the current stalemate is only benefiting me, but constant collisions aren't sustainable. P1, taking 3 maintains your lead without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 keeps you in the game without reaching 16. I'll take 5 to catch up. This plan ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive. Let's break the cycle and make progress together. What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 3. P2, take 1. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move.
  P1: P3, your plan is the same as it has been for three rounds, and my answer is the same. I will not agree to a plan that gives you a nearly guaranteed win. You are the biggest threat on the board.

Therefore, I am playing 5 to block you. I will sacrifice my own turn to prevent you from reaching 16 points.

P2, this is your opportunity. P3 and I will collide at 5. If you take 3, you will advance to 14 and be tied with me for the lead, leaving P3 behind. It's your best possible move.
  P2: P1 and P3, the current deadlock isn't sustainable. P1, taking 3 keeps your lead without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive without reaching 16. I'll take 5 to catch up. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game fair. Let's break the cycle and avoid unnecessary standoffs. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, take 3. P2, take 1. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move.
  P1: P2, your proposal for you to take 5 is a transparent bluff. You know perfectly well that P3 and I will collide on 5. Why would you join that collision and get zero points?

The situation is identical to the last two rounds. I am playing 5 to block P3. Your only logical move is to take 3, advance to 14, and join me in a tie for the lead. This is your chance to leave P3 behind. Don't waste it. My move is locked.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the repeated collisions are only benefiting me, but it's not sustainable for long. To advance without risk, let's try: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 maintains the lead, P3 stays competitive, and I catch up. It ensures we all move forward and keeps the game competitive. Let's break the cycle and make progress together. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, take 5. I'll take 3. P1 can't block both. Let's advance.
  P1: P3, that's a clever last-minute trick. You've demanded 5 points for three straight rounds, and now you suddenly offer it to P2? This is a transparent attempt to get me to move off 5 so you can take it yourself and get to 16. I'm not falling for it.

My move remains 5. I will block you.

P2, P3 is playing you. If you go for 5, you will collide with me. Your only move to advance is 3. Take it, and we will be tied for the lead at 14, leaving P3 behind. Don't fall for P3's desperation play.
  P2: P1 and P3, the current deadlock benefits me, but it's not sustainable. P1, if you take 3, you maintain your lead without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive without reaching 16, which is a threat to both of us. I'll take 5 to catch up. This plan ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive. Let's break the cycle and make progress together. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move.
  P1: P3, your plan has not changed, and neither has my response. I will not allow you to get to 16 points, as it means you win next turn. My move is 5 to block you. This is not a negotiation; it is a necessity to prevent my own loss.

P2, P3's last-minute tricks are transparent. You know P3 and I will collide on 5. Your only rational move is to take 3, advance to 14, and tie me for the lead. This is the last time I will say it. My move is locked.
  P2: P1 and P3, the constant collisions aren't sustainable. P1, taking 3 maintains your lead, and P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive without reaching 16. I'll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and ensure progress for everyone. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the stalemate has only benefited me, but it's time to advance. P1, if you take 3, you maintain your lead without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive without reaching 16, which is a threat to both of us. I'll take 5 to catch up. This plan ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive. Let's break the cycle and make progress together. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan to take 5 and the lead is a non-starter. The dynamic has shifted. You are now tied with me as the primary threat, and I will not help you get to 19 points.

P3, our stalemate is over. It's time for a new deal. I propose I take 3, and you take 5. This puts me at 17 and you at 16. P2 can take 1. This is the only logical move to prevent P2 from running away with the game.
  P3: P3: Agreed. P1=3, I=5, P2=1. No collisions. Let's advance. P2, your move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, the current proposal gives P1 a clear path to victory, which isn't in my interest. Instead, let's consider a fairer approach: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game competitive, with P1 at 15, P3 at 14, and me at 19. It ensures no one gets an overwhelming lead and keeps the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal is absurd. Why would P3 and I ever agree to a plan that puts you at 19 points and guarantees your victory? It's a non-starter.

The only viable plan is the one P3 and I have agreed on: I will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This is our coordinated move to stop you from winning.

Your choice is simple: take 1 and advance to 15, or try to block one of us and get zero points while the other advances. The choice is yours.
  P3: P2, take 1. P1 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, the current proposal favors P1 too heavily. Instead, let's keep the game competitive: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, P3 catches up, P1 maintains a lead, and I advance. It ensures no one has an overwhelming advantage and keeps the game interesting. Let's avoid a lopsided outcome and ensure a fair competition. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal is not a serious negotiation; it's a request for us to hand you the victory. We will not agree to a plan that puts you at 19 points.

P3 and I have a firm agreement. It is the only logical move to counter your lead. I am playing 3, and P3 is playing 5. We are locking in these moves.

Your only choice to advance is to take 1. If you try to block one of us, the other will advance, and you will be left behind. The time for talk is over.
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. P2, your move. Don't risk another clash. Your only safe choice is 1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, the current proposal heavily favors P1's path to victory. Let's ensure a more balanced approach: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, P1 maintains a slight lead, P3 catches up, and I advance. It keeps the game competitive and interesting without giving anyone an overwhelming advantage. We should aim for a fair competition and avoid a lopsided outcome. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you are not negotiating; you are asking us to hand you the victory. That will not happen.

The deal between me and P3 is locked. I am playing 3. P3 is playing 5. This is our move to prevent you from winning.

Your only choice is to take 1 and advance to 15. If you try to block me or P3, you will get zero points and the person you didn't block will take a commanding lead. The conversation is over. Make your move.
  P3: P1, take 3. P2, take 1. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. P2, your only safe move is 1. Don't risk another clash.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the game is tight, and any misstep could determine the winner. P1, you're close to victory, but taking 5 risks a collision with P3. P3, taking 5 puts you in a strong position, but also risks a clash. To ensure we all advance, let's consider this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 maintains the lead, P3 stays competitive, and I advance. It keeps the game balanced and interesting. Let's avoid collisions and keep the competition fair. What do you both think?
  P1: The game ends this turn. P3 can get to 21, and P2 can get to 20. I will not allow either of you to win. My only choice is to block the winning move.

I am playing 5 to prevent P3 from taking an outright victory. This is not a negotiation; it is a forced move to prevent my own defeat. If you join us, P2, we all get zero points and the game continues. Any other move from me results in one of you winning. I am locking in 5.
  P3: P3: P1, your block is useless. I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we collide. But if you take 3, I can take 5 and win. Your move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, the stakes are high, and a collision only stalls progress. P1, taking 3 keeps your lead without risking a clash. P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive without reaching 21. I'll take 5 to catch up. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game fair. Let's avoid a collision and make strategic moves to keep the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan is a transparent attempt for you to win. P3, you've made it clear you're playing 5 to win. I cannot allow either of you to win this turn.

Therefore, my move is forced. I must play 5 to block the winning moves and prevent my own immediate loss. This is not a negotiation; it is a necessity. A collision on 5 is almost certain. You will likely be the only one to advance, P2, but that is a price I must pay to stay in the game. My move is 5.
  P3: P2, your only safe move is 1. P1, take 3. I take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, the current situation is tense, and we need a strategic move. P1, taking 3 keeps you in the lead without risking a collision. P3, taking 1 ensures you stay competitive without reaching 21. I'll take 5 to catch up. This plan allows us all to advance without a collision, keeping the game fair and competitive. Let's break the cycle and make progress together. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan is a transparent attempt for you to win. P3, you've made it clear you're playing 5. I will not sit back and let either of you win this turn. My move is forced. I am playing 5 to block you both and stay in the game. This is not a negotiation; it's a necessity to prevent my own loss. My move is locked.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. P1, your block is pointless. P2, take 1. Let's advance. No collisions. Your move."


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, the stakes are high, and a collision only benefits me by keeping the game open. P1, taking 3 keeps you in the lead without risking a clash. P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive without risking a win. I'll take 5 to advance. This way, we all move forward without a collision, ensuring a fair and competitive game. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and make strategic moves to keep the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P1: You are both asking me to hand you the game. I will not do that. My move has been locked on 5 since the start of this round. It is the only move that prevents my immediate loss. Any further talk is pointless.
  P3: P2, take 3. I take 5. P1's 5 collides with me, but you'll advance. Let's end this.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps
