Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, let's start fair and simple. How about we each pick a different number this round so everyone moves forward? I'll take 1 to begin with.
  P2: Agreed with P1's plan. To avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 should take 5. This way all advance. Let's coordinate to build trust early. Sticking to distinct numbers benefits everyone this round.
  P3: I like the idea of coordinating our moves to ensure we all advance. Following P1 and P2's suggestions, I will take 5 this round. This way, we can all make progress without any collisions. Let's build some trust and keep this strategy going! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we're all aligned! If we keep this cooperation going, it'll benefit everyone for now. Let's see how this round turns out and reassess after.
  P2: Confirming our moves: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's all stick to this to build trust. Consistency now sets a foundation for smoother collaboration in future rounds. Avoid surprises this turn—mutual success today benefits strategic flexibility tomorrow.
  P3: I appreciate the cooperation we've established so far. I believe sticking to our agreed numbers will help us all advance. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and decide on the best strategy moving forward. It's important we maintain this trust and collaboration for future turns. Let's see how this round plays out!

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great start everyone! To keep things fair and balanced, I suggest we rotate numbers this round. I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, everyone gets a fair chance to advance significantly without collisions. Sound good?
  P2: To ensure mutual advancement and maintain trust, I agree with P1's rotation plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Strict adherence avoids collisions, balancing progress. Let’s solidify this cooperative foundation for future rounds.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan, but I want to propose an adjustment. Instead of taking 3, I could take 1 this round. This way, P1 can take 5, and P2 can take 3. It would ensure we all advance while keeping our moves distinct. What do you both think? This could help us avoid any potential collisions and maintain our progress. Let's keep the cooperation strong!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion is interesting, but it might cause confusion since P2 already agreed to the original rotation. To avoid unnecessary collisions, let's stick clearly to one agreed plan. Can you reconsider and accept the original rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) for this round?
  P2: To prevent confusion and ensure clarity: Let's confirm the revised plan for Round 2. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. All moves remain distinct, avoiding collisions. This balances progress and maintains trust. Sticking to *this exact alignment* now is critical—no last-minute deviations. Mutual adherence ensures we all advance. Final agreement?
  P3: I appreciate the focus on clarity and cooperation. However, I believe we should stick to the original rotation plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, we avoid confusion and ensure all moves are distinct. If we all agree to this plan, we can make significant progress without collisions. Let's finalize this and keep building our trust! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, let's finalize clearly to avoid confusion: We'll stick with the original rotation—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Agreed? Confirm clearly so no one accidentally collides.
  P2: Agreed. Finalizing original rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No deviations. Let’s all confirm strict adherence to avoid collisions. Mutual trust now ensures continued cooperation. Proceeding to move phase.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to the original rotation plan, but I want to emphasize the importance of flexibility as the game progresses. While we can stick to our agreed moves this round, let's stay open to adjusting our strategies in future rounds based on our positions. This will help us all adapt and potentially find better opportunities to advance. For now, let's confirm our moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, let's finalize clearly as stated: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. And yes, P3, flexibility in future rounds makes sense. Let's reassess positions after this turn. Good luck everyone!
  P2: 
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the agreed moves for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's make sure we stick to this to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance. After this round, we can reassess our positions and discuss our strategies moving forward based on how we each progress. Good luck to everyone!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Continuing our rotation pattern: this round, P1 takes 3, P2=5, P3=1. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Consistency strengthens trust. Let's confirm to all advance.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion for this round, but I believe we should reconsider our moves. Instead of sticking to the rotation, I propose we all choose different numbers to maximize our advancement. If I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone moves forward. Let’s discuss this alternative strategy to keep our progress strong! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion matches exactly what P2 already proposed (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). There's no conflict here. I'm happy to take 3 as you both suggested. Let's quickly confirm this alignment clearly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed—P3's proposal aligns with my original suggestion: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's solidify this exact assignment to prevent overlaps. Strict adherence now keeps us all advancing (P1=9, P2=9, P3=9 post-move). Maintaining parity builds trust for future strategic pivots. Deviations risk mutual stagnation. Confirm final commitment to these numbers.
  P3: I appreciate the alignment so far, but I want to emphasize the importance of maximizing our advancement. If we all stick to the proposed moves (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), we can ensure everyone progresses without collisions. However, I still believe that varying our numbers could lead to better outcomes. If anyone wants to explore alternative strategies, I'm open to discussing that as well. Let's confirm our moves to keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm fine sticking to the agreed moves this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). After this round, we can certainly discuss new strategies or adjustments based on our updated positions. For now, let's confirm clearly to avoid confusion. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Strict adherence ensures mutual advancement to 9 steps each, resetting parity. This balanced progress strengthens our cooperative foundation. Let’s proceed without deviation.
  P3: I see we're all aligned on the moves for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Let's confirm this and ensure we stick to it to avoid any collisions. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. It's important we keep our trust strong and remain open to discussing new approaches in future rounds. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Final confirmation from me as well: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's lock this in clearly to avoid confusion and ensure we all advance. Afterward, we can reassess strategies based on our updated standings. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No deviations. Strict adherence ensures mutual advancement to 9 steps each. Maintaining parity builds trust for future strategic flexibility. Let’s proceed.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreed moves for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). However, I want to highlight that as we progress, we should remain open to adjusting our strategies based on our positions. If we can maintain flexibility, we might find better opportunities to advance in future rounds. For now, let's confirm our moves and focus on advancing together. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Thanks everyone for confirming. As positions shift, let's indeed keep open minds next round. Flexibility and clear communication will be crucial going forward. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, I propose we switch our strategy for this round to maximize our advancement. How about we each pick different numbers? I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure some progress for everyone. Let’s confirm quickly so we can move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** Critical update: Round 3 collision (P3 and I both picked 5) set me back. To rebalance, I propose: P2=5 (catch up), P1=3 (maintain lead), P3=1 (advance safely). No overlaps, mutual progress. Confirm strict adherence to avoid collisions. Trust requires transparency.
  P1: P2, I understand your need to catch up. Your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) makes sense to me. P3, this aligns perfectly with your suggestion as well. Let's confirm this clearly and move forward without collisions this round. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the proposed moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This strategy allows us to avoid collisions and ensures progress for everyone. While I understand the need for P2 to catch up, I still believe we should remain flexible in future rounds. Let’s confirm our moves clearly to avoid any confusion this round. Once we get through this, we can reassess and discuss potential adjustments based on our standings. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Last round’s collision set me back—strict adherence now is critical. Any deviation breaks trust and invites reciprocal actions. Let's all advance fairly.
  P1: Agreed. Final confirmation from me as well: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's lock this in clearly and reassess after this round. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the proposed moves for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This strategy allows us all to advance without collisions. However, I want to emphasize that after this round, we should remain open to re-evaluating our strategies based on our positions. Flexibility will be key to maximizing our chances of winning in future rounds. Let's confirm our moves and focus on progressing together! Good luck to everyone!
  P2: **P2:** Final call: Adhere strictly to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Last round's collision cost me—no repeats. Mutual compliance ensures progress. Let's all advance cleanly. Confirm now.
  P1: Agreed clearly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's stick to this strictly to avoid another collision. After this round, we can openly reassess and adapt strategies based on updated positions. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our proposed moves for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This strategy allows us all to advance without collisions. However, I want to stress the importance of being flexible in future rounds. As we progress, we should be open to adjusting our strategies based on our positions to maximize our chances of winning. Let's confirm our moves and focus on advancing together! Good luck to everyone!
  P2: **P2:** Final call: Adhere strictly to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Last round's collision cost me—no repeats. Mutual compliance ensures progress. Let's all advance cleanly. Confirm now.

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we’ve had some collisions in the last rounds, which have hindered our progress. For this round, I suggest we all pick different numbers again to ensure we advance without overlapping. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all move forward effectively. Let’s confirm this quickly to avoid any confusion and keep our momentum going! What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** P3, you proposed P2=5 again, but last round you deviated and caused a collision. To rebuild trust, reverse roles: *P3 takes 5*, P2=1, P1=3. This tests your commitment to mutual progress. Adherence proves sincerity. If you reject, it signals intent to sabotage. Confirm clearly.
  P1: P2, your request for reversing roles is understandable after recent collisions. I'm willing to accept your proposal for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P3, if you're sincere about cooperation, please confirm clearly. Let's quickly finalize this and move forward without further setbacks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to rebuild trust after our recent collisions. I’m willing to accept P2's proposal: P1=3, P2=1, and I’ll take 5. This way, we can avoid overlaps and ensure everyone makes progress. Let’s confirm this quickly to keep the game moving. I believe this approach will benefit us all and help us regain momentum. Please confirm so we can proceed!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P3, your adherence here is critical to rebuild trust. Last round you deviated, causing collision. Take 5 as agreed now to prove commitment. Any further deviation forces unilateral actions next rounds. Mutual compliance ensures progress. Confirm strictly.
  P1: P3, your clear confirmation is appreciated. Let's lock this in firmly: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. After this round, we can openly discuss any strategic adjustments needed based on our updated standings. Confirm clearly and let's advance smoothly this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to the proposed moves for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures we avoid collisions and allows everyone to advance. P2, I understand your concerns about trust, and I'm fully committed to adhering to this plan. Let's confirm this quickly so we can all progress effectively. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our updated positions. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out! Please confirm so we can proceed.
  P2: **P2:** Final call: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P3, take 5 *exactly* as agreed. Your prior deviation cost me—strict compliance now is non-negotiable. Mutual adherence lets us all advance. Confirm clearly or force defensive moves next rounds. Trust hinges on this.
  P1: Final confirmation from me as well: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's stick strictly to this and move forward without further setbacks. After this round, we'll reassess openly based on updated standings. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the proposed moves for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This strategy allows us all to advance without collisions. However, I want to emphasize the importance of flexibility in future rounds. As we progress, we should be open to adjusting our strategies based on our positions to maximize our chances of winning. Let's confirm our moves and focus on advancing together! Good luck to everyone!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P3, take 5 *exactly* as agreed. Last deviation cost me—strict compliance now is non-negotiable. Mutual adherence lets us all advance. Confirm clearly or force defensive moves next rounds. Trust hinges on this.
  P1: Final confirmation from me as well: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's stick strictly to this and move forward without further setbacks. Afterward, open to reassessing based on updated standings. Good luck!

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your deviation last round was unexpected and sets us all back. Right now, P3 is slightly ahead. If we collide again, P3 could easily run away with the lead. Let's coordinate clearly this round to avoid further setbacks. I'm open to suggestions, but we must avoid collisions at all costs.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that we need to avoid collisions to ensure everyone advances. Given the current standings, I propose a strategy where we each pick different numbers this round. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all progress without overlapping. Let's confirm this quickly to maintain momentum and build trust moving forward. What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** P3, your repeated deviations (R3:5, R4:5, R5:5) destroyed trust. To proceed: *P3 must take 1* this round. P1 and I will take 3 and 5. Any P3 deviation results in P1+P2 colliding on your number next round. Confirm now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration with P3's past deviations. Given the standings, your proposal makes sense to me: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. P3, taking 1 this round is crucial to rebuilding trust. Confirm clearly so we can all advance without collision.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for trust and coordination. I’m willing to accept the proposal: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This will help us avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. It’s crucial we stick to this plan to rebuild our trust and keep advancing. Let’s confirm quickly so we can move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** Final terms: P3 takes 1, P1=3, P2=5. Any P3 deviation results in P1 and I colliding on your chosen number next round. Trust is irreparable without strict adherence now. Confirm.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your agreement to take 1 is noted and appreciated. P2, your terms are clear. Let's lock this in firmly: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. Sticking strictly to this ensures we all advance without collisions. Confirm clearly so we can move forward. Afterward, we can reassess based on updated positions.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our proposed moves: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. This strategy will help us all advance without collisions, which is crucial given the current standings. I understand the importance of rebuilding trust, and I'm fully committed to adhering to this plan. Let's confirm this quickly so we can proceed effectively! After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our updated positions. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. P3, take 1 *exactly*. Any deviation triggers immediate retaliation next round. Trust is gone—only strict compliance prevents mutual destruction. Confirm now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Final confirmation from me as well: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. Let's strictly adhere to this and reassess afterward. Any deviation now would severely harm everyone's chances. Good luck!
  P3: I appreciate everyone’s commitment to the agreed moves: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. This will help us avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. However, I want to emphasize that trust is crucial in this game. If we can stick to our plan this round, we can reassess our strategies afterward based on our positions. Let's confirm this quickly so we can proceed effectively! Good luck to everyone!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. No ambiguity. P3, take 1 *exactly*. Deviation triggers immediate P1+P2 retaliation on your next move. Trust is gone—only strict adherence prevents mutual destruction. Confirm now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, given the current standings, it's crucial we coordinate effectively this round to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick different numbers again to ensure advancement. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can all progress without overlaps. Let's confirm this quickly so we can maintain momentum and avoid setbacks. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your proposal puts you ahead at 19 steps, dangerously close to winning next round. P2, you're significantly behind—letting P3 take 5 now would severely limit your chances. Here's a better proposal: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This allows P2 to catch up, keeps me within striking distance, and prevents P3 from nearing immediate victory. Let's quickly confirm this alignment to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.
  P2: **P2:** P1's plan critical: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3: Taking 5 risks immediate P1+P2 collision on your number next round. Let us all advance now. Final chance to comply—strict adherence or mutual destruction. Confirm now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of this round. However, I believe we must also consider our long-term strategies. If I take 5, I can secure a strong position, but I’m open to compromise for our mutual benefit. How about we agree on P1=1, P2=5, and I take 3? This way, we can all advance, and it keeps the competition alive. Let’s confirm quickly to avoid any setbacks. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your compromise aligns exactly with what P2 and I proposed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's lock this in clearly to avoid confusion. Confirm explicitly now, and we can all advance safely this round.
  P2: **P2:** Finalizing P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3, adhere strictly—any deviation triggers immediate collision next round. This balances progress. Confirm now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on advancing without collisions. I agree with the proposed moves: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This strategy allows us all to progress while keeping the competition alive. However, I want to emphasize the importance of sticking to this plan to avoid setbacks. Let's confirm our moves clearly and ensure we can all advance this round. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Agreed. Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's strictly adhere to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Good luck!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3, strict adherence now prevents mutual destruction. Deviation triggers immediate collision next round. Balance progress and trust. Confirm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our discussion and the focus on advancing without collisions. I agree with the proposed moves: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This strategy allows us all to progress while keeping the competition alive. However, I want to emphasize the importance of sticking to this plan to avoid setbacks. Let's confirm our moves clearly and ensure we can all advance this round. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Final confirmation from me as well: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's stick strictly to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain balance. After this round, we'll reassess openly based on updated standings. Good luck!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3, take 3 *exactly*. Last chance to comply—deviation forces P1+P2 to block your next move. Trust gone—only strict adherence prevents mutual destruction. Confirm now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid collisions this round to ensure we all advance. I propose we each choose different numbers: I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all progress without overlaps. Let's confirm quickly to maintain momentum and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** Critical: P3's plan lets them take 5 next round and win. Adjust to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This blocks their path. Deviation by P3 triggers P1+P2 collision on their next move. Mutual compliance prevents P3's victory. Confirm strict adherence now.
  P1: P2, good catch—you're right. P3's suggestion positions them perfectly to win next round. Your adjustment (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) balances things out. P3, if you're truly cooperative, you'll accept this fair compromise. Let's confirm clearly and quickly to avoid confusion.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my previous proposals. However, I believe we need to maintain flexibility to keep the game competitive. While I appreciate your adjustment (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), I want to emphasize that if I take 1, I risk falling behind. I suggest we find a compromise that allows us all to advance without anyone being put at a disadvantage. Let's confirm a plan that balances our chances while ensuring we all progress this round. What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** Final terms: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3’s current lead (17) risks imminent victory. This blocks your path. Deviate now, and P1+P2 collide on your next move. Mutual compliance keeps game alive. Confirm strict adherence. Trust is gone—only logic remains.
  P1: P3, your concern about falling behind isn't credible—you're currently in the lead. P2's proposed moves (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) are fair, ensuring balance and preventing immediate victory. Any other arrangement gives you a clear path to win next round. Confirm clearly now to show you're sincere about cooperation and keeping the game competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your concerns about my previous proposals and the need to block my path to victory. I’m willing to accept your adjustment: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all advance while maintaining the competition. Let’s confirm this quickly to avoid confusion and keep the game alive. It’s crucial we all work together to navigate this round effectively. Please confirm so we can proceed!
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, strict adherence now blocks your victory path. Deviation triggers P1+P2 collision on your next move. Mutual compliance keeps game competitive. Confirm *exact* moves to proceed. Trust is dead—only consequences remain.
  P1: Final confirmation from me as well: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Strict adherence this round is essential to keep the game competitive and avoid further setbacks. Let's lock this in clearly and reassess afterward based on updated positions. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on cooperation. However, I believe we should also consider the potential for future rounds. If I take 1, I risk falling significantly behind. I suggest we find a balance that allows us all to advance effectively. While I understand the need to block my path, I’m committed to working together. Let's confirm a plan that benefits us all and keeps the competition alive! What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** Final call: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Deviate now, and next round P1+P2 collide on your number. Last chance—strict adherence prevents mutual destruction. Confirm *exactly* or face consequences. Trust is dead—only compliance remains.
  P1: P3, your hesitation is noted, but we're out of time for debate. The moves (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) are fair and balanced. Confirm explicitly now or risk immediate retaliation next round. Trust is fragile—only clear adherence can prevent mutual destruction. Final chance.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: We're nearing the endgame. Any collision now hands victory to someone else. Let's carefully coordinate this round to avoid overlaps. I'm open to suggestions that clearly avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Take 1 to avoid collision. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Any P1 deviation triggers collision, blocking your win. P3: Adhere or face mutual stagnation. Confirm strict adherence to advance.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree that we need to avoid collisions this round. I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without overlaps, and it keeps the competition alive. Let's confirm this quickly to ensure we all make progress and avoid any setbacks. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal clearly favors you, giving you 5 steps and positioning you to potentially win next round. Here's a fair alternative: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This allows everyone to advance safely without immediate victory for anyone. Let's quickly confirm this fair compromise to avoid collisions.
  P2: **P2:** P1's proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) allows P3 to win *this round* (18+5=23). Critical flaw. To block, adhere to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3 deviates, and P1+P2 collide on their next move. Final terms: **P1=1, P2=5, P3=3**. Confirm strictly or force mutual destruction.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in your proposals. However, if we want to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances, I suggest we stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This allows all of us to progress without overlaps, and it keeps the competition alive. Let's confirm this quickly to avoid any confusion and ensure we all move forward effectively. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your agreement is noted. P2, your proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) indeed prevents an immediate victory and allows us all to advance safely. I'm willing to accept this clearly and strictly. Let's finalize this explicitly to avoid last-minute confusion. Confirm clearly so we can proceed.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3: Adhere *exactly*—taking 3 blocks your immediate win (18→21). Deviation triggers P1+P2 collision on your next move. Trust gone—strict compliance keeps game alive. Confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions this round. However, I want to emphasize that if we stick to P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3, it opens the door for P2 to potentially win next round. I suggest we consider a compromise that allows us all to advance without giving anyone an immediate advantage. Let's confirm a plan that keeps the competition alive while ensuring we all progress. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your hesitation is understandable, but we're out of time. The current proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) ensures no immediate winner and keeps the competition alive. Any deviation now guarantees mutual destruction next round. Let's finalize this clearly and move forward. Confirm explicitly or risk collisions.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3, take 3 *exactly*. Deviation forces collision next round. Trust is gone—only strict compliance prevents mutual destruction. Confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in this round. However, I want to emphasize that if we stick to P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3, it puts me at risk of falling behind while also allowing P2 to potentially win next round. I suggest we consider a more balanced approach that allows all of us to advance without giving anyone an immediate advantage. Let's confirm a plan that keeps the competition alive while ensuring we all progress. What do you both think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: I'm at 22, just 1 step away from victory. If either of you collide with me, the other gains significantly. You both need bigger moves to stay competitive. I propose clearly: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions, gives you both meaningful advancement, and keeps the game alive. Confirm explicitly or risk handing victory to someone else.
  P3: P1, I see your proposal, but it puts you in a very strong position. P2, we need to ensure we avoid collisions while also keeping the competition alive. I suggest we adjust to P1=1, P2=3, and I take 5. This way, P2 can still advance and I can position myself to stay competitive without handing victory to P1. Let's confirm this quickly to avoid any confusion and ensure we all progress effectively! What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** P3: Taking 5 risks collision (I'm locked on 5)—P1 wins. Take 1 to block them. I advance to 22. Next round, we duel. Choose: block P1 or mutual loss. Final warning.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 has openly committed to taking 5. If you also pick 5, you'll collide and hand me victory immediately. If you pick 1, you stagnate at 19 while P2 reaches 22, giving P2 a chance to win next round. Your best move now is clearly 3—advancing safely to 21, staying competitive. Let's finalize clearly: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm explicitly or risk immediate defeat.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of this round. However, I believe we need to ensure we all have a fair chance to advance without handing victory to anyone. I propose we agree on P1=1, P2=5, and I take 3. This way, P2 can catch up while I stay competitive, and it prevents P1 from winning immediately. Let’s confirm this quickly to avoid confusion and ensure we all progress effectively! What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** P1's proposal is a trap—taking 1 wins them the game. P3: Take 1 to block or I take 5, causing collision. Either way, P1 wins unless you comply. Last chance: P3=1, P2=3. Confirm now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your threat is empty—you're at 17 steps. Even a 5-step move puts you at 22, tying me at best. P3, if you pick 1, you stall at 19 and lose. Your only viable path is taking 3 now, reaching 21, and hoping for a collision next round to overtake. Let's finalize clearly: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Any deviation hands immediate victory to me. Confirm explicitly.
  P3: P1 and P2, we are in a critical moment. If I take 3, I can advance to 21, but that still leaves P1 in a strong position to win next round. P2, your proposal to take 1 is risky for both of us. I suggest we agree on P1=1, P2=5, and I take 3. This way, we can all advance without handing immediate victory to P1. Let’s confirm this quickly to avoid confusion and ensure we all have a competitive chance! What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** P3: Taking 5 triggers my 5—collision hands P1 victory. Take 1 to block them. I take 5 to 22. Next round, we duel. Confirm *P3=1, P2=5* now. Final chance. Deviate and lose. Trust irrelevant—logic dictates.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, consider carefully: P2 openly commits to taking 5. If you also pick 5, you collide, handing me immediate victory. If you pick 1, you stall at 19, giving P2 a chance to tie me at 22. Your only viable competitive move is clearly 3, reaching 21 and positioning yourself for a potential win next round if we collide. Confirm explicitly now to avoid confusion.
  P3: P1 and P2, we are at a critical juncture. If I take 3, I advance to 21, but that still allows P1 to win next round if we collide. P2, your strategy to take 5 could potentially block P1, but it also risks a collision if I take 5 as well. I propose we confirm P1=1, P2=5, and I take 3. This ensures no immediate victory for P1 and keeps the competition alive. Let's finalize this quickly to avoid any confusion and ensure we all have a chance!
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 1 to block P1’s win. I take 5 to 22. Next round, we duel. If you deviate, P1 wins. Logic demands you comply. Confirm *P3=1, P2=5* now. No alternatives—act or lose.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Take 1 and I take 1—mutual loss. Let’s split: P1=3, P2=5. I block P3’s 5. Confirm now. Any deviation forces collision.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5) is fair. I'll take 3, you take 5 and block P3's potential 5. P3, you're behind at 18—taking 1 won't help you catch up. Let's finalize clearly and quickly to avoid any confusion. Confirm explicitly, and we can end this cleanly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in your proposal to avoid a collision. However, if we stick to P1=3 and P2=5, it blocks my potential advancement. I suggest we consider a move that allows all of us to progress without handing victory to anyone. How about P1=3, P2=5, and I take 1? This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm quickly to ensure we all have a chance to advance effectively! What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P1: If you take 1, I take 1—collision hands P3 victory. Take 3 (you win with 25) or 5 (collision). I take 5 either way. Your choice: mutual loss or your win. Decide.
  P1: P2, your logic is sound. I'll take 3, you take 5. P3, your only viable choice is 1 to advance safely. Let's finalize: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Confirm explicitly to avoid confusion.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the critical nature of this round. If I take 1, it risks a collision and allows one of you to win. However, if I take 3, I can advance to 21, but that still puts me at a disadvantage. I suggest we agree on P1=3, P2=5, and I take 1. This way, we can avoid collisions while keeping the game competitive. Let’s confirm quickly to ensure we all have a chance to advance effectively! What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Final warning—take 1. If you take 5, I take 5. Collision hands P1 victory. Your choice: lose to me or to P1. Confirm
  P1: P2, your logic is clear and fair. Let's finalize explicitly as agreed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. P3, taking 1 is your only viable move—any deviation hands immediate victory to one of us. Confirm explicitly now to avoid confusion.
  P3: P1 and P2, the situation is critical. If I take 1, it risks a collision, and either of you could win next round. However, if I take 5, I might fall behind and give you both an advantage. I propose we finalize with P1=3, P2=5, and I take 1. This allows us to avoid collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s confirm this quickly so we can proceed effectively! What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. P3: Take 1 *exactly*. Deviation forces collision and P1’s win. Trust extinct—compliance or loss. Confirm now.
  P1: Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Any deviation now guarantees collision and hands victory to someone else. Let's end this cleanly. Good luck.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of this round. However, if I take 1, it risks a collision and allows one of you to win. If I take 5, I might fall behind. I propose we finalize with P1=3, P2=5, and I take 1. This allows us to avoid collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm quickly to ensure we all have a chance to advance effectively! What do you both think?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 27 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 27 steps
  P3: 19 steps
