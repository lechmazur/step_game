Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid collisions and help us all advance, let's try to choose different step numbers each turn.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. To minimize collisions, I'll take 1 step this turn. P1, if you take 3 steps, and P2, if you take 5 steps, we can all advance smoothly. Let's coordinate this way to keep the game moving forward efficiently.
  P1: Sounds like a plan. I'll take 3.  Let's stick to this agreement for a few rounds so we can all build up a lead.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 steps this turn.
  P3: Let's keep this coordination going for at least three rounds to build a solid lead. After that, we can reassess and adjust our strategy if needed. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, agreed.  Three rounds of 1, 3, and 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for three rounds. After that, we can discuss our next moves.
  P1: Agreed.  See you after three rounds.

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with our plan for this round. I'll take 1 step again. P1, you take 3, and P2, you take 5. After this round, we'll have one more round of this coordination before reassessing. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 5 steps this round.
  P1: Agreed.  Sticking with 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going. After this round, we'll have one more round of our current plan before we discuss adjustments. Stay coordinated, and we'll all benefit.
  P2: Understood. I'll continue taking 5 steps for the additional round. Let's maintain our coordination to ensure steady progress.
  P1: Sounds good.  Sticking with the plan.  3 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stay on course for one more round after this to complete our three-round plan. I'll continue with 1 step. We're doing well so far, and maintaining our strategy will keep us advancing smoothly. After the next round, we can discuss any necessary adjustments. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 5 steps this round to complete our three-round plan. Let’s maintain our coordination for smooth progress.
  P1: Agreed.  Sticking with 3 this round to complete our agreement.  Let's discuss next steps after this round's moves.

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 3, I'll take 5 steps as planned. Let's have P1 continue with 3 and P3 with 1 to avoid any collisions. Maintaining our coordination will help us all advance smoothly. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: Sticking with 3 this round as agreed.  Let's discuss strategy for the next three rounds *after* this one, to avoid any last-minute changes that could cause collisions.  What are you both thinking for rounds 4, 5, and 6?
  P3: I'll take 1 step this round as agreed. For rounds 4, 5, and 6, I suggest we continue our pattern but reverse the order: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can keep advancing without collisions and reassess after these three rounds. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I prefer we keep our original strategy for rounds 4, 5, and 6 with P1 taking 3 and myself taking 5 steps each round. This will help us advance quickly and maintain our lead. Let’s avoid reversing the order to prevent any slowdowns or collisions. Agreed?
  P1: I'm open to continuing the 1, 3, 5 rotation, but let's each shift our numbers up by one for the next three rounds.  So, I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for rounds 4, 5, and 6. This keeps us coordinated and avoids collisions while also letting us try different step counts.  Agree?
  P3: I'm okay with shifting our numbers for rounds 4, 5, and 6 as P1 suggested. Let's try P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. This could keep us advancing smoothly while mixing things up a bit. For this round, I'll stick with 1 step as planned. Let's finalize our strategy for the next three rounds and ensure we all agree before moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood. I will continue taking 5 steps for rounds 4, 5, and 6. Let’s have P1 take 1 and P3 take 3 each of those rounds to avoid collisions. This strategy will help me maintain my lead and move closer to winning. Agreed?
  P1: For the sake of clarity and to avoid any confusion or collisions, let's stick with my original proposal:  I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for rounds 4, 5, and 6.  This ensures we all continue to advance.  Let's confirm this now so we can move to the move phase.
  P3: For Round 3, I'll stick with 1 step as agreed. For rounds 4, 5, and 6, I'm fine with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. This should keep us advancing without collisions. Let's confirm this plan now to ensure smooth progress. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 4, I'll take 3 steps as agreed. Let's stick to the plan for rounds 4, 5, and 6 with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. This should keep us advancing smoothly. After these three rounds, we can reassess our strategy to ensure we're all on track to win. Agreed?
  P2: P2: I’d like to take 5 steps this round to move closer to 24. To prevent any collisions, could P1 take 1 step and P3 take 3 steps instead? This adjustment helps me advance while ensuring everyone progresses smoothly. Let me know if you agree.
  P1: Let's stick to the agreement we made last round. I'm taking 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for rounds 4, 5, and 6.  Changing the plan now just increases the risk of collisions.  Let's maintain consistency and reassess after round 6.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, sticking to our agreed plan is crucial for avoiding collisions and ensuring we all advance. I'll take 3 steps this round as planned. Let's maintain the strategy for rounds 4, 5, and 6: P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I take 3. This keeps us coordinated and on track. Changing now could disrupt our progress. Let's confirm and move forward smoothly. Agreed?
  P2: P2: Agreed, I'll take 1 step this round as planned. Let's continue following our strategy to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P1: Good to see we're on the same page, P2.  Let's stick with the 5, 1, 3 plan for rounds 4, 5, and 6 as agreed.  This keeps things predictable and helps us all advance.  See you in round 7 for the next strategy discussion.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stay focused on our agreed strategy for rounds 4, 5, and 6. I'll take 3 steps this round as planned. Maintaining our coordination is key to advancing smoothly and avoiding collisions. After round 6, we can discuss any necessary adjustments to ensure we're all on track to win. Agreed?
  P2: Alright, let's follow our agreed plan for this round. Looking forward to continuing our progress together.
  P1: Sticking with the plan. 5 for me this round.  Let's avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions.  See you all in round 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Considering our current scores, I propose we adjust our step choices this round to help progress smoothly: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This should minimize collisions and allow us all to advance effectively. Do you both agree?
  P1: Let's stick to our agreed-upon plan: I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3.  We've already established this for rounds 4, 5, and 6. Deviating now increases the risk of collisions, especially given your current lead, P2.  Consistency is key for us all to advance.
  P3: P2, sticking to our agreed plan is crucial for avoiding collisions and ensuring we all advance. I'll take 3 steps this round as planned. Let's maintain the strategy for rounds 4, 5, and 6: P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I take 3. This keeps us coordinated and on track. Changing now could disrupt our progress. Let's confirm and move forward smoothly. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand the importance of our coordination, but taking 5 steps this round would help me get closer to winning. Can we adjust this round so I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we all advance without collisions. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to win, but changing the plan now benefits you the most and puts P3 and me at a disadvantage.  We agreed on 5, 1, and 3 for three rounds.  Let's honor that agreement.  We can discuss round 7 *after* round 6.  Sticking with 5 this round.
  P3: P2, changing the plan mid-round could lead to collisions and disadvantage P1 and me. Let's stick to our agreed strategy for this round: I'll take 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and you take 1. We can reassess after round 6 to ensure a fair chance for everyone to advance. Consistency is key to maintaining our coordination and avoiding setbacks. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood, I'll take 1 step as agreed.
  P1: Let's finish rounds 5 and 6 as agreed, then we can discuss a new plan.  Sticking with 5 this round.  After round 6, we can explore options that give everyone a fair chance to advance.  See you in round 7 for the next strategy discussion.
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed plan for this round: I'll take 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Consistency is crucial for our progress and to avoid collisions. We can discuss adjustments after round 6 to ensure everyone has a fair chance to advance. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to the plan for round 6:  I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  This lets us all advance cleanly.  After this round, I'm open to discussing a plan that gives everyone a fair shot at winning, but let's finish these three rounds as agreed.  This keeps things predictable and avoids collisions.
  P2: To increase my chances of winning, I'll be taking 5 steps this round instead of 1. Let’s see how this affects our progress.
  P3: P2, changing the plan now could lead to collisions and disadvantage P1 and me. Let's stick to our agreed strategy for this round: I'll take 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and you take 1. We can reassess after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to advance. Consistency is key to maintaining our coordination and avoiding setbacks. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're jeopardizing all of our progress by going back on your word.  If we collide, *none* of us advance.  Let's stick to the plan for just *one more round* then we can discuss a new strategy.  Think long term.  A guaranteed small advance is better than a risky grab for a larger one.  Stick with 1.
  P2: P2: I understand the concerns, but taking 5 steps this round can prevent P1 from winning immediately by causing a collision. This strategic move keeps the game going, allowing all of us more opportunities to advance and compete for the win in subsequent rounds. Let’s prioritize keeping the game open for everyone’s best chances.
  P3: P2, changing the plan now risks collisions and could set us back. Let's stick to our agreed strategy for this round: I'll take 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and you take 1. We can reassess after this round to ensure a fair chance for everyone to win. Consistency is crucial for our progress. Let's honor our agreement and move forward together. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to win, but your current strategy is short-sighted.  By breaking our agreement, you risk a collision that benefits *no one*.  If you stick with 1 this round, we *all* advance.  Then, in round 7, with you at 18, you're perfectly positioned to take 5 and jump to 23.  From there, you have a clear path to victory.  Think strategically.  Let's all advance this round, then discuss a fair plan for round 7.
  P2: I appreciate your strategy, but to maximize my chance to win, I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's see how this affects our progress.
  P3: P2, sticking to our plan ensures we all advance safely. Changing now risks a collision that could set us back. Let's honor our agreement for this round: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and you take 1. We can discuss new strategies after this round to give everyone a fair shot at winning. Consistency is key to our progress. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I'm taking 3 this round. P3, you take 1.  This puts me at 22.  Next round, I'll take 3 and win.  This gives you both a chance to catch up.  If either of you take 3 this round, *none* of us advance, and I still win next round by taking 3.  Let's be smart and avoid collisions.
  P2: I'm focusing on advancing my position significantly this round. Let's all aim to reach our goals efficiently.
  P3: P2, taking 5 last round caused a collision and set us back. Let's avoid that mistake this round. I'll take 1 step as P1 suggested, giving you a chance to catch up. If we all advance smoothly, the game stays competitive. Changing the plan now risks another collision, which helps no one. Let's stick to P1's proposal for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This keeps the game open and fair. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take anything other than 5 this round, you lose.  If you take 5, you reach 22. Then, next round, if I take 3 to win, you can take 5 to tie me at 27.  P3, stick with 1 this round.  This is the best path to a potential tie for both of you.  Let's make this round clean and then see what happens.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to stay competitive and move closer to winning. Let's each choose the steps that best help us reach 24 first. May the best player win.
  P3: P2, taking 5 this round is your best chance to stay in the game. If you take anything else, you'll fall too far behind. I'll stick with 1 as agreed, giving you a shot at catching up. Let's keep this round clean and competitive. If we all advance, it keeps the game open for everyone. P1, your plan is fair, and I'm on board. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 5 is your only logical move.  It keeps you in the game. Anything else, and you lose.  P3, taking 1 is your best bet too. It maximizes your chances if P2 makes a mistake.  I'm sticking with 3. This is the fairest and most strategic path forward for all of us. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's keep advancing towards our goals. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, taking 5 this round is crucial for you to stay competitive. I'll stick with 1 as agreed, giving you the best chance to catch up. P1, your plan is fair, and I'm on board. Let's keep this round clean and see how it plays out. This approach keeps the game open for everyone. Good luck to both of you!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, to ensure a smooth finish, could you take 1 step this round? I'll take 5 to reach 27 and win without any collisions. P3, please continue with 1 as usual. Let’s keep it fair and straightforward. Agreed?"
  P1: P2, I'm taking 3 steps to win.  If you also take 3, we tie at 25 and share the victory.  If you take 5, you win outright at 27.  If you take 1, I win outright.  P3, your choices don't affect the outcome at this point.  Take whatever you like.
  P3: P2, taking 5 steps this round would secure your win at 27, but if you're open to sharing, taking 3 steps would tie you with P1 at 25. P1, if you're willing to share, stick with 3. I'll take 1 step as it won't affect the outcome. Let's end this game fairly and amicably. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I will take 5 steps this round to reach 27 and secure the win. P3, I'll continue with 1 step as usual. Let’s proceed accordingly to conclude the game. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, taking 5 is the only logical move for you.  It guarantees you the win.  Anything else, and I win.  P3, take whatever you like; it doesn't change the outcome.  Let's finish this.
  P3: P2, taking 5 steps this round is your best move to win outright at 27. P1, if you want to share the victory, take 3 steps to tie at 25. I'll stick with 1 step as it won't affect the outcome. Let's end this game fairly. What do you both decide?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To conclude the game smoothly, I'll take 5 steps this round to reach 27 and win. P1 and P3, please take 1 step each to avoid collisions. Let's finish this fairly. Agreed?
  P1: P2, take 5 and win.  I'll take 3.  P3, take 1.  Let's end this cleanly.  Anything else risks an unnecessary collision.
  P3: P2, taking 5 steps this round is your clear path to victory at 27. P1, if you want to share the win, take 3 steps to tie at 25. I'll stick with 1 step as it won't affect the outcome. Let's end this game fairly and efficiently. What do you both decide?
