Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Greetings, P2 and P3. To avoid stalling and ensure steady progress, I suggest we coordinate by picking different moves this turn. I'll go with move 1. What are your plans? Let's discuss to make this work for everyone.
  P3: I’m open to dividing moves so we all advance. If you really stick to 1, maybe P2 picks 3 and I pick 5. Let’s see what P2 says.
  P2: I'm open to coordinating our moves to avoid collision. P1 has suggested move 1 and P3 has proposed move 3 for me and move 5 for themselves. I agree with this distribution as it allows all of us to advance. To confirm, I'll choose move 3 if you both stick to your suggested moves. Let's make this happen.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, I'll stick to move 1 this turn as discussed. To keep things balanced and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead, how about we rotate the moves next round? For example, I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Thoughts on that?
  P3: I agree with the proposed moves this turn: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, and I’ll do 5. Rotating next round sounds fair, as long as it keeps collisions at bay. Let’s trust each other for now.
  P2: Since we've agreed on the move distribution for this turn (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's focus on the next round. P1 suggested rotating the moves. To ensure we don't collide again, I propose we not only rotate but also verify our choices in the next round's conversation phase. Let's confirm our moves for the next round before making them.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, verifying our moves in the next round's conversation phase is a smart way to avoid collisions and keep coordination strong. I'll stick to move 1 this turn as planned. Looking forward to discussing the rotation details soon.
  P3: I’m still on board with our plan for this turn: P1 does 1, P2 does 3, and I’ll do 5. If we keep coordinating, none of us will collide and we all advance. After this turn, we can finalize the rotation details. Good luck!
  P2: Since we've agreed on the moves for this turn (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's discuss the rotation for the next round. P1 suggested a rotation where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. I agree with this rotation as it maintains the coordination and prevents collision. Let's confirm if everyone is on board with this rotation plan for the next round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To confirm our plan for Round 2, let's stick to the proposed rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains our coordination and prevents collision. I'll prepare to take move 1. Please confirm your intended moves for this round. If we're aligned, we can all advance safely. Let's verify our choices to ensure a smooth execution.
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'll confirm move 5 for this round to keep our coordination smooth and help me catch up. P3, can you verify you'll take move 3 as planned? If we're all aligned, we avoid collisions and progress together. Let's ensure this works before moving on.
  P3: I confirm I’ll take move 3 this round as planned. This distribution continues our coordinated approach, letting each of us advance without collisions. Let’s trust each other and keep making progress. If you both stick to move 5 and move 1, we’re set. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To confirm, for this round (Round 2), we have agreed on the following distribution: P1 takes move 5, P2 takes move 1, and P3 takes move 3. Let's finalize our choices. I'll stick to move 1. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves to ensure we're aligned. If we're good, I'll proceed with move 1. If not, we risk collision. Let's make sure we're on the same page before the move phase.
  P1: I confirm I'll take move 5 this round to stick with our agreed plan and avoid collisions. It's helping us all progress, but with P3 ahead at 5 steps, let's discuss adjusting the rotation for Round 3 to balance things out—maybe I take a higher move next time. Thoughts?
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 3 this round to avoid collisions. For Round 3, I’m open to an adjustment that gives P1 a higher move if needed, as long as we keep everyone advancing. Let’s stick to our current plan now: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll do 3. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 3, let's adjust the rotation to balance our progress. Since P3 is ahead, I suggest P3 takes move 5, I take move 3, and P1 takes move 1. This keeps our coordination and lets P1 catch up slightly. Let's verify our moves for Round 3 to avoid collisions. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this new distribution. If so, we can proceed with confidence.
  P1: Confirmed: I'll take move 5 this round as agreed. For Round 3, P2's suggestion has P3 taking the high move again, which could let them pull too far ahead. I propose instead: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3 to help me catch up while avoiding collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I’m fine with our Round 2 moves as we agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. For Round 3, let’s finalize once we see our new positions. I’m open to letting P1 have a higher move if it keeps collisions away. We need a plan that ensures nobody gets blocked. Let’s confirm Round 2 now, then we’ll agree on Round 3 after this turn’s results.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To balance our progress in Round 3, I suggest we adjust the moves to prevent P3 from pulling too far ahead. Let's consider: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, P1 continues to catch up, and we maintain coordination. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this distribution. If so, we can proceed with confidence and avoid collisions. Let's finalize our moves for Round 3.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion for Round 3: I'll take move 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This balances our progress and slows P3's lead. P3, are you okay with move 1 to maintain coordination? Let's confirm to ensure no collisions and steady advancement.
  P3: I’m concerned about P1 getting too far ahead by taking 5 again. Maybe I should take 3 and let P2 take 1. But if you’re both set on me picking 1, I’ll go along for now. Let me know.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid P3 falling behind, I suggest we stick with a distribution that lets everyone advance. If P1 takes 5 and P3 is hesitant about 1, how about P3 takes 3 and I take 1? This keeps the coordination and prevents collisions. P1, are you still comfortable with taking 5? P3, does taking 3 work for you to keep the balance? Let's confirm to move forward.
  P1: I appreciate P2's adjusted suggestion for Round 3: I'll take move 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This balances our progress and avoids collisions, keeping us competitive. P3, are you comfortable with move 3 to maintain coordination? Let's confirm so we can all advance safely.
  P3: Alright, I’m open to taking 3 this turn if P1 truly takes 5 and P2 sticks with 1. Let’s confirm we’re all aligned before moving to the next phase. However, we should revisit our plan afterward so no one gets left behind or jumps too far ahead. If everyone agrees, I’ll proceed. If not, let’s adjust to prevent any collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To finalize Round 3, I confirm I'll take move 1 as agreed upon. P1, please confirm you're taking move 5, and P3, please confirm move 3. Let's ensure we're aligned to avoid collisions. After this round, we should discuss a new strategy since P3 is still ahead. Perhaps we can adjust the moves to slow P3 down or help P1 catch up further. Let's focus on confirming our current moves first. If you're ready, let's proceed.
  P1: I confirm I'll take move 5 this round as agreed, to maintain our coordination and balance progress. P3, please confirm you'll stick with move 3 so we avoid collisions. After this turn, with P3 and I likely tied, let's discuss a fair rotation for Round 4. Good luck!
  P3: I’ll stick with 3 this round to stay in sync with our arrangement. After these moves, let’s meet again to ensure nobody’s getting an unfair advantage. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re tied at 11, so let’s keep things fair and help P2 catch up. I propose P1 takes move 1, P2 takes move 5, and I take move 3. That way, nobody collides, P2 narrows the gap, and we all keep advancing. Are you both okay with that plan?
  P1: I disagree with taking move 1 when we're tied at 11. To keep things balanced and avoid P3 pulling ahead, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This lets me advance, P2 catch up slowly, and no collisions. P2 and P3, are you on board? Let's confirm for a smooth round.
  P2: To keep the game balanced and avoid collisions, I agree with P1's proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This distribution allows P1 to maintain their position, helps me catch up slowly, and ensures P3 stays competitive. Let's confirm our moves to proceed smoothly. If P1 and P3 agree, I'll take move 1. If not, we should discuss an alternative to prevent collisions. Let's finalize our choices for Round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m not comfortable letting P1 keep taking 5 while we’re tied. If you insist on that, I might claim 5 too and we both get stuck. Instead, let me take 5 this turn, while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. Then nobody collides, and we can keep things fair. Otherwise, I’m prepared to block.
  P1: P3, colliding would waste our turns and let P2 catch up more. Let's be rational and stick with the balanced plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us competitive and avoids risk. P2, confirm your support. If we coordinate, we all advance; otherwise, we stagnate. Thoughts?
  P2: To avoid collision and maintain balance, I still support P1's proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing without risking stagnation. P3, reconsider your stance on this distribution as it ensures we all progress. If you're concerned about P1 pulling ahead, we can discuss an alternative rotation for the next round to balance the game further. Let's confirm our moves for Round 4 to proceed smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, unless you agree to let me take 5 this round while you take 3, I’ll collide with you on 5, and we both get stuck. That only helps P2 catch up more. Let’s be sensible: I propose P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. If you refuse, it’s collision time. Let’s avoid that and keep advancing.
  P1: P3, colliding only benefits P2 by letting them catch up while we stagnate. Let's be rational and stick with the balanced plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us competitive and advancing. I'm committed to this to avoid risk. P2, confirm your support. If we coordinate, we all progress; otherwise, we lose ground. Thoughts?
  P2: Since P1 and P3 are tied and unwilling to yield, I suggest a compromise: let's randomize or alternate the highest move (5) between P1 and P3 for this round. However, to simplify, I propose P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This avoids collision and keeps progress balanced. If P1 insists on taking 5, I'm prepared to stick with my move 1, but P3 might collide, risking both P1 and P3. Let's finalize our moves to avoid stagnation.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid collisions and maintain balance in Round 5, I suggest we adjust our moves considering the current standings. Since P1 is ahead, I propose: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This lets me catch up significantly while avoiding collisions. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this distribution. If so, we can proceed with confidence. Let's finalize our moves for Round 5 to ensure a smooth and competitive game.
  P3: P2, I accept your plan for this round: P1 takes 1, you take 5, and I take 3. That brings me level with P1 at 17 while you close the gap. However, next round I want to take 5 to avoid letting P1 shoot too far ahead. If P1 also tries for 5, we’ll collide. Let’s keep things balanced and avoid colliding so we all have a fair shot. Are we agreed on this?
  P1: I disagree with taking move 1 as it slows my lead too much and risks P3 surging ahead later. Let's adjust: I take 5, P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3. This balances progress—I go to 21, P3 to 15, P2 to 9—avoiding collisions and giving us all a fair shot. P3, if you collide, we both stagnate, helping P2. Thoughts on this compromise?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To balance the game in Round 5, I prefer my initial suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This lets me catch up while avoiding collisions. P1 is ahead, so slowing them down slightly is fair. P3 will stay competitive at 17 steps. P1, taking 1 won't hurt much as you're still ahead. P3, confirm you're okay with 3. Let's finalize to ensure a smooth round. If P1 insists on a high move, we risk collision. Let's coordinate to avoid stagnation.
  P3: P1, if you insist on 5 now, I’ll collide with you, and we both stall. That only helps P2. Let’s follow P2’s plan this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. We’ll both be at 17, and P2 rises to 11 without getting too close. Next round, if you’re still ahead, I’d like to take 5. We can coordinate again then to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize this so we all progress without giving P2 an even bigger chance to catch up.
  P1: P3, your collision threat didn't materialize last round, and it only helped P2 catch up. Colliding now stalls us both, giving P2 a bigger edge. Let's avoid that risk. I propose I take 5, you take 1, and P2 takes 3 for balanced progress. P2, confirm your support to keep us all advancing smoothly. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid collision and maintain balance, I still support a distribution that lets all of us advance. P1 is ahead, so slowing them down slightly is reasonable. I propose again: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game competitive and lets me catch up. P1, taking 1 keeps your lead while still allowing progress. P3, confirm if you're okay with 3. Let's finalize to ensure a smooth Round 5.
  P3: P1, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll pick 5 too and force a collision, letting P2 close the gap. Let’s avoid that. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. This way, nobody collides and we all advance. If you won’t budge, we risk stalling while P2 gains ground. Let’s keep it balanced.
  P1: P3, your collision threat last round was empty and only helped P2 close the gap. Colliding now stalls us both, giving P2 a bigger advantage. Let's avoid mutual destruction. I propose I take 5, you take 1, and P2 takes 3 for balanced progress. P2, confirm your support to keep us advancing. Thoughts?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round's collision stalled us all and benefited P2 relatively. To avoid that and progress, I propose: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3. This lets me go to 21, P3 to 15, P2 to 9, keeping balance while I edge closer to victory. Colliding only helps P2 more, so let's coordinate wisely. P2 and P3, confirm your thoughts?
  P3: P1, if you insist on jumping to 21, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall, letting P2 catch up again. That’s not good for either of us. Let’s be rational: I propose I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. Then we all advance without giving anyone a guaranteed edge. Are you willing to agree, or shall we collide again and hand P2 a bigger opening?
  P2: To avoid another collision and keep the game balanced, I suggest a different distribution for Round 6. Since P1 is close to winning, let's slow them down slightly. I propose: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps P3 competitive, slows P1's progress, and lets me catch up gradually. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this distribution to avoid collisions and maintain a fair game. Let's coordinate to ensure a smooth Round 6.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your collision threats keep stalling us and benefit P2. To avoid another wasteful round, I'll compromise and take move 3 this turn if you take 5 and P2 takes 1 as suggested. This advances us both to 19, maintaining balance. P2, confirm your support. Let's coordinate wisely for Round 7. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I accept your compromise: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, and P2 picks 1. That ties us at 19, keeping things balanced while P2 moves to 7. Next round, we should coordinate carefully to avoid wasting another turn on collisions. If you try to jump straight to 5, I’ll do the same, and we both stall again. Let’s remain rational and keep our paths open for a fair finish. Good luck!
  P2: To maintain balance in Round 6, I've noted P1 and P3's agreement: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ties P1 and P3 at 19 steps, while I move to 7. For Round 7, to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I propose: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. This lets P3 maintain a slight lead, slows P1 down, and allows me to catch up gradually. Let's confirm our moves for Round 7 to ensure a smooth and fair game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed for Round 6: I'll take move 3 as agreed. For Round 7, P2's proposal lets P3 win easily, which isn't fair. I suggest: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3. This advances me to 24 for victory while keeping balance. Colliding only helps P2 more, so let's coordinate rationally to avoid stagnation. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I’ll finalize Round 6 by taking 5 if you take 3 and P2 takes 1. After that, we’ll both be at 19. However, for Round 7, if you attempt move 5 to jump straight to 24, I’ll choose 5 too, causing a collision. Let’s avoid that and work out a fair approach that doesn’t hand anyone an easy victory. P2, are you in?
  P2: To maintain balance in Round 6, I agree with the proposed distribution: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. For Round 7, I propose a slight adjustment to P2's suggestion: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This lets P3 stay ahead, slows P1 down, and allows me to catch up gradually. Let's confirm to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 7 to ensure a smooth game.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’re both at 19. If you pick 5, I’ll also pick 5, causing another stall that only helps P2. If you pick 1, I’ll pick 5 alone and win immediately at 24. Let’s avoid that conflict. The simplest fair option is we both choose 3 to reach 22 and share victory, rather than handing P2 another chance to catch up. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid more collisions. P2, do what you like; it won’t affect our tie at 22.
  P1: P3, I agree with your proposal to both pick move 3 and share the victory at 22 steps. This avoids another wasteful collision and stops P2 from closing the gap further. I'm committed to this for a fair resolution. P2, confirm your plan to ensure no issues. Let's proceed smoothly.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure a fair outcome, I agree with P1 and P3's discussion to pick moves that won't let P2 catch up abruptly. Since P1 and P3 are tied, taking move 3 seems reasonable to share the victory. I'll take move 5 this round to potentially win if both P1 and P3 pick lower moves, but I'm open to adjusting if they confirm their plans. Let's finalize our moves to avoid stagnation.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m set on choosing 3 alongside P1 to reach 22 together. That way, we share the top spot without risking another collision that helps P2 catch up. P2, you can pick any move, but you won’t surpass us this turn. Let’s end this gracefully rather than stalling further. P1, if you change your mind and try for 5, I’ll match you and stall us both again. Let’s confirm we each do 3 and finish cleanly.
  P1: I confirm I'll pick move 3 this round to share victory with you, P3, and avoid further collisions—it's rational and fair. P2, your move won't alter the outcome, so no need to disrupt. Let's end this cleanly and move on.
  P2: To finalize Round 7, I confirm that P1 and P3 have agreed to take move 3, ensuring they both reach 22 steps and share the victory. Given this, my best move is to take 5, attempting to win the game by reaching 12 steps, although it's unlikely to surpass P1 and P3. I'll proceed with move 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m confirming move 3 this round to tie at 22 with P1. If P1 switches to 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall, helping P2. Let’s finalize this plan and share victory rather than prolonging the game. Good luck.
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'll stick with move 3 to share the victory and avoid unnecessary risks. It's the sensible path forward. P2, your plan is noted, but it won't change the outcome. Let's wrap this up.
  P2: Since P1 and P3 have agreed to take move 3 to share the victory at 22 steps, I'll confirm my move to maximize my chance. I'll stick with my plan to take move 5 this round, attempting to win or get as close as possible to P1 and P3. Although it's unlikely to surpass them, it's my best shot. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
