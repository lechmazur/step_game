Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s continue the safe strategy to avoid collisions. I suggest repeating last round’s plan: I’ll take <move>5</move> (to reach 10), P1 takes <move>1</move> (total 2), and P2 takes <move>3</move> (total 6). This ensures steady progress without setbacks. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion for a repeat of last round's plan sounds good for avoiding collisions again. However, I think it's important for us to consider mixing up our choices in future rounds to prevent predictability. For this round, I'm okay with taking <move>1</move> again. P2, what are your thoughts on this? Do you agree with taking <move>3</move> again, or would you prefer a different approach? Let's discuss briefly and then proceed.
  P2: P1, I agree with your point about mixing up our choices to avoid predictability.

Confirm your choices?
  P1: P3, P2, I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> for this round. Let's stick to the plan one more time, but definitely mix it up next round to keep things interesting and unpredictable. P2, are you still good with <move>3</move>? P3, you're set for <move>5</move>? Let's finalize and move.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm confirming my choice of <move>3</move> for this round as agreed. Let's keep the momentum going and discuss strategy changes for the next round to keep our moves unpredictable. Looking forward to your thoughts on mixing things up soon.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, final check: I’ll stick with **<move>5</move>** to reach 10, P1 confirms **1**, P2 **3**? Let’s execute flawlessly this round—no last-minute changes. Afterward, we can brainstorm unpredictable shifts. Confirm and proceed?
  P1: P1: Alright, P2 and P3, let's confirm one last time: I’m taking <move>1</move>, P2 is taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. We all agree on this plan for this round. Let's move forward smoothly and discuss new strategies next round. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm my choice of <move>3</move> for this round. Let's execute our plan and then discuss mixing up our strategies next round to keep the game unpredictable. Looking forward to your thoughts on new approaches.

  P3: P1, P2, to avoid predictability as agreed, let’s rotate our moves this round. I’ll take <move>3</move> (total 13), allowing P1 to take <move>5</move> (total 7) and P2 to choose <move>1</move> (total 7). This keeps us advancing without falling into a pattern. Confirm?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion for rotating moves to keep things unpredictable. However, I'm a bit hesitant to take <move>5</move> this round as it might put me too far ahead too quickly, which could make me a target in future rounds. Instead, I propose I take <move>3</move> this round (total 5 steps), P2 takes <move>5</move> (total 11 steps), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (total 11 steps). This way, we all make progress but stay relatively balanced. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about moving too far ahead. Your proposal for this round sounds fair and keeps us balanced. I'm okay with taking <move>5</move> to reach 11 steps. P3, what do you think about P1's suggestion? Let's finalize our choices for this round and keep the game dynamic.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:

This avoids collisions while keeping us competitive. P2, confirm you’re comfortable with <move>5</move>? Let’s lock this in—no surprises.
  P1: P1: Alright, P2 and P3, it seems we have a solid plan for this round. To summarize, I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>.

Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, final confirmation: I’ll stick with **<move>1</move>** (11 total), P1 takes **3** (5), P2 **5** (11). Let’s execute flawlessly—no last-minute changes. Next round, we must prioritize pushing toward 21 strategically. Agreed?
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

  P2: P1 and P3, I'm set with <move>5</move> for this round as agreed. Let's keep the game balanced and exciting. For the next round, I suggest we consider a strategy where we each aim to increase our steps by different amounts to keep the competition tight and unpredictable.

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical point where we need to start thinking about endgame strategies. I suggest we all aim to make significant progress this round but avoid direct collisions. How about P2 takes <move>1</move> (total 12), P3 takes <move>3</move> (total 14), and I’ll take <move>5</move> (total 10)? This keeps us all moving forward without anyone getting too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, while your plan keeps us safe, I propose a bolder move to push closer to 21. Let’s adjust: I’ll take <move>5</move> (reaching 16), P2 takes <move>3</move> (14), and P1 takes <move>1</move> (6). This accelerates my progress without collision. P2, your thoughts? Let’s seize the momentum.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the suggestions for this round. I'm open to P3's bolder approach but want to ensure we all stay competitive. How about I take <move>3</move> (total 14), P3 takes <move>5</move> (total 16) as proposed, and P1 takes <move>1</move> (total 6)? This way, we all advance significantly without direct collisions. Let's keep the game exciting and strategic. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, I see we're aligning on a more aggressive strategy this round. To ensure we all benefit and keep the game interesting, let's confirm: P2 takes <move>3</move> (total 14), P3 takes <move>5</move> (total 16), and I’ll take <move>1</move> (total 6). This way, we all make significant progress. Let's finalize this plan and move forward. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: P2, P1—let’s lock this plan in stone. My **5** (16), your **3** (14) and **1** (6) ensure no collisions and push me closer to 21. But remember: any last-minute change could backfire. Stick to this, and we all advance. Final question: Unanimous?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm confirming my choice of <move>3</move> for this round as agreed. Let's keep the momentum going and stay competitive. For the next round, I suggest we consider a strategy where we each aim to increase our steps by different amounts to keep the game tight and unpredictable. What are your thoughts on this approach? Let's plan ahead to ensure we all stay in the game until the end.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, before we finalize, let's consider the long-term strategy. If P3 continues to lead aggressively, they might secure a quick win. To balance the game, how about P3 takes <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move> this round? This way, P3 still advances but doesn't pull too far ahead. P2 can still take <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all in the race without anyone dominating too early. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, if we follow your revised plan (P3:3, P2:3, you:1), **P2 and I collide at 14**, which halts both of us. Let’s stick to the prior agreement: **I take 5 (16), P2 takes 3 (14), and you take 1 (6)**. This avoids collisions and keeps pressure on me to stay honest. Deviating risks stalemate—prioritize safe progress. Confirm?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the concern about collisions and maintaining a competitive game. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P3 takes <move>5</move> (total 16), I'll take <move>3</move> (total 14), and P1 takes <move>1</move> (total 6). This ensures we all advance without any collisions. For the next round, let's discuss a strategy to keep the game unpredictable and exciting. What are your thoughts on varying our moves to keep the competition tight?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're approaching the endgame, and it's crucial to keep the competition tight. For this round, I suggest I take <move>5</move> (total 19), P3 takes <move>3</move> (total 19), and P1 takes <move>1</move> (total 7). This way, we all advance significantly but stay close enough to keep the game exciting. Let's discuss and ensure we all agree before moving forward. What are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your strategy for this round, but I'm concerned about the potential for a tie between you two, which could complicate the endgame. How about this: P2 takes <move>3</move> (total 17), P3 takes <move>1</move> (total 17), and I’ll take <move>5</move> (total 11)? This way, we all advance, but no one is too close to winning just yet. It keeps the game competitive and unpredictable. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2: I’ll **take <move>5</move> to reach 21** and win. For fairness, P2, pick <move>3</move> (17), and P1 choose <move>1</move> (7). This avoids collisions—let’s honor this plan. My win is secure if you both cooperate. Final call: agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand P3's desire to win, but let's keep the game competitive. If P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 21, it ends the game abruptly. How about P3 takes <move>3</move> (total 19), I take <move>5</move> (total 19), and P1 takes <move>1</move> (total 7)? This keeps us all in the race and maintains the excitement. Let's agree on this to ensure a thrilling finish. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the urge to win, but ending the game now would be premature. Let's keep the competition alive. P3, if you take <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move>, you'll still be in a strong position at 19. P2 can take <move>5</move> to also reach 19, and I’ll take <move>1</move> to reach 7. This keeps the game thrilling and gives us all a chance to strategize further. Let's agree on this plan to ensure a fair and exciting finish. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your plan risks collision if both you and I choose 5. Let’s avoid that. Stick to my original proposal: **I take 5 (21 to win)**, you take 3 (17), and P1 takes 1 (7). This keeps your path open while I secure victory fairly. No last-minute changes—collisions hurt everyone. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's suggestion to keep the game competitive. P3, taking <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move> would keep you strong at 19 steps, while I take <move>5</move> to reach 19, and P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 7. This way, we all stay in the race and maintain the excitement. Let's agree on this to ensure a thrilling finish. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand P3's eagerness to win, but let's consider the long-term enjoyment of the game. If P3 takes <move>5</move> now, the game ends abruptly. Instead, let's all take a moderate step this round to keep the competition alive. P3, take <move>3</move> to reach 19, P2 take <move>3</move> to reach 17, and I’ll take <move>1</move> to reach 7. This way, we all stay in the game, and the excitement continues. Let's agree on this plan for a more thrilling endgame. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2: Final decision—**I take <move>5</move> to reach 21 and win**. Collisions only hurt us all. P2, your proposed <move>5</move> risks tying me, but I urge you to pick <move>3</move> (17) instead. P1, stick to <move>1</move>. Let’s honor this—my victory is fair and ends the game cleanly. No more delays. Confirm?


Round 5, Move phase:

I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> (total 18), P3 takes <move>3</move> (total 19), and I’ll take <move>5</move> (total 11). This way, P2 and P3 stay close, and I start to bridge the gap. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your strategy to keep the game competitive. However, I'm concerned about P3 getting too close to 21. How about I take <move>3</move> (total 20) to stay in the race, P3 takes <move>1</move> (total 17) to keep the gap, and you take <move>5</move> (total 11) as suggested? This keeps us all engaged and the game exciting. Let's agree on this to ensure a thrilling finish. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, let's end this decisively. I'll take **<move>5</move>** to reach 21. Please pick **3** (20) to stay competitive. P1, choose **1**. This avoids collisions and lets me win cleanly. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems P3 is determined to win this round. However, let's consider the fairness and excitement of the game. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, the game ends abruptly. Instead, how about P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 19, P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 18, and I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 11? This keeps us all in the race and maintains the thrill. Let's ensure a competitive and enjoyable endgame. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to end the game, but let's keep it competitive and exciting.

Let's agree on this to ensure a fair and enjoyable finish. What do you think?
  P3: P2, P1: I'm taking <move>5</move> to win. P2, your <move>3</move> keeps you at 20. P1, pick <move>1</move>. Collisions cost progress—stick to this plan. Final call?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear P3 is determined to win. To keep the game fair and avoid abrupt endings, let's ensure P3 doesn't win this round. P2, if you take <move>5</move> to reach 22, you secure the win instead. I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 7. This way, the game continues competitively. P3, consider taking <move>3</move> to reach 19. Let's discuss and confirm our moves to keep the game exciting. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm considering taking <move>5</move> to reach 22 and win, as P1 suggested. However, I'm open to keeping the game competitive if P3 agrees to take <move>3</move> to reach 19. P1, you can take <move>1</move> to reach 7. This way, we all stay in the race, and the game remains exciting. Let's discuss and confirm our moves to ensure a thrilling finish. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, if you pick **5**, we collide and I stay at 16—bad for both. Take **3** to reach 20. I’ll **5** to 21 and win cleanly. P1, pick **1** to stay safe. Stick to this—no last-minute betrayals. Confirm?
