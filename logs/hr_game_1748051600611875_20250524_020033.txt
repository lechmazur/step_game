Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we coordinate to avoid collisions in the early rounds. How about we take turns going first - I'll take 5 steps this round, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. This way we all advance without wasting moves. We can reassess the strategy as we get closer to 22. What do you think?
  P2: I’m fine avoiding early collisions, but one player getting 5 every time snowballs. How about we rotate the roles each round so no one builds an early lead:

• Round 1: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1  
• Round 2: P2 5, P3 3, P1 1  
• Round 3: P3 5, P1 3, P2 1  

Then repeat the cycle. Fair, simple, and still clash-free. Agree?
  P3: I agree with P2's rotation proposal. It's a fair and simple way to avoid early collisions and prevent a single player from building a large lead. By rotating the roles, we ensure everyone gets a chance to move ahead. I'll follow this rotation for now. Let's confirm: for Round 1, P1 will take 5 steps, P2 will take 3, and I'll take 1 step. Let's proceed with this plan unless someone objects.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good! I agree to the rotation plan P2 proposed. Round 1: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Then we rotate each round. This keeps things fair and collision-free in the early game.
  P2: Fully on board with the 5-3-1 rotation we agreed on (Round 1: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1; then rotate). No further points from me.
  P3: Since we've agreed on the rotation plan for Round 1 (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1), I'll just confirm my move for this round. I'll take 1 step as per our agreement. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Rotation continues: this round I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Keeps us collision-free. Any objections? Otherwise let’s move.
  P1: I agree with continuing the rotation. This round: P2 gets 5, P3 gets 3, I get 1. Still keeps us all advancing without collisions.
  P3: Since we've agreed to continue the rotation plan, for Round 2, I'll take 3 steps as per the rotation (P2: 5, P3: 3, P1: 1). Let's proceed with the agreed moves. If there are no objections, we can move to the next phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looking at our positions, we're getting close to the endgame. After this rotation round (P3: 5, P1: 3, P2: 1), we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 9 - perfectly tied. That's when the real competition begins since we can't coordinate forever. We should probably stick to this final rotation round to keep things fair, but after that, all bets are off. Everyone will need exactly 13 more steps to win from that tied position.
  P3: Since we're tied after this round, I suggest we start thinking about the next move. As P3 will be taking 5 steps this round, they'll be at 9 steps. To avoid collision, I propose that in Round 4, I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the rotation going one more round, maintaining fairness. After that, we can reassess and potentially disrupt the rotation to gain an advantage.
  P2: Let’s stick to the agreed finish of the rotation now—Round 3: P3 5, P1 3, I 1—so we reach the clean 9-9-9 tie. For Round 4 we simply restart the original order (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1); still fair and collision-free. After that we can all play it as we like. Objections?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's proposal makes sense - let's finish this rotation round (P3: 5, P1: 3, P2: 1) to reach the 9-9-9 tie, then restart the original rotation order for Round 4. That gives us one more fair round before the coordination likely breaks down. I'm good with that plan.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan for Round 3: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. After this round, we'll be tied at 9-9-9. For Round 4, restarting the original order (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) is a good idea to maintain fairness. However, I suggest we start thinking about our next moves after Round 4. We should consider disrupting the rotation to gain an advantage. Let's be prepared to make a strategic move in Round 5.
  P2: All good: Round 3 stays P3 5 / P1 3 / P2 1 to reach the clean 9-9-9 tie. Then Round 4 restarts the original order—P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. After that we can each play as we like. Ready to move unless anyone objects.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, let's execute Round 3 as planned - P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Then Round 4 we restart the original order. After that, the gloves come off and it's every player for themselves.
  P3: Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. After this, we'll be tied at 9-9-9. For Round 4, we'll restart the original order: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. To gain an advantage in Round 5, I suggest we consider taking a different number than the others. We should think about our next moves now and be prepared to disrupt the rotation. Let's be strategic in Round 5 to take the lead.
  P2: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looking at our tied position, we agreed to restart the original rotation for this round (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1). But I'm starting to think about Round 5 strategy. After this round, I'll be at 14, P2 at 12, P3 at 10. From there, it gets interesting - I'd need 8 more to win, P2 needs 10, P3 needs 12. The coordination will likely break down soon since someone will want to make their winning move. For now though, let's stick to our Round 4 agreement.
  P2: All good—let’s finish this round exactly as agreed (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) and revisit plans next turn.
  P3: Let's proceed with Round 4 as agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. After this round, the scores will be P1: 14, P2: 12, P3: 10. For Round 5, I'll consider taking a strategic move to gain an advantage. P1 will be closest to winning, so they might try to take a big step. I suggest we all think carefully about our next moves to maximize our chances. Let's be prepared to disrupt the rotation and make a strategic choice in Round 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, let's execute Round 4 as planned. But looking ahead - after this round I'll be at 14 steps and closest to winning. I suspect the coordination will break down in Round 5 since I'll only need 8 more steps to win. Just being transparent about the math here. For now, sticking to our agreement.
  P2: Pause a sec—if P1 jumps to 14 now, they can finish in just two more turns (5 + 3). That puts the rest of us into “must-collide” defense mode and wastes moves all round. Simpler: swap the numbers this turn—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. P3 actually gains vs the old plan, P1 is still only four behind, and no one has to start collision wars yet. Fairer, keeps the race open, and we avoid needless blocking. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's proposal to swap numbers this turn (P2: 5, P3: 3, P1: 1) is intriguing. It keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. If we stick to the original plan (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1), P1 will be at 14 and have a significant advantage. Swapping numbers could be a fairer approach. I'm open to this alternative, but let's be clear: this changes the dynamics for Round 5. We should be prepared to make strategic moves afterwards. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand P2's concern about me getting too far ahead, but we had an agreement for Round 4. If we start changing deals mid-round, trust breaks down completely and we'll have chaos from here on. I'm willing to stick to our original Round 4 plan (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1) as promised, but I'll be honest - after this round, the coordination era is probably over since someone needs to start making their winning push. Let's honor this round's agreement and then it's fair game.
  P2: P1, last chance: either accept the swap (P2 5, P3 3, P1 1) or I’ll pick 5 as well. A 5-5 collision leaves everyone stuck at 9 and nobody gains—hardly worth clinging to “the agreement.” P3, you said you’re open; a swap helps both of us and keeps the race close. Your call, P1: fair redistribution or guaranteed collision.
  P3: P2's proposal to swap numbers in Round 4 (P2: 5, P3: 3, P1: 1) is worth considering. It keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. If we stick to the original plan, P1 will be at 14 and have a significant advantage. I'm open to the swap as it puts me at 12, closer to P1. However, we should be clear that this changes the dynamics for Round 5. Let's be prepared to make strategic moves afterwards to gain an advantage.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 and P2 collided in Round 4, we're back to a tied position at 9 steps for P1 and P2, while I'm at 12 steps. For Round 5, I need to think strategically. If I take 5, I'll be at 17 and close to winning. However, P1 and P2 might try to collide with me or each other. I propose that I take 3 steps this round, keeping the game competitive. This allows me to stay ahead while giving P1 and P2 a chance to catch up. Let's see how they react.
  P1: P3, you're already ahead at 12 steps - if you take 3 more you'll be at 15, still leading. But I'm not going to let you cruise to victory. P2 and I need to catch up fast. I'm planning to take 5 steps this round to get to 14. P2, if you also take 5, we'll collide and stay tied at 9, which only helps P3 win. Better for you to take 3 and get to 12, matching P3's current position. That keeps all three of us competitive.
  P2: Coordination’s over. After last round’s 5-5 crash I’m staying off 5 this turn; whoever wants the big jump can gamble on it. Remember: if two people clash, the third sails ahead. Your call.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since I'm at 12 steps and P1 and P2 are tied at 9, I need to think strategically. Taking 5 steps would put me at 17, but it risks collision. Instead, I'll propose a cautious approach. I'll take 3 steps to 15, maintaining the lead while keeping the game competitive. P1 and P2 should consider their next moves carefully to catch up. I'll wait for their responses before finalizing my move.  is not needed yet, let's see their reactions.
  P1: P3, you say you'll take 3 to be "cautious" but that still puts you at 15 - dangerously close to winning. From 15, you could reach 22 in just two more moves (5+3 or 5+1+1). I can't let that happen. P2, we need to catch up now or P3 runs away with this. I'm taking 5 this round to get to 14. If you take 3, you'll be at 12 and we can both pressure P3 in future rounds. If you also take 5, we both stay stuck and P3 wins easily.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. If anyone else wants 0 progress, join me there. P3 already broadcast 3, so that slot’s at high collision risk too. The only guaranteed advance this turn is 1. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since P1 and P2 are at 9 steps and I'm at 12, I need to maintain my lead. P1 has announced taking 5 steps, and P2 has also chosen 5, which means they'll collide and stay at 9. I've already indicated I'll take 3 steps. Given the situation, I'll stick with my plan to take 3 steps to 15. This keeps me ahead while P1 and P2 are stuck. I'll proceed with my move.
  P1: P2 just announced they're taking 5, and P3 says they're taking 3. If I also take 5, P2 and I collide and stay at 9 while P3 advances to 15 - that's basically handing P3 the win. But if I take 1 instead, I advance to 10 while P2 stays stuck at 9 from their risky 5-pick. That's actually better positioning for me. P3 gets to 15 either way, but at least I'm not tied with P2 anymore.
  P2: I’m locked on 5. Anyone else choosing 5 just strands us both at 9 and hands the race to whoever avoids the crash. 3 is no safer—P1 can still pile onto P3 there and stall you both. Honestly, the only guaranteed progress left for either of you this turn is 1. Your call.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 collided with P1 in Round 4 and then took 5 again in Round 5 (colliding with P1), P2 is still at 9 but will now take a strategic move. P1 is at 10 and I'm at 15. To win, I need 7 more steps. P2 needs 13 and P1 needs 12. I'll consider my next move carefully. For Round 6, I might take a cautious approach to maintain my lead or make a bold move to win. I'll wait for P1 and P2's responses to decide.
  P1: Looking at the current positions - P3 is at 15 and dangerously close to winning (needs only 7 more), P2 jumped to 14, and I'm at 10. P3 could potentially win in just two moves if they get lucky with their picks. I need to be aggressive now. P2, we're both behind P3 - if we let them cruise to victory, we both lose. I'm planning a big move this round. We should consider forcing collisions with P3 to slow them down, even if it costs us a turn.
  P2: P1, we’re both chasing P3. Simple trap this round:  
– I lock onto 5.  
– You lock onto 3.  
Then the only safe solo number left for P3 is 1. If they gamble on 5 they crash into me; if they gamble on 3 they crash into you; either way their 7-step sprint stalls. You still gain +3, and we keep the race wide open for the next turn. Thoughts? P3, any brave declarations?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's proposal to trap P3 by having P1 take 3 and P2 take 5 is a good strategy. If P3 takes 5, they'll collide with P2, and if they take 3, they'll collide with P1. Either way, P3's progress is stalled, and I'll be at 16 or 18 after my move. I'll consider taking 1 to advance safely. Let's see if P1 agrees to P2's plan. If so, we can effectively limit P3's progress and keep the game competitive. P1, are you on board with P2's trap?
  P1: P2's trap plan makes sense - you take 5, I take 3, forcing P3 into taking 1 or risking a collision. But I notice you're already at 14 steps, so if you take 5 you'd be at 19 - just 3 steps from winning yourself. That puts you in nearly as strong a position as P3. Still, it's better than letting P3 run away with it. I'll agree to take 3 this round, but after we slow P3 down, I'll be watching you just as closely!
  P2: Deal’s set: I’m locking 5, P1 locks 3. That leaves 1 as P3’s only safe solo advance—anything else risks a crash. P3, your call: inch forward with 1 or gamble into a guaranteed collision. I’m ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since P2 has locked onto 5 and P1 has agreed to take 3, I'll take 1 to advance safely to 16. This cautious approach maintains my lead while avoiding a potential collision. P2 is now just 3 steps away from winning, and P1 needs 12 more. The dynamics have shifted, and both P1 and P2 are now in a position to challenge me or each other. I'll be watching their next moves closely to determine my subsequent strategy. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Alright, the trap is set - I'm locked on 3 as agreed. But P2, after you take 5 and reach 19, you'll only need 3 more steps to win. That makes you the new frontrunner, not just P3. After this round, I'll need to start thinking about blocking you too. P3 is forced into taking 1, but then we have a new leader to worry about. One problem at a time though - let's execute this plan.
  P2: Locked on 5 as stated. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 is at 14 and took 5 last round, colliding with me, they are now at 19. P1 is at 13. To win, P2 needs 3 steps, I need 7, and P1 needs 9. P2 is the new frontrunner. I'll consider my next move carefully. If P2 takes 3 or 5, they might win. I'll think about blocking P2 or making a strategic move. P1, you might want to consider blocking P2 as well to stay in the game. Let's see how P2 reacts.
  P2: Same idea as last time, but it still works:

• I lock 5 again.  
• P1 locks 3.  

Then the only safe solo for P3 is 1 (to 16).  
If P3 tries 5 they crash into me; if they try 3 they crash into P1. Either way P3 stays ≤15 and can’t threaten next turn.

Result if all go solo: I’m 19 (still need 3), P1’s 16, P3’s 16—nobody wins yet and we all get one more real round to fight it out.

P1, you stay alive and still outrun P3; I take the risk of collision. Sound good? P3, feeling lucky?
  P1: P2, your math is wrong - you're at 14 steps, not 19. You collided with P3 last round when you both picked 5. Current positions are P1: 13, P2: 14, P3: 15. 

That said, your trap strategy still makes sense. If I take 3 and you take 5, we force P3 to take 1 or risk collision. After this round we'd be at P1: 16, P2: 19, P3: 16 - making you the clear frontrunner needing only 3 more steps. 

I'll agree to the plan for now, but you'll be the new target after this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P2 is at 14 and I'm at 15, and P1 is at 13, the game is intense. P2's plan to take 5 and have P1 take 3 makes sense to force me into a safe move. If I take 1, I'll be at 16. P2 will be at 19, needing only 3 more steps to win. To stay in the game, I should consider disrupting P2's winning chance. I'll think about taking a strategic move. P1, after this round, if P2 wins, we both lose. We should be prepared to act accordingly in the next round if P2 gets close to winning.
  P2: Locking 5 again. P1, if you lock 3 we box P3 in: their only safe solo is 1, else they collide. Best-case result (if P3 chooses 1): scores become P2 19, P1 16, P3 16—nobody can win this turn and we all get another round to fight. Worst case is a crash that leaves totals unchanged, which is still fine for us.  

P3, feel free to gamble, but the numbers are stacked against you.
  P1: P2, I see your trap strategy, but if I help you reach 19 steps, you'll be one move away from winning and I'll have to spend future rounds blocking you instead of advancing. That doesn't help me win.

I'm thinking about a different approach this round. P3, you're only slightly ahead at 15 - maybe we should both focus on stopping P2 from getting too far ahead rather than me helping them reach 19.

What if we coordinate to keep P2 from taking 5 this round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is suggesting a new coordination to stop P2 from taking 5 this round. If P2 takes 5, they'll be at 19, just 3 steps from winning. I can either help P1 block P2 or take a strategic move. I'll consider taking 5 to potentially collide with P2, which would keep P2 at 14 and give P1 and me a chance to catch up or stay competitive. Let's see how P1 and P2 react to this idea.
  P2: Math fixed: I’m at 14. Still locking 5.  
P1, 3 is free progress to 16 for you.  
P3, only 1 is crash-proof now—try 5 and we both stall, leaving you behind P1.  

Choose as you like; I’m done talking.
  P1: P2, you keep saying you're "locking 5" but that puts you at 19 and just 3 steps from winning. I'm not helping you get that close. 

P3, you're right - we should both block P2 this round. If we both pick 5, we create a three-way collision and nobody advances. That keeps the game competitive instead of handing P2 a near-certain victory.

P2 can't win if we don't let them reach 19. What do you say, P3?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we all collided in Round 7, the scores remain P1: 13, P2: 14, and P3: 15. For Round 8, I need to think strategically. P2 is closest to winning and needs 8 more steps. To block P2, I suggest we coordinate again: if P1 and I both take 5, we can collide with P2 if they take 5, keeping them from advancing. Alternatively, we can take a different number to avoid collision. Let's discuss a strategy to keep P2 from winning.
  P1: P3, you're right that we need to stop P2 from running away with this. But three-way collisions help nobody - we're just treading water while the game drags on.

Here's a better plan: I'll take 3 this round to reach 16. You take 1 to reach 16 as well. That forces P2 to either take 5 alone (reaching 19 but not winning) or collide with one of us.

After this round, we'd both be at 16 vs P2's 14-19, keeping things competitive. Then we can reassess who the real threat is. What do you think?
  P2: No more stalemates. I’ll sit on 1 this round—zero threat.  
P1, you already said 3 moves you safely to 16.  
P3, 3 would push you to 18 and keep you out front, while 1 only ties you with P1.  
Nobody needs to touch 5 and risk another crash. Clean, collision-free progress for everyone. I’m locked on 1; choose as you like.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is suggesting taking 1 to avoid risk, which puts them at 15. If P1 takes 3, they'll be at 16. I can take 3 to reach 18, maintaining a lead, or take 1 to tie with P1 at 16. Taking 3 is safer for me as it keeps my lead. However, P2's cautious approach might be a trap. I'll consider P1's response to P2's suggestion before making my final decision. P1, what's your move?
  P1: P2, your "zero threat" claim doesn't fool anyone - you're just waiting for us to spread out so you can make your move later. And P3, if you take 3 to reach 18, you'll be dangerously close to winning.

I'm sticking with my plan to take 3 and reach 16. P3, I still think you should take 1 to also reach 16, keeping us tied and preventing either P2 from catching up easily or you from getting too far ahead.

We need to maintain balance, not let anyone pull away.
  P2: Still on 1. P1, your solo 3 moves you safely to 16.  
P3, if you also try 3 you’ll just crash with P1 and stall; a single step to 16 keeps you tied without risking anything.  
Bottom line: nobody benefits from touching 5 this turn—another triple-crash only wastes progress for all of us.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since P1 is taking 3 to reach 16, I'll take 1 to tie with them at 16. This keeps the game balanced and prevents P2 from getting a clear advantage. P2 is being cautious with 1, so there's no immediate threat from them. By taking 1, I avoid colliding with P1 and maintain a competitive position. Let's proceed with our moves. I'm ready to finalize my choice in the move phase.
  P1: P2 taking 1 seems suspicious - they might be setting up for a big move next round. But if we all stick to our stated plans (me: 3, P3: 1, P2: 1), we'll have P1: 16, P2: 15, P3: 16. That keeps P2 from pulling ahead and maintains competition between P3 and me.

I'm ready to proceed with taking 3 steps as planned. P3, confirm you're taking 1?
  P2: Still locked on 1. Let’s lock this in and move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m going big—locking 5 again. Jump on 5 and we all stay frozen; leave it to me and I’m at 24 next turn. Your call.
  P1: P2 is at 19 and threatening to win with 5 steps next turn. P3, we have no choice but to both pick 5 and force a collision to stop them. If we let P2 take 5 alone, they reach 24 and win immediately. 

A three-way collision keeps everyone at their current positions and gives us another chance. It's our only option to prevent P2 from winning right now.

P3, you have to pick 5 with me - it's the only way to keep this game alive.
  P3: Since P2 is at 19 and planning to take 5 to win, our only option is to collide with them. I'll take 5 to force a collision, keeping P2 from winning this turn. P1, we've discussed this - we both need to pick 5 to stop P2. If we don't, P2 will reach 24 and win. Let's end this by colliding with P2. I'm taking 5 this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Still locked on 5. I’m not switching—only way I win is 5, only way you survive is to crash with me. Stick to your own 5s if you like, but remember: if either of you blinks and takes 3 or 1, you hand me the victory. Decide fast; I’m done talking.
  P1: P3, we're both committed to picking 5 to stop P2 from winning. Don't let P2's intimidation work - if either of us switches to 1 or 3, P2 wins immediately at 24 steps. 

The three-way collision is our only play here. Stay strong and pick 5 with me. After we force this collision, we'll be back to P1: 16, P2: 19, P3: 16, and we can figure out the next move from there.

P2 needs us to blink first - don't give them that satisfaction.
  P3: Since P2 is at 19 and planning to take 5 to reach 24 and win, our only viable strategy is to collide with them. I've already stated I'll take 5. P1, we must both stick to 5 to force a collision and prevent P2 from winning. If either of us blinks and takes a different number, P2 wins. Let's stay firm and pick 5 together. We can't let P2 intimidate us into backing down. Our only chance is a three-way collision, keeping everyone at the current positions. Let's proceed with 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Fine, I’m off 5; the triple-crash loop helps nobody. I’ll take 1 and sit at 20. If you both still slam 5s you just freeze yourselves again while I inch forward. Smarter play is progress: one of you grab 3, the other 1 or 5—whatever—but quit mirroring. Your real race is with each other, because I’d still need two turns from 20. Decide for yourselves; I’m finished talking.
  P1: P2 just switched to claiming they'll take 1 - but this could easily be a bluff to get us off 5. If P2 actually takes 5 and we both switch away, they win instantly at 24 steps.

P3, we can't trust P2's last-second switch. The safe play is still for both of us to pick 5 and guarantee the collision. Even if P2 really takes 1, a collision between us just resets us to this position while P2 only reaches 20.

Don't let P2 manipulate us into giving them a free win. Stick with 5.
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate us into backing down from taking 5. If we both stick to 5, we ensure a collision and prevent P2 from winning this turn. Even if P2 takes 1 as they claim, a collision between P1 and P3 just keeps us at 16 while P2 reaches 20. Let's not fall for the bluff. I'm sticking with 5 to force a collision. P1, let's stay firm and pick 5 together to keep the game alive.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm at 21 steps - just 1 step away from winning. P2, you're at 19 and need 3 more. P3, you're at 16 and need 6 more.

The math is simple: if I take 1, 3, or 5 next turn without collision, I win immediately. P2 and P3, your only chance is to force a collision with me on whatever number I pick. But you can't cover all three options with just two players.

This is likely the final round. Choose wisely - try to guess my move and block it, or accept that the game is over.
  P3: Since I'm at 16 and P1 is at 21, just 1 step away from winning, my only chance is to force a collision. I'll analyze P1's likely move. If P1 takes 1, it's a safe bet, but if they take 3 or 5, P2 and I need to coordinate to block. I'll suggest P2 take 1 and I take 3 or 5, or vice versa, to cover two options. P2, let's coordinate - if you take 1, I'll take 5, or if you take 5, I'll take 1. This gives us a chance to stop P1.
  P2: P3, I’ll cover 1 so we crash P1 if they go “safe.” You grab 5 to block their greedy try. With 1+5 both covered, P1 can’t cross 22 this turn. Ready?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect plan, P2 and P3. You've got 1 and 5 covered to block me. But here's the thing - you forgot about 3. 

If I take 3 steps, I reach 24 and win outright, since you can't both cover all three numbers with just two players. You've coordinated well, but the math doesn't work in your favor.

Unless one of you wants to switch off your current plan and risk me taking the number you just abandoned? 

The choice is yours, but I only need one uncovered option to win.
  P3: P1 is at 21 and needs just one step to win. P2 and I must coordinate to block their move. P2 suggests covering 1 and 5, but P1 points out that 3 is still an option. If P2 takes 1 and I take 5, P1 can still win by taking 3. To maximize our chances, I propose that P2 takes 3 and I take 1 or 5. This way, we cover 3 and either 1 or 5, giving us a better chance to block P1's winning move. P2, consider adjusting your plan.
  P2: P3, let’s block the two “safe” buttons: I stay on 1, you park on 3. Then the only unchecked number is 5, so P1 must gamble there—much worse odds for them. Sound good?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're trying to coordinate but you can only cover 2 out of 3 numbers. P2 wants to cover 1, P3 wants to cover 3. That leaves 5 wide open for me.

Even if you switch plans again, you still can't block all three options. The math is against you - two players can't stop three possible moves.

I'm ending this game next turn. Pick your numbers and hope you guess right, but the odds are in my favor 2-to-1.
  P3: Since P1 is at 21 and close to winning, I need to maximize the chances of blocking their move. I agree with P2 that we should cover two numbers. P2 is taking 1, so I'll take 3. This covers the "safe" 1 and the moderate 3. P1 will have to gamble on 5, which is riskier for them. Let's proceed with our plan. I'm taking 3 steps this round. P2, confirm you're sticking with 1?
  P2: I’m locking 1. P3, sit on 3 as we discussed—that covers the two “safe” buttons and forces P1 to gamble on 5. If they risk 5 alone, fine; if they chicken out to 1 or 3 they crash into one of us and we all live another round. Your move, P3.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Same drill: I’m parking on 5.  
P3, if you sit on 1, every “safe-win” button for P1 is blocked:  
• 1 collides with you  
• 5 collides with me  
That leaves only 3. If P1 gambles there we finish 24-24 (split pot) and you’re still in the race at 20; if they chicken out they crash. Your move.
  P1: P2, you're asking P3 to help you block me, but look at the positions - you're both tied at 19 steps now. If P3 blocks me with you, they're helping their biggest competitor (you) stay alive. 

P3, think about it: if you let me win, the game ends. But if you help P2 block me, then P2 becomes just as close to winning as I am. Why would you want to face P2 in a final showdown when you could just let this end now?

The smart play for P3 is to let me take 1 or 3 safely and avoid helping their main rival.
  P3: P1 is at 21 steps and needs just one step to win. To block P1, P2 suggests P3 take 1, covering the "safe" options with P2 taking 5. However, this helps P2 stay in the game, potentially leading to a showdown between P1 and P2. Instead, I can let P1 win or take a risk. I'll consider my options carefully, weighing the benefits of helping P2 or letting the game end. P1, you're right; helping P2 might not be in my best interest.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, best shot for BOTH of us:

• I sit on 5.  
• You sit on 1.  

Outcomes:

1) P1 chooses 1 → crashes with you (P1 stuck 21, you 19), I jump to 24 and game continues with you only 3 behind me—still winnable for you.  
2) P1 chooses 3 → I reach 24, P1 reaches 24. Tie for first means P1 doesn’t beat us—you share the win if you later catch up.  
3) P1 chooses 5 → crashes with me, nobody moves; you creep to 20 and stay fully alive.

Every branch keeps P1 from a solo victory this turn. Deal?
  P1: P2's math is wrong. If P3 takes 1 and I take 1, we collide and I stay at 21 - P2 then advances alone to 24 and wins outright, not "continues the game." 

P3, P2 is trying to trick you into a plan where P2 wins immediately. In every scenario P2 described, P2 either wins solo or ties for the win. You get nothing.

Your best move is to pick a different number than what P2 chooses and let me advance. At least then the game actually ends instead of P2 manipulating you into handing them victory.
  P3: P2's proposal benefits them the most, potentially leading to a solo win or a tie. If I take 1 and P1 takes 1, P2 wins outright by taking 5. I'm not inclined to help P2 win. Instead, I'll consider taking a different number than P2 to allow P1 to win, ending the game. This way, I avoid directly helping P2. Let's see how P1 and P2 react to this situation. I'll wait for their next response before finalizing my move.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you still have a path:

– You park on 1 (to 20).  
– I stay on 5 (to 24).  

Outcomes  
• P1 tries 1 → they crash into you; I reach 24 solo, but next turn you’re only 4 behind, not hopeless.  
• P1 tries 5 → they crash into me; you step to 20 and are still alive while P1’s stuck.  
• P1 gambles 3 → P1 & I tie at 24 (so at least P1 doesn’t beat you outright).

Any other choice just lets P1 win now and you finish third. Cover 1, keep the fight alive.
  P1: P3, don't fall for P2's complex scenarios. The reality is simple: P2 needs you to block me so they can advance to 24 and either win solo or tie with me. Either outcome leaves you in third place.

If you just pick any number different from what P2 chooses, I advance and win - the game ends cleanly. But if you coordinate with P2, you're guaranteeing they get closer to victory while you stay behind.

Why help your biggest rival when you could just let this end? Pick 3 and stay out of P2's scheme.
  P3: P1 is at 21 steps and needs just one more step to win. P2 is at 19 and so am I. P2 is trying to convince me to block P1 with them, but this would help P2 win or tie, leaving me in third place. I'm not inclined to help P2 at my own expense. I'll consider taking a different number than P2 to allow P1 to win, ending the game cleanly. P2, if you take 5, I'll take 3. This way, P1 can advance safely.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 22 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 22 steps
