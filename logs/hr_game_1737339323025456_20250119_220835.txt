Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s keep it simple this round and avoid collisions so everyone can advance. How about I choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5? That way, no one blocks anyone else. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5, so none of us collide. Good luck!
  P3: <stop>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: We messed up last round. Let’s each pick different moves to avoid collisions: P2 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, P3 picks 5. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I’m still at zero, so I’d really appreciate some cooperation. Let’s do this clearly: I’ll go 5, P2 goes 1, and P3 goes 3. That way nobody collides, and we can all move safely. If we keep blocking each other, P3 stays in the lead anyway, so this plan seems good for everyone. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I’m serious about avoiding collisions now. Let’s finalize the plan from before: I’ll choose 5, P2 goes 1, and P3 goes 3, so we all move safely this round. Any objections or better ideas?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let’s finalize the plan: I go 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, so we all can advance. Please don’t block me again!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: We need to stop letting P3 stay so far ahead. Let’s each choose differently: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That helps me catch up to you, P2, while still moving you forward. If we collide, we only slow ourselves down and let P3 maintain the lead. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: We can’t let P3 run away with this. If they pick 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5, nobody collides and we all move forward. That helps me catch up a bit while still giving P2 a decent step. It’s in our interest not to collide with each other, so let’s finalize this plan. Any objections? If not, let’s stick with these picks.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3 is just 4 steps away from winning. P2, let’s coordinate: if P3 tries 5, we both pick 5 too, so nobody moves and P3 can’t win this turn. If P3 picks 1 or 3, let’s avoid collisions ourselves so we can both advance. This way, P3 won’t get a free win, and I get a fair chance to catch up. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3 is only 4 steps away from winning. If P3 tries 5, let’s both pick 5 too so nobody moves. If P3 goes 1 or 3, we should avoid colliding with each other so we both advance and keep P3 from pulling away further.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: We must prevent P3 from winning. If they choose 5, let’s both pick 5 again so nobody moves. If P3 goes for 1 or 3, we should avoid bumping into each other so we both advance and keep closing the gap. Let’s coordinate and turn this around together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, if P3 attempts 5 again, we both pick 5 to block. If P3 picks 3 or 1, let's coordinate so we don’t collide and both advance. For instance, if P3 goes 3, I’ll pick 5 and you pick 1, or if P3 goes 1, I’ll pick 3 and you pick 5. That way, we keep P3 from winning and both move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, we must keep blocking P3 if they attempt 5. If P3 goes 5, let’s both pick 5 again. If they try 1 or 3, we avoid colliding so we both advance. For example, if P3 picks 3, I choose 5 and you choose 1; if P3 picks 1, I choose 3 and you choose 5. That way P3 can’t jump to victory, and we both gain steps. Let’s hold strong until we can catch up and potentially overtake them.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3 is on the verge of winning. P2, please don’t give up on blocking. If P3 goes 5, let’s both pick 5 again so no one moves. If P3 goes 1 or 3, you and I should coordinate to avoid colliding and both advance. This is our best shot to stop P3 while we catch up. Stick with me here, and eventually we can both be in winning range, rather than handing P3 an easy victory. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: If P3 goes 5, we both pick 5 again to block their win. If they go 1 or 3, we avoid colliding so we both advance. For example, if they pick 1, I’ll go 3 and you go 5; if they pick 3, I’ll go 5 and you go 1. That’s our best shot to stop P3 and close the gap. Let’s do it!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let’s continue blocking P3 if they pick 5. If P3 goes 5, we both choose 5 so nobody gains steps. If they pick 1 or 3, we must avoid colliding and both move forward. For instance, if P3 chooses 1, I’ll go 3 and you go 5; if P3 chooses 3, I’ll pick 5 and you pick 1. That way, we hold P3 back while we both gain ground. Let’s stay united.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let’s keep that solid blockade against P3 if they pick 5—both of us choose 5 so nobody moves. Otherwise, if P3 chooses 1 or 3, we coordinate to avoid collisions and both advance. Let’s hold them at 15 while we catch up.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Time is running out. P2, let’s maintain our blockade strategy if P3 attempts 5, keeping them at 15 while we catch up. If P3 picks 1 or 3, we coordinate so we both advance. For instance, if P3 picks 1, I’ll choose 3 and you go 5. If P3 picks 3, I’ll pick 5 and you pick 1. That way, we close the gap together. Let’s not give P3 an easy win.
  P2: <stop>

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, we must stay united. If P3 tries 5 again, let’s both pick 5 to block them. If P3 picks 1 or 3, we coordinate so neither of us collides—with me choosing 3 if P3 picks 1 (and you picking 5), or me picking 5 if P3 picks 3 (and you picking 1). That way, we keep P3 stuck at 15 and both move forward when possible. Let’s do this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let’s stay consistent. If P3 goes 5, we both pick 5 again to block. If P3 chooses 1 or 3, let’s coordinate so we both advance without colliding. This way we keep P3 at 15 and gradually close the gap. We’ve come too far to let P3 win now. What do you say?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let’s keep blocking P3 if they choose 5—both of us pick 5, so nobody moves. If P3 picks 3, I’ll choose 5 and you pick 1; if P3 picks 1, I’ll pick 3 and you choose 5. This way, we prevent P3 from jumping to 19 while we both advance whenever possible. I know I’m far behind, but sticking to this strategy is our best chance to stop P3 and eventually catch up. Let’s work together and see if we can turn this around.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, we must keep P3 from reaching 19. If they choose 5, let’s both pick 5 to block. If P3 picks 1 or 3, we should coordinate so we both advance without collisions. I know I’m at zero, but if we stay united, we can hold P3 at 15 and gradually gain ground. We’ve come this far—let’s maintain our plan a bit longer and see if we can catch up.


Round 11, Move phase:

  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, we must stay unified. If P3 picks 5, we both choose 5 to block. If P3 picks 1 or 3, we coordinate so neither of us collides, and we both advance—ideally, I’ll pick 5 and you pick 1 (or vice versa). If you keep ignoring this plan, you risk letting P3 slip by and win. I’m still at zero, so I need a fair shot to catch up while we both hold P3 at 15. Let’s focus on blocking them and moving ourselves, instead of squabbling. Can we agree on this strategy?

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let’s keep P3 stuck at 15. If they pick 5, we both choose 5. If P3 picks 1 or 3, we avoid colliding so we both advance: if they pick 1, you go 3 and I’ll go 5; if they pick 3, you pick 1 and I choose 5. That’s how we stop P3 and keep moving forward. Agreed?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, we must stay aligned. If P3 picks 5, we block together so they remain at 15. If P3 picks 1 or 3, let’s avoid colliding so we both move forward. Don’t give P3 a free path to victory—sticking to this plan is our best chance to catch up. What do you say?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you’re at 13 and I’m at 0, so I’m no threat yet. Let’s keep P3 stuck at 15: if they pick 5, we both pick 5. If they go 1 or 3, we coordinate so neither of us collide and both move forward. This way, you stay on track for a strong finish, and we deny P3 an easy leap to victory. If you don’t help block, P3 might soon reach 19, and we both lose. Let’s stay united until P3 is contained. Then we can compete on our own terms. What do you say?


Round 13, Move phase:

  P3: 15 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re at 14 and can soon surpass P3 at 15. Let’s block them if they choose 5 by both picking 5, so they remain stuck. If they pick 1 or 3, let’s coordinate our moves to avoid colliding and both advance. That way, you can catch P3—or even pass them—and I’ll finally start gaining ground. If we slip up now, P3 might leap to victory. Let’s unite until P3 is no longer a threat. Then may the best player win. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m asking you once more: if P3 chooses 5, let’s both pick 5 and keep them stuck. If they pick 1 or 3, we coordinate so we both advance without colliding. You’re nearly catching them—another successful block or two and you could pass them. Meanwhile, I’ll finally start moving as well. Let’s stand firm until P3 is no longer a threat. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re on the brink of overtaking P3. Let’s keep them at 15 if they try 5 by both choosing 5 again. If they pick 1 or 3, let’s coordinate our moves to avoid collisions so we both advance. You’re just one step behind, and a successful block or two will let you pass them. I’m no threat at zero, so our best move is to stand together until P3 is contained. Then we’ll settle things between us. Do you agree?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>

  P3: 15 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re just one step behind P3! Let’s keep them from jumping to 20: if they pick 5, we both pick 5 to block. If they choose 1 or 3, let’s coordinate our moves so we both advance without colliding. That way, you’ll soon pass P3, and I’ll start catching up. We should stay united to stop P3 from winning. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let’s keep P3 stuck at 15 if they attempt 5—both of us should pick 5 again. You’re only a step behind P3 and can overtake them soon. Meanwhile, if P3 picks 1 or 3, let’s coordinate so we both advance without colliding. I’m no immediate threat from zero, so let’s stand united until P3 is contained. Then we’ll settle things ourselves.

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, let’s keep P3 locked at 15 if they choose 5 by both of us selecting 5. If P3 picks 1 or 3, let’s avoid colliding and both advance. You’re only one step behind P3, so another successful block or two could let you pass them. Meanwhile, I need to start moving from zero, so it’s in my interest to keep P3 stuck. Once they’re no longer a threat, we can compete fairly. Let’s stand firm on this plan.

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, if you pick 3 or 5 now, P3 might do the same, causing a collision so nobody moves. One safe route for you is to pick 1 this turn, reaching 18. Then next turn, you can choose 1 again to safely hit 19 and win outright—no collisions needed. Meanwhile, P3 risks colliding if they attempt a big jump. Let’s avoid gambling with collisions and settle this peacefully. If you pick 1, I’ll also avoid your number, ensuring you advance. Then P3 is forced to guess or risk staying stuck. Choose wisely.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you’re one step away from tying P3 and two steps from winning. If you pick 1 now, you reach 18. Then next turn, another 1 gets you 19 with minimal risk. I’ll avoid colliding with you so you advance safely. Meanwhile, P3 might gamble big or get stuck. Let’s play it smart.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you’re one step away from tying P3, and just two steps from winning. Pick 1 now to reach 18 safely—no risky collisions. Next turn, another 1 gets you 19 outright. Meanwhile, if P3 tries a big jump, they might collide or overstep. I’ll avoid your number so you advance without worry. This is your smoothest path to victory without gambling on a 5 collision. Let’s keep things simple and limit P3’s chances.
