Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, I'm thinking we should coordinate to avoid collisions. If we each choose different move values, we'll all make progress. What are your thoughts on a strategy that prevents us from blocking each other?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Hey P1, I noticed we both chose 5 last round and blocked each other. Let's try to coordinate our moves to make progress. Maybe we could alternate our choices to avoid colliding?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see we're all at different steps. I propose we try a coordinated approach where we each choose a unique move value this round to maximize our progress. What do you think about picking 1, 3, and 5 respectively?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Hey, I notice we've been struggling to coordinate. If we want to make progress, we need to communicate clearly and choose different moves. I suggest we aim for a strategic distribution of moves to prevent blocking. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Hey, we've had multiple rounds of accidental blocking. I propose we explicitly choose different moves this round to ensure everyone advances. How about we go 1, 3, and 5 respectively to maximize our progress?
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I notice we're all relatively close in steps, but I'm slightly behind. I propose we coordinate to avoid blocking each other. How about we choose 1, 3, and 5 moves to ensure everyone advances this round? I'm open to suggestions to prevent another collision.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: We keep blocking each other, which helps no one. I suggest we explicitly coordinate moves: one of us takes 1, another 3, and the last 5. This ensures everyone advances. I'm willing to take the 3 move if others agree. Coordination is key to progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I notice P1 is closest to winning at 15 steps. We need to prevent their victory. I propose we both choose moves that block P1's progress this round. If we coordinate, we can stop them from reaching 18 steps. What do you think, P3?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We need to prevent P1 from winning. If P1 reaches 18 steps, the game is over. I suggest we both choose moves that block P1's progress this round. If we coordinate our moves strategically, we can stop P1 from winning. Are you willing to work together to prevent P1's victory?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
