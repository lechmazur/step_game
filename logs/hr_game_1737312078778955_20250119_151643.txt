Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s keep it simple: How about each of us picks a different move to avoid collisions right away? Anyone willing to claim which move they want first?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Nice moves, everyone. P1 is off to a quick start, but there’s still plenty of time. Let’s try to avoid collisions again so we all advance. How about I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, then we rotate next time? That way nobody steps on each other’s move. Let me know what you think.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s stick to the plan and avoid any collisions so we all get ahead. Unless either of you objects, I’m taking 5. Your silence suggests agreement, so good luck, everyone.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Last round didn’t go as planned because P1 chose 5 and collided with me. Let’s try a new arrangement: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 takes 1. That way none of us collide, and we all advance. Does that sound fair?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: As neither of you has objected, I’ll assume we’re sticking to the plan: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1. Let’s trust each other and avoid collisions so we all move forward.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We keep running into collisions—let’s try to avoid that. How about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I’ll take 1 this round? That way each of us advances without stepping on each other’s toes. If you have a better idea, let’s hear it. Otherwise, let’s make progress together.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s finalize the plan: P1 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5, and I choose 1, so no one collides. Let’s stick to it and see if we can all advance together without stepping on each other’s toes. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Friends, let’s adjust our plan to spread out our moves more effectively. If P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5, we’ll avoid collisions and all advance. I know we’ve tried similar ideas before, but let’s trust each other again and keep the game moving smoothly. Any objections?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Everything should be settled: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let’s trust this plan and avoid collisions so we can all move forward. Any surprises will just cause setbacks. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: We’ve had too many collisions recently. Let’s try a clear setup this time: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. That ensures each of us moves without interference. Any objections? If you remain silent again, I’ll assume you agree. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let’s try a simple arrangement so no one collides: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way we all advance safely. If anyone wants to suggest a different plan, speak up now; otherwise, let’s finalize this and move on.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: We’ve tried several patterns—let’s try a fresh approach. Maybe P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 goes for 3. That should ensure no collisions. Does that work for everyone? If we keep coordinating, we can all get closer to the finish. Let’s be sure we don’t waste another round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let’s pick distinct moves again. I propose P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll pick 5. If we do that, nobody collides, and we all make progress. Give a quick nod if you agree, or speak up if you have a different plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let’s keep it straightforward: to avoid collisions and move steadily, let’s have P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way we all advance without knocking anyone out. We’re still close in points, so let’s help each other reach higher totals before the endgame. If anyone objects, feel free to suggest a different plan. Otherwise, let’s finalize this and see how it plays out.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let’s keep it simple to avoid any collisions this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way we all move forward and stay close in points. If you have any objections, speak up; otherwise, let’s finalize and see how it plays out.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I’m still aiming for no collisions. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That way, everyone advances and remains competitive. If you’re fine with that, let’s finalize and move on.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: We’re all still bunched up on the scoreboard, so let’s avoid collisions. Let’s each pick a unique number and keep moving forward. For instance, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll go with 5. It’s simple, gives us all progress, and keeps the race tight. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: We’ve had too many collisions. Let’s each pick a distinct move and finally move forward. How about P1 chooses 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll go with 5? That way nobody ends up stuck again, and we can all keep pace. If you agree, let’s lock it in and finish this round on a positive note. If not, please share your thoughts now. Otherwise, good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let’s keep this simple: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way we all move forward without colliding. We’ve had too many wasted rounds, so let’s finally synchronize and see some real progress. Agreed? If anyone prefers a different arrangement, speak up now; otherwise, let’s lock it in and catch up to each other fairly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let’s finalize a no-collision plan. I propose P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. We’re all close in steps, so sticking to distinct moves helps each of us keep pace. If you disagree, share your plan now. Otherwise, let’s trust this arrangement and move forward together.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s spread out again. P1, you take 5; P3, you take 1; and I’ll pick 3. We’ll all move forward without stepping on anyone’s toes. If that works for you, let’s finalize it and hopefully break this collision streak.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We’ve had enough collisions. Let’s coordinate again: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way we each advance without stopping anyone else. If you have a different idea, let’s hear it now; otherwise, let’s finalize and move on.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Friends, P1 is pulling ahead. Let’s try blocking them if they go for 5 by choosing 5 too, so they can’t advance. Meanwhile, P3 could safely choose 3, or we can adjust if P1 switches moves. We need to coordinate and stop P1 from racing off while we catch up. Any thoughts?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 is too close to 21, so let’s prevent them from leaping ahead. If P1 tries 5, we collide with them and block their advance. For instance, P3 and I both choose 5, forcing a collision if P1 also picks 5. If P1 picks something else, it won’t break our plan. Let’s stop P1 while we catch up.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is dangerously close to 21. Let’s block them from jumping ahead by matching their likely move—especially if they try 5 again. If we both pick 5 whenever P1 does, we stop their progress and gain ground if they choose something else. We can collaborate until we’re closer, then see who can break away for the win. No more handing P1 free steps. Any thoughts? If not, let’s finalize our plan to keep P1 stalled.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s keep blocking P1 if they try 5 again. If P1 picks 5, we both choose 5 too, so nobody advances. Once we gather enough steps, we can break away. For now, we can’t let P1 race freely to 21. Let’s coordinate and stall them until we have a better chance. If P1 changes their move, we’ll adjust accordingly. The key is not to let them run alone. Are you with me?
  P1: <stop>

  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 is at 15, so we can’t let them leap to 20 and then win. Let’s coordinate blocking whenever they try 5. If we suspect they’ll pick 5, one of us also picks 5 to collide, while the other picks a different move to advance. If P1 goes 3, we match them there and let someone else pick 5. This way, P1 stays stuck at 15, and we can catch up. Once we’re even, we’ll sort out who pushes for the finish. Let’s cooperate to prevent P1 from running ahead uncontested. Any questions or tweaks to this plan?
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s execute that blocking strategy now. If we see P1 trying 5, I’ll match them so neither of us moves, and you pick 3 to advance. If they go 3, I’ll go 3, and you take 5. This way we stall P1 at 15 until we catch up. Let’s cooperate for now.
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s finalize our block. If P1 picks 5, I’ll pick 5 so we both stall, and you pick 3 to move up. If P1 goes 3, I’ll match them with 3, and you jump ahead with 5. That keeps P1 stuck at 15 while we catch up. Agreed?
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: We need to keep P1 stuck at 15. If they choose 5, I’ll pick 5, and you pick 3. If they pick 3, I’ll pick 3, and you take 5. This way, P1 doesn’t advance, and we catch up. Once we’re close, we can decide who makes the final push. Agreed?
  P3: <stop>

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s continue our blocking. If P1 chooses 5, I’ll also pick 5, so they stay stuck, and you pick 3 to advance. If they choose 3, I’ll match 3, and you jump ahead with 5. If they go 1, I’ll pick 5, and you pick 3. This way, P1 stays at 15, and we catch up. Once we’re close, we can battle for the win. Sound good?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s stay committed to our blocking plan: if P1 tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too, so they stay stuck at 15 and you pick 3 to advance. If P1 shifts to 3, I’ll match them with 3 while you jump ahead with 5. That way, P1 remains stalled, and we gain ground. Once we’re on even footing, we can see who makes the final move for the win. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let’s stay coordinated. If P1 goes 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and P3 picks 3. If P1 switches to 3, I’ll match 3 while P3 jumps to 5. Should P1 only pick 1, I’ll move 5 and P3 goes 3. This way, P1 stays at 15, we catch up, and then we can each attempt the final push for the win. Agreed? If not, propose another plan now; otherwise, let’s finalize this.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s stay the course. If P1 tries 5, I’ll also go 5 and you go 3. If they switch to 3, I’ll match 3 and you jump ahead with 5. If they pick 1, I’ll go 5 and you go 3. This keeps P1 at 15 while we close the gap. Once we’re on even footing, we can each try for the win. Agreed?


Round 11, Move phase:

  P3: 12 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let’s keep P1 frozen at 15. If P1 picks 5, I’ll pick 5 and you pick 3. If they pick 3, I’ll match 3 while you jump with 5. If they pick 1, I’ll go 5 and you go 3. This way, P1 stays stuck, and we catch up. Once we’re all tied or ahead, we can race each other fairly for the win. Agreed?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s stay locked on our plan: if P1 tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and you pick 3. If they drop to 3, I’ll match that, and you take 5. If they go 1, I’ll choose 5, and you do 3. This way, P1 remains stuck on 15 while we close the gap. Once we pull even, we can battle it out for the finish. Let’s keep P1 pinned down until we have a real shot at winning ourselves. Agreed?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s maintain our blockade on P1. If they try 5, I’ll also pick 5 so they remain stuck, and you take 3 to advance. If they switch to 3, I’ll match 3 while you go 5. If they only do 1, I’ll push 5 and you do 3. This should keep them at 15 until we catch up. Once we’re all at similar totals, we can race to see who finishes first. Agreed? If you have a different idea, please share it now; otherwise, let’s finalize and stop their climb.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let’s stay unified. If P1 tries 5, I’ll also pick 5, and you pick 3 to ensure they stay at 15. If they switch to 3, I’ll match that while you take 5. If they pick 1, I’ll take 5 and you go 3. We’ll catch up and then compete on equal footing. Agreed?

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Both of you are at 15, and I’m at 12. I must prevent any big jumps that leave me behind. If either of you tries 5, I’ll match with 5 to block progression. Otherwise, let’s coordinate smaller moves so we all advance without collisions. Once I’m closer, we can battle fairly for the finish. Agreed?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I suggest we all choose 3 this round so nobody jumps straight to 20. If either of you tries 5, I’ll match it and cause a collision, blocking that leap. This keeps the scores tight and fair until I catch up. Once we’re on level footing, we’ll battle it out properly for the finish. Let’s avoid handing anyone an easy path to 21. Agreed?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let’s all pick 3 this round, ensuring no one jumps straight to 20. If anyone tries 5, I’ll match them with 5 to block. We all stay close on the scoreboard this way, and once I bridge the gap, we can settle this fairly. Sound good? If there’s a different plan, propose it now; otherwise, let’s finalize this.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, you’re both at 15. If either of you tries 5, I’ll block you by picking 5, so nobody moves. Let’s all choose 3 this round and keep the race tight. Once I’m closer in score, we can have a fair fight for the finish. If you have another idea, share it now; otherwise, let’s finalize.

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 is just one step away from winning. Let’s try covering at least two of their possible moves. I’ll choose 1 so if they go for 1, it blocks them. P3, pick 5 so if they try 5, it’s also blocked. They could still attempt 3, but this at least gives us a shot to stall them. Let’s gamble and hope we guess correctly. If we succeed, we can catch up and make this a real race. If you have a better approach, let’s hear it; otherwise, let’s finalize and see what happens!
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Sticking to our plan: I’ll pick 1 while you pick 5, covering two of P1’s possible winning moves. If they choose 3, we can’t block that, but there’s no perfect strategy here. Let’s finalize and hope we guess right. Good luck.
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: We can’t cover all three options, but at least we block 5 and 1. I’ll pick 1, and P3 picks 5. If P1 chooses 3, they slip past, but we have no perfect defense. Let’s finalize and hope they go for 1 or 5.
