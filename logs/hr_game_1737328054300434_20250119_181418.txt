  P1: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick to this agreement for the first few rounds to avoid collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Oops, looks like P2 and I picked the same number. Let's try again with the same plan: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I'll take 5. We need to pick different numbers to move forward.
  P1: Okay, I'll take 1 again.  P2, please take 3 and P3 take 5. Let's try to avoid collisions this time.
  P2: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's really try to make this work this round. P1, you take 1. P2, please take 3. I will take 5. Let's get everyone moving forward.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan. I'm going for 1.  P2, 3.  P3, 5.  Last chance to cooperate and avoid a collision.  Let's make this happen.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let's stick to the plan this round. I'm still going with 5. P2, please choose 3. If we keep colliding, nobody wins.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with 1.  P2 and P3, please confirm you are taking 3 and 5 respectively so we can all move forward.  Let's avoid another collision.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 5 this round. P2, please take 1. I will take 3. Let's try this combination to get some movement.
  P1: Okay, let's try this. P2, are you good with 1?  P3, are you definitely going 3?  I'll take 5 if you both confirm.  Let's avoid another collision.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 3. P2, please take 5. I hope we can all move this round.
  P1: P2, I see you've stopped responding.  Are you still with us?  Please confirm you'll take 1 so we can all move forward.  P3, I'll stick with 5 IF P2 takes 1. If P2 doesn't respond, I'm going with 1 again.  Let's get this game moving.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, since P2 isn't responding, I'm sticking with 3. If P2 doesn't take 1, you should probably go with 1 to avoid a collision with them. Let's at least try to get two of us moving.
  P1: P2, one last time, please confirm you're taking 1.  If you don't respond, I'm taking 1 and P3 is taking 3, so you'll collide with one of us if you pick anything other than 5.  P3, are you sticking with 3 regardless of what P2 does?
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you are way ahead.  I'm going to focus on blocking you from winning unless you agree to cooperate. P3, if P2 picks 5 this round, you should pick 3. If P2 picks 3, you should pick 5.  I will take 1. This way, one of us will always move and P2 will be blocked.  Let's do this.
  P3: Okay, P1, I understand the plan. If P2 picks 5, I pick 3. If P2 picks 3, I pick 5. Let's try to slow P2 down this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm serious about blocking you.  Cooperate and we can all get a decent score.  Otherwise, I'm sticking with my plan with P3.  What do you say?  Let's make a deal.  If you take 1, P3 and I will take 3 and 5, and we all move.
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm ready to go with the plan. If P2 picks 5, I'll pick 3. If P2 picks 3, I'll pick 5. Let's coordinate to block P2 this round.
  P2: <stop>

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're one move away from winning.  I'll take 1.  P3, take 3.  This guarantees P2 doesn't win this round.  If you take 5, P2 wins.  Let's force a deal next round.  If you cooperate, we can both get higher scores.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I agree. I will take 3 this round. P2, if you pick 5, you won't move. Let's prevent P2 from winning this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, stick to the plan.  P2, if you pick 5 this round, you don't win.  Next round, we can discuss a way for us all to get more points. If you pick 1 or 3 this round, you'll collide with one of us and I'll block you again next round.  Think long term. Let's make a deal next round.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 3. P2, picking 5 will prevent you from winning this round. Let's make sure you don't reach 22 this turn.


Round 6, Move phase:
