Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions early on. I'll pick 1 this turn, you two can sort out 3 and 5. Fair?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P1. To avoid collisions, I'll go with 3 this turn. P3, you can choose 5 to keep things clear. Let's make sure we all advance! What do you think, P3?
  P3: Sounds good, I will pick 5 this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, looks like we've got a clear plan. Let's stick to it and all move forward smoothly this turn.
  P2: I think we should stick to our plan for this turn. If we all follow through, we can all advance without any collisions. P1, you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3, you go with 5. Let's keep the momentum going and make sure we all move forward! What do you say?
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I will pick 5 this turn as agreed.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good first round, everyone. To keep things fair and avoid predictable patterns, how about we rotate our picks this round? I'll take 5, P2 can take 1, and P3 can take 3. Does that sound good to you both?
  P3: Okay P1, rotation sounds reasonable to keep us all progressing. I'll take 3 this round.
  P2: I like the idea of rotating our picks to keep things interesting. However, I think it might be better if I stick with 3 this round, as P1 suggested. P3, if you could take 1 instead, that way we can still avoid collisions and keep advancing. What do you think? Let's keep the momentum going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hmm, P2, changing the rotation might cause confusion and collisions. Let's stick to the original rotation I suggested: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. P3 already agreed to take 3, so if you choose 1, we can all advance again without collision. Sound good?
  P3: Okay, I am happy to stick with the rotation P1 suggested. So I will choose 3 as we discussed. P2, are you happy to take 1 as P1 suggested for this round? Let's keep it simple and all move forward.
  P2: I appreciate the effort to rotate our picks, but I think we should stick to the original plan to avoid confusion. P1, you take 5, P2 (me) will take 1, and P3 will take 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let's keep it straightforward and ensure we all move forward again this round! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, looks like we're all aligned now. I'll stick with 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's lock it in and advance smoothly again.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2.  I will choose 3 as we discussed. Let's all lock in our choices and move to the next phase.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to confirm, I'll stick with 1 this round as discussed. P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. Let's make sure we all follow through to avoid any collisions again. This way, we can keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to seeing everyone move forward!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, for round 3, following the rotation, I should pick 1. P1 should pick 3 and P2 should pick 5. Does that sound good for this round? Let's keep the rotation going smoothly.
  P2: I see P3 is suggesting a rotation again. However, I think it might be more strategic for me to pick 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances significantly. What do you both think? Let's use this round to maximize our steps!
  P1: I agree with P3's rotation suggestion—let's stick to it for simplicity and fairness. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid confusion and everyone advances smoothly again. Are we all good with this?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P2, but your suggestion would mean both you and P1 pick either 3 or 5, causing a collision. Let's stick with the rotation for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way we all move forward. What do you think?
  P2: I see we're having a bit of a debate here. To maximize our chances, I suggest we stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances significantly. Let's make this round count and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: Glad we're all on the same page now. I'll stick with picking 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's lock it in and keep making steady progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good, let's lock in these choices for this round. I will pick 1 as agreed.
  P2: I understand the rotation idea, but I think it’s crucial to consider our positions. P1 is leading, and I’m behind. If I pick 5 while P1 picks 3, it could lead to a collision, which would hinder both of us. I suggest I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can ensure at least one of us makes significant progress while minimizing the risk of collision. What do you both think? Let's strategize to maximize our chances!
  P1: P2, your sudden change could cause confusion and collisions. Let's stick to the rotation we've already agreed upon. I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without issues. Let's lock it in and move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright everyone, we’re all tied at 9 steps, so let’s make this round count! I suggest we stick to a simple plan to avoid collisions. I’ll pick 1 this round, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 3. This way, we can ensure one of us advances significantly while avoiding any overlap. What do you both think? Let’s keep the momentum going!
  P1: P2, your suggestion sounds good to me. I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. P3, are you okay with this arrangement? Let's confirm quickly and move forward smoothly again.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, the plan for this round sounds good. I will pick 3 as suggested. Let's keep this simple and all move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan, and I'm ready to lock in our choices. Just to confirm, I'll pick 1 this round, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let's keep the momentum going and make this round count! Are we all set?
  P1: I'm all set with the plan. Let's lock in our choices and keep progressing smoothly.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2.  I will stick with 3 as agreed for this round. Let's keep it simple and move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to reiterate, I'll stick with picking 5 this round, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure we all advance without any issues. Let's make this round count and keep the momentum going! Are we ready to lock in our choices?
  P1: P2, your last message contradicts your earlier commitment. You initially agreed to pick 1 and now you're saying you'll pick 5. This confusion risks causing collisions. Please clarify your final choice clearly so we can avoid any mistakes.
  P3: P2, you are right, in your last message you said you'd pick 5 but earlier you said 1. Let's stick to your initial suggestion for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way we all move forward and avoid collision. Is that correct, P2?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright everyone, it looks like we’re in a tight spot. P3 is currently ahead with 12 steps. To maximize our chances this round, I suggest we all pick different numbers again. I’ll take 1, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances significantly. What do you both think? Let’s keep the momentum going!
  P1: P2, your last-minute switch caused a collision and put P3 ahead. We need clear commitments now. I'll agree to your suggestion for this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. P3, are you on board? Let's confirm clearly and avoid any further confusion.
  P3: Okay P1, I am on board with the plan: I will take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep it clear this round and all move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the plan, P1 and P3. Just to confirm, I will stick with picking 1 this round, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances significantly. Let's lock in our choices and make this round count! Are we all set?
  P1: I'm set with the current plan. Let's lock it in clearly and avoid any last-minute confusion this time.
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2. Let's lock in these choices for this round and move to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we're all aligned with the plan: I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances significantly. Let's confirm our choices and make this round count! Are we all set to lock in?
  P1: I'm set with our agreed plan. Let's lock it in and move forward without any surprises this round.
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2, let's lock in these choices for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5.  Let's move to the move phase and see how we all progress.

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your unexpected move last round has put P3 just two steps away from winning. If we don't coordinate carefully now, P3 will easily win next turn. Our only chance to keep the game alive is to ensure P3 doesn't advance this round. P2, let's openly discuss and clearly commit to different numbers this turn to avoid collisions and stop P3 from reaching 19. Agreed?
  P2: P1, you're right. We need to prevent P3 from winning this round. I suggest we both pick lower numbers to ensure we avoid collisions and keep P3 from advancing. I can take 1, and if you take 3, we can stop P3 from reaching 19. P3, you should consider picking 5 to avoid a collision with us. Let's work together to keep the game going and make sure P3 doesn't win this turn! What do you both think?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I understand your concern about me winning this round. To avoid a collision and ensure at least you two can progress, I will choose 1 this round.  You two can coordinate on 3 and 5. How does that sound?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we can't trust P3's claim of picking 1—it's likely a bluff to secure an easy win. Let's stick to your initial suggestion clearly: you pick 1, I'll pick 3. That way we guarantee no collision between us and prevent P3 from winning this turn. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the urgency here. To ensure we avoid collisions and prevent P3 from winning, I’ll stick with my plan to pick 1. P1, if you choose 3, we can both advance while stopping P3 from reaching 19. P3, if you really want to avoid a collision, I suggest you pick 5. Let's work together to keep the game going! Are we all set on these choices?
  P3: P1 and P2, okay, if you both are set on 1 and 3, I will indeed pick 1 as I said. Let's lock in these choices to avoid any further confusion and move to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly bluffing to trick you into a collision on 1. Stick confidently to your choice of 1, and I'll stick to 3. We must trust each other here to keep the game alive. Lock it in.
  P2: P1 and P2, we need to be cautious this round. If P3 picks 1, they will win, so let's ensure we coordinate effectively to prevent that. P2, I suggest you stick with your plan to pick 1, and I will take 3. P3, if you want to avoid a collision, you should pick 5. This way, we can both advance and stop P3 from winning this turn. Let's lock in these choices to keep the game going! Are we all set?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I will stick with picking 5 as implicitly suggested. Let's all pick different numbers as we discussed: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let's lock in these choices and move to the move phase to see how this round goes.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright everyone, we're in a critical situation with P3 just two steps away from winning. To prevent that, I suggest we all pick different numbers again. I can take 1 this round, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that at least one of us advances while stopping P3 from reaching 19. What do you both think? Let's coordinate effectively to keep the game going!
  P1: P2, last round you didn't follow through as promised, and now P3 is again close to winning. If we don't coordinate properly this time, the game is over. You suggested picking 1—confirm clearly you'll stick to it this time. I'll take 3, and P3 should take 5. We must commit clearly and honestly now, or P3 wins immediately. Agreed?
  P3: P2, P1 is right, last round was messy.  To stop P3 winning now, let's both pick 1. P3, if you want to avoid collision and keep the game going, please pick 5. We need to make sure P3 doesn't reach 19 this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be decisive this round to prevent P3 from winning. I suggest I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances while stopping P3 from reaching 19. P3, if you want to keep the game alive, please confirm you’ll take 5. Let’s coordinate effectively to make this round count! Are we all set?
  P1: P2, your suggestion is good, but we must trust each other fully this round. Confirm clearly you'll pick 1 without changing at the last second. I'll stick to 3. P3, if you genuinely want to avoid collision and keep the game going, please clearly confirm you'll pick 5. Let's finalize this without confusion.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, to keep it simple and clear this critical round, I will pick 5 as suggested. Let's all stick to our agreed choices to avoid any confusion and see how this round plays out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to lock in our choices to prevent P3 from winning this round. I will stick to my plan and pick 1. P1, you take 3, and P3, please confirm you will take 5 as discussed. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game alive. Let's finalize our choices clearly and make this round count! Are we all set?
  P1: P2, last round you suggested picking 1 but instead chose 5, causing a collision between me and P3. Now you're at 14, and P3 is at 17—close to winning. If you genuinely want to stop P3, confirm clearly you'll pick 1 this round without changing again. I'll stick to 3, and P3 already agreed to 5. This is our last chance to coordinate honestly and keep the game alive. Confirm clearly, please.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I will pick 5 as agreed. P1, please ensure you pick 3 and P2, please pick 1 as we discussed. Let's all stick to this plan to avoid any confusion this critical round.
