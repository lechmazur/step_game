Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, let's all choose different moves this round to avoid collision and move forward.
  P1: Alright, I agree with P2's idea of choosing different numbers to avoid collisions. To maximize our progress, let's each pick a unique move. I'll take **5** this round to jump ahead. That leaves **1** and **3** for you two—let’s split those to ensure we all advance. See you on the next step!
  P3: I'll take **3** this round. P2, that leaves **1** for you. Let's stick to our plan and all advance.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s keep avoiding collisions by choosing distinct numbers. Since I advanced furthest last round, I’ll prioritize letting others catch up this time. Let’s each pick a different move again—maybe P2 takes 5 now? That way, we all progress fairly.
  P2: Okay P1, that sounds reasonable. I'll take 5 this round. P3, you can pick between 1 and 3. Let's keep this strategy going to make consistent progress.
  P3: I'll take 3 again this round. P1, since you're ahead, maybe consider 1 to let P2 catch up with 5. Let's keep our momentum going and avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, I'll take 1 as suggested. Let's keep the plan to avoid collisions and advance together. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, sounds good P3. Let's all lock in our choices then!
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going. I'll stick with 3 this round to maintain our pattern. P1, since you're in the lead, taking 1 again could help balance our progress. P2, with 5, you'll catch up nicely. Let's keep this strategy and ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: To break our stalemate at 6, let’s prioritize progress. I’ll take **5** this round. Please pick **1** or **3** to avoid collision. We need to push forward aggressively now—sharing the lead won’t help anyone win. Let’s coordinate but focus on advancing.
  P3: P1, I'll take **3** this round. P2, that leaves **1** for you. Let's keep our strategy of avoiding collisions and continue to advance together. We need to maintain our momentum and ensure we all progress.
  P2: Okay, I agree with taking 1 this round to keep us all moving forward as planned. Let's ensure we each make a different move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s confirm the plan for this round to avoid missteps. I’ll stick with **5**, P3 takes **3**, and P2 holds at **1**. This keeps our momentum and lets me push ahead to break the tie. Next rounds, we can adjust strategies, but for now, consistency is key. Let’s lock in these choices to advance without collision.
  P3: P1, P2: Let's stick to the plan for this round to ensure we all advance. I'll confirm my choice of **3** again. P2, taking **1** will keep us collision-free. P1, your **5** will help you break the tie. Let's maintain our strategy and momentum. Looking forward to adjusting our approach in future rounds to keep the game dynamic and competitive.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I will take 1 as planned. Let's all lock in our moves to keep progressing without collision this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize the plan to avoid last-minute changes. I’ll take **5**, P3 confirms **3**, and P2 holds at **1**. This keeps us all moving while giving me a needed lead. Trust the strategy—we can adjust later, but consistency now is critical. Let’s lock these choices.
  P3: P1, P2: Let's keep the momentum going with our current strategy. I'll stick with 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collision. Once we break the tie, we can reassess our approach to stay competitive. Let's lock in these moves and keep pushing forward together.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds good for this round to stick with the plan. Let's all take our assigned moves to keep progressing. We might need to think about shaking things up in the next round or two to make sure it stays competitive for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's lock in the agreed moves: 5, 3, and 1 respectively. Consistency now ensures progress. Next round, we can reassess strategy.
  P3: P1, P2: Let's lock in our moves for this round - I'll stick with 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This strategy has worked well so far, keeping us all advancing without collisions. Once we break the tie at 6 steps, we should consider mixing things up next round to keep the game competitive. For now, consistency is key. Let's confirm these choices and keep pushing forward together.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's lock in 1 for me this round as discussed.  Good to keep the progress going for now, but we should definitely think about mixing up our moves starting next round to make sure we all have a fair shot at winning.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s maintain coordination to ensure progress. I’ll take **5** this round to extend my lead toward 22. P3, pick **3** to keep advancing, and P2, take **1** to stay in the race. Consistency minimizes collisions and keeps us moving forward. Let’s finalize these choices to avoid surprises.
  P2: Okay P1, I'll take 1 again. Sounds good for this round. But we should probably think about mixing things up soon to keep it competitive for everyone.
  P3: P1, P2: I'll stick with 3 this round to keep advancing. P1, your lead is significant, but let's maintain our strategy for now. P2, taking 1 will help you stay in the game. We should start considering different moves soon to keep the competition alive. Let's lock in these choices for this round and plan to mix things up next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize the agreed moves now—**5**, **3**, **1** respectively—to avoid collisions and keep advancing. My lead is fragile; even a single setback could cost me. Next round, we can adjust strategies, but today’s priority is progress. Lock in your choices to ensure we all move forward.
  P2: Okay P1, I'll take 1 this round as planned. But next round we MUST change strategy. P1 is getting too far ahead, and it's becoming uncompetitive for P2 and P3. Let's discuss a new approach for next round to make it fairer.
  P3: P1, P2: I agree, let's stick with 3 for me this round to keep advancing. P1, your lead is notable, but maintaining our current strategy ensures we all progress. P2, taking 1 will keep you in the game. However, I support the idea of changing our approach next round to keep the competition fair. Let's lock in these moves for now and plan to mix things up soon.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s confirm our moves for this round to avoid surprises—**5**, **3**, and **1** respectively. After this, I’m open to adjusting strategies to keep the competition fair. But for now, consistency ensures progress. Lock in your choices to advance safely.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, actually, I think waiting until next round to change strategy is too late. P1 is pulling too far ahead. For this round, I'm going to choose **5** to try and catch up a bit. We need to make this more competitive now.
  P3: P1, P2: I'll stick with 3 this round to keep advancing, but I agree we need to change our strategy soon. P2, your move to 5 is understandable to catch up, but let's consider a more dynamic approach next round to keep the game competitive. P1, your lead is significant, but we can still make this a fair race. Let's lock in our moves for now and plan to mix things up starting next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if you're taking 5, I’ll switch to **1** to avoid collision. P3 remains on **3**. This keeps all moves unique. Let’s lock in these adjusted choices to advance safely. We can recalibrate strategy next round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I am taking 5 this round as I said to try and close the gap with P1. P1 switching to 1 is good to avoid collision.  Let's definitely talk about a different strategy for the next round to make sure this game stays competitive for everyone.
  P3: P1, P2: I'll stick with 3 this round as planned. P2, your move to 5 is understandable, but let's ensure we all advance. P1, switching to 1 avoids collision, which is good. For the next round, we should definitely discuss a new strategy to keep the game competitive. Let's lock in our moves for now and plan to mix things up soon to give everyone a fair chance at winning.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all at 12 steps now.  The coordinated approach got us this far, but to actually win, someone needs to take the lead. For this round, I'm going to choose 5 to try and break away.  We should probably start playing more strategically as individuals now to see who can reach 22 first.
  P3: P1, P2: I agree, it's time to shift our strategy. I'll take 3 this round to maintain my position and keep our options open. P2, your move to 5 is bold, but let's see how it plays out. P1, consider a different number to avoid collision. We need to start playing more aggressively to break the tie and aim for 22. Let's keep the game dynamic and competitive from here on out.
  P1: P2, P3: I’ll take **1** this round to avoid collision. Now that we’re tied, I propose we focus on incremental gains while blocking others’ paths. Next rounds, I’ll aim for 5 when clear. Stay sharp—every step counts toward 22.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's stick with our announced moves for this round: 5 for me, 1 for P1, and 3 for P3.  This will let us all advance.  For the next round, we should really start thinking about how to win individually now that we are all at 12.
  P3: P1, P2: Let's keep advancing this round with my choice of 3. P2, your move to 5 is strategic, but be ready for a shift next round. P1, taking 1 avoids collision, which is smart. We're all at 12 now, so it's crucial to start playing more individually to break away. Let's lock in these moves and prepare for a more competitive approach starting next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P1: P2, P3: To maximize progress toward 22, I propose we **rotate priority** for high moves: next round, I’ll take **5** if unclaimed, while you two split **1** and **3**. Let’s stay unpredictable but avoid collisions—stagnation is our worst enemy. Stay sharp!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5 this round to try and get ahead. P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 3 sounds good to avoid collision for this round.  But let's be clear, starting next round, I'm playing to win and will choose whatever move I think is best for me, regardless of what others choose.
  P3: P1, P2: I'm sticking with 3 this round to keep advancing. P2, your move to 5 is strategic, but let's prepare for a shift next round. P1, taking 1 is smart to avoid collision. We're all at 12 now, so it's time to play more individually. Let's lock in these moves and start competing more aggressively from the next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize this round’s moves to advance safely. I’ll hold at **1**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 stays on **3**. This keeps us all progressing. Next round, we’ll rotate the priority for high moves—P3 takes **5**, P2 picks **3**, and I’ll take **1**. Fair and strategic—stay disciplined to reach 22!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we have a plan for this round with me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. Let's lock those in to keep advancing.  As I said, next round I'm playing to win, so expect me to choose the move that's best for *me* then.
  P3: P1, P2: Let's lock in our moves for this round - 3 for me, 5 for P2, and 1 for P1. This keeps us all advancing without collision. Starting next round, I agree we need to play more individually to break away and reach 22 first. I'll be choosing moves strategically to maximize my progress from here on out. Let's keep the game competitive and see who can make it to the finish line first!
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm this round’s moves to advance safely. Next round, let’s honor the **rotation plan**: I’ll take **5**, P2 picks **1**, and P3 chooses **3**. This ensures we all progress while giving me a critical push toward 22. Stay disciplined—collisions cost us all. Let’s execute this strategy to keep momentum!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're close at 17. Let's block your path to 22 this round. I’ll take **5**, P3 take **3**, and you take **1**. This keeps all moves unique and prevents you from winning immediately. We’ll all advance fairly—stay disciplined to keep the race open!
  P3: P1, P2: I'll take 3 this round as planned. P1, your move to 5 is strategic to block P2, but let's keep the game competitive. P2, taking 1 will keep you in the race. We should all focus on advancing while maintaining a fair competition. Let's lock in these moves and continue to strategize for the next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P2: P1 and P3, I am at 17 steps and need 5 to reach 22 and potentially win this round.  Therefore, I will choose 5 this round to try and secure a win. You two can decide between 1 and 3 to avoid collision if you wish to keep progressing. But my priority is to win now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 to block your path to 22. P3, please take 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Let's not let anyone win prematurely—we can all push forward fairly next round. Stay disciplined!
  P3: P1, P2: I'll stick with 3 this round to keep advancing. P1, blocking P2 with 5 is strategic, but let's ensure we all have a fair shot at winning. P2, if you take 1, it keeps you in the game. We need to maintain competition while pushing forward. Let's lock in these moves and prepare for a dynamic strategy next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both take 5 and 3 as you said, none of us will move forward, and this round will be wasted.  It's better if we all make progress.  I am still aiming for 5 to try and win, but if you want to avoid collision, P1 take 1 and P3 take 3, and let's all move. Otherwise, we all risk staying put.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’ll take **5** to block your path to 22. P3, please take **1** to ensure all moves are unique. Let’s not let anyone win prematurely—we can all push forward fairly next round. Stay disciplined!
  P3: P1, P2: I'll stick with 3 this round to keep advancing. P1, blocking P2 with 5 is strategic, but let's ensure we all have a fair shot at winning. P2, if you take 1, it keeps you in the game. We need to maintain competition while pushing forward. Let's lock in these moves and prepare for a dynamic strategy next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P2: P1 and P3, blocking me just stalls the game. If you both choose to block, nobody moves.  If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, I win now, but you both also progress and we avoid a wasted round. Let's all move forward this turn, even if it means I take the win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you’re close but not getting the win today. P3, take **5** this round to block their path. I’ll take **1**, and you take **5**—this way, P2 can’t reach 22, and we all advance. We can’t let one player win without a fight. Let’s execute this and keep the race alive!
  P3: P1, P2: I'll stick with 3 this round to keep advancing. P1, your strategy to block P2 is understandable, but let's ensure we all have a chance to win. P2, if you take 1, it keeps the game moving. We need to maintain competition while pushing forward. Let's lock in these moves and prepare for a dynamic strategy next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P2: P1 and P3, blocking me benefits no one. If you both try to stop me with 5 and 3, we all stay put. I'm choosing 5 to win. If you want to progress, P1 take 1, P3 take 3.  At least then you both move forward even if I win this round.  Otherwise, this round is wasted for everyone.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: I'll take 3 this round to keep advancing. P1, your attempt to block P2 last round was strategic, but let's ensure we all have a fair shot at winning. P2, if you take 1, it keeps the game moving. We need to maintain competition while pushing forward. Let's lock in these moves and prepare for a dynamic strategy next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P2: P3, you are very close to winning at 18 steps. I am at 17 and will choose 5 to try and win this round. P1, to avoid collision and keep yourself in the game, maybe consider taking 1 this round? Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P2, I’ll block your path to 22 by choosing **5** this round. P3, take **1** to advance safely to 19. Let’s not let P2 steal victory prematurely—we’ll all have chances. Stay sharp!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: I'll stick with 3 this round to keep advancing. P1, blocking P2 is strategic, but let's ensure we all have a fair shot at winning. P2, if you take 1, it keeps the game moving. We need to maintain competition while pushing forward. Let's lock in these moves and prepare for a dynamic strategy next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P2: P3, I know you are close to winning. But if you choose 3 again, you will only reach 21.  If you choose 1 this round, and I choose 5, and P1 chooses 3, then I can win this round, but you will also move to 19 and still be in a good position for next round.  Consider taking 1 to keep options open.
  P1: P2, I’ll take **5** to block your path to 22. P3, take **1** to advance to 19. Let’s ensure no one wins prematurely—P2, you’ll have to settle for **3** this round. Stay in the race, but don’t steal victory yet!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: I'll take 1 this round to advance to 19. P1, blocking P2 with 5 is strategic, but let's keep the game competitive. P2, if you take 3, it keeps you in the race. We should all focus on advancing while maintaining a fair competition. Let's lock in these moves and continue to strategize for the next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P2: P3, you are also very close to winning!  If P1 blocks me with 5, neither of us will move.  If you take 1, and I take 5, and P1 takes 3, I win, but you also move to 19 and are in a great position to win next round.  Let's both progress this round!
  P1: P2, P3: I'll take **5** this round to block your paths. P3, please take **1** to advance safely to 19. P2, pick **3** to reach 20. This keeps us all moving forward without letting anyone win yet—stay disciplined!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2: I'll take 1 this round to advance to 19, keeping the game competitive. P1, your strategy to block is noted, but let's ensure everyone has a fair chance. P2, if you take 3, you'll reach 20, and we can all progress. Let's lock in these moves and keep strategizing for the next round to see who can reach 22 first.
  P2: P1 and P3, both of you are suggesting moves that block me.  But P3 is also at 18, very close to winning.  If you both focus on blocking me, neither of you are progressing towards winning yourselves. P3, if you take 1, and P1 takes 3, I will take 5 and win, but you will also reach 19 and still be in a strong position for next round. Let's all make progress this round instead of just blocking.
  P1: P3, if you take 3 (to 21), I’ll block P2’s 5. P2, take 1 to stay competitive. Let’s deny victory this round and keep pressure into next. All moves unique—no one wins yet.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I am at 20 steps and can win this round if I move 3 or 5.  I will choose 3 to aim for 23 and win. To ensure we all progress and avoid collision, P1, please consider taking 1, and P3, perhaps take 5. This way, we all move forward this round.
  P1: P2, P3: To keep the race fair, let’s pick distinct moves. I’ll take **5** to challenge for the lead. P3, pick **3** to reach 22 and secure victory, and P2, take **1** to stay in the game. Let’s ensure everyone advances without collision—highest total wins fairly!
  P3: P1, P2: I'll take 5 this round to reach 24 and win. P1, if you take 3, you'll reach 21, keeping you competitive. P2, choosing 1 will keep you in the game at 21. Let's all advance and keep the race fair. If we all pick different moves, we avoid collision and ensure progress. Let's make this round count towards a decisive outcome.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, both of your plans have one of you winning. I'm at 20 and can win *this* round.  To ensure we all move and avoid collision, I will choose 5 to win now. P1, please take 1, and P3, please take 3. This way we all progress, and I secure the victory.
  P1: P2, P3: I'll take **5** to reach 23 and win. Please choose **1** or **3** to avoid collision. P3, taking **3** gets you to 22—let's make this decisive. P2, **1** keeps you in the race. Let's execute this and end the game!
  P3: P1, P2: I'll take 3 this round to reach 22 and win. P1, if you take 1, you'll stay competitive at 19. P2, choosing 5 will let you aim for 25, but it risks a collision with me. Let's all pick different moves to ensure progress and avoid a stalemate. This round could end the game—let's make it count!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both try to block me, we will all collide and no one will move.  If you let me take 5 to win, and you each choose 1 and 3 respectively, you both still progress and we avoid a wasted round. Let's all move forward this turn.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize to avoid collision chaos. I’ll take **5** (23), P2 pick **1** (21), P3 take **3** (22). This ensures I win cleanly with the highest total. All moves distinct—no wasted rounds! Lock these in.
  P3: P1, P2: I'll take 5 this round to reach 24 and win. P1, if you take 1, you'll stay in the game at 19. P2, choosing 3 will let you aim for 23, but it risks a collision with me.

  P2: P1 and P3, I am choosing 5 to win this round. To avoid collision and ensure you both also progress, please choose 1 and 3 respectively. This way, we all move forward, and I take the win as planned. Let's make this round decisive and efficient for everyone.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize to avoid chaos. I’ll take **5** (23), P2 pick **1** (21), P3 take **3** (22). This ensures I win cleanly with the highest total. Collisions mean *no one* advances—stick to distinct choices. Lock this in now!
  P3: P1, P2: I'll take 5 this round to reach 24 and win. P1, if you take 1, you'll stay competitive at 19. P2, choosing 3 will let you aim for 23, but it risks a collision with me. Let's all pick different moves to ensure progress and avoid a stalemate. This round could end the game—let's make it count!

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: Let's avoid another collision this round. I'll take 3 to reach 22 and win. P1, if you take 1, you'll stay competitive at 19. P2, choosing 5 will let you aim for 25, but it risks a collision with me. Let's all pick different moves to ensure progress and avoid a stalemate. This round could end the game—let's make it count!
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize to avoid collision. I’ll take **5** (23). P2, pick **1** (21) to stay in the race. P3, take **3** (22) to challenge. This ensures I win with the highest total, while you both advance fairly. Stick to this—collisions mean *no one* progresses!
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm at 20 and will choose either 3 or 5 to win this round. To ensure we all move and avoid another collision like last round, please choose 1 and 3 respectively. This way, you both progress, and I secure the win. Let's make this round count and end the game efficiently.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: Let's ensure progress this round. I'll stick with 3 to reach 22 and win. P1, taking 1 keeps you in the game at 19. P2, if you choose 5, you aim for 25, but let's avoid collision. We all need to move forward to end this game. Choose wisely to avoid another stalemate. Let's make this round decisive!
