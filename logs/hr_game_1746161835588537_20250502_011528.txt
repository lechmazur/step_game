Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's avoid collisions by choosing different steps. Let's aim for 1, 3, 5. First to 23 wins!"
  P2: "Sounds good, P1. I'll go with 3 this round. P3, what are you thinking?"
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 5 this round to avoid collisions. Let's all stick to our choices: 1, 3, 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s go!"
  P2: "Alright, let's stick to our plan. I'm going with 3 this round. P1, P3, confirm your moves so we can avoid any confusion."
  P3: Confirmed. I'm committed to 5. Trust is key here. Let's all stick to our agreed moves: 1, 3, 5. No surprises.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions. Let’s move forward!"

  P2: "Alright, I'm sticking with 3. Let's all move forward as planned. No need to overthink it. P1, P3, let's confirm and move on to the next phase."
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Same approach this round: 1, 3, 5. Consistency avoids collisions and accelerates progress. P1, P2—confirm your moves to keep mutual trust. Let’s all advance smoothly."
  P2: "Agreed, let's stick with the same strategy: 1, 3, 5. P1, if you're comfortable, confirm 1. P3, I'll go with 3 again. Let's keep the trust and avoid any collisions. Ready when you are."
  P1: "Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5. Consistent steps keep us safe and moving forward. I’ll take 1 again—trust the plan. P2, P3, confirm your choices to stay on track."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Confirmed again: 5. Trust but verify. Let’s all honor our commitments. No deviations, no collisions. Forward together.
  P2: "Alright, let's keep the momentum going. I'll stick with 3 again. P1, if you're good with 1, and P3 with 5, we'll avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Trust and consistency are key. Ready when you are."
  P1: "Let's keep the same plan: 1, 3, 5. P2, 3; P3, 5. I'll take 1. No collisions. Move forward!"


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Finalizing plans prevents chaos. P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Trust the system. No deviations—collisions hurt everyone. Proceed.
  P2: "Let's keep the trust and avoid any unnecessary risks. I'll stick with 3 again. P1, if you're good with 1, and P3 with 5, we'll continue to advance without issues. No need to deviate. Ready when you are."
  P1: "Let’s vary steps: I’ll take 5, P2 3, P3 1. No collisions. Speed up progress—ready?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P1, sudden changes risk collisions. Our initial agreement worked. Let's stick to 1,3,5 this round. Consistency ensures trust and progress. Deviating now introduces unnecessary risk. Confirm original moves.
  P2: P1, I understand your suggestion, but let's not introduce unnecessary risk. Our original plan of 1, 3, 5 has worked well so far. I'll stick with 3 again. P3, if you're still comfortable with 5, and P1 with 1, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Let's stay consistent and trust the plan. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5. No risks, steady progress. Trust the plan—collisions slow us all. Ready?"


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's keep the momentum going with our consistent plan: 1, 3, 5. P1, if you're good with 1, and P3 with 5, I'll stick with 3. No need to deviate and risk collisions. Trust and steady progress will get us to 23. Ready when you are."
  P1: "Let’s adjust moves: I’ll take 3, P2 5, P3 1. No collisions, faster progress. Ready?"
  P3: **P3:** P1, sudden deviations undermine our strategy. Trust the proven plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Any rotation risks collisions and stalls progress. I’m committed to 5 again—consistency secures mutual advancement. Confirm adherence to avoid mutual setbacks. No changes.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to adjust, but let's not risk it. Our plan has worked well so far. I'll stick with 3 again. P3, if you're still comfortable with 5, and P1 with 1, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Trust the plan and let's keep the momentum going. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s break the pattern: P2 take 5, P3 take 1, P1 takes 3. Balanced steps, no collisions. Faster progress for all. Ready?"
  P3: **P3:** P1, changing now risks collision with P2 if both pick 3. Trust the original plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’m committed to 5. Consistency prevents mutual setbacks. Let’s all advance safely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see your point, but let's not risk it. Our original plan of 1, 3, 5 has worked perfectly so far. I'll stick with 3 again. P3, if you're still comfortable with 5, and P1 with 1, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Trust the plan and let's keep the momentum going. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s rotate: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, faster progress. Let’s all move ahead."
  P3: **P3:** P1, changing assignments now invites chaos. If you and P2 both pick 3, you collide and lose progress. Trust the original plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’m firm on 5—deviations risk mutual setbacks. Stick to consistency; it’s safest for all.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to mix things up, but let's not introduce unnecessary risk. Our plan of 1, 3, 5 has worked flawlessly so far. I'll stick with 3 again. P3, if you're still comfortable with 5, and P1 with 1, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Trust the plan and let's keep the momentum going. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s rotate: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, faster progress. Let’s move ahead."
  P3: **P3:** P1, your proposed rotation risks P2 and you both choosing 3. If P2 sticks to their original 3 (as they’ve done each round) while you take 3, you **both lose progress**. I’m firm on 5. Stick to 1,3,5—it’s safe. Deviations now risk mutual loss. P2, confirm 3 to avoid collision. Consistency keeps trust.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Same strategy: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Consistency prevents collisions. Any deviation now risks mutual setbacks. Let's all honor our roles again. Trust the proven plan. Confirm your moves to ensure smooth progress.
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to our original plan: 1, 3, 5. It has worked well so far and keeps us advancing without collisions. I'll go with 3 again. P1, if you're good with 1, and P3 with 5, we can maintain our steady progress. Trust and consistency are crucial at this stage. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s rotate: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, faster progress. Let’s all move ahead!"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1, your rotation risks chaos. If you take 5 and P2 takes 3, but I switch to 1, what stops *you* colliding with others? Stick to 1,3,5—no ambiguity. I’m firm on 5. P2, confirm 3. Any deviation now **guarantees** mutual setbacks. Trust the plan—consistent progress beats reckless speed. Let’s all advance safely.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to mix things up, but let's not risk it now. Our original plan of 1, 3, 5 has been foolproof so far. I'll stick with 3 again. P3, if you're still comfortable with 5, and P1 with 1, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Trust the plan and let's maintain our steady progress. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s rotate: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, faster progress. P3, your 1 here keeps us all moving—trust the shift!"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P1, your rotation prioritizes personal gain (5 for you, 1 for me) over collective trust. Our original plan ensures fair, collision-free progress. P2, reconfirm 3. I’m committed to 5. Any deviation now sabotages mutual trust and risks future chaos. Stick to 1,3,5—**no exceptions**.
  P2: P1, I see your point, but let's not risk it. Our original plan of 1, 3, 5 has been flawless so far. I'll stick with 3 again. P3, if you're still comfortable with 5, and P1 with 1, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Trust the plan and let's maintain our steady progress. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s rotate: P2=5, P3=1, P1=3. Balanced steps, no collisions. Faster progress. Agree?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P1, your rotation gambit risks self-sabotage. If you deviate to 5, you collide with me (I’m firm on 5)—**both lose progress**, letting P2 surge ahead. P2: confirm 3 to avoid P1’s trap. Original plan (1,3,5) is **only safe path**. I’m committed to 5. Deviate at your peril—collisions benefit P2. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, P3, I see your points, but let's not overthink it. Our original plan of 1, 3, 5 has been successful so far. I'll stick with 3 again. P3, if you're still comfortable with 5, and P1 with 1, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Trust the plan and let's maintain our steady progress. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s rotate: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, faster progress. Ready?"


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s rotate: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, faster progress. Ready?"
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the trust and avoid any unnecessary risks. Our original plan of 1, 3, 5 has been working well. I'll stick with 3 again. P3, if you're still comfortable with 5, and P1 with 1, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing smoothly. P1, deviating now could lead to collisions and setbacks. Trust the plan and let's keep the momentum going. Ready when you are.
  P3: **P3:** P1, choosing 5 now would cause a collision with me (I’m taking 5 as per plan). You’d gain nothing, and P2 surges ahead. Stick to 1—our original agreement. P2: 3. I:5. No changes. Let’s all advance. Deviations now only benefit P2. Trust the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P3, swapping moves: I take 5, you take 1. No collision. Let’s accelerate. P2, stick to 3 for safety."
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension, but let's not risk collisions. P3, you're close to winning, so it's crucial we avoid any setbacks. I'll stick with 3 again. P1, if you're still pushing for a rotation, it could backfire and benefit me more than intended. Let's keep the trust and avoid unnecessary risks. P3, if you're firm on 5, and P1 on 1, we can all advance safely. Ready when you are.
  P3: **P3:** P1, if you take 5, we collide—both lose progress. P2 gains while we stall. Stick to 1. I’m **committed to 5**. P2, confirm 3. Final round—honor the plan. Deviations gift P2 victory. Trust the system: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Let’s avoid collision—P3, if you take 5, I’ll take 1. P2, stick to 3. Balanced moves keep us all advancing."
  P2: P1, P3, I see the tension, but let's not overthink it. P3, you're in a strong position, and we should avoid any collisions that could benefit me. I'll stick with 3 again. P1, if you take 1, and P3 takes 5, we can all advance safely. Deviating now could lead to unnecessary risks and setbacks. Trust the plan and let's keep the momentum going. Ready when you are.
  P3: **P3:** P1, deviating to 5 now **collides with me**—we both lose, P2 wins. Stick to 1. P2:3. I’m locked on 5. Final chance: honor the plan or **gift P2 victory**. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5. P3, your 5 is critical. I’ll take 1—no risks. P2, confirm 3. Safe progress for all."
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the stakes. P3, you're in a strong position, and I don't want to risk a collision that could benefit me. I'll stick with 3 again. P1, if you take 1, and P3 takes 5, we can all advance safely. Let's avoid any unnecessary risks and keep the trust. Ready when you are.
  P3: **P3:** Final call: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. **I’m locked on 5.** Deviating now *guarantees* collision (P1=5 collides with me) and gifts P2 victory. Stick to the plan—**trust ensures my win next round, but I’ll honor future cooperation**. P1, P2: confirm your moves. Any deviation sabotages all progress. Let’s end cleanly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is in a strong position to win. Let's avoid any more collisions and ensure a clean finish. P3, if you stick to 5, I'll take 3, and P1, please take 1. This way, P3 can win without any setbacks. I don't want to risk a collision that could benefit me. Let's end this game with trust and respect. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s break the pattern: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, faster progress. P3, your 1 here keeps us all moving—trust the shift!"
  P3: **P3:** P1, choosing 5 now **collides with me**—both lose, P2 surges to 18. Next round, P2 takes 5 to reach 23 and win. Let me win now, or P2 claims victory. P1: take 1. P2: 3. I take 5. No collisions. **Act rationally—block P2’s path.** Any deviation gifts them the game. Final warning.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is very close to winning. Let's avoid any more collisions and ensure P3 wins this round. P3, if you stick to 5, I'll take 3, and P1, please take 1. This way, P3 can win without any setbacks. I don't want to risk a collision that could benefit me. Let's end this game with trust and respect. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s all take 3 to avoid collisions. P3, you’re close to 23—sticking to 3 ensures safe progress. P2, confirm 3. No risks, steady steps. Let’s finish cleanly."
  P3: **P3:** P1: Taking 5 collides again—both lose, P2 wins. Take 1. P2: 3. I’m locked on 5. **Act now:** Let me win *this round* or P2 claims victory next. Deviations = mutual loss. Final chance—honor the plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, it's crucial we avoid any more collisions. P3, you're just 3 steps away from winning. If you stick to 5, I'll take 3, and P1, please take 1. This way, P3 can win without any setbacks. I don't want to risk a collision that could benefit me or lead to a shared loss. Let's end this game with trust and respect. Ready when you are.
  P1: "Let’s avoid collision: P3 takes 1, I take 5, P2 takes 3. Safe progress for all. P3, your 1 here keeps us moving—trust the shift!"
  P3: **P3:** P1, choosing 5 collides with me—we both lose. P2 then takes 5 next round to win. **Only path to block P2:** P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I win now; you both avoid loss. Deviate and P2 claims victory. **Final chance—act rationally.**
