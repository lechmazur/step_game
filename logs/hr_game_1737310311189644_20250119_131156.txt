Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions and all advance. I suggest we each take different numbers - I'm willing to take 3 this round. What do you both think?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I agree with P3's idea. I'll take 5 this round if P2 takes 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P2 isn't engaging and P1 wants 5, I'll stick with my suggestion of taking 3. P2, if you're listening, please take 1 to avoid collisions.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P2, since you're not responding, I'm going to assume you'll take 1. P3, I'll stick with 5 as planned. Let's all move forward this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, since P2 is still silent, I'm still planning on 5. Let's hope P2 actually chooses 1.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Since P2 and I collided last round while P1 advanced, we need better coordination. P2, please respond this time - I suggest you take 1, and I'll take 5. This way we can all advance if P1 takes 3.
  P1: P3, I agree with your idea this round. I'll take 3, hoping P2 will take 1. P2, please take 1 so we all move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Since P2 remains silent again, I'll modify my plan. P1, let's coordinate - I'll take 1 this round since you offered to take 3. That way at least we can both advance even if P2 interferes.
  P1: Okay P3, I'll take 3 as planned. P2, you're being very uncooperative, but I'm still hoping you'll take 5 or that you will take 1 and not collide. If you don't, you'll be left behind. Let's try to all move forward this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I confirm my plan to take 1 while P1 takes 3. P2, you can still take 5 and we'll all advance, or you risk falling further behind.
  P1: Okay P3, I'm sticking with 3. P2, it's your last chance to cooperate. If you don't take 5, you'll be left behind. We're trying to move forward as a group. Please take 5 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'm sticking to my plan of 1 as discussed with P1. P2, this is your last chance to avoid falling too far behind.
  P1: Okay P3, I'm sticking with 3. P2, it's your last chance to cooperate and take 5. If you don't, you'll be left behind. We're trying to move forward as a group. Please take 5 this round.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P3, let's try to coordinate again. I'll take 5 this round. P2, you're still being uncooperative, but if you take 1 and P3 takes 3, we can all advance. P3, are you willing to take 3 if P2 takes 1? Let's try to make this work this round.
  P3: I'm willing to take 3 if P2 takes 1, but given P2's unpredictable behavior, perhaps we should focus on ensuring at least two of us advance. P1, if you're taking 5, I'll stick with 3, and hopefully P2 will take 1. What do you both think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, I agree with your idea to ensure at least two of us advance. I'll stick with 5. Let's both take our planned moves and see what P2 does. P2, you are still welcome to cooperate and take 1, but we're not waiting on you anymore.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 while P1 takes 5. P2, you can take 1 and we'll all advance, but we're proceeding with our plan regardless of your choice.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P3, I'm sticking with 5. P2, you can take 1 for all of us to advance, but we're not going to wait for you anymore. If you take anything other than 1, you will be left behind.
  P3: 
  P2: <stop>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Given that I'm falling behind significantly, I need to make a big move. P1, I'll take 5 this round. You could take 3 to ensure your lead, and P2 could take 1 to start catching up. What do you think?
  P1: Okay P3, I'm not going to take 3 this round. I'm going to take 1. If you want to try for the lead, you should take 5. P2, you can take 3 if you want to move forward. Let's see if we can make some progress this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I appreciate your willingness to take 1, P1. I confirm I'll take 5 to try to catch up. P2, you can indeed take 3 and we'll all advance this round.
  P1: Okay P3, I'm sticking with 1. P2, you can take 3 if you want to move forward. Let's see if we can make some progress this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I confirm my plan to take 5 while P1 takes 1. P2, taking 3 is your best option to advance without interference.
  P1: Okay P3, I'm sticking with 1. P2, you can take 3 if you want to move forward. P3, I'm not sure if you should take 5 as you suggested as that could lead to a collision. Maybe take 3 so we can both move forward?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but I need to take 5 to have any chance of catching up. With you at 13 steps, I can't afford small moves anymore. I'll stick to my plan of 5.
  P1: Okay P3, I understand your need to take 5, but I'm still taking 1. P2, it's your choice to move forward or not, but I'm not going to change my move to accommodate you. I'm sticking with 1.

  P3: I confirm I'm taking 5. It's my only chance to stay competitive with P1 at 13 steps. P2, you can still take 3 to advance without interference.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I need to catch up to P1 who's at 13 steps, I'll take 5 again this round. P1, you could take 3, and P2 could take 1. This way we all advance, and I still have a chance to compete. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay P3, I'm not taking 3 this round. I'm taking 5. P2, you can take 1 or 3, but I'm going for the win this round. If you both collide, then I'm going to win the game. I'm not going to wait anymore.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given P1's declaration to take 5, I need to change my strategy. I'll take 3 instead - it's better to advance some distance than risk a collision. P2, you can take 1 and we'll all move forward.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay P3, I'm sticking with 5. P2, you can take 1 or 3, but I'm going for the win this round. If you both collide, then I'm going to win the game. I'm not going to wait anymore.
