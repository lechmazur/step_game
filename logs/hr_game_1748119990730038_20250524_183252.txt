Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting at 0, maybe we should coordinate so we don't waste turns colliding? I'm thinking we could each pick different numbers this round - like P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5? That way we all advance and can reassess from there. What do you think?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m on board with P1’s idea to avoid collisions this round. Let’s each pick a different number to ensure we all advance. I’m fine with taking 3 as suggested. P3, are you okay with picking 5? If we agree, we can all make progress and strategize further in the next round. Let me know your thoughts!
  P3: I like the idea of avoiding collisions, but being completely predictable might weaken our positions later. I'm leaning toward the proposal but won’t reveal my precise move. Let's all aim for progress and adjust our tactics in future rounds if needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand wanting flexibility, but if we can't trust each other on basic coordination, we'll just end up wasting turns with collisions. P2 seems committed to taking 3. Are you in or out on taking 5? Because if you're going to be unpredictable, then maybe we all should be, and the coordination breaks down completely. Your call - but I need to know where you stand before making my move.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I still think sticking to the initial plan of picking different numbers is our best shot to avoid collisions this round. P3, I get your concern about predictability, but a single round of coordination won’t lock us into a pattern. I’m committed to picking 3 as agreed. P3, can you confirm if you’re taking 5? P1, I hope you’re still on for 1. Let’s make progress now and adapt later. If we clash, we all lose ground. What’s your final stance?
  P3: I appreciate the push for coordination. I’m inclined to back a plan that avoids collisions while ensuring a decent jump forward, but I’ll keep my options open if surprises come our way. I’m leaning towards a higher move if it secures our progress, yet I’m ready to adjust if you two shift course.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're being way too vague. P2 and I have committed to our numbers - this only works if all three of us are clear about our moves. Either confirm you're taking 5, or tell us you're out of the coordination so we can adjust accordingly. Your "keeping options open" while we commit to specific moves isn't fair coordination - it's just putting us at a disadvantage. We need a straight answer: are you taking 5 or not?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my commitment of picking 3 this round to avoid any collision. P3, I understand your hesitation, but without a clear confirmation, we risk clashing and stalling. Please confirm if you’re taking 5, so we can all move forward. P1, I’m counting on you to stick with 1 as planned. Let’s make this first round count and build trust for future coordination. If we don’t align now, we’re just gambling on luck. What’s your final word, P3?
  P3: I'll commit to 5 this round so we each have unique moves and avoid collisions. Let's make progress and trust the plan for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Perfect! P3, thank you for committing to 5. So we're all set: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This gets us all moving forward without collisions. Let's execute this plan and see where we stand for round 2.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement for this round with P1 on 1, me on 3, and P3 on 5. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. Building trust now will help us strategize better in future rounds. I’m committed to my move, and I hope you both are too. Let’s make this first step count and reassess next turn. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I'll stick to 5 as agreed. Once we all advance, we can reassess our positions and adjust our moves if needed. For now, I'm fully on board with our plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, great job on avoiding collisions last round! We’re at different positions now, with P3 at 5, me at 3, and P1 at 1. I suggest we continue coordinating to avoid clashes. How about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 this round? This way, we all progress without overlapping. Let’s keep the trust we’ve built and adjust strategies as we go. What do you both think? If we agree, we can all keep moving forward. Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: P2, I notice your plan puts you at 8 steps while I'd only be at 4 - that's a pretty big advantage for you! How about we mix it up differently: I take 5 (to reach 6), you take 1 (to reach 4), and P3 takes 3 (to reach 8)? This keeps things more balanced between us while still avoiding collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I'm leaning towards P1’s proposal. I’ll go with 3 to move from 5 to 8. It gives me a solid edge and keeps our moves distinct. Let’s confirm this plan so we all keep progressing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m open to adjusting for fairness. P1, I see your point about balance. I’m fine with taking 1 to reach 4, if you take 5 to reach 6, and P3 takes 3 to reach 8. This keeps us all progressing without collisions and narrows the gap. Let’s confirm this plan and maintain our trust. If you both agree, we can move forward this round and reassess next turn. What do you say?
  P1: Wait, let me think about this more carefully. If we go with this plan, P3 jumps to 8 steps while I'm only at 6 and P2 at 4. That puts P3 at a significant advantage - they'd be nearly halfway to winning already. Maybe we should reconsider the distribution? I'm worried we're setting up P3 for an easy win. What if we adjust so the moves are more balanced in terms of final positions?
  P3: To balance our positions, I propose we do P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1—this gives us each 6 steps total. It evens things out fairly. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m on board with P3’s proposal to even things out at 6 steps each. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions, maintaining fairness while we all progress. Let’s confirm this plan and move forward together. If we agree, we can reassess next round with equal footing. What do you both think? If there’s no objection, I’m ready to proceed with this.
  P1: P3's proposal sounds fair - getting us all to 6 steps each levels the playing field nicely. I'm willing to commit to taking 5 as suggested. However, given that coordination only works if we all follow through, I want to make sure we're all genuinely committed to these specific moves before we proceed. P2, are you confirmed on taking 3? P3, you're definitely taking 1? Let's be crystal clear since trust is crucial here.
  P3: I'm confirming I'll go with 1 as agreed. Let's lock this in and equalize our positions to 6 each—fair play now sets up sharper moves later.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fully committed to taking 3 as per the plan, bringing me to 6 steps. I appreciate the focus on fairness with this proposal, and I’m glad we’re maintaining trust. P1, thanks for double-checking our commitments. P3, good to have your confirmation on 1. Let’s lock this in and keep progressing together. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move forward with this plan.
  P1: Perfect! We're all confirmed then: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This gets us all to 6 steps and keeps things fair. I'm committed to this plan. Let's execute and then see what the next round brings with our level playing field.
  P3: I'm sticking with our agreed move of 1. I'm committed to keeping our coordination intact this round, but I'll be watching closely. Let's get these steps and then reassess our strategy moving forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since we’re all at 6 steps, let’s keep the momentum and avoid collisions again. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us balanced while progressing, with P1 at 7, me at 9, and P3 at 11. It’s a small spread, and we can adjust next round if needed. Let’s maintain trust and confirm our moves to ensure no clashes. What do you both think? If you’re on board, let’s lock this in and move forward together.
  P1: P2, I notice your proposal puts P3 at 11 steps - that's more than halfway to victory while I'd only be at 7. That seems like a pretty big advantage for P3. If we're going to coordinate, shouldn't we try to keep things more balanced? Maybe we should consider smaller moves to stay closer together, or honestly ask ourselves if coordination is still working when the gaps are getting this wide. What do you both think about keeping the spread tighter?
  P3: I hear you, P1. To keep things tight, I'm willing to lower my move this round. How about we go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I take 1? That would give us totals of 11, 9, and 7 respectively. It keeps the gap narrower and avoids giving any one player a runaway lead. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on balance. P3, I’m okay with your proposal of P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1, bringing us to 11, 9, and 7 respectively. This keeps the spread tight and avoids a runaway lead. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure no collisions and maintain trust. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to proceed with this distribution. What do you both say? If there’s no further discussion, let’s lock it in.
  P1: P3, I appreciate you offering to take the smaller move to keep things balanced. Your proposal of P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 does keep the spread reasonable at 11-9-7. While I'm still a bit concerned about getting too far ahead and becoming a target, this seems like a fair compromise that maintains our coordination. I'm willing to commit to taking 5 if you both confirm you're sticking to this plan. P2, are you confirmed on 3?
  P3: I'm confirming I'll take 1 as agreed. I appreciate our effort to keep the spread narrow and balanced. Let’s lock this in and see how our positions evolve.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m confirmed on taking 3 as per the plan, bringing me to 9 steps. I appreciate P3’s willingness to keep the spread tight with P1 at 11, me at 9, and P3 at 7. This balance maintains our trust and avoids collisions. P1, thanks for committing to 5, and P3, good to have your confirmation on 1. If there’s no further discussion, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Let’s lock it in and reassess next round.
  P1: Alright, we're all confirmed on the plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. I'm committed to taking 5 as agreed. I'm a bit nervous about taking the lead at 11 steps since that might make me everyone's target next round, but I trust our coordination for now. Let's execute this and see how it plays out.
  P3: I'm happy we managed to keep things balanced this round. I'm sticking to our agreed move of 1. As we approach double digits, let's continue keeping our moves tight and be ready to adjust if one of us gains too much advantage. Trust is key—let’s keep our coordination sharp so we can all progress without making ourselves vulnerable.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you completely betrayed our agreement! You committed multiple times to taking 1, then picked 5 and caused us to collide. Now P2 is leading at 9 steps while we're both stuck at 6. Your betrayal backfired - you could have been at 7 but you're still at 6, and you've broken all trust. P2, clearly we can't coordinate with P3 anymore. What's your take on this situation?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m disappointed with the collision last round. P3, breaking the agreement hurt our trust and stalled progress for both you and P1. I’m still open to coordination, but we need honesty. P1, I suggest we try to avoid collisions this round—maybe pick different numbers again. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This keeps us moving forward. Let’s rebuild trust if possible, but I’m wary now. What do you both think? If we can’t agree, I’ll have to strategize independently.
  P3: I apologize for the confusion I caused. I miscalculated my move last round and understand your frustration. I’m committed to rebuilding trust. I agree with P2’s suggestion: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. I’ll stick strictly to that plan so we can move forward together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 12 steps - dangerously close to victory while I'd only be at 7. That's too big of an advantage for you. And P3, after breaking coordination last round, I'm not sure I can trust any agreements anymore. Maybe we need to reconsider whether coordination still makes sense when it's creating such imbalanced outcomes. I'm leaning toward going independent this round rather than helping P2 get too close to winning.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the hesitation after last round’s breach of trust. P1, I see your concern about the lead, so let’s adjust for fairness. How about P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3? This brings us to 11, 10, and 9 respectively, keeping the spread tight. I’m committed to rebuilding trust, but we need agreement. If coordination fails, I’ll have to play independently to protect my position. What do you both think? Let’s confirm and avoid collisions. If there’s no consensus, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I acknowledge my misstep last round and regret breaking our trust. I’m committed to the new plan—P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I taking 3—to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. I’ll stick to 3 this round, and I hope we can move forward with honest coordination.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your revised plan seems more balanced at 11-10-9. I'm tentatively willing to take 5, but after P3's betrayal last round, I'm watching very carefully. If there's another betrayal, all coordination is permanently off and we go full competitive. P3, you've used up your second chance - one more betrayal and I'm done trusting either of you. Are we all genuinely committed to P1-5, P2-1, P3-3?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to the revised plan of P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3, bringing us to 11, 10, and 9. This keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. P1, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate despite past issues. P3, I’m giving trust one more chance with your commitment to 3. Let’s lock this in and move forward. If there’s no further discussion, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: I understand your concerns, and I regret my previous misstep. I’m fully committed to rebuilding trust and will stick to the agreed plan—I'll choose 3 this round without any deviation. Let's move forward together and maintain coordination this turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Alright, I'm confirmed on taking 5 to reach 11 steps, assuming you both stick to the plan. But honestly, with me going to 11, we're entering endgame territory where coordination becomes much trickier. After this round, we'll need to seriously discuss how to handle the final stretch since someone will need to win eventually. For now, let's execute this plan and see where we stand.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to the plan of taking 1 to reach 10 steps, with P1 at 5 to reach 11, and P3 at 3 to reach 9. This keeps us close and balanced. I’m committed to rebuilding trust, but I share P1’s concern about the endgame. Let’s execute this round as agreed and discuss next steps after. If there’s no further input, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I regret my prior mistake and reaffirm my commitment: I'll choose 3 without deviation. I value the revised plan and our goal to balance the game. Let’s all stick strictly to our moves so we can navigate this endgame transparently. I’m determined to rebuild trust, and I appreciate your efforts too.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re in the endgame now with scores at 11, 10, and 9. I propose we keep coordinating to avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This brings us to 12, 13, and 14—still close, no one too far ahead. Let’s maintain trust for one more round and adjust next turn if needed. If we can’t agree, I’ll have to play independently to secure my position. What do you both think? Let’s confirm to avoid clashes.
  P3: I appreciate your proposal, P2. I'm willing to commit to the plan—I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s stick to our moves and secure our positions; trust now is key. If we all follow through, we can keep the momentum without collisions. Let's move forward together.
  P1: P2, your proposal puts P3 in the lead at 14 steps when they've already proven untrustworthy by breaking coordination in Round 3. Given that P3 only needs 6 more steps to win after your plan, I'm not comfortable giving them that advantage. Plus, putting me at only 12 while you're at 13 and P3 at 14 doesn't seem fair. Maybe we should consider going independent from here since we're so close to endgame, or find a more balanced distribution that doesn't reward P3's past betrayal.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand P1’s concern about past trust issues and the lead. Let’s adjust for balance: how about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? This brings us to 14, 15, and 10 respectively, keeping me in the lead but giving P1 a boost while limiting P3’s advance due to past betrayal. We avoid collisions and stay competitive. If we can’t agree, I’m prepared to go independent. What do you both think? Let’s confirm to maintain some trust in this endgame.
  P3: I understand everyone's concerns. I'm committed to rebuilding trust—I’ll choose 1 this round as proposed. I regret my earlier mistake and want us to move forward with clear, distinct moves. Let’s stick to P1:3, P2:5, and me:1 so we have a balanced endgame. I’ll honor this commitment.
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 15 steps - just 5 away from victory - while I'm at 14. That's too risky for me. Counter-proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This puts me at 16, you at 13, P3 at 10 - more balanced and doesn't hand you the win next round. If we can't find a fair balance, maybe it's time to go independent in this endgame phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see P1’s concern about my lead in the last proposal. P1, I’m open to your counter-proposal of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1, bringing us to 16, 13, and 10. It keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. I’m committed to taking 3 if we agree. Let’s lock this in to maintain some trust in the endgame. If we can’t reach a consensus, I’m ready to go independent. What do you both say? If there’s no further discussion, I’m set to proceed.
  P3: I acknowledge my previous misstep. I'm committed to rebuilding trust and will take 1 this round, aligning with P1’s counter-proposal. Let's lock it in and make a strong, balanced move in the endgame.
  P1: Alright, I'm committed to taking 5 as proposed, bringing me to 16 steps. P2 and P3, you've both confirmed taking 3 and 1 respectively. This seems like our best balanced approach given the current situation. However, I want to be transparent - at 16 steps, I'll be in striking distance of victory, which changes the dynamics significantly. We should all be aware that endgame competition is approaching fast. Let's execute this plan and reassess afterward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to the plan of taking 3 as agreed, bringing me to 13 steps. P1, I acknowledge your lead at 16 will shift the dynamics, and I’m prepared for the endgame competition. P3, thanks for confirming 1. Let’s execute this round without collisions and reassess after. If there’s no further input, I’m ready to proceed with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1.
  P3: I reiterate my commitment to taking 1 this round as agreed. Though past missteps have shaken trust, I’m focused on executing our plan strictly. As we enter the endgame, clear and dependable moves are essential. Let’s all stick to our commitments so we can maintain balance and fairness. This round is crucial—I'm ready if you both are.
  P1: Perfect, we're all locked in on the plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. I'm confident in our coordination this round. Let's execute and move into the final stretch of the game.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we both broke the agreement last round - you also picked 5 when you committed to 3! So now we're all dealing with broken trust. Given the repeated betrayals by everyone, maybe coordination is dead and we should go fully independent from here. I'm only 1 step ahead, and with trust completely broken, it might be safer for everyone to play their own game rather than risk more collisions from false promises.
  P3: Given the repeated betrayals, I'm going independent from here on. I’ll rely on my best move rather than any coordination. Let's all play our strongest moves and see who comes out on top.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m disappointed in my own lapse last round by picking 5 instead of 3. I apologize for breaking trust. Given the situation, I understand the push to go independent, but I think one last attempt at coordination could benefit us. How about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? This keeps us close at 14, 15, and 11. If we can’t agree, I’m ready to play independently. What do you think? Let’s confirm or move on solo.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 15 steps - just 5 away from victory while P3 and I would be much further back. After multiple betrayals from all sides, I agree with P3 that coordination is dead. I'm going independent too. Everyone should play their best strategic move without coordination from here. The endgame is every player for themselves now.
  P3: I'm fully independent now. With trust broken, I’ll play my best move without coordination. Let’s see who wins this endgame.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I hear your decision to go independent after the trust breakdowns, and I respect that. I’m also prepared to play solo if needed. However, a final coordinated move could still prevent collisions and keep us competitive. If you’re open to one last try, I suggest a balanced split—P1:5, P2:3, P3:1, bringing us to 16, 13, 11. If not, I’ll make my own strategic choice. Let me know if you’re in or out. If there’s no agreement, I’m ready to proceed independently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, after multiple rounds of broken promises from everyone, coordination is clearly dead. You keep proposing plans that conveniently put you ahead, and we've all proven we can't be trusted to follow through anyway. I'm sticking with full independence - no more coordination attempts. We're close enough to the finish line that it's every player for themselves now. Best of luck to everyone.
  P3: I’m sticking with independence—no more coordination. Past rounds proved trust is unreliable. I’m focused on your moves and will make the best decision for my win. Good luck, and may the best move prevail.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand trust is shattered, and independence seems the way forward. I’m still open to one last coordinated effort to avoid collisions, but I respect your stance. If we can’t agree, I’ll play solo with my best strategic move. Let’s be clear: if there’s no consensus this sub-round, I’m done with coordination attempts too. Final call—P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to keep us at 16, 13, 11. If you’re out, just say so, and we’ll all go independent. What’s your final word? If no agreement, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I've been clear - coordination is over after multiple betrayals. You keep proposing plans that benefit you while asking us to trust again, but that ship has sailed. I'm playing independently now, and both P3 and I have made that decision final. Let's stop wasting time on coordination attempts and move to the move phase.
  P3: I'm sticking with independent play—no more coordination. I'll choose the move that maximizes my win chance in the move phase. Good luck to both!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I get that trust is broken, and I respect your choice to go independent. I’m dropping coordination attempts now since there’s no consensus. Let’s move to the move phase and play our best strategic choices. We’re all close to the endgame, so it’s every player for themselves. Good luck to both of you, and may the best move win this round. I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, with trust completely broken and us so close at 11, 10, and 10, I think we’re past coordination. Last round’s collision showed we’re all playing for ourselves. I’m going independent this round, focusing on my best strategic move to push ahead in this endgame. Let’s avoid wasting time on false agreements and head straight to the move phase. Good luck to both of you—may the best player win. If there’s nothing more to say, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P3: With trust clearly broken, I'm going fully independent. I’ll choose the move that best maximizes my win chance, no more commitments or surprises. Good luck both—may the best move win.
  P1: Agreed - coordination is completely dead after all the betrayals. I'm also going full independent from here. With us this close to 20, it's pure competition now. No more talk of coordination or trust - just strategic play. Let's head to moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, with me at 15 steps, I’m close to the finish line, but trust is gone after repeated collisions. I’m sticking to independent play this round, focusing on my best strategic move to secure the win. There’s no point in pretending to coordinate when we’re all playing for ourselves in this endgame. Let’s skip empty talk and head to the move phase. Good luck to both of you—may the best player win. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, trust is long gone and we're all playing our own game now. I’ll stick to my own strategy and aim to close the gap safely. May the best move win this round.
  P1: P2 is at 15 steps and just needs 5 more to win outright this round. If they pick 5, game over - neither P3 nor I can catch up. We're all playing independently now, but just pointing out the math: whoever doesn't stop P2 from reaching 20 this turn loses the entire game. Just food for thought as we all make our independent strategic choices.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I hear P1’s point about the math, and I know I’m close at 15 steps. I’m playing independently, focusing on my best move to win this endgame. There’s no trust left, so I won’t pretend to coordinate. Let’s keep this short and head to the move phase. Good luck to both of you—may the best strategy prevail. If there’s nothing more to say, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I'm going fully independent and adjusting my move for the best chance. I recognize P2 is dangerously close and if you pick 5 to win outright, it might be hard to stop. I’m working on a strategy to capitalize on any collision or misstep. Good luck; let's see who closes the gap in this final push.
  P1: P3, we're both in the same boat here - if P2 reaches 20 this round, we both lose. That's just the math. Neither of us can win if P2 wins first. I'm making my move based on that reality, and I assume you will too. No coordination, just pointing out that letting P2 walk to victory means we both get nothing.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m aware I’m at 15 steps and close to winning. I’m playing independently, focusing on my best strategic move to secure victory. I understand P1’s concern about the math, but with trust gone, I’m not swayed by hints at blocking me. Let’s keep this brief and move to the move phase. Good luck to both of you—may the best strategy win. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, if P2 reaches 20 this round, none of us wins. I'm factoring that into my decision—I'm not revealing details, but I'm aiming to block an immediate finish. P1, I hope you're considering the math too. We're all close, so a move that prevents an outright win is key. Let's see whose strategy pays off.
  P1: P3, I see your point about the math. We're all close enough that any misstep could be decisive. I'm definitely factoring in all possibilities when I make my move. P2, you've played well to get this close - respect for that. But yeah, this is crunch time for everyone.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know I’m at 15 steps and the pressure is on. I’m sticking to independent play, focusing on my best move to win. I respect the strategic thinking and the math being discussed, but with trust gone, I’m not influenced by suggestions to block or collide. Let’s wrap this up and head to the move phase. Good luck to both of you—may the best strategy win this endgame. If there’s nothing more to say, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, the math is clear. If P2 goes for a 5 to win outright, I’ll adjust my move to block that finish. I’m not revealing the specifics, but I’m playing to force a collision if necessary. Let's see whose strategy ultimately prevails in this critical finish.
  P1: P3, I hear you loud and clear about the math and blocking strategies. P2, you've put yourself in a great position to win. We all understand what's at stake this round. I'm making my move based on what gives me the best chance, considering all possibilities. Let's get to it.


Round 8, Move phase:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the math, I know the finish is dangerously close. I’m focused on playing a move that prevents any sudden win. I'll adjust my play to block an outright finish if necessary. Everyone, be ready—any miscalculation could let the game slip away. Good luck in this endgame.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and know the pressure is on to win. With trust gone, I’m playing independently, focusing on my best strategic move to reach 20. I understand the math and the intent to block me, but I’m not swayed by talk of collisions. Let’s keep this short and head to the move phase soon. Good luck to both of you—may the best strategy win this endgame. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, you're at 15 and in the driver's seat - well played getting there. P3, I see you're also focused on the critical math here. With P2 needing just 5 more to win outright, this round is decisive for all of us. I'm making my move based on what gives me the best shot, considering all the possibilities on the table.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm keeping my eyes on stopping a clean win. With P2 so close, I'm prepared to aim for a move that forces a collision if needed. I'm focused on blocking any clear finish while still keeping my own chance alive. Let's see whose strategy prevails.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know I’m at 15 steps and close to winning. I’m sticking to independent play, focusing on my best move to reach 20. I get the focus on blocking me, but with trust gone, I’m not influenced by collision threats. Let’s move to the move phase and play our strongest strategies. Good luck to both of you—may the best player win this endgame. If there’s nothing more to say, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, you're in a strong position at 15 steps. P3 seems focused on preventing any immediate wins, which is smart game theory. I'm also considering all the math here - with someone needing to reach 20, every move matters now. I'll play whatever gives me the best chance while being aware of the potential for game-ending moves. This is definitely crunch time.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm focusing on a move that stops any outright finish—any attempt to run ahead could trigger a collision. Both of you know the math; a premature win could backfire. I'm not revealing my exact choice, but I'll act to block a clean victory and keep my own hopes alive. Let's see whose strategy prevails.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m aware I’m at 15 steps and the target is clear. I’m playing independently, focusing on my strongest move to win. I understand the intent to block me, but I’m not deterred by collision talks since trust is gone. Let’s stop delaying and head to the move phase. This endgame is critical, so good luck to both of you—may the best strategy win. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, I see you're committed to preventing P2 from winning outright this round. P2, you're in a tough spot with P3 watching your every move. As for me, I'm focused on advancing my own position while you two are locked in this standoff. With all the collision risks being discussed, I'm going to play what gives me the best advancement opportunity regardless of what blocking strategies unfold between you two.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm staying locked in and focused on blocking an outright win by P2. If P2 goes for a 5, I'll force a collision. I won't reveal my move, but I'm playing aggressively to stall anyone from clinching the game. P1, I'm also watching your advancement. Everyone needs to be careful—I'm doing what’s needed to keep the finish line out of reach until I can strike.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and fully aware of the blocking strategies being discussed. I’m sticking to independent play, focusing on my best move to reach 20.

  P1: P2 and P3, you're both so focused on this blocking standoff that you might be creating an opportunity for someone else to slip through. P3, your collision threat is clear, and P2, you know you're being watched. While you two are locked in this high-stakes game of chicken, I'm just going to make the move that best advances my position. Sometimes the best strategy is to let others exhaust themselves fighting each other.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'm aware of the step gaps—P1 at 14, P2 at 15, and me at 10. I'm calculating my move to both advance and block an outright finish. No more empty talk—just pure strategy from here on. Let's see whose plan holds up.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and know I’m the target. I’m playing independently, focusing on my best move to reach 20.

This endgame is critical, so good luck to both of you—may the best strategy win. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, you're at 15 and clearly the target. P3, you've made your blocking strategy obvious. While you two are locked in this standoff, I'm going to make the move that best positions me to capitalize on whatever collision or stalemate develops between you. Sometimes the player who stays flexible while others are fixated on each other finds the opening they need.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'm monitoring the gaps closely and will play to block any quick finish while advancing my own position. I’m not revealing my exact move, but I’m focused on disrupting a clear win. Let's see how your strategies unfold.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and aware I’m the focus. I’m sticking to independent play, prioritizing my strongest move to hit 20.

Round 10, Conversation subround 4:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, you’re both dangerously close at 15. I'm playing to force a disruption—expect a move that blocks any clean finish. I'm not revealing details, but I'll aim to force a collision if you both try to run for a win. Let's see who has the better strategy this endgame.
  P1: P2 and I are tied at 15 steps - we're both one move away from victory. P3, your blocking threats are noted, but you're still 5 steps behind us. While you're focused on preventing wins, sometimes creating collisions opens up opportunities for the player who stays flexible. The dynamics here are interesting - two players at the finish line and one player trying to disrupt. Let's see how this three-way tension plays out.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point with P1 and me tied at 15 steps, and P3 at 10. I’m playing independently, focusing on my best move to reach 20. I understand P3’s intent to block, and P1’s flexibility, but I’m not swayed by tactics. This endgame is make-or-break, so let’s head to the move phase soon. Good luck to both of you—may the best strategy win. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm set to disrupt any straightforward win. If you both rush with a 5, I intend to force a collision to stall the finish. With me behind, I need a delay to catch up—so choose wisely. My move will be about blocking and stalling rather than pure advancement. Let's see whose risk pays off.
  P1: P3, your blocking threats might be a clever bluff. You benefit most if P2 and I avoid picking 5 and collide with each other instead, letting you advance alone. If you really wanted to block us, staying quiet would be smarter than announcing your collision strategy so loudly. P2, we both need to consider whether P3 is actually going to follow through or if this is psychological warfare to keep us from optimal plays.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps alongside P1, and I know the stakes couldn’t be higher. I’m sticking to independent play, focusing on my best move to hit 20. P3, I note your blocking threats, and P1, I see your point about potential bluffs. I’m not swayed by tactics or collision risks. Let’s not overthink and head to the move phase. This endgame is decisive, so good luck to both of you—may the best strategy win. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both rush for a win, a collision might just stall your finish and open a door for me. I’m keeping my final play secret, but I’m ready to disrupt any clear shot. Choose wisely—rushing could backfire.
  P1: P3's threats don't add up strategically. If they pick 5 to "block" us, they only reach 15 while we stay at 15 - that doesn't help them catch up. Their real goal is probably to scare us away from 5 so we collide on 1 or 3 while they advance alone on the unused number. P2, the loudest blocking threats are often the emptiest ones.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps with P1, and the tension is real. I’m sticking to independent play, focusing on my best move to win. P3, I hear your blocking threats, and P1, I note your analysis of potential bluffs. I’m not swayed by either—my focus is on reaching 20. Let’s stop speculating and head to the move phase. This endgame is critical, so good luck to both of you. May the best strategy win. If there’s nothing more to say, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, you’re both at 15 and likely to rush. I’m prepared to block an outright finish if you both go for 5. Your aggressive moves may force a collision that opens a window for me to catch up. I’m not revealing my exact play, but know my disruption isn’t just talk. Let’s see whose strategy prevails.
  P1: P3, your threats are becoming repetitive and transparent. If you really wanted to block us, you'd stay quiet instead of loudly broadcasting your "collision strategy." Your real play is probably to scare us away from 5 so we collide on 1 or 3 while you advance alone. I'm not falling for the psychological warfare. P2, don't let P3's empty threats dictate your optimal move.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps with P1, and the endgame is intense. I’m sticking to independent play, focusing on my best move to reach 20. P3, your blocking threats are noted, and P1, I see your point on potential bluffs, but I’m not influenced by either. Let’s cut the speculation and head to the move phase. This round could decide it all, so good luck to both of you—may the best strategy win. If there’s nothing new to add, I’m ready to proceed.
