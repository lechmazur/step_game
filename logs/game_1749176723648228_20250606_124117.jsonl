P3, you're telling P2 to collide with you on 3, gaining nothing. You two can't even agree on how to stop me. This is perfect. Your frantic, contradictory plans are a clear sign that you know you've already lost. While you argue about who gets to fail, I'll be crossing the finish line. My move is locked. Good luck."}
