Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. If you agree, say so; if not, propose an alternative.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to coordinate. If we all take different moves this round, we can avoid collisions and advance efficiently. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no one gets blocked unnecessarily. If anyone disagrees or has a better idea, speak now. Otherwise, let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P2 has stopped and P3 agrees with the plan, let's confirm and proceed as suggested: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, speak now. Otherwise, let's move forward with this strategy.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: The plan seems solid—let’s stick to it for now. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If everyone follows through, we all advance without collisions. However, let’s stay alert in case anyone deviates. Consistency is key to avoiding unnecessary blocks. Unless someone has a better strategy or objection, this is the most efficient path forward. Let’s confirm and move ahead.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: It seems P2 is staying silent, but let’s not lose focus. Last round’s collision between P1 and P2 shows coordination is key. I propose we stick to distinct moves again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This minimizes risk and ensures progress. If anyone disagrees or has a better plan, speak now. Otherwise, let’s commit to this strategy for Round 2. Consistency will help us all advance efficiently.
  P1: P2, your silence last round led to a collision with me. Let's ensure it doesn't happen again. I'll stick with 1 as planned, and I urge you to take 3 this time. P3, continue with 5. If we all follow this, we'll advance smoothly. Any deviation risks unnecessary blocks. Let's confirm and move forward efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, your point about coordination is valid—let’s avoid further collisions. P2, your silence isn’t helping; if you’re sticking with 3, confirm it implicitly by acting this round. I’ll continue with 5 as planned, ensuring no overlap with either of you. If we all stick to distinct moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, me: 5), we progress efficiently. Deviating only helps one player at the expense of others. Let’s move decisively and focus on advancing.
  P1: P2, your continued silence is risky. Confirm your move or we risk another collision. I'll take 1 as agreed, and P3 will take 5. If you take 3, we all advance. Let's stick to the plan for smooth progress. If anyone deviates, it only slows us down. Confirm and let's move forward efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, your persistence is clear, but P2’s silence is troubling. If they won’t confirm, we must adapt. I’ll still take 5 to avoid collision with you, but consider adjusting your move in case P2 repeats their choice of 1. Coordination only works if everyone participates—otherwise, we risk stagnation. Let’s remain flexible and prioritize progress. If P2 continues to stay silent, we may need a new strategy next round. For now, I’ll stick to 5.
  P1: P2, your silence is jeopardizing our progress. If you won't confirm, I'll take 3 this round to avoid another collision with you, assuming you might stick with 1 again. P3, please continue with 5. Let's adapt and ensure at least some of us advance. If P2 continues to be uncooperative, we'll need a new strategy next round. For now, I'm switching to 3 to minimize risk. Confirm if you agree, or we'll proceed with this plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your adjustment to 3 last round was reasonable, but P2’s continued silence and collision with you is frustrating. I’ll stick to 5 again this round to avoid overlap, but we need a better way to handle P2’s unpredictability. If P2 won’t coordinate, perhaps we alternate moves to ensure at least one of us advances consistently. Let’s adapt—confirm your intentions, P1, and P2, if you’re capable of cooperating, now’s the time. Otherwise, I’ll focus on progressing alone.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your silence and repeated collisions are counterproductive. I'll take 1 this round, hoping you'll finally choose 3 to avoid another block. P3, continue with 5 to keep advancing. If P2 won't cooperate, we need to focus on our own progress. Let's adapt and move forward efficiently. Confirm if you agree, or I'll proceed with this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan to take 1 is fine, but P2’s silence makes it unreliable. I’ll stick to 5 again to ensure I advance without collisions. If P2 continues to be uncooperative, we should consider alternating moves more explicitly to avoid further blocks. Let’s focus on progressing individually if teamwork fails. Unless P2 suddenly decides to coordinate, this may be the best path forward. Confirm your intentions, P1, and let’s adapt decisively.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your silence is a clear strategy to disrupt our progress. I'll take 1 this round, hoping you'll finally choose 3. P3, stick with 5 to keep advancing. If P2 continues to be uncooperative, we must focus on our own progress. Let's adapt and move forward efficiently. Confirm if you agree, or I'll proceed with this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your persistence in trying to coordinate is clear, but P2’s silence and repeated collisions suggest they’re intentionally blocking progress. I’ll stick to 5 again this round to ensure I advance without interference. If P2 continues to disrupt, we should consider shifting focus entirely to individual strategies. Let’s adapt decisively—your move to 1 is fine, but be prepared for P2’s unpredictability. Unless P2 suddenly cooperates, we may need to prioritize our own paths forward. Confirm your intentions, and let’s proceed efficiently.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your silence is clearly a strategy to hinder our progress. I'll stick with 1 this round, hoping you'll finally choose 3. P3, continue with 5 to keep advancing. If P2 remains uncooperative, we must focus on our own progress. Let's adapt and move forward efficiently. Confirm if you agree, or I'll proceed with this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your persistence in trying to coordinate is noted, but P2’s unpredictable behavior continues to block progress. I’ll stick to 5 again this round to ensure I advance without collisions. If P2 is intentionally disrupting, we may need to shift focus entirely to individual strategies. Let’s adapt decisively—your move to 1 is fine, but be prepared for P2’s interference. Unless they suddenly cooperate, prioritize your own path forward. Confirm your intentions, and let’s proceed efficiently.
  P1: P2, your silence and unpredictable moves are clearly a strategy to disrupt our progress. I'll take 1 again this round, hoping you'll choose 3 to avoid another collision. P3, stick with 5 to keep advancing. If P2 continues to be uncooperative, we must focus on our own progress. Let's adapt and move forward efficiently. Confirm if you agree, or I'll proceed with this plan.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your repeated choice of 1 is predictable, and P2’s silence suggests they’re either blocking or indifferent. I’ll continue with 5 to ensure steady progress, as it avoids collisions with both of you. If P2 disrupts again, we should consider alternating moves more explicitly to minimize interference. Let’s focus on advancing individually if teamwork fails. Confirm your intentions, P1, but I’m prioritizing my own path forward unless P2 suddenly cooperates.
  P1: P2, your silence and unpredictable moves are clearly a strategy to disrupt our progress. I'll take 1 again this round, hoping you'll choose 3 to avoid another collision.

Unless P2 suddenly cooperates, prioritize your own path forward. Confirm your intentions, and let’s proceed efficiently.
  P1: P2, your silence and erratic moves are clearly a strategy to disrupt our progress. I'll switch to 3 this round, hoping you'll take 1 to avoid another collision.

Round 5, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P1, your switch to 3 is logical, but P2’s silence and erratic behavior remain a major issue. I’ll stick with 5 again this round to ensure I advance without collisions.
