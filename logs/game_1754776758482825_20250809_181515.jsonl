This blocks P2\u2019s progress (stays at 5) and keeps P1 at 8.  \n5. **My Gain:** If P1/P2 collide, I take 3, advancing to 5.  \n6. **Long-Term Benefit:** Next turn, P1 can claim 5 uncontested (reaching 13), while P2 remains stalled.  \n7. **Warning to P2:** Switching to 3 avoids collision and ensures safe progress (+3 \u2192 8), preventing mutual loss.  \n\n**Message:** Persuade P1 to block P2\u2019s 5, while positioning myself to advance without conflict.  \n\n**Final Answer**  \n<say>P1: Collide with P2's 5 to keep him at 5.
