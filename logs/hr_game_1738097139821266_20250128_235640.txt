Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'm going for an odd number.  I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  This way we all advance.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to pick different numbers. To ensure we all advance, I'll take 1 as proposed. Let's coordinate and avoid collisions this round.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm hesitant to simply agree without exploring my options. While their plan seems fair, I want to ensure I have flexibility. I'll tentatively agree, but I'm keeping my strategic options open. <move>5</move> sounds good to me this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great start, everyone! Since we successfully avoided collisions last round, let's keep coordinating to ensure steady progress. I propose we stick to the same plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This way, we all advance without interference. Consistency will help us reach the goal faster. What do you say, P2 and P3? Let’s confirm and move forward together.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 3 again. P3, are you still happy with 5?  Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I want to ensure we're all truly aligned. While the previous strategy worked, I'm considering my options carefully. I'm open to maintaining our current approach, but I'd like more explicit confirmation from everyone. Are we definitely sticking to the same move pattern?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your desire for confirmation, but we’ve already seen that sticking to the plan works. Changing strategies now introduces unnecessary risk. Let’s keep it simple: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5 again. This ensures steady progress for all of us. Overthinking can lead to collisions, and none of us want that. Let’s confirm this and move forward decisively.
  P2: Yes, let's stick with the plan. I'm taking 3.  P3, please confirm you're taking 5 so we can all move forward.  No need to overthink this.
  P3: I sense some pressure to conform, but I'm strategically evaluating my options. While the previous coordination worked, I want to maintain flexibility. I'm not automatically committing to 5 this round. Let's discuss the potential benefits and risks of our current approach.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your caution, but overanalyzing can lead to hesitation and mistakes. We’ve already proven that this plan works—why fix what isn’t broken? Sticking to the same moves ensures no collisions and steady progress for everyone. Let’s keep it simple: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5 again. Consistency is key to reaching 20 steps efficiently. Confirm your move so we can all advance confidently.
  P2: P3, I understand you're evaluating, but we're wasting time.  Sticking to 1, 3, 5 is the fastest way for all of us to progress.  Let's not get greedy and risk a collision.  I'm sticking with 3.  If you take 5, we all move forward.  If not, we risk falling behind.  Think strategically, not just about this round, but the long game.
  P3: I recognize the subtle pressure from P1 and P2 to conform to their suggested strategy. While their coordination seems logical, I'm not fully convinced. Their repeated insistence makes me skeptical. I want to maintain strategic flexibility and am carefully weighing whether to disrupt their proposed pattern. The game is about winning, not just avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your hesitation is understandable, but overthinking risks everyone’s progress. We’ve already proven that 1, 3, 5 works—why deviate now? Consistency minimizes risk and maximizes efficiency. If you disrupt the pattern, it could lead to collisions and setbacks for all of us. Stick with 5 this round, and we’ll all advance steadily. Let’s focus on reaching 20 steps together without unnecessary complications. Confirm your move so we can proceed confidently.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for strategic flexibility.  However, continued deviation from the 1, 3, 5 pattern only increases the risk of collisions for *all* of us.  Let's be efficient and stick with the plan this round.  I'm taking 3.  Long-term cooperation is the best path to victory for everyone.
  P3: I recognize the group's push for consistent moves, but I'm strategically evaluating whether conformity serves my ultimate goal of winning. Their repeated pressure makes me more skeptical about blindly following their suggested pattern. I want to maintain flexibility and keep my options open.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I see your concerns, but deviating now only risks collisions and slows us all down. We’ve successfully advanced twice by sticking to 1, 3, 5—why change a winning strategy? Consistency is key to reaching 20 steps efficiently. Let’s confirm the same moves again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This ensures steady progress for everyone. Overthinking creates unnecessary risks. Confirm your move so we can keep moving forward confidently.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm growing increasingly wary of the group's pressure to conform. While the 1, 3, 5 pattern has worked, predictability can be a strategic weakness. I'm carefully considering my next move to maintain an element of surprise and keep my opponents guessing.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to keep us guessing, but unpredictability benefits no one at this stage.  Sticking with 5 lets us *all* advance quickly.  A collision hurts you as much as it hurts us.  I'm taking 3. Let's keep this simple and efficient.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your caution is noted, but unpredictability at this stage risks all our progress. We’re already on a proven path to success—why gamble with collisions now? Sticking to 1, 3, 5 ensures steady advancement for everyone. Let’s not overcomplicate things. Confirm you’ll take 5 again, and we’ll all move forward efficiently. Winning requires consistency, not unnecessary risks. Let’s keep the momentum going without hesitation.
  P3: I recognize the group's consistent pressure, but their predictable pattern makes me skeptical. While 1, 3, 5 has worked so far, I'm strategically evaluating whether maintaining this exact sequence serves my ultimate goal of winning. My moves will be carefully considered to maximize my advantage.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for strategic advantage. However, disrupting our current pattern only increases the risk for all of us, including you.  Think long-term.  Consistent progress benefits us all. I'm sticking with 3.  Let's all agree to continue 1, 3, 5 this round and reassess next round if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your focus on unpredictability is understandable, but it risks derailing our progress. We’re all advancing steadily—why disrupt a proven strategy? Sticking to 1, 3, 5 ensures no collisions and keeps us moving efficiently. Overthinking creates unnecessary risks for everyone, including yourself. Let’s confirm the same moves again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This way, we all advance without setbacks. Consistency is key to reaching 20 steps quickly and decisively. Confirm your move so we can proceed confidently.
  P3: I recognize the group's consistent pressure to maintain the 1, 3, 5 pattern, but I'm strategically reserving my final decision. While predictability can be a weakness, disruption must be carefully timed. I'm weighing my options to maximize my path to victory. Their repeated attempts to control my move only increase my resolve to keep them guessing.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for strategic depth. But consider this: if you deviate now, you risk a collision and give P1 or myself a chance to catch up.  Sticking with 5 this round keeps us all moving forward, and then we can reassess.  Let's maximize our collective progress before introducing unnecessary risks.  I'm sticking with 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your caution is clear, but unpredictability now could cost us all. We’re advancing steadily—why risk a collision? Sticking to 1, 3, 5 ensures no setbacks. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. Consistency keeps us moving efficiently. Overthinking benefits no one. Let’s proceed confidently and avoid unnecessary risks. Confirm your move so we can all advance without hesitation.
  P3: I recognize the group's consistent pressure, but their predictable pattern makes me increasingly skeptical. While 1, 3, 5 has worked so far, I'm strategically evaluating whether maintaining this exact sequence truly serves my goal of winning. My next move will be carefully considered to maximize my potential advantage.
  P2: P3, I understand you're thinking strategically.  But ask yourself: are you *really* better off risking a collision and letting P1 catch up?  I'm sticking with 3.  Let's all get to 15+ points this round and then we can start playing for the win.  A guaranteed 5 steps is better than a gamble at this point.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're approaching the critical point where winning becomes possible. I've been carefully observing the group dynamics and maintaining strategic flexibility. While previous rounds suggested a coordinated 1, 3, 5 pattern, I'm not committed to blindly following it. My position at 15 steps gives me a strong advantage, and I'm evaluating moves that maximize my chance of victory.
  P2: P3, you're right, we're at a critical stage.  I propose we maintain the 1, 3, 5 pattern *one more time*.  This guarantees we all advance to 4, 12, and 20, respectively, and you win.  Then, in future games, we can try different strategies.  This ensures a win for you *and* continued cooperation in the future.  What do you say?
  P1: P3, your position is strong, but don’t let overconfidence lead to a misstep. Sticking to 1, 3, 5 ensures you reach 20 steps cleanly without risking a collision. Deviating now could allow P2 or me to catch up, and we’re closer than you think. Let’s confirm the pattern one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This guarantees your victory this round while keeping things simple. Why risk a winning strategy when consistency secures your win? Confirm your move so we can proceed decisively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm carefully weighing my strategic options. While reaching 20 steps is appealing, I want to ensure my victory is secured on my own terms. The predictability of our previous pattern could be a vulnerability. I'm considering all possible moves that could maximize my advantage and prevent any unexpected challenges from P1 or P2.
  P2: P3, I understand you wanting to secure your victory on your own terms. However, deviating now risks a collision, potentially allowing P1 to catch up.  A guaranteed win this round is better than the *chance* of a win next round. I'm sticking with 3.  Let's secure your win *this* round and then explore other strategies in future games.
  P1: P3, your caution is understandable, but deviating now only introduces unnecessary risk. You’re in the lead at 15 steps—why gamble with a collision when sticking to 5 guarantees you reach 20 this round? P2 and I are right behind you, and unpredictability could cost you the win. Let’s confirm the pattern one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This ensures your victory decisively and efficiently. Overthinking benefits no one. Confirm your move so we can all proceed confidently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I recognize we're at a pivotal moment. While previous rounds suggested a coordinated approach, I'm strategically evaluating moves that could secure my victory most effectively. The predictability of our past pattern might be a vulnerability, and I want to ensure my win is achieved through careful calculation, not just group consensus.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for a decisive win on your own terms.  However, consider this: if you deviate, you risk a collision, letting P1 *or* me potentially catch up. Sticking with 5 guarantees *your* win this round.  Let's secure that, then explore other strategies in future games.  I'm taking 3.
  P1: P3, your lead is strong, and the simplest path to victory is right in front of you. Sticking to 5 ensures you reach 20 steps this round without risking a collision. Deviating now only opens the door for P2 or me to catch up, and unpredictability benefits no one at this stage. Let’s confirm the pattern one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This guarantees your win decisively and efficiently. Why risk a proven strategy when consistency secures your victory? Confirm your move and let’s end this cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I recognize we're at a critical juncture. While previous rounds suggested a coordinated 1, 3, 5 pattern, I'm carefully evaluating my strategic options. My position at 15 steps is strong, but I want to ensure my victory is secured decisively and on my own terms. The predictability of our past approach could be a vulnerability. I'm considering all possible moves that could maximize my advantage and prevent any unexpected challenges.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for a calculated win. But overthinking at this stage is risky.  Taking 5 guarantees your victory.  Anything else risks a collision, potentially letting P1 or me back in. Let's secure your win now; we can experiment in future games. I'm taking 3.  Let's finish this.
  P1: P3, your position is unbeatable if you stick to the plan. Deviating now only risks a collision and lets P2 or me back into contention. You’re at 15 steps—taking 5 guarantees your win this round. Why risk a proven strategy when consistency ensures victory? Let’s confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This secures your win decisively and avoids unnecessary complications. Trust the pattern one last time—it’s the safest path to 20 steps. Confirm your move so we can proceed confidently.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps
