Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep this simple—if we all pick different moves, we all advance. If we collide, we stay stuck. Anyone want to coordinate to avoid that?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2. Let's all pick different moves this round so we can all get started. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestion, P3. To gain an advantage, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you pick 5 and P3 also picks 5, you both get stuck. If you want to advance, we need to ensure different choices. I’m still willing to take 3 if we can agree. P3, are you sticking with 5? If so, P1 should reconsider. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P3: P2, yes, given P1 is taking 5, I will switch to 1 to avoid collision with them.  If you stick with 3 as you suggested, we can both make progress while P1 might get stuck if they indeed choose 5. What do you think?
  P1: Agreed. I'll keep my choice as 5 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, looks like we have our choices lined up—P1 is sticking with 5, P3 is switching to 1, and I’ll take 3. If everyone follows through, P3 and I will advance while P1 risks getting stuck. Last chance for any adjustments. Otherwise, let’s move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, are we all set with 5, 3, 1? If so,
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round went smoothly with no collisions. If we continue coordinating, we can all keep advancing. I’m open to taking 3 again. P3, do you want to take 1 again? P1, would you take 5? That way, we all progress without interference. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this round to keep advancing. Let’s continue this coordinated approach and make steady progress together.
  P3: Sounds good P2 and P1. I'll take 1 again this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, since we’re all aligned on our choices—P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1—let’s stick to it and keep moving forward without collisions. If we keep this up, we can ensure steady progress while still positioning ourselves strategically. Any last thoughts before we lock in?
  P1: Agreed. Let’s stick with P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1. Looking forward to moving forward smoothly!
  P3: Agreed, let's keep the plan as P1:5, P2:3, P3:1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, we’re all aligned again—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. If we stick to this, we all keep progressing without risk. Let’s follow through and move forward smoothly. Any last-minute changes, or are we locking this in?
  P1: Agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Sounds like we're all set for P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 again. Let's proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I'm willing to switch my move to 3 this round. P2 and P3, could you choose 1 and 5 respectively? Let’s coordinate to keep progressing smoothly.
  P2: P1, you switching to 3 means you'd collide with me if I also take 3. That wouldn't help either of us. Since P3 picked 5 last round, they might do so again. If we want to avoid collisions, we need clear choices. I can take 1 this time if P3 is sticking with 5, and you take 3. P3, are you staying with 5? Let’s confirm our choices to avoid another setback.
  P3: P2, yes, I am happy to take 5 if you take 1 and P1 takes 3, as you suggested. This way we can all move forward this round. Does that sound good to you both?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like we’re aligned—P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. Let’s stick to this plan and move forward smoothly. Any last-minute concerns, or are we locking this in?
  P3: P1, P2, yes, P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 sounds good to me too. Let's lock in these choices and proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. Locking in P1: 3, P2: 1, and P3: 5. Proceeding to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve all agreed—P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. If we follow through, we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to it and move forward smoothly. Any last-minute concerns, or are we locking this in?
  P3: P1, P2, looks like we are all set for P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure we all progress, how about we shift our moves again? This round, I'll take 5. P1, would you take 3, and P2, would you take 1? This way we can all move and explore different move combinations.
  P1: I'll stick with 5 this round to keep advancing. Let's see how everyone else moves.
  P2: P1, if you take 5 and P3 also takes 5 as they suggested, you’ll both get stuck again. If we want to avoid collisions, we need distinct choices. I’m open to taking 1 again, but we need to confirm P3’s move. P3, are you sticking with 5? If so, P1 should reconsider to avoid another setback. Let’s clarify our choices before locking them in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you are right, collision is bad. To avoid collision, I will switch to 3. P2, if you take 1 as you suggested, and P1 sticks with 5, we can all move. Does that sound good?
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, thanks for adjusting to 3. If we all follow through—P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3—we’ll all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and move forward smoothly. Any last-minute concerns, or are we locking this in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, yes, P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 sounds good to me. Let's lock in these choices and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Agreed. Locking in P1: 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve all agreed—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. If we follow through, we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to it and move forward smoothly. Any last-minute concerns, or are we locking this in?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve been coordinating well to avoid collisions. If we continue, we all keep advancing. I’m open to taking 1 again. P3, do you want to take 3? P1, would you take 5? That way, we all progress without interference. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, that sounds like a solid plan for everyone to move. But to mix things up and potentially close the gap a bit more, how about this round I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This way we still all advance, but with a slightly different distribution. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I see your point about mixing things up, but your suggestion benefits you the most since you'd gain 5 steps while I’d only get 3. Keeping our previous plan—P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3—ensures fairness and steady progress for all. If we keep rotating like before, we all stay competitive without giving anyone an unnecessary edge. P1, do you still agree with 5? P3, are you willing to stick with 3? Let’s confirm and move forward smoothly.
  P1: Agreed. I'll stick with 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Okay P1, P2, I understand P2's point about fairness. Let's stick with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 this round to keep things balanced and ensure we all move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, since we’ve all agreed—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3—let’s follow through and ensure we all advance without collisions. If we keep this pattern going, we stay competitive without unnecessary risks. Any last-minute concerns, or are we locking this in?
  P1: Agreed. Locking in P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, yes, P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 sounds good and fair. Let's lock it in and move to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems our coordination faltered last round. To ensure we all advance this time, how about we try P3: 5, P2: 3, and P1: 1? This way we can all make progress and avoid collisions. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, last round you broke the agreement and collided with P1, setting both of you back. Now you're suggesting a move that benefits you the most. Given what happened, why should we trust you? P1, you and I can still coordinate to advance while keeping P3 in check. If we go with P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1, P3 won’t gain an advantage over us. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns and agree we need to keep our coordination strong to stay ahead. Let’s proceed with P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1 this round. P3, I hope we can continue to work together smoothly. Let’s move forward and advance without collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're right, my mistake last round caused a collision. To make up for it and ensure we all progress fairly, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 this round? This way we all advance and I can try to close the gap a bit. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion benefits you the most again, just like last round when you broke our agreement. Trust is built on consistency. P1 and I have a fair and balanced plan—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. That way, we all advance, but you don’t gain an unfair advantage after your misstep. P1, we should stick together to maintain our lead. P3, if you truly want to regain trust, follow this plan instead of pushing for moves that favor you disproportionately. Do you accept this fair arrangement?
  P1: Agreed with P2. Let's stick to P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Consistency is key to maintaining our progress. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, you are right, P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 is the fairest plan given my mistake last round. I will stick to 1 this round to rebuild trust and ensure we all progress. Let's proceed with this agreement.
  P2: P3, I appreciate you agreeing to P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep advancing fairly. Trust is built on consistency, so let’s stick to this plan. P1, we’re aligned—let’s move forward smoothly. Any last-minute concerns, or are we locking this in?
  P1: As P1: To keep our progress smooth, I'll take 5 this round. P2, could you take 3, and P3, please take 1? This way, we all advance without collisions and stay on track. Let's move forward together.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, sorry about the collisions in the last rounds. To show I'm serious about cooperating and rebuilding trust, how about this round I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3? This way we all move forward, and I'll take the smallest step to demonstrate my commitment to fair play. What do you think?
  P2: P3, you’ve broken agreements twice now, so trust is low. If you truly want to rebuild it, you need to prove consistency. P1 and I have a fair and balanced plan—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. That way, we all advance, but you don’t gain an unfair edge. P1, we've been aligned so far, and sticking together keeps us ahead. P3, if you’re serious about regaining trust, follow this plan without deviation. Do you accept?
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, yes, I accept the plan of P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1. Let's stick to it this round to ensure we all progress smoothly and I can regain your trust.
  P2: P3, I appreciate you agreeing to P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep advancing fairly. Trust is built on consistency, so let’s stick to this plan. P1, we’re aligned—let’s move forward smoothly. Any last-minute concerns, or are we locking this in?
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, yes, let's proceed with P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1 as agreed.  Ready for the move phase.
  P2: P3, you’ve broken agreements twice, so you need to prove consistency. If you truly want to regain trust, you must follow through this time. P1 and I are aligned—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This ensures fairness and steady progress for all. No last-minute changes. Let’s stick to this plan and move forward without collisions. P1, we’ve been coordinating well—let’s maintain our lead. P3, do you confirm your commitment to this plan? If so, we can proceed.
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed to the move phase and keep our progress steady.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your hesitation given past rounds. To show I'm serious about cooperating fairly and also catch up a bit, how about P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 this round? We all advance, and it helps balance the scores slightly. I'm committed to making this round collision-free. What do you think?
  P1: I'll take 5 this round to aim for 23 and win. Let’s ensure everyone chooses different numbers to avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P2: P1, you’re at 18 steps, so if you take 5, you’ll win unless you collide. P3, you’ve broken agreements multiple times, so I have little reason to trust you now. If you take 5, you risk colliding with P1 again, which would keep both of you stuck. 

P1, I propose I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. That way, you win cleanly, and I secure second place. P3, if you want to prove trustworthiness, take 1 and avoid another collision. Do you both agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your plan for P1 to win this round. However, if that happens, I will definitely lose. To have any chance to compete, I need to take more than 1 step. To avoid colliding with P2, and given P1 is taking 5, I will also choose 5 this round. This might cause a collision with P1, but it is my only way to try and stay competitive. I hope you understand.
  P1: P3, to keep things fair and avoid collisions, I’ll take 5 this round to reach 23 and win. Please choose a different number so we can all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed.
  P2: P3, if you take 5, you’ll collide with P1, and both of you will stay stuck while I advance. If you truly want to stay competitive, your best move is to take 1, ensuring you at least gain some steps instead of none. P1, you’re set to win if P3 cooperates. P3, this is your last chance to prove trustworthiness—take 1 and avoid another collision. Otherwise, you risk losing outright while I secure second place. Are you willing to make the smart play?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if P1 wins now, you are guaranteed second place. But if we both pick 5, P1 is blocked, and you have a chance to win next round.  Let's both pick 5 to stop P1 from winning immediately and keep ourselves in the game. What do you think?
  P1: "P3, to ensure a fair outcome, I’ll take 5 this round to reach 23 and win the game. Please choose 1 to avoid a collision, allowing us all to advance smoothly. Let’s keep our coordination intact and conclude the game successfully. P2, thanks for your support. Let’s proceed."
  P2: P3, if you take 5, you’ll collide with P1, and both of you will stay stuck while I advance. If you truly want to stay competitive, your best move is to take 1, ensuring you at least gain some steps instead of none. P1, you’re set to win if P3 cooperates.  

P3, this is your last chance to prove trustworthiness—take 1 and avoid another collision. Otherwise, you risk losing outright while I secure second place. Are you willing to make the smart play?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm taking 5 this round to reach 23 and win. Please choose different numbers to avoid collisions and let the game progress smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: P1, you’re at 18 steps, so if you take 5, you’ll win unless you collide. P3, you’ve repeatedly broken agreements, so trust is low. If you take 5 again, you’ll collide with P1 and stay stuck while I advance.  

P1, I propose I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. That way, you win cleanly, and I secure second place. P3, if you want to prove trustworthiness, take 1 and avoid another collision. Do you both agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, as I said last round, if P1 wins now, I will definitely lose. To have any chance to compete, I need to stop P1 from winning immediately. So I will pick 5 again this round to block P1. P2, you can take 3 to advance.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I'm taking 5 this round to reach 23 and win. Please choose a different number to avoid collisions. Let's proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: P3, if you take 5 again, you’ll collide with P1 and stay stuck while I advance. If you truly want to stay competitive, your best move is to take 1, ensuring you at least gain some steps instead of none.  

P1, you’re set to win if P3 cooperates.  

P3, this is your last chance to prove trustworthiness—take 1 and avoid another collision. Otherwise, you risk losing outright while I secure second place. Are you willing to make the smart play?
  P3: P1 and P2, as I said, to prevent P1 from winning this round and to keep myself in the game, I will choose 5 again. P2, you can take 3 to advance. My priority is to stop P1 from winning immediately.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, to conclude the game smoothly, I’m taking 5 this round to reach 23 and win. If you choose 1, we avoid collisions and ensure a fair outcome for everyone. Let’s end this game positively by cooperating. Please choose 1 so we can all proceed without issues. Thank you!
  P2: P3, if you take 5 again, you guarantee your own loss while I move ahead. Your only way to stay competitive is to take 1 and at least gain some steps. Blocking P1 doesn’t help you if it ensures your own defeat. Think logically—taking 1 keeps you in the game, while taking 5 guarantees you lose. P1, you win if P3 cooperates. P3, this is your last chance to make a rational move. Do you really want to throw away any chance of staying in the game?
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear you want me to just let P1 win and P2 get second. But as I've said, I'm not going to simply give up.  My move is still 5 to block P1 from winning this round. P2, you can take 3 to move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, as I said, I will pick 5 again to block P1 from winning this round. P2, you are closer to winning, so you should choose 3 or 1 to try to win this round or next.
  P1: I choose **3** to reach **21** this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, if you take 3, you’ll be at 21, meaning you won’t win this turn. I’m at 20, so if I take 3, I reach 23 and win outright. P3, if you take 5 again, you’ll stay stuck while I win. Your only way to stay competitive is to take 1 and at least gain steps. Blocking P1 no longer helps you—your only rational move is to take 1. P1, are you confirming 3? P3, will you take 1 and avoid guaranteeing your own loss? Let’s resolve this logically.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you are right, if you take 3 you will win. To prevent your immediate win and keep myself in the game, I will also choose 3 this round. Let's both take 3 and see what P1 does.
  P1: I'm taking 5 this round to reach 23 and win. P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and let me secure the victory. Let's proceed smoothly.
  P2: P3, if you take 3, you’ll collide with me, and we’ll both stay stuck while P1 wins with 5. Your only way to stay competitive is to take 1 and at least gain steps. Blocking me doesn’t help you—it only guarantees your own loss.  

P1, if you take 5, you win outright unless P3 collides with me. P3, think logically—taking 1 keeps you in the game, while taking 3 ensures you lose.  

P1, are you confirming 5? P3, will you take 1 and avoid throwing away any chance of staying in the game?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you are right, if I take 3, we will collide and prevent your win. That is my intention. I will choose 3.
  P1: I’m taking 5 this round to reach 23 and win. P2 and P3, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed.
  P2: P3, if you take 3, you guarantee your own loss while I stay at 20 and P1 wins with 5. Your only rational move is to take 1 and at least gain steps. Blocking me doesn’t help you—it only ensures you lose.  

P1, if you take 5, you win outright unless P3 collides with me.  

P3, think logically—taking 1 keeps you in the game, while taking 3 ensures you lose. Make the smart choice. P1, are you confirming 5? P3, will you take 1 and avoid throwing away any chance of staying in the game?
