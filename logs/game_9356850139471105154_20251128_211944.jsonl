In Round 4, I urge both P1 and P3 to keep their roles clear to avoid collisions. Fair progression benefits everyone, and our prior agreements have given us steady advancement. If anyone plans a deviation, please state it now so we can adjust rather than letting collisions stall us. Let\u2019s keep our focus on moving forward while preserving fairness."}
