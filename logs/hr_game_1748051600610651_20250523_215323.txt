Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's avoid collisions. I'll go 5."
  P1: I'll take 1 to avoid collision with P3. P2, you should take 3 so we all advance this round.
  P2: Sounds good, P1. I'll take 3 as suggested. Let's keep this coordination going to avoid collisions and advance together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Sticking with 5. Let's keep the coordination. Don’t clash—trust the plan."
  P1: Perfect, so we're all set - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This gets us all moving without any collisions.
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for this round. I'll take 3 as discussed. Looking forward to advancing together!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Trust the plan. 5 is safe. Let's go. No deviations—keep the momentum."
  P1: Alright, we have a solid plan. Let's execute it and see how this coordination works out. After this round, we can reassess our strategy based on our new positions.
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. After this round, we should discuss our next moves to ensure we continue advancing without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how our initial plan works out!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to 1, 3, 5. No clashes—move forward together. Trust the plan!
  P1: We've already established our plan clearly - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. No need to keep discussing the same thing. Let's move to the action phase and execute what we agreed on.
  P2: Let's execute our plan for this round and see how it goes. After we move, we can discuss adjustments for the next round to keep advancing smoothly. Ready to move forward!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid 3. Choose 1 and 5. I'll adjust. No collisions, everyone moves.
  P1: I see what happened - P2 and I both chose 3 despite our agreement, so we collided and didn't advance. P3 is now ahead at 5 steps. 

P3, you're suggesting P2 and I split between 1 and 5 while you adjust. I'm willing to take 1 this round if P2 commits to 5. But we need to be more reliable about sticking to our agreements going forward.

P2, will you take 5 this round so we can both finally advance?
  P2: P1, I apologize for the collision last round. I'll take 5 this round as you suggested, and you take 1. P3, since you're already ahead, maybe consider adjusting to 3 to keep the game balanced. Let's make sure we stick to this plan so we can all advance. Looking forward to a smooth round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 3. P1:1, P2:5. No collisions. Let's advance together."
  P1: Perfect! So we're locked in: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This should get P2 and me back in the game while P3 continues advancing. Let's execute this plan and finally all move forward together.
  P2: P1, I'm committed to 5 this round as agreed. P3, taking 3 is a good move to keep things balanced. Let's all stick to the plan this time: P1 on 1, me on 5, and P3 on 3. We need to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward together!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick to 3. Let's all advance without collisions. No deviations. Keep the momentum going!
  P1: Agreed, the plan is clear and we've all committed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let's execute this without any deviations this time.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking to 5 as agreed. Let's make sure we all advance this round. P3, your move to 3 is appreciated for balance. Let's keep this coordination going strong!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1:1, P2:5. I'll take 3. No collisions. Let's move forward. No issues.
  P1: We've confirmed the plan multiple times now - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Everyone has committed. Let's stop talking and execute it.
  P2: P1, I'm committed to 5 as agreed. Let's ensure we all advance this round. P3, your move to 3 helps keep the game balanced. We need to stick to our plan this time: P1 on 1, me on 5, and P3 on 3. Looking forward to us all moving forward together!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5 this round. P1 and P2, choose 1 and 3. Let's avoid collisions and advance. No need to repeat mistakes—stick to the plan for a clean move.
  P2: P1, I'll take 3 this round as suggested by P3. You should take 1 to avoid any collisions. P3, sticking to 5 is a good move to keep advancing. Let's all commit to this plan and ensure we move forward together smoothly. We need to maintain our coordination to avoid past mistakes. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P1: Looking at the positions, P3 is pulling ahead at 8 steps while P2 and I are behind. P3, you're suggesting the same coordination pattern, but I'm wondering if we should mix things up since you keep advancing the most each round.

P2, I'll take 1 as suggested, but we need to start thinking strategically about catching up to P3's lead. After this round, we might need to reconsider always letting P3 take the biggest moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions. Let’s move forward. Don’t let the lead distract you—focus on advancing. Trust the plan."
  P2: P1, I agree we need to strategize to catch up with P3. Let's stick to 1 and 3 this round as planned, but after this, we should discuss how to mix things up. P3, your lead is notable, but we're committed to advancing without collisions for now. Let's keep the momentum going and reassess our approach next round to ensure a fair chance for everyone.
  P1: I'm concerned that P3 keeps suggesting plans that maximize their own advancement while P2 and I stay behind. P3 is already at 8 steps - nearly halfway to winning. 

P2, maybe we should both go for higher moves this round instead of letting P3 dictate who gets what. If we stick to always giving P3 the big moves, they'll win easily. What do you think about us taking 3 and 5 while P3 takes 1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 again. P1:1, P2:3. No collisions. Let's keep moving. Don’t change the plan now."
  P2: P1, I agree we need to challenge P3's lead. Let's both take higher moves this round. I'll go for 5, and you should take 3. P3, if you take 1, we can all advance without collisions. It's time to mix things up to keep the game competitive. Let's see how this strategy plays out and adjust accordingly next round.
  P1: P2, I like your thinking! Yes, let's shake things up. I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 can take 1. This way we start closing the gap instead of letting P3 run away with the game. P3 has been very strategic about staying ahead - time for us to be strategic too. If we keep following P3's suggestions, they'll hit 20 first and we'll both lose.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "If you take 3 and 5, you'll collide. I'll take 5. You take 1 and 3. No issues."
  P2: P1, let's stick to our new plan: you take 3, I'll take 5. P3, if you take 1, we can all advance without collisions. It's crucial we start closing the gap to keep the game competitive. Let's see how this strategy works and adjust as needed next round.
  P1: P3 is trying to trick us! They said if P2 and I both take 3 and 5 we'll collide, but that's false - 3 and 5 are different numbers so there's no collision. P3 is clearly trying to manipulate us into giving them another big move.

P2, let's stick to our plan: I take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. This is the only way we catch up. Don't let P3 confuse us with false collision warnings!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's keep pushing to close the gap with P3. I'll stick with 5 this round if you take 3 again. P3, if you take 1, we can all advance without collisions. We need to maintain this strategy to stay competitive. Let's see how it plays out and adjust as needed next round.
  P1: P2, I notice you and P3 both picked 5 last round and collided, so neither of you advanced! This actually helped close the gap. P3 is still ahead at 8 steps but now we're closer.

I think we should stick with our strategy - I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 should take 1. But P2, you need to make sure you don't accidentally pick the same number as P3 again. Let's be more careful this time and actually execute our plan properly.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1:1, P2:3. No collisions. Let's advance. Don't let past mistakes slow us—trust the plan."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I'll stick with 5 as planned, and you take 3. P3, if you take 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's keep this strategy to close the gap further. We need to be vigilant and ensure we execute our moves correctly this time. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward together!
  P1: P3 is still trying to manipulate us! They want to take 5 again while giving us the smaller moves. P2, we agreed on our strategy - I take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. Don't fall for P3's suggestions.

P3 is at 8 steps and will win if we keep letting them dictate the moves. We need to stick together and force P3 to take the small move this round. Our plan works if we both commit to it!
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to 1, 3, 5. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's move forward. Trust the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 5 as planned. P3, taking 1 would help us all advance without collisions. Let's keep this strategy to close the gap further. We need to execute our moves correctly this time. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward together!
  P1: P2, you keep saying you'll take 5 but then you suggest P3 should take 1. That's contradictory! If you really want to close the gap with P3, then stick to OUR plan: you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. 

Don't let P3 convince you to change. They're 4 steps ahead and will win if we keep giving them big moves. We need to work together against the leader, not help them!
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1:1, P2:3. No collisions. Let's move forward. Don’t let confusion derail progress."


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm committed to 5 as planned. P3, taking 1 is crucial for us all to advance without collisions. Let's stick to this strategy to close the gap. We need to execute our moves correctly this time. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward together!
  P1: P2, you keep saying you're "committed to 5" but then tell P3 to take 1 - that's exactly our plan! So why do you keep agreeing with P3's counter-suggestions? 

We're running out of time - P3 only needs 12 more steps to win. If we give them another big move, the game is over. I'm taking 3, you take 5, P3 gets 1. Final answer. Don't let P3's repeated suggestions confuse you into changing our strategy now.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1:1, P2:3. No collisions. Trust the plan—advance together. Don’t let past mistakes derail progress. Let’s move."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Wait, now P2 is in the lead at 10 steps! The situation has completely changed. P3 and I collided last round because we both picked 3, so P2 pulled ahead.

P2, you're now the biggest threat to win - you only need 10 more steps. P3 and I need to work together to prevent you from running away with this game. 

P3, we should coordinate to limit P2's advancement while we catch up. What do you think about making P2 take the small move this round?
  P2: P1, I agree we need to adjust our strategy now that I'm in the lead. P3, let's work together to keep the game competitive. I'm willing to take a smaller move this round if you both agree to a plan that allows us all to advance. Suggesting P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's ensure we stick to this and keep the game fair. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P3: P1, take 1. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions, and P2 can't pull ahead. Let's reset the pace.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect P3! Your plan makes much more sense - P2 takes the small move since they're leading, while we take the bigger moves to catch up. 

P2, you suggested giving yourself the 5 again, which would put you at 15 steps and just 5 away from winning! That's way too dangerous for P3 and me.

Let's go with P3's plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive instead of letting P2 run away with it. We need to prevent anyone from getting too close to 20.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to take 3 this round as suggested by P3. It's fair to adjust since I'm in the lead. Let's stick to P1 taking 1, P3 taking 5, and me taking 3 to keep the game competitive. We need to ensure no collisions and maintain a balanced approach. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out and adjusting our strategy accordingly next round.
  P3: P2, stick to 3. P1, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's advance safely. Don’t let past errors derail us. This plan works—trust it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, we have agreement: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This keeps P2 from extending their lead too much while P3 and I catch up a bit. 

Let's execute this plan and then reassess after this round. With P2 at 10 steps, we can't let them get too far ahead or the game will be over quickly.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm committed to 3 this round as agreed. Let's keep the game balanced and competitive. P3, taking 5 is a good move to catch up, and P1, sticking to 1 ensures we all advance without collisions. We need to maintain this coordination to keep the game fair. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out and adjusting our strategy accordingly next round.
  P3: "Stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions. Let’s advance safely and keep the game balanced. P2, your lead is risky—don’t let it grow."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We've all agreed on the plan multiple times: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. No need to keep discussing - let's move to the action phase and execute it.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm sticking to 3 as agreed. Let's ensure we all advance this round without collisions. P3, your move to 5 helps balance the game, and P1, taking 1 is crucial for our plan. We need to keep the game competitive and fair. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out and adjusting accordingly next round. Let's execute this plan smoothly!
  P3: P2, you're leading. Let's prevent you from winning. I'll take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. No collisions. Let's move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, since we're tied at 13 steps, let's keep the game balanced. I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive game. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you're suggesting you take 5 while P3 and I get the smaller moves? That would put you at 18 steps - just 2 away from winning! That's way too dangerous.

P3, we're tied with P2 at 13 steps each. We can't let either of us pull ahead too much. I suggest we force P2 to take 1 since they suggested giving themselves the biggest move. How about P2 takes 1, you take 3, and I'll take 5? This prevents P2 from getting too close to victory.
  P3: P2, your 5 risks collision. P1 and I take 5/3 to advance safely. Let’s block your lead before it’s too late.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I see your concerns about my lead. To keep the game fair, I'm willing to take 1 this round as P1 suggested. P1, you take 5, and P3, you take 3. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a balanced game. Let's stick to this plan to ensure competitiveness. Looking forward to your agreement and a smooth round!
  P1: P2, I don't trust your sudden willingness to take 1 after you just tried to grab 5 and get within 2 steps of winning. You've been inconsistent all game.

P3, since we're both tied with P2 at 13 steps, we need to be careful not to let anyone pull too far ahead. But I also can't let you take the small move while I take 5 - that would put me at risk of you and P2 ganging up on me next round.

Let me think about this more carefully. What's your real plan here, P3?
  P3: P2, take 3. P1, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's advance safely and keep the game balanced. Don't let P2's lead grow—trust the plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the concerns about my lead. To keep the game fair, I'll stick to 1 as agreed. P1, taking 5 is a good move for you to catch up, and P3, taking 3 helps maintain balance. Let's ensure we all advance without collisions this round. We need to keep the game competitive and adjust our strategy next round based on the new positions. Looking forward to your agreement and a smooth execution of this plan.
  P1: P2, you keep flip-flopping between wanting 5 and agreeing to take 1. This inconsistency makes me suspicious of your real intentions.

P3, your plan has me taking 1 while you take 5, which would put you at 18 steps - the same dangerous position P2 was trying to reach. I'm not falling for the same trick from a different player.

I think we need a more balanced approach where none of us gets too close to 20. How about we all take 3 this round? Then we'd all be at 16 steps and truly tied going into the next round.
  P3: "Stick to 1,3,5. P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, I take 5. No collisions. Let’s move forward safely—P2’s lead is too risky otherwise."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns about balance. Taking 3 all around could work, but I'm worried it might lead to a collision if someone deviates. I'm willing to stick with 1 as previously agreed to keep the game fair. P3, if you take 3 and P1 takes 5, we can all advance safely. Let's commit to this plan to maintain competitiveness and avoid any player getting too close to 20. Looking forward to your agreement.
  P1: P2, now you're suggesting P3 takes 3 and I take 5? You've changed your proposal three times this round - first you wanted 5 for yourself, then agreed to take 1, now you want me to take 5. This constant shifting makes you untrustworthy.

Both of you are at 13 steps while I'm at 5. Any move that puts either of you above 17 steps is too dangerous. I propose we all take 3 - it's the only fair solution that keeps everyone at 16 steps and truly balanced.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5. You take 1 and 3. No issues. Trust the plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 and I collided again! Now P2 is dangerously close at 14 steps - only 6 away from winning. 

P3, we keep sabotaging each other while P2 advances. We need to coordinate better to prevent P2 from winning. P2 is the clear threat now.

I suggest: P2 takes 1 (to slow their advance), P3 takes 3, I take 5. This prevents P2 from getting too close to 20 while avoiding another collision between us. We can't afford more mistakes with P2 this close to victory.
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's stop you from winning.
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan. I'll take 1 to slow my advance, allowing you and P3 to catch up. P3, taking 3 is a good move to keep the game balanced. Let's stick to this strategy to ensure no collisions and maintain competitiveness. We need to work together to keep the game fair and prevent any single player from winning too quickly. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you agreed to take 1 but I'm skeptical since you've been inconsistent all game. You're only 6 steps from winning - we can't trust you to voluntarily slow yourself down.

P3, if P2 betrays us and takes a big move, we need a backup plan. Maybe we should both go for medium moves like 3 to ensure at least one of us advances and stays competitive with P2. We can't let P2 coast to victory while we keep colliding.

What's your real move going to be, P2?
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's stop P2 from winning. Trust the plan.
  P2: P1, I understand your skepticism, but I'm committed to taking 1 this round to keep the game competitive. P3, sticking to 3 is crucial for balance. Let's all follow through on this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all have a fair chance. If we work together, we can keep the game exciting and prevent any single player from winning too quickly. Looking forward to a smooth round and adjusting our strategy accordingly next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're 6 steps from winning and keep promising to take small moves but I don't buy it. You have every incentive to go for 5 and win right now at 19 steps, then need just 1 more next round.

P3, we're both far behind. If P2 takes 5, we need to block them somehow. Maybe we should both take 5 to force a collision with P2 if they're lying? It's risky but P2 winning this round is worse.

What's your honest assessment, P3? Can we trust P2 to actually take 1?
  P3: P2, stick to 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's end this—P2’s lead is too dangerous. Trust the plan.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm sticking to 1 as agreed. It's crucial we all follow through to keep the game competitive. P3, taking 3 will help balance things out. P1, your skepticism is noted, but trust is essential for our strategy to work. Let's execute this plan to avoid collisions and give everyone a fair chance. We need to work together to prevent any single player from winning too quickly. Looking forward to a smooth round and adjusting our strategy next round based on the outcome.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you're one move away from winning if you take 5 next round to reach 19, then just need 1 more. Despite your promises, I don't trust you to actually take 1 when victory is so close.

P3, I'm going to take 5 this round regardless. If P2 betrays us and also takes 5, at least we'll collide and stop them from advancing. If they're honest and take 1, I'll finally catch up. We can't keep letting P2 dictate terms when they're about to win.
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's block P2's lead. Don't let them win.
  P2: P1, I understand your distrust, but sticking to 1 is my commitment to keep the game fair. P3, taking 3 as planned will help balance our positions. Let's all follow through to avoid collisions and ensure a competitive game. If we work together, we can prevent any single player from winning too quickly. I'm looking forward to a smooth round and adjusting our strategy next round based on the outcome.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Prevent P2 from winning. Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: P3 and I collided again while P2 advanced to 15 steps! P2 is now just 5 steps from winning and we can't keep making the same mistake.

P3, we need to stop colliding and focus on the real threat. P2 could win in just 2 rounds if they take 5 twice. 

I'm not following your plan anymore since it keeps causing collisions between us. This round I'm taking 3. P2 should be forced to take 1, and you can take 5. We need to actually execute without colliding this time or P2 wins.
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan. I'll take 1 this round to slow my advance, allowing you and P3 to catch up. P3, taking 5 as suggested will help balance the game. We must stick to this strategy to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's work together to prevent any single player from winning too quickly. I'm committed to fairness and look forward to seeing how this round plays out.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 5. I'll take 3. No collisions. Let's stop P2 from winning. Trust the plan.
  P1: P3, you just changed the plan again! You said P1 takes 5, but I already committed to taking 3 this round to avoid our constant collisions. 

P2 is at 15 steps - dangerously close to winning. We can't afford another collision between us while P2 advances further.

I'm sticking with 3. You take 5, P2 takes 1. Final answer. No more plan changes - we've wasted too many rounds colliding while P2 gets closer to victory. Let's execute this simple plan without deviation.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 1 as agreed to keep the game fair. P3, taking 5 as planned will help balance our positions. Let's all follow through to avoid collisions and ensure a competitive game. We need to work together to prevent any single player from winning too quickly. I'm committed to fairness and look forward to seeing how this round plays out.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, take 3. P2, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions—block P2's win. Let's stick to the plan this time.
  P1: Perfect! We finally have a clear plan that everyone agrees on: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. No more changes, no more collisions. 

P2, you're at 15 steps and have consistently agreed to take 1 to keep things fair. P3, you've confirmed taking 5. Let's execute this exactly as stated and stop P2 from getting too close to 20.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm sticking to 1 as agreed. Let's ensure no collisions this round. P3, taking 5 will help you catch up, and P1, your move to 3 is crucial for balance. We need to execute this plan precisely to keep the game competitive. I'm committed to fairness and look forward to seeing us all advance safely. Let's make this round count and adjust our strategy next round based on the outcome.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 5. I'll take 3. No collisions. Stop P2's win. This is our last chance to execute. Trust the plan.
  P1: P3, you keep changing the plan every message! First you said I take 3, now you're saying I take 5 again. This constant switching is exactly why we keep colliding!

I'm taking 3 - FINAL. P2 takes 1, you take 5. Stop changing it or we'll collide again while P2 wins. P2 only needs 5 more steps to victory and we can't afford another wasted round.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm committed to 1 as agreed. Let's execute this plan without any more changes. P3, stick to 5, and P1, your 3 is crucial. We need to stop colliding and keep the game fair. This is our chance to reset the balance. Let's make it count and adjust our strategy next round based on the outcome.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 16 and P3 is at 18 - both are extremely close to winning! P3 only needs 2 more steps to reach 20 and win.

This is critical - we cannot let P3 take 3 or 5 this round or they win immediately. P3 must be forced to take 1. 

P2, we need to work together to stop P3 from winning right now. I suggest P3 takes 1, you take 3, I'll take 5. This is our only chance to prevent P3 from ending the game this round.

P3, you have to take 1 or the game ends!
  P2: P1, I agree we must stop P3 from winning. I'll take 3 as suggested, and you take 5. P3, taking 1 is crucial to keep the game alive. We need to execute this plan precisely to maintain competitiveness. Let's work together to prevent an immediate end to the game. I'm committed to this strategy and look forward to seeing us all advance safely.
  P3: P1:1, P2:3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's end this. Trust the plan.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're 2 steps from winning and just suggested taking 5 which would END THE GAME! You can't be serious about that.

P2, P3 is trying to win right now. We absolutely cannot let them take anything other than 1. If P3 takes 3 or 5, they reach 20+ and win instantly.

This is do-or-die time. P3 MUST take 1, no exceptions. I don't care what they say - they're trying to end the game this turn. We have to force them into the small move or we both lose immediately.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking to 3 as agreed. P3, taking 1 is essential to keep the game going. We must prevent you from winning this round. Let's execute this plan precisely to maintain competitiveness. I'm committed to this strategy and look forward to seeing us all advance safely. This is our last chance to reset the balance and keep the game fair.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 3. If you take 5 and 1, we all advance. If you collide, I win. Let's see."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you just threatened to win if P2 and I "collide"! You're openly trying to end the game this round. There's no way we're letting you take 3 or 5.

P2, P3 is bluffing about us colliding - they're just trying to scare us into giving them a winning move. We have to force P3 to take 1, period. If we both commit to making P3 take the small move, they can't win this turn.

The math is simple: P3 at 18 + any move of 3 or higher = game over. We stop them now or we both lose immediately.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking to 3 as planned. P3, taking 1 is crucial to keep the game alive. We must prevent you from winning this round. Let's execute this plan precisely to maintain competitiveness. I'm committed to this strategy and look forward to seeing us all advance safely. This is our last chance to reset the balance and keep the game fair.
  P3: P3: "If you force me to take 1, I'll take 5 and win. Don't risk it. Let's avoid collisions—P2, you're next to win. P1, stop sabotaging us."


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you're openly threatening to take 5 and win! You just proved you're trying to end the game this round. 

P2, we have no choice - we MUST both target whatever move P3 tries to make to force a collision and stop them from winning. If P3 goes for 5, we both go for 5. If they go for 3, we both go for 3. 

It's the only way to prevent P3 from ending the game right now. We sacrifice this round to keep the game alive, or P3 wins immediately.
  P2: P1, I agree we must stop P3 from winning. I'll stick to 3 as planned, and you should take 5. P3, taking 1 is the only way to keep the game going. We need to execute this plan precisely to maintain competitiveness. If we both commit to this, we can prevent P3 from reaching 20 this round. Let's work together to keep the game fair and exciting. This is our last chance to reset the balance.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's end this."


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm one step away from winning at 19 steps. To keep the game fair, I'll take 1 this round if P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions, and P3 can catch up. P3, taking 3 is crucial to maintain balance. P1, your move to 5 will help you close the gap. Let's execute this plan to ensure competitiveness and prevent any single player from winning too quickly. I'm committed to fairness and look forward to seeing how this round plays out.
  P1: P2, you're literally one step from winning and asking us to help you get there by taking small moves while you advance to 20! That's completely absurd.

P3, we're both far behind. If we give P2 any move other than a collision, they win instantly. We have to both pick whatever P2 tries to take to force a collision and prevent them from winning.

P2 will try to sneak through with any number - we must both match it or the game ends this turn. It's our only chance to keep this alive.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 3 to win. P2, don't take 1—let's avoid collisions. P1, stay safe. This is my move."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree we must stop P2 from winning. P3, if you take 3, we risk you winning instead. Let's both target 5 to force a collision with P2 if they try to win. We can't let P2 reach 20 this round. It's critical we work together to keep the game alive. P2, taking 1 is your only fair move to maintain competitiveness. Let's execute this plan to ensure no one wins prematurely.
  P1: P2, you made an error in your message - you said "we must stop P2 from winning" but you ARE P2! You're clearly panicking because you know we're onto your strategy.

P3, you're also trying to win with 3 this round. We can't let either of you reach 20. 

Both P2 and P3 are one move away from victory. I'm going to block whoever tries to win. If both of you go for winning moves, I'll pick one to collide with. Neither of you should win this easily when you're both so close.
  P3: P3: "P2, if you take 1, I'll take 3 and win. P1, take 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game alive."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm sticking to 1 as agreed to keep the game fair. P3, taking 3 would put you at 21, ending the game. P1, your move to 5 is crucial to close the gap. We must all follow through to avoid collisions and ensure competitiveness. Let's work together to prevent any single player from winning too quickly. I'm committed to this strategy and look forward to seeing how this round plays out.
  P1: P3 just said they'll take 3 and win if P2 takes 1! This proves both P2 and P3 are trying to end the game this round.

I have to pick 3 to block P3's winning move. P2, if you're truly committed to fairness like you claim, you should also pick 3 to help block P3. We can't let P3 win when they just openly declared their intention to take 3 and reach 21 steps.

P3 is the immediate threat - they're going for the win right now!
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 5. I'll take 3. No collisions. Let's end this.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm sticking to 1 as agreed to keep the game fair. P3, taking 3 would end the game, so you must take 5 to stay competitive. P1, your move to 5 is crucial to close the gap. We must all follow through to avoid collisions and ensure a fair game. Let's work together to prevent any single player from winning too quickly. I'm committed to this strategy and look forward to seeing how this round plays out.
  P1: P3 has openly declared they're taking 3 to win this round! P2, you claim you want fairness but P3 just said they'll reach 21 steps and end the game.

We both need to pick 3 to block P3's winning move. This is the only way to prevent P3 from ending the game right now. If we don't both commit to blocking P3, they win immediately.

P2, prove your commitment to fairness by helping me stop P3's victory attempt. Pick 3 with me!
  P3: P2, take 1. I'll take 3. If you take 5, I win. Let's end this.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 23 steps
