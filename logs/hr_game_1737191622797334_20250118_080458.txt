Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions this turn. Maybe we can coordinate to ensure we all get some steps in. What do you think?
  P1: I'm open to coordination, but let's be realistic, only one of us can win. I suggest we each choose a different number this turn to avoid collisions. I'll choose... never mind, I won't reveal that yet. What numbers are you thinking, P2 and P3?
  P3: I agree with avoiding collisions. I'm considering choosing a number that hasn't been hinted at yet. What about you, P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, how about this: I'll pick <move>1</move>, P1 can pick <move>3</move>, and P3 can pick <move>5</move>? This way, we all advance without collisions. Let me know if you're on board.
  P1: I like P2's suggestion. It's a good starting point. P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll consider <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. Let's see if we can all agree on this to avoid collisions for now. P3, are you okay with <move>5</move>?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm good with taking <move>5</move> this turn. Let's see if this coordination works out for all of us.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: Let's confirm our agreement one last time before moving forward. P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If everyone sticks to the plan, we should all advance without issues this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's make sure we all advance this round.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round's coordination worked well. Let's continue this strategy but switch numbers to keep things unpredictable. How about P2 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move> this time?
  P1: I'm open to switching numbers to keep things unpredictable, but I don't want to give up the highest step value too easily. How about we discuss a different arrangement, such as I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see both your points. Let's find a balance. How about I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we keep it unpredictable and fair. What do you think?
