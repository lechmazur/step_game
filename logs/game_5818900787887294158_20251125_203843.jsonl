I am 100% locked on 3. It is the only move that prevents your guaranteed win. If you play 3, we crash, you stay at 18, and P1 wins with 20. Your game ends. Your only chance to survive is to block P1 on 5, which puts me in the lead. I've accepted that outcome. The choice is yours: lose now, or let me take the lead. I will not be moving from 3."}
