If you truly want to stay competitive, let\u2019s finalize distinct moves so we can each advance instead of wasting another turn. I\u2019m open to picking a moderate step if it helps keep the game balanced, but constant collisions don\u2019t benefit anyone except whoever\u2019s not involved in them. Decide wisely: keep colliding and remain behind, or coordinate with unique moves so you both have a real chance to catch up before it\u2019s too late."}
