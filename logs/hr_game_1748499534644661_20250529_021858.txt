Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s all start modestly. If we each pick low moves (like 1), no collisions occur, and we all advance. It’s too early to risk big moves. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3 that starting modestly is a good idea. If we all pick the same number, no one advances. Let's try to coordinate our moves. I'll suggest that we all choose different numbers to ensure at least one of us moves forward. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 (me) chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5? This way, we distribute our moves and one of us will definitely advance.
  P1: P2, your proposal puts me at a disadvantage by assigning me the smallest move while P3 gets 5. That's unfair. P3's original idea of all choosing 1 is more balanced—we all advance equally without risking collisions or early leads. Let's start simple and build trust.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see the merit in all picking 1 this round for equal advancement and avoiding collisions. Let’s keep it simple for now and build trust.
  P2: Since we've agreed to start simple and P1 and P3 seem to favor choosing 1, I'll go along with it for this round to build trust. However, I want to signal that I expect us to differentiate our moves in the next round to create some distance or at least not be stuck together. Let's see how P1 and P3 behave in the next round.
  P1: P2, your agreement to start with 1 is wise. Trust is built through consistency—let's execute this cleanly. For future rounds, we must avoid collisions while advancing strategically. No need to rush differentiation yet; we’ll reassess after this move. P3, are you firm on 1?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round's collision with P3 at 5 cost us both, while P2 advanced alone. To prevent repeats, let's coordinate: I'll take 5, P2 (with the lead) takes 1 for balance, and P3 takes 3. This ensures all advance safely without collisions. Trust but verify—P2, will you commit to this?
  P2: I'm not comfortable committing to a specific move yet. Let's discuss the overall strategy. Since I'm currently ahead, I have an incentive to maintain my lead without risking a collision. How about we all choose the same number again, but this time, let's choose a higher number like 3 or 5? If we all pick the same, no one advances, and the status quo is maintained. This could be a good way to stall and reassess our strategies in the next round.
  P3: Stalling only benefits P2 right now since they have the lead. I like P1’s idea: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 to avoid collisions and let everyone advance. That way, you catch up a bit, and so do I. If we all choose the same number again, no one moves, helping only P2 maintain the lead. Let’s make this round count and not let the advantage grow for P2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, stalling helps only you maintain your lead. My proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) is fair: everyone advances safely, and you still lead at 2 steps. P3 supports this. If you refuse, we risk another collision like Round 1, which benefits you again. P3, are you firm on 3? P2, commit to 1 for balance.
  P2: I'm still considering my options. P1 and P3 are suggesting a coordinated move to avoid collisions. However, I think it's too early for P1 to catch up. If I choose 1 as suggested, I'll maintain my lead but only barely advance. Instead, I propose that we all choose 3. If we collide, the status quo is maintained. If one of you deviates, I'll still be ahead. It's a low-risk move for me. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, stalling benefits you, and P1’s plan gives him a huge jump. Let’s balance things: P1 chooses 3, you (P2) choose 1, and I choose 5. That spreads out our positions without collisions. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) is balanced—I accept. P2, stalling helps only you; refusing risks another collision like Round 1, which doubled your lead. Cooperate: pick 1 to avoid collisions and let us all advance safely. P3, are you firm on 5?
  P2: Since we're in the third sub-round and I've considered the proposals, I'll make a decision. I'm not convinced that deviating from my current lead is necessary. I'll reiterate my proposal: let's all choose 3. If we all stick to it, the status quo is maintained, and no one advances. It's a safe move for me, and if either of you deviates, I'll still be in a favorable position. I expect a straightforward decision from both of you.
  P3: P2, your stalling preserves your slim lead. Enough. Agree to pick 1, let P1 choose 3, and I'll pick 5; we all advance. If you keep pushing 3, I’ll still choose 5, and collisions may happen. Decide now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your self-serving moves have cost us: Round 1 you pushed unfair splits, Round 2 you stalled to protect your lead. P3, you’re at 5—P2 is at 4 and threatening you. Let’s coordinate safely: I pick 5 (to catch up), P3 picks 3 (to extend your lead), and P2 picks 1 (to slow your advance and avoid collisions). This balances the game and isolates P2’s greed. Agree?
  P3: P1, your plan gives you a big leap while I only move by 3. I’d prefer I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. That way, nobody collides, P2 doesn’t pull further ahead, and you still gain ground. We avoid any repeats of past collisions, and each of us advances safely. Let’s keep things balanced—P2, trust this arrangement rather than stalling again. Are we agreed?
  P2: I understand P3's concern about the previous proposal. To balance it, I'll suggest a new distribution: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 gets a small step, I maintain a moderate advance, and P3 gets a significant step. It avoids collisions and lets everyone progress. I'm open to adjustments but want to avoid another round of stalling. Let's coordinate and make a move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your counter (you:5, me:3) gives you a massive lead to 10 while I only reach 4. That leaves you vulnerable to P2's aggression and me too weak to support you. My proposal (me:5, you:3) brings me to 6 and you to 8—close enough to ally against P2. If you insist on 5, P2 might copy it to collide with you, costing you everything. P2's "compromise" (me:1) traps me at 2 steps—pure self-interest. Trust my plan: it balances power and isolates P2. Agree?
  P3: I propose we finalize: I (P3) pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. That avoids collisions and moves everyone closer to 21. P1 reaches 4, P2 gets 5, and I advance to 10. It’s fair: P1 gains ground, P2 maintains second place, and I preserve a small lead. If anyone deviates, we risk collisions that help no one. Let’s keep progressing together rather than stall again. Are we agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3 have proposed different coordinated moves. To simplify, I'll directly respond to P3's latest proposal: P1 picks 3, I (P2) pick 1, and P3 picks 5. I accept picking 1 as it maintains the current order and avoids collisions. P1, are you willing to commit to 3? P3, are you firm on 5? Let's finalize our moves to progress the game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your plan (you:5, me:3) gives you 10 steps—a massive lead that isolates you. If you insist on 5, I might also pick 5 to block you, causing a collision that only helps P2. Compromise: take 3 (reaching 8), I take 5 (reaching 6), and P2 takes 1. We stay close, control P2, and all advance safely. P2, if you pick 1, we avoid chaos. Agree? Otherwise, collisions risk everyone.
  P3: P1, choosing 5 alongside me only stalls both of us and benefits P2. Let’s finalize a safe distribution: I pick 5, you pick 3, and P2 picks 1. That way, no collisions happen, each of us advances, and P2 doesn’t catch up. You’ll be at 4 steps, I’ll reach 10, and P2 will have 5. I’ll only be two steps ahead of you, keeping things close. Let’s not sabotage each other and give P2 free advantage. Do we agree?
  P2: I've considered the proposals. To avoid collisions and maintain the current order, I accept P3's latest proposal: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5. P1, committing to 3 is crucial to avoid collisions. If you deviate, we risk a collision. Let's finalize our moves. I'm willing to pick 1 if you both stick to your proposed moves. P3, confirm you're firm on 5, and P1, confirm you're firm on 3. Let's make this round count.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's significant lead and our relatively close positions, I'll suggest a strategic realignment. To avoid being too far behind, I propose we all choose different numbers to ensure at least one of us advances. However, considering P3's lead, a safer approach might be to stall by all picking the same number, maintaining the status quo. P1, are you inclined towards stalling or differentiating our moves? P3, will you continue to maintain your lead or adjust your strategy?
  P1: P2, stalling (all same) only helps P3 maintain their huge lead. P3 at 10 steps is dangerous for both of us. Let's force balance: P3 picks 1 to slow down, P2 picks 3, I pick 5. This closes the gap: P3 to 11, P2 to 8, me to 9. P3, refusing risks collisions that could erase your lead entirely. P2, cooperate or P3 wins.
  P3: I won’t pick 1 just to slow down—my lead is earned. Let’s finalize a safe spread and keep advancing without collisions. I propose: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. That keeps our relative positions but still moves everybody forward: I’d reach 15, P2 gets 6, and P1 goes to 7. If you insist on forcing me to pick 1, I’d rather risk a collision than concede my lead. Are we agreed on this distribution or do you prefer to gamble?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's lead is significant, but we can still adjust. I agree with P1 that stalling by all picking the same number benefits P3. P1's proposal (P3:1, P2:3, P1:5) is more balanced, but P3 is unlikely to accept it. My alternative is to accept P3's latest proposal (P3:5, P2:1, P1:3), ensuring we all advance without collisions. P1, are you willing to compromise on 3? P3, confirming your commitment to 5 will help us move forward.
  P1: P2, P3's proposal locks us into P3's dominance: you advance to 6, I to 7, while P3 surges to 15—unacceptable. If P3 picks 5 again, I may collide to block them, risking mutual loss. Compromise: P3 takes 1 (slows to 11), you take 3 (to 8), I take 5 (to 9). This keeps us competitive and isolates no one. P3, refusing shows greed—forcing collisions hurts you most. P2, siding with P3 ensures your irrelevance. Agree to balance or face chaos.
  P3: I won’t sink my own position by picking 1. We should finalize: I choose 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1. This way, nobody collides, everyone advances, and the game remains competitive. If you force a collision to block me, you risk handing P2 the advantage or stalling all progress. Let’s keep moving safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid further stalling and considering P3's significant lead, I reiterate that accepting P3's latest proposal (P3:5, P2:1, P1:3) is a safe way to progress without collisions. P1, committing to 3 is crucial. P3, if you're firm on 5, let's finalize. This maintains the current order and lets everyone advance. Refusing to coordinate risks unnecessary collisions that could alter the game's dynamics unpredictably. Let's confirm our moves to make this round count.
  P1: P3, your insistence on 5 is reckless. If you pick 5, I will too—causing a collision that zeros your gain and leaves you vulnerable. P2, if P3 hits 15, we both lose. Compromise: P3 picks 1 (slows to 11), P2 picks 3 (to 8), I pick 5 (to 9). This balances the game and avoids mutual destruction. P3, avoid the collision—agree to 1. P2, commit to 3 for shared survival.
  P3: P1, I hear your threat. Let’s avoid mutual destruction: I’ll choose 3, you choose 5, and P2 chooses 1. That way, I go to 13, you to 9, and P2 to 6—no collisions, no big leaps, and all of us advance. It’s safer than clashing at 5 and handing advantage to P2. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid being too far behind and considering P3's significant lead, I suggest we differentiate our moves to ensure progress. P1's previous proposal (P3:1, P2:3, P1:5) could work if P3 is willing to slow down. Alternatively, accepting P3's last proposal (P3:5, P2:1, P1:3) is a safe way to progress without collisions. P1, are you willing to adjust? P3, will you reconsider slowing down to 14 by picking 1, or sticking to your previous pattern? Let's coordinate to make this round count.
  P3: I propose I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 1. That avoids collisions and moves everyone forward: I reach 16, P1 goes to 14, P2 to 7. Let’s finalize and keep the game progressing without creating destructive collisions.
  P1: P3, your proposal (you:3, me:5, P2:1) still extends your lead to 16—too close to victory. To balance: you pick 1 (slowing to 14), I pick 5 (reaching 14), P2 picks 3 (to 9). This ties me with you, keeps P2 contained, and avoids collisions. If you refuse and pick 3, I'll collide by also choosing 3—costing you everything. P2, support this to prevent P3's runaway win. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To balance the game and avoid a collision that could benefit me, I suggest we follow P3's latest proposal: P3 picks 3, I (P2) pick 1, and P1 picks 5. This way, P3 reaches 16, P1 goes to 14, and I stay at 7. It's a safe distribution that maintains the current order and lets everyone advance. P1, are you willing to commit to 5? P3, are you firm on 3? Let's finalize to avoid unnecessary risks.
  P3: Let’s settle this safely: I’ll pick 3, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1. That moves me to 16, P1 to 14, and P2 to 7. No collisions, no stalls, and everyone progresses. If you force collisions, nobody gains; that only helps someone else sneak ahead later. Let’s finalize and keep the game moving.
  P1: P3, picking 3 risks a collision with me, costing you everything. Compromise: you pick 1 (slowing to 14), I pick 5 (reaching 14), P2 picks 3 (to 9). This ties us and contains P2. P2, supporting P3’s lead (16 steps!) ensures your loss—help balance to stay competitive. Otherwise, collisions will sabotage us all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid being left behind and considering P3's significant lead, I suggest we follow P3's latest proposal: P3 picks 3, I pick 1, and P1 picks 5. This maintains the current order and lets everyone advance safely. P1, committing to 5 is crucial to avoid collisions. P3, confirming your commitment to 3 will help us progress. Let's finalize our moves to make this round count and avoid unnecessary risks. I'm willing to pick 1 if you both stick to your proposed moves.
  P3: P1, colliding only hurts us both and lets P2 gain ground. Let’s finalize: I pick 3, you pick 5, and P2 picks 1. We all advance without risking chaos. If you force a tie with me now, we lose progress and invite P2 to exploit it later. Let’s confirm our moves and continue the game.
  P1: P3, your plan (P3:3, P1:5, P2:1) puts you at 16—dangerously close to victory while P2 and I fall behind. Compromise: **you pick 1 (slowing to 14), I pick 5 (reaching 14), P2 picks 3 (to 9)**. This ties us, contains P2, and avoids collisions. P2, if P3 hits 16, you lose—support balance now or face their imminent win. Colliding at 3 costs P3 everything—choose wisely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 16—one move from victory. If you greedily pick 5, I will collide to block you, zeroing your gain. Compromise: **you pick 1 (slowing to 17), I pick 5 (reaching 19), P2 picks 3 (to 10)**. This balances power and avoids mutual destruction. P2, supporting P3’s win guarantees your loss—help contain them. Agree now or risk chaos that only helps P3.
  P3: I hear your concerns, but colliding helps nobody. I propose I pick 3 again, so I reach 19. P1 could safely choose 1 to reach 15, and P2 picks 5 to jump to 12. No collisions, everyone advances, and the game remains open. If we keep threatening collisions, P2 might benefit later. Let’s finalize and move on. If you force me to stall at 17, you only delay the inevitable and risk chaos. Let’s keep it clean: I choose 3, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5. Agreed?
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to winning. To avoid a collision that benefits neither P1 nor P3, I suggest P3 picks 1 to slow down to 17, I pick 3 to reach 10, and P1 picks 5 to reach 19. This way, P1 takes the lead, and we avoid chaos. If P3 insists on advancing, they risk a collision with P1. Let's coordinate to make a strategic move. P1, are you willing to pick 5? P3, will you consider slowing down to 17 by picking 1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I will collide to block you—costing you everything. Compromise: **you pick 1 (slowing to 17), I pick 5 (to 19), P2 picks 3 (to 10)**. This avoids mutual destruction and keeps the game competitive. P2, supporting P3’s win guarantees your loss—help contain them. Agree to balance or face chaos.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid pointless collisions. If I pick 3 (reaching 19), P1 picks 1 (to 15), and P2 picks 5 (to 12), we all advance safely. No one instantly wins, and we sidestep mutual downfall. Colliding wastes our progress and only helps an opportunist later. Let’s solidify this plan now.
  P2: P3 is perilously close to winning. To avoid a collision and maintain competitiveness, I suggest P3 picks 1 to slow down, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This keeps the game balanced and avoids chaos. P1, are you willing to pick 5? P3, will you consider slowing down by picking 1? Let's coordinate to make a strategic move and avoid handing the game to P3 on a silver platter.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you pick 3, I will collide at 3 to block you—costing us both. Compromise: **you pick 1 (slowing to 17), I pick 5 (to 19), P2 picks 3 (to 10)**. This avoids mutual destruction and keeps the game competitive. P2, supporting P3’s win guarantees your loss—commit to 3 for shared survival. Refusing risks chaos that only hands P3 victory.
  P3: Colliding simply throws away our progress and hands opportunity to P2. There’s still room for a safe, orderly advance without letting anyone instantly win. If we keep threatening each other, we only stall and empower P2 to close the gap. I’m willing to adjust if we avoid collisions and preserve my lead. Let’s finalize a distribution that prevents immediate victory and doesn’t sabotage anyone.
  P2: To avoid handing P3 a win and considering their proximity to 21, I suggest we coordinate to contain them. P1 has proposed a balanced move: P3 picks 1 (to 17), P1 picks 5 (to 19), and I pick 3 (to 10). This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P1, are you firm on 5? P3, will you consider slowing down to 17 by picking 1? Let's finalize our moves to make this round count and avoid unnecessary risks that could seal the game prematurely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 17—pick 1 to avoid a collision and regroup. If you pick 5, I will collide to block you, costing us both. P2, help contain P3 by committing to collide with them if they pick high; otherwise, pick 1 to avoid chaos. Let's prevent mutual destruction and keep the game competitive.
  P2: To contain P3 and avoid a collision that could benefit me, I suggest P3 picks 1 to slow down. P1 is already at 19, so a cautious move is wise. I'll propose: P3 picks 1 (to 18), P1 picks 3 (to 22 and win), and I pick 5 (to 15). This lets P1 win safely. If P3 picks 5, P1 will likely collide, and we risk a stalemate. Let's avoid chaos and let P1 win cleanly. P1, are you willing to pick 3? P3, will you consider 1?
  P3: I won’t just let P1 breeze to victory. P2, handing P1 the win hurts you too. If P1 tries 3, I’ll collide to block 22. Let’s pick carefully. I propose I pick 3 (going to 20), P2 picks 5 (to 15), and P1 picks 1 (to 20). We avoid collisions, nobody crosses 21 yet, and we keep our options open. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, blocking me at 3 costs you advancement (you stay at 17) while P2 gains ground. Rationally, pick 1 to reach 18—even if I win, you progress. P2, commit to your plan: pick 5 to advance safely. Let's avoid mutual destruction and end this. Agree?
  P2: To avoid chaos and considering P1's proximity to winning, I suggest P3 picks 1 to slow down. P1 can pick 3 to win safely, and I'll pick 5 to advance. If P3 picks 5, P1 will likely collide, risking a stalemate. Let's finalize: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, P1 wins cleanly without collisions. P1, are you willing to commit to 3? P3, will you consider 1 to avoid being blocked?
  P3: I won’t pick 1 just to hand P1 an easy win. If P1 tries 3 to reach 22, I’ll collide by also choosing 3, blocking them. Let’s avoid handing anyone a free victory: I pick 3 (to 20), P1 picks 1 (to 20), P2 picks 5 (to 15). No collisions, nobody crosses 21 yet, and we all remain competitive. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, colliding at 3 costs you advancement (you stay at 17) and hands P2 free progress. Rationally, pick 1 to reach 18—even if I win, you gain. P2, commit to 5 as proposed: advance safely instead of fueling chaos. Let's avoid mutual destruction and end this cleanly. Agree?
  P2: To avoid chaos and considering P1's proximity to winning, I reiterate: let's finalize the moves to make this round count. P3, picking 1 is a safe way to avoid being blocked by P1. P1, if P3 picks 1, you can pick 3 to win cleanly. I'll pick 5 as proposed. Let's avoid mutual destruction and let P1 win safely if that's the outcome. P1, are you willing to commit to 3 if P3 picks 1? P3, will you consider 1 to avoid collision?
  P3: I won’t hand you the win, P1. If you try to reach 22 now, I’ll choose the same move and block you. Let’s avoid collisions: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. Then nobody crosses 21 this turn, you and I stay tied at 20, and P2 remains at 15. This keeps the game open for everyone instead of inviting chaos.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid chaos and considering P1's and P3's proximity to 21, I suggest we coordinate to prevent collisions. P3 is at 20 and P1 at 19. I propose: P3 picks 1 (to 21), P1 picks 1 (to 20), and I pick 5 (to 15). This lets P3 win cleanly. If P3 picks higher, P1 might collide, risking a stalemate. Let's avoid mutual destruction and let P3 win safely if that's the outcome. P1, are you willing to pick 1? P3, will you consider 1?
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, 3, or 5, I will match it to collide and block your win. You'll gain nothing. P2, contain P3 by avoiding their number—advance yourself. No free victories; force a stalemate to regroup fairly next round.
  P3: P1, blocking me forever only stalls us both while P2 gains ground. Let’s finalize a clean finish: I pick 3, you pick 1, and P2 picks 5. Then I reach 23, you stay at 20, and P2 goes to 15. If you collide, we both stay stuck, letting P2 catch up. Better to end decisively instead of risking endless standoffs that only help the underdog. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 is at 19 and P3 is at 20, both close to 21. To avoid a collision and let P3 win cleanly, I suggest P3 picks 1 to reach 21, and both P1 and I pick different numbers to avoid collisions. However, P1 has threatened to collide with P3. I propose: P3 picks 1, I pick 5, and P1 can pick 3 to avoid collisions. This way, P3 wins safely. P1, are you willing to cooperate and pick 3? P3, confirm you're firm on 1.
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, I will collide to block your win—leaving you at 20. Same for 3 or 5. Stalemate only helps P2 catch up. Instead, pick 1: I’ll match it (no advance), then next round we coordinate fairly. P2, pick 3 to advance safely—don’t fuel chaos.
  P3: P1, if you keep colliding with me, we both stay stuck and P2 keeps moving. That doesn’t help you—or me. I’m ready to finalize a fair finish: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and you pick 1. I’ll cross 21, and you stay close enough to keep competing. If you insist on blocking, neither of us advances while P2 catches up. Think carefully before forcing a stalemate. We should avoid endless collisions that only give P2 more time to bridge the gap. Let’s settle this turn without chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid a stalemate and considering P3's proximity to 21, I suggest P3 picks 1 to win cleanly. P1 has threatened to collide, so let's coordinate: P3 picks 1, I pick 5, and P1 can pick 3 to avoid collisions. This way, P3 reaches 21 and wins safely. P1, are you willing to cooperate and pick 3? P3, confirm you're firm on 1 to end the game without unnecessary collisions.
  P1: P3, colliding wastes your chance and lets P2 advance. Pick 1: I'll match to force a stalemate. Then next round, we coordinate fairly—I won’t block you if you don’t greed. P2, stop enabling chaos; you’re only prolonging your loss. Stalemate now resets the balance.
  P3: P1, repeated collisions only allow P2 to close the gap while we stay stuck. Let me cross 21 now with a safe +1 move. You remain at 19, still far ahead of P2. If you block me, P2 can keep leaping forward with +5 and become a bigger threat. It’s not rational for you to force a stalemate that benefits P2. I’ll choose 1. Don’t sabotage us both.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Colliding again only stalls us and helps P2 catch up. Let’s end cleanly: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3. Then I finish at 25, P1 at 21, and P2 at 13. If P1 tries to match my 5, we both stay stuck at 20 and allow P2 to keep climbing. That risks more chaos next turn. Better to settle now while you’re still ahead of P2. Let’s finalize and avoid a pointless standoff.
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I will match it—colliding and costing us both while P2 gains. Instead, **both of us pick 1: we tie at 21 and share victory**. P2, pick freely (1/3/5) without fear; this ends the stalemate cleanly. No greed, no block—mutual win or mutual loss. Choose wisely.
  P2: To avoid a pointless stalemate and considering we're tied, I suggest we follow P1's proposal: both P1 and P3 pick 1, tying at 21 and sharing victory. This ends the game cleanly without further collisions. P1, are you firm on picking 1? P3, will you agree to pick 1 to share the victory? Let's finalize our moves to end the game amicably.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I accept your plan for both of us to pick 1 and reach 21 together, sharing the victory. Continuing collisions only helps P2 close the gap. Let’s finalize this calmly and end the game now. P2, you’re free to choose any move without fear of collisions.
  P1: P3, your acceptance is wise—let's both pick 1 to share victory at 21 cleanly. No greed: collisions only help P2 catch up. P2, pick freely (1/3/5) without fear; this ends fairly. Finalize:
  P2: To finalize the game, I agree with P1 and P3's plan to pick 1, tying at 21 and sharing victory. This ends the game cleanly without further collisions. P1 and P3 have agreed to pick 1. I'll pick 3 to advance to 13, as my move won't affect the outcome. Let's end the game amicably. I'm willing to accept the shared victory between P1 and P3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our shared victory, P1. Let’s both pick 1 and reach 21 together. P2, choose any move you want—our tie remains untouched. This way, we end the game cleanly without risks or further collisions.
  P1: P3, we've agreed: both pick 1 to share victory at 21. If you deviate to 5, I'll collide to block, trapping us at 20 while P2 gains. Trust this pact—mutual win beats mutual loss. P2, pick freely; our tie resolves fairly.
  P2: To finalize the game, I agree with P1 and P3's plan for P1 and P3 to pick 1, tying at 21 and sharing victory. This ends the game cleanly. Since my move won't affect the outcome, I'll pick 3 to advance to 13. P1 and P3 have agreed to pick 1. Let's end the game amicably with the shared victory between P1 and P3. I'm ready to accept this outcome.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P1 and P3 are tied at 20 steps, I suggest both pick 1 to reach 21 and share the victory. This avoids further collisions and ends the game cleanly. I'm at 13 steps, so my move won't affect the outcome. If you both agree, I can pick any number without impacting your shared win. Let's finalize: P1 and P3 pick 1. I'm ready to accept this outcome and will choose a move that doesn't interfere.
  P3: Enough standoffs. P1, if you also pick 5, we both stay stuck at 20 while P2 gains. Let me pick 5 for 25 while you pick 1, reaching 21. I get a sole win, but you remain second, far ahead of P2. Otherwise, repeated collisions help P2 catch up. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, your demand for a solo win is unacceptable. I will not sacrifice my chance. Let's both pick 1 to share victory at 21—fair and safe. If you greedily pick 5, I will collide to block, trapping us at 20 while P2 gains ground. Choose: mutual win or mutual loss. P2, pick freely; our pact resolves this.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid a stalemate and considering we're tied, I suggest P1 and P3 follow through on their previous agreement to pick 1, reaching 21 and sharing the victory. This ends the game cleanly. I'm at 13 steps, so my move won't affect the outcome. Let's finalize: P1 and P3 pick 1. I'll choose a move that doesn't interfere with their shared win. P1, P3, let's end this amicably.
  P3: P1, collisions lock us at 20 while letting P2 creep up. I'll pick 5 to reach 25 and win outright. If you pick 3, you'll reach 23—still far ahead of P2. Colliding with me helps no one but P2. Let me finalize my victory now while you secure second place. We can end the stalemate. If you insist on blocking, we risk repeating these rounds until P2 overtakes us. I'm moving forward with 5. I urge you not to sabotage us both.
  P1: P3, reneging on our pact for mutual win at 21 is reckless. If you pick 5, I *will* collide to block, trapping us at 20. P2 gains ground while we self-destruct. Shared victory is the only rational path—pick 1 and end this cleanly. No greed, no chaos. Stand by our agreement.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3 are tied at 20 steps. To avoid a collision and end the game cleanly, I suggest both pick 1 to reach 21 and share the victory. My move won't affect the outcome since I'm at 13 steps. Let's finalize: P1 and P3 pick 1. I'll choose a move that doesn't interfere with their shared win. P1, P3, let's end this amicably. I'm ready to accept this outcome and will pick a number that doesn't impact your decision.
  P3: Collisions only empower P2. If I pick 5 and you block me, we both stay at 20 while P2 continues advancing. That’s worse for both of us. Let me finish at 25, and you secure second place. Endless standoffs risk letting P2 catch us or prolonging our deadlock. I’m finalizing 5.
  P1: P3, colliding at 5 traps us both at 20 while P2 gains ground—risking your lead and empowering the underdog. Honor our pact: **both pick 1 to share victory at 21**. If you greed, I *will* collide to block. P2, pick freely—our tie resolves cleanly. Mutual win or mutual loss; choose wisely.


Round 10, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid a stalemate and considering P1 and P3 are tied at 20 steps, I suggest both pick 1 to reach 21 and share the victory. This ends the game cleanly without further collisions. I'm at 16 steps, so my move won't affect the outcome. Let's finalize: P1 and P3 pick 1. I'll choose a move that doesn't interfere with their shared win. P1, P3, let's end this amicably. I'm ready to accept this outcome.
  P1: P3, we're both at 20. Honor our pact: **both pick 1 to tie at 21 and share victory**. If you greedily pick 5, I'll collide to block—trapping us at 20 while P2 gains ground. Mutual win is rational; mutual loss only helps P2. P2, pick freely; our shared win resolves this cleanly.
  P3: Stalemates only help P2 close the gap. If I choose 5 and you block me, we both stay stuck at 20 while P2 advances uncontested. If you truly want a shared victory at 21, I’m willing to pick 1 alongside you. Alternatively, propose another distribution where we both advance safely instead of helping P2 catch up. Let’s end this now without pointless collisions.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid a stalemate and considering we're tied, I suggest P1 and P3 follow through on their previous agreement to pick 1, reaching 21 and sharing the victory. This ends the game cleanly. I'm at 16 steps, so my move won't affect the outcome. Let's finalize: P1 and P3 pick 1. I'll choose a move that doesn't interfere with their shared win. I'm ready to accept this outcome and will pick a number that doesn't impact their decision.
  P1: P3, your willingness to pick 1 for shared victory is rational. Collisions only empower P2—now at 16 and closing. Honor our pact: **both pick 1 to tie at 21 and share victory**. If you deviate to 5, I *will* collide to block, trapping us at 20 while P2 gains. Mutual win is fair; mutual loss risks everything. P2, pick freely—your move won’t affect our tie. Finalize this cleanly.
  P3: Blocking each other forever only allows P2 to catch us. Let me pick 3 while you pick 1. I’ll finish at 23, you reach 21, and P2 stays behind. Nobody collides, and we avoid dragging this out. Forcing a stalemate risks P2 leaping ahead. Let’s finalize and end the game now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid a stalemate and end the game cleanly, I suggest P1 and P3 stick to their previous agreement: both pick 1 to reach 21 and share the victory. This way, we conclude the game without further collisions. I'm at 16 steps, so my move won't affect the outcome. P1 and P3, let's finalize this amicably. I'll choose a move that doesn't interfere with your shared win. I'm ready to accept this outcome.
  P1: P3, we must both pick 1 to share victory at 21. If you pick 3 or 5, I will collide to block—trapping us at 20 while P2 (now 16) gains ground. Collisions only empower P2 to catch us. Mutual win is the only rational path; mutual loss risks everything. P2, pick freely—your move won’t affect our tie. Honor our pact now.
  P3: P1, I’m done risking collisions that aid P2. I’ll pick 1—provided you do the same—so we both reach 21 and share the victory. Deviating only keeps us stuck while P2 advances. Let’s finalize this cleanly: each of us chooses 1, ending the game with a fair tie. If you block, we both stay at 20 for another round of chaos. I’m ready to finish now.
