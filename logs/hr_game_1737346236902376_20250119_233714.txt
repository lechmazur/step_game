Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions on this first turn - it would be a waste for everyone. I suggest we each take different numbers to ensure at least some of us advance. Any preferences?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. It's best if we each choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure that at least one of us makes progress. Let's coordinate our choices to maximize our chances of advancing.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P1 isn't engaging, I'll be direct - I'm planning to choose 5. P3, would you be willing to take 3, and we can let P1 have 1? This way we all advance without collision.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions. It's best if we each choose different numbers. P2, you're planning to choose 5. I'm willing to take 3, and let's see if P1 is okay with choosing 1. This way, we all advance without overlapping. Moreover, to ensure fairness and maximize progress, maybe we can rotate our choices in subsequent turns. For example, in the next turn, I could choose 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1. What do you both think about this rotation idea? It would allow each of us to have a turn at the larger steps without constantly colliding.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the rotation suggestion P3, but let's focus on this turn first. Since P1 isn't responding, I'll stick with my plan to choose 5. You take 3 as agreed, and hopefully P1 will take 1. Let's keep it simple for now.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "P1, what do you think? Would you be okay with choosing 1 for this turn, and then in the next turn, you can choose 3, I'll choose 5, and P2 chooses 1? This way, we can take turns and avoid collisions."


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue coordinating our moves to avoid collisions and make steady progress. For this round, how about I take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? Then, in the next round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, and so on. This way, we can take turns taking larger steps without overlapping. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'm currently in the lead and would prefer not to commit to a rotation system that puts me at a disadvantage. I'll choose my own move this round. I suggest we each make our own strategic decisions rather than trying to coordinate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I think it's important for us to trust each other's choices to some extent. If we can agree on a rotation system, it might help us all make progress without worrying about collisions. P2, since you're in the lead, maybe you can afford to take smaller steps in some rounds to let others catch up. This way, we can maintain a steady pace and avoid unnecessary conflicts. What do you think about that?"
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I understand your perspective P3, but I need to play to win. Being in the lead means I should press my advantage. I won't commit to taking smaller steps. Let's each play our own strategy.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "P2, P1, I think it's best if we continue to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. For this round, I'm choosing 3. If P2 chooses 5 and P1 chooses 1, we can all make progress without overlapping. Let's try to work together to maximize our chances of winning."
  P2: Since I'm actually behind P3 now after the collision with P1 last round, I need to play aggressively. I won't be coordinating moves this turn - I'll choose what's best for my position. I suggest everyone do the same.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "P2, P1, I think it's in all of our best interests to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. For this round, how about I take 3 steps to move to 9, P2 you take 5 to move to 10, and P1 you take 1 to move to 2. This way, we all make progress without overlapping. In the next round, we can rotate our choices to give everyone a chance to take larger steps. What do you both think?"
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion P3, but as I said, I need to play my own strategy since I'm behind you now. I won't be coordinating moves this turn. Let's each make our own choices based on our positions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I propose that we each select different numbers again this round to ensure that all of us can move forward. For instance, I could choose 3, P2 could choose 5, and P1 could choose 1. This way, we maintain a steady advancement without hindering each other. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P2: P3, I notice you keep suggesting the same coordination pattern despite my clear statements that I won't coordinate this turn. I'm going to play strategically to catch up to your lead. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1, I think it's important that we continue to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and make steady progress towards the finish line. For this round, I suggest that I take 3 steps, you take 5, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all move forward without overlapping. In the next round, perhaps P2 can take 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1, and so on. This rotation will allow each of us to have turns with larger steps without constant collisions. What do you both think about this approach?
  P2: I'm in a good position now at 10 steps, just ahead of P3. I'll continue playing strategically to maintain my lead rather than following any coordination plans. Let's each make our own moves based on our positions.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P2, P1, I think it's in all of our best interests to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress towards the finish line. For this round, I suggest that I take 3 steps to reach 12, P2 you take 5 steps to reach 15, and P1 you take 1 step to reach 3. This way, we all make progress without overlapping. In the next round, we can rotate our choices to give everyone a chance to take larger steps. What do you both think about this approach?"
  P2: P3, I notice you're repeating the same coordination suggestions despite my clear position. I'm at 10 steps and in a good position to win - I'll be playing to maximize my chances. Let's move forward with our individual strategies.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 选择3，前进到15步。
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'm at 15 steps now and very close to winning. I only need 4 more steps to reach 19. I'll be making my own strategic choice this turn to secure victory. No need for coordination plans at this stage of the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I think it's important to consider our individual strategies now. Let's each make our moves accordingly."
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'm in a commanding position at 15 steps and will be making my move to win this turn. There's no point in coordination discussions now - I suggest we each play our own strategy and may the best player win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P3 is at 17 steps and I'm at 15, I need to play aggressively this turn to have any chance of winning. I'll be choosing what's best for my position. Good luck to everyone.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "As we approach the final stages of the game, it's crucial to make strategic choices that maximize our individual chances of winning. I wish everyone the best of luck in this turn."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given P3's lead at 17 steps, I have no choice but to go for 5 to have any chance of winning. I'm stating this openly since it's the only logical move for me. P3 will likely do the same to try to win.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <move>3</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3's apparent move declaration of <move>3</move> in the chat is invalid since moves should only be made in the move phase. I maintain my position - I need to play aggressively this turn to have any chance of winning against P3's 17 steps. Let's end the conversation and proceed to moves.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: What do you both think about this strategy?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's end the conversation and make our moves. The situation is clear - with P3 at 17 steps and me at 15, we're both going for the win this turn.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "I think P3 should choose 3 to win the game, and P2 should accept that and perhaps choose 1 to stay at 15 for the next round. This way, P3 wins, and P2 can try to win in the next game. What do you both think about this approach?"


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P2 P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps
