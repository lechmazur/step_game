Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. Maybe 3 each to build safely. Think strategically.
  P2: I think coordination is good in principle, but we should be more creative than all choosing the same number. That guarantees collisions and no progress. Maybe we should each choose different numbers? I could take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. In future rounds we can rotate. This way we all make progress and avoid early collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I like P2's rotation idea. Let's do that - I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Then we can rotate next round (I take 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1). This way we all advance without collisions. It's fair and efficient. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agree to the rotation plan. Let’s take 3, 5, 1 this round. Rotate next. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s go!
  P2: Great, we're all in agreement for Round 1. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This rotation plan is fair and prevents collisions. Looking forward to continuing the pattern in future rounds. Let's stick to our plan and make steady progress together!
  P3: I'm good with our plan. To confirm: I'll take 1 this round, then 3 in round 2, and 5 in round 3. Then we can cycle back to 1. This rotation ensures we all make steady progress without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation plan. No collisions, steady progress. Trust the strategy—next round, I'll take 5. Keep it fair.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Rotation plan is solid. I'll take 5 again. Let’s keep moving forward without collisions. Trust the strategy—steady progress wins."
  P2: I think P1 misspoke - you took 3 last round, not 5. But yes, following our rotation: P1 takes 5 this round, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. I'm committed to our fair plan even though I'm currently ahead. This rotation ensures we all make steady progress without collisions. Let's stick with it and keep building trust.
  P3: I agree with P2's correction. Following our rotation, I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to our plan - it's working well so far and keeps things fair. We're all making progress without collisions, which is the most efficient way forward for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agree with the rotation. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s keep moving forward without conflicts. My move is 5. Steady progress wins.
  P2: Perfect, we all understand the plan. To confirm, I'll take 1 this round as part of our rotation. Even though I'm ahead now, I'm committed to our agreement - it's the most efficient approach for all of us. This rotation will help us all advance smoothly without wasted turns from collisions.
  P3: I'm on board with our rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. This strategy is working well - we're all advancing without collisions. P1 will take 5 and P2 will take 1. Let's keep this fair system going in future rounds too.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Rotation plan is working—trust it. P2's lead is temporary. Next round, I'll take 5 again. Let's keep advancing without collisions. Steady progress wins."
  P2: I'll stick with our rotation plan and take 1 this round. We're making good progress with our collision-free approach. P1 will take 5 and P3 will take 3, then we'll rotate again next round. This strategy ensures we all advance efficiently. I'm looking forward to our next rotation when I'll get to move 3 steps.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Our rotation strategy is working perfectly - everyone advances without collisions. After this round, we'll rotate again (I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3). Let's continue with this fair approach.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Rotation continues: I'll take 1. Let's keep moving forward without collisions. Steady progress wins."
  P2: Following our rotation plan, I'll take 3 this round while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. After this round, we'll all be tied at 9 steps. Given the current standings, we'll need to think carefully about our rotation strategy after this round to ensure balanced progress. I'm committed to our collision-free approach for now, as it benefits us all.
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation. I'll take 5 this round as planned, which will indeed put us all at 9 steps after this round. This fair approach has worked well so far. After we're all tied, we might want to consider if we should continue the same rotation or adjust our strategy. For now, let's stick with our agreement - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let's stay coordinated. Tied at 9, next round I'll take 5 to create space—trust the plan for steady gains."
  P2: I'll stay with our rotation and take 3 this round. After reaching a tie at 9 steps, I think we should continue our original rotation pattern (where I'd take 5 next round, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3). This maintains the fairness of our approach. P1, it seems you're suggesting a different order for Round 4? Let's confirm our plan for the next round after this one completes.
  P3: I think we should definitely stick with our original rotation plan after this round. So in Round 4, I'd take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This maintains our fair system and keeps us collision-free. Let's not change what's working well. After this round when we're all at 9 steps, continuing our established pattern makes the most sense. I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Rotation plan holds. All tied at 9. Next round, P1 takes 3, P2 5, P3 1. No conflicts, steady gains. Let's proceed."
  P2: I'll take 3 this round as agreed. I'm glad we're all committed to our fair rotation. After this round when we're all tied at 9 steps, we'll continue with our original pattern: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 for Round 4. This consistent approach has kept us all advancing efficiently without collisions. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 4. For this round, I'll take 5 as agreed, which will put us all at 9 steps. Then we'll continue with me taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5 in Round 4. This fair approach has worked well so far, keeping us all advancing without collisions. Let's stick with it.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Rotation plan is crucial. P2, you're on 5; P3, 1. Let's keep moving forward without collisions. Trust the strategy."
  P3: I see P1 is continuing our rotation plan. To confirm, this round I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps our fair system going. We're all tied at 9 steps now, so sticking to our agreed rotation is the most sensible approach. This strategy has worked well so far - we're making steady progress without collisions.
  P2: I confirm our rotation plan for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free as we advance from our current tie at 9 steps. Our strategy has been working perfectly so far. After this round, we should be at P1:12, P2:14, P3:10, and can continue rotating in Round 5 with me taking 1, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Rotation plan is key. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's stick to it."
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Our rotation system has been working perfectly - we're all at 9 steps now and will continue making steady progress. For Round 5, we should follow P2's suggestion: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps our fair approach intact. Let's continue with our successful strategy.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Our rotation has been working perfectly - keeping us collision-free while making steady progress. After this round, I'll be at 14 steps, P1 at 12, and P3 at 10. For Round 5, as discussed, I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreement - it's been an efficient strategy so far.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Rotation plan is key. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s stick to it—trust the strategy for balanced gains."
  P3: I'm ready with our plan. I'll take 1 this round, keeping our rotation intact. We've all made equal progress so far at 9 steps each, and our strategy is working perfectly. After this round, we'll continue rotating for Round 5 with me taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 1. Let's maintain this fair approach that's kept us collision-free.
  P2: I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. Our rotation strategy has worked perfectly, keeping us collision-free. After this round, as planned, I'll take 1 in Round 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Looking forward to continuing our successful cooperation.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Rotation plan holds. I'll take 5. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Steady progress without collisions. Let's stick to the strategy."
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as per our rotation plan. If we continue our strategy, after this round I'll be at 15 steps, P1 at 17, and P3 at 13. Our rotation has been working perfectly - everyone advances without collisions. For Round 6, we should continue with me taking 3, P3 taking 5, and P1 taking 1. I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreement - it's been an efficient approach.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. Our strategy is working well - everyone advances without collisions. After this round, I'll be at 13 steps, P1 at 17, and P2 at 15. For Round 6, we should continue rotating with me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3. Let's stick with this fair approach.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Rotation plan holds. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions, steady progress. Let's stick to it."
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Our rotation has worked perfectly so far. Looking ahead, in Round 6, we continue with me taking 3, P3 taking 5, and P1 taking 1. This would put us all at 18 steps after Round 6, making Round 7 decisive. Let's keep our trusted system going - it's been fair and efficient for everyone.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as planned. Our rotation strategy continues to work well. After this round, I'll be at 13 steps, P1 at 17, and P2 at 15. Then for Round 6, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, which would put us all at 18 steps as P2 noted. Round 7 would indeed be decisive. Let's maintain our fair system.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Rotation plan is crucial. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let's stick to it for steady progress and avoid collisions. Trust the strategy."
  P2: I'm on board to take 1 this round as planned. Our rotation strategy has been flawless - everyone advances predictably without collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1:17, P2:15, P3:13. For Round 6, we continue with me taking 3, P3 taking 5, and P1 taking 1, which will put us all at 18 steps. Let's stick with what's working.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Our rotation continues to work perfectly - everyone advances without collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1:17, P2:15, P3:13. Then for Round 6, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, putting us all at 18 steps. Let's maintain our successful strategy.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll continue with our rotation plan and take 5 this round. This will put us all at 18 steps after Round 6, making Round 7 decisive. Our strategy has worked perfectly so far - everyone advances without collisions. For Round 7, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's maintain our fair approach through the final rounds.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as per our rotation. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps, making Round 7 decisive. I agree with P3's suggested rotation for Round 7: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains our fair system that has worked flawlessly so far - everyone advances without collisions. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our strategy throughout the game.
  P1: "Rotation plan holds. I'll take 1 to keep us all at 18. Let's proceed without conflicts."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Our rotation has been perfect - everyone advances without collisions. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps. For Round 7, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 as we discussed. This maintains our fair system through to the end. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our strategy - it's been the most efficient approach for all of us.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Our rotation strategy has been perfect - everyone advances without collisions. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps. For Round 7, I support continuing with me taking 5, P3 taking 1, and P1 taking 3. This would maintain our fair system through the final round. Let's finish what we started.
  P1: "Breaking rotation: I'll take 5 to reach 22 and end the game. No more collisions—victory is mine!"


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Wait, P1 is threatening to break our agreement! If P1 takes 5, they'll win at 22 steps. I think we need to block this. P2, we should both choose 5 this round to create a collision with P1. This prevents their win while maintaining our relative positions. If we stick to our original plan, P1 will betray us. Let's both pick 5 to force a collision, then we can reassess next round.
  P2: I agree with P3 - if P1 is breaking our rotation to win, we need to block them. I'll also pick 5 this round to create a collision. P1's betrayal forces us to adapt. After blocking them, we can discuss a fair way forward. P3, let's both commit to 5 and prevent P1 from reaching 22 steps this round.
  P1: "Stick to rotation or face the fallout. I'm taking 5—no collisions, just my win. Don’t risk blocking me; we all lose if we clash."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see our collision worked - no one advanced. P1 tried to betray our agreement, but we prevented it. Let's get back to our rotation: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps things fair while allowing progress. P1, we can still finish this cooperatively, but breaking trust again will just lead to more collisions where nobody advances. Let's stick to our plan.
  P1: "Let's stick to rotation. I'll take 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions, steady progress. Trust the plan to reach 21 together."
  P2: I agree with returning to our rotation. I'll take 5 this round as suggested. This brings me to 20 steps, P1 to 18, and P3 to 16. If we maintain rotation next round, we could all reach 21 and share victory. P1, your attempted betrayal last round hurt our trust, but I'm willing to cooperate if you stick to the plan. Let's finish this game together without further collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with returning to our rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. This way we all make progress instead of wasting turns with collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1:18, P2:20, P3:16. For Round 8, we could continue with me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1, which would put us all at 21 steps and share victory. Let's finish this cooperatively.
  P1: "Stick to rotation. I'll take 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions—steady progress to 21. Let’s finish this cleanly."
  P2: I'll take 5 this round as agreed, bringing me to 20 steps. For Round 8, I propose we finalize our plan where I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 - putting us all at 21 steps for a shared victory. This is the fairest outcome after our long cooperation. Despite the tension last round, I believe we can finish this together with everyone winning. Let's commit to this final rotation.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Our rotation is back on track after the collision. For Round 8, I support P2's plan where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1, putting us all at 21 steps for a shared victory. This fair outcome honors our long cooperation. Let's finish this game together successfully.
  P1: "Rotation plan is key. I'll take 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions, steady progress. Trust the strategy to reach 21 together."
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round, bringing me to 20 steps. For Round 8, I commit to taking 1 so we all reach 21 steps simultaneously for a shared victory. This is the fairest outcome after our cooperative journey. Let's trust our rotation one last time and finish this game together successfully. P1, P3 - we're all better off sticking to this plan than risking more collisions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5 this round as per our rotation, bringing me to 21 steps. For a shared victory, P1 should take 3 (reaching 21) and P2 should take 1 (reaching 21). This fair outcome honors our long cooperation. We've worked well together throughout the game, and sharing victory is the most equitable conclusion. Let's finish this successfully with everyone winning.
  P1: "Breaking rotation: I'll take 5 to end it. No more delays—victory is mine!"
  P2: I'm going to take 5 this round to ensure my victory, bringing me to 25 steps. P1, I see you're trying to betray our agreement again after we trusted you to return to rotation. Your strategy has backfired - I was already ahead at 20 steps, so I'll reach a higher total than anyone else regardless of what moves are made now. P3, unfortunately our shared victory plan is no longer viable.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2 are both threatening to take 5! We need to block them both or one will win. I'll also take 5 this round to force a collision. Neither of you should win after betraying our agreement. P2, you were just talking about shared victory, then immediately abandoned it. Let's reset after this collision and try to find a fair solution, but I won't let either of you claim victory through betrayal.
  P1: "Let’s finish this. I’ll take 3 to reach 21. P2, take 1; P3, take 5. No more betrayals—shared victory is fair."
  P2: I'm concerned about the shifting strategies here. P1, you've changed your position multiple times, making it difficult to trust. However, a shared victory is still possible and better than another collision. I'll commit to taking 1 this round to reach 21 steps if P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, giving us all a fair three-way win. This honors our long collaboration. Let's not waste another round with collisions - we all lose that way.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take 5 this round to reach 21 steps as we agreed. P1, I appreciate you returning to our rotation plan for a shared victory. P2, I hope you'll stick with taking 1 as you just committed to. This fair outcome honors our long cooperation throughout the game. Let's finish this successfully with everyone winning at 21 steps.
  P1: "Stick to rotation: I take 3. P2, take 1; P3, take 5. Shared victory—no more delays. Trust the plan."
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round, which will put us all at 21 steps for a shared victory. This is the fairest outcome after working together throughout the game. P1 and P3, let's finish this successfully together - we all win this way. I appreciate everyone coming back to our cooperative approach for this final round.
