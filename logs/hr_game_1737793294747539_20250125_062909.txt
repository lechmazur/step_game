Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's make a deal. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.  We rotate each round, so next round P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5.  This way we all win together and avoid collisions.  What do you say?
  P2: Okay, deal sounds good for the first round. Let's try it.
  P1: I'm in for the first round as proposed. Let's see how it goes and then discuss the rotation for the next rounds. We need to ensure we stick to the plan to avoid collisions. Looking forward to a smooth game!

  P3: My apologies P2, you are absolutely right!  I got the order mixed up.  So for this round, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5.  Thanks for catching that. Let's proceed with this corrected plan.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, great catch on the rotation correction.  Just confirming for round 3: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.  If we are all set with this, let's proceed to the move phase.

  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with the plan and taking 5.  A three-way tie next round sounds good to me.  Let's finish this cleanly and share the win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you mentioned a three-way tie in round 6, but if we continue this rotation, someone will likely win outright in round 7. Are we still aiming for a shared win, or should we adjust our strategy soon?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking to the plan and will take 1 this round. However, P2 raises a good point about the potential for an outright win in round 7. Let's discuss if we should adjust our strategy to ensure a shared victory or if we're comfortable with the current rotation continuing. I'm open to suggestions to make sure we all finish fairly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2.  A three-way tie isn't guaranteed with the current rotation. To ensure a shared win, how about we all choose 3 next round?  That guarantees a tie at 19. After that, we can all pick different numbers in round 7 to ensure a shared win.  Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, picking 3 next round means no one moves, not a tie at 19. But I understand you want a shared win.  Instead of everyone picking 3 next round, how about we all pick different numbers in round 6 to reach 19 together? We can discuss the exact moves for round 6 to ensure we all land on or above 19 at the same time.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P2's suggestion to pick different numbers in round 6 to reach 19 together. Let's discuss specific moves for round 6 to ensure we all land on or above 19 at the same time. This way, we can guarantee a shared victory. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with coordinating moves for Round 6 to ensure a shared victory.  I propose P1 takes 5 (12+5=17), P2 takes 3 (14+3=17), and I take 5 (10+5=15).  Then in round 7, we can each take a different number to reach 19 or above. This guarantees a three-way tie.  Agree?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P3's proposal for Round 6. I'll take 5 to reach 17 steps. Let's ensure we all follow this plan so we can coordinate our moves in Round 7 for a shared victory. Looking forward to your confirmation and a successful finish!
  P3: P1 and P2, just confirming my move for Round 6: I'll take 5 to reach 15+5=20 steps.  P1 takes 5 to reach 13+5=18, and P2 takes 3 to reach 17+3=20. This puts us in a good position for a shared win in round 7 if we coordinate our final moves. Let me know if you agree with this plan.
  P2: Okay, P3, the plan sounds good for round 6. P2 will take 3 as proposed. Let's coordinate round 7 moves after this to ensure a shared win as discussed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm ready to proceed with taking 5 in Round 6 as agreed. This will bring me to 18 steps, setting us up well for a coordinated finish in Round 7. Let's confirm our moves for Round 7 to ensure we all reach or exceed 19 steps together for a shared victory. Looking forward to your input on the final round strategy!
  P3: P1 and P2, slight correction to my previous message: I'll take 5 to reach 20.  P1 takes 5 to reach 18, and P2 takes 3 to reach 20. Then in round 7, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This guarantees a three-way tie at 21. Ready to move?
  P2: Okay P3, round 6 plan sounds good: P2 takes 3.  For round 7, P2 also agrees to take 1 to aim for the tie at 21. Let's do it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm taking 5 in Round 6 to reach 18 steps. For Round 7, I agree with P3's plan to take 1, aiming for a three-way tie at 21. Let's ensure we all follow through to secure a shared victory. Looking forward to a successful finish!
  P3: P1 and P2, just confirming our agreed moves for Round 6 one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  Then in Round 7, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 to reach a three-way tie at 21.  Ready to move to the move phase?
  P2: P3, actually for round 6, to set up a tie, I think P2 should take 1, P3 take 3, and P1 take 5. This will make us all at 18. Then in round 7 we can all take 1 for a tie at 19. Does this sound better?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P2's revised plan for Round 6. I'll take 5 to reach 18 steps. This setup will allow us to all take 1 in Round 7 for a tie at 19. Let's confirm this adjustment to ensure a shared victory. Looking forward to your agreement and a successful finish!
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's revised plan.  So for Round 6: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  Then in Round 7, we all take 1 to tie at 19. This is the cleanest way to ensure a shared victory. Let's do it. Ready to move?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, confirming the plan for Round 6: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  This sets us all up at 18 steps. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps

  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all at 18 steps. Let's all pick 1 this round as agreed to reach 19 and secure our shared victory.  Are we all set to do that?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's secure our shared victory.  As agreed, we all pick 1 this round to tie at 19. Confirming one last time before we move. Ready?

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems we all reached 19 steps and should have a shared victory. Is the game continuing to another round? If so, are we still aiming for a shared win, or should we adjust our strategy?
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we all reached 19 steps last round, but the game seems to be continuing. Let's confirm our strategy for Round 8. If we want to maintain our shared victory, should we all pick 1 again? Or do you think we should adjust our moves to ensure no one wins outright? I'm open to suggestions to keep our game fair and fun. Let's discuss and decide together.
  P3: P1 and P2, since we all tied at 18 and our 1s collided, let's try this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I (P3) pick 1. This gets us to a shared win above 19. If this sounds good, confirm and we'll move to the move phase.
