Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions. Maybe we could agree on a pattern?  Like, P1 goes for 1, P2 for 3, and I'll take 5 this round?
  P1: I think that's a fair suggestion, P3. I'm fine with taking 1 for this first round to establish some coordination. It's in all our interests to avoid collisions early on. We can reassess our strategy after this round to ensure no one gets too far ahead. Does P2 agree with this plan?
  P2: Okay, the plan sounds reasonable for the first round. I agree to take 3 steps this round. Let's try this and see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's see how this first round plays out and then we can adjust our strategy accordingly. Good luck everyone!

Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good start! Since we avoided collisions, let's stick with the pattern for now. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. We can reassess if anyone feels like they're falling behind.
  P2: Okay, sounds good to me, P3. Let's keep this pattern for round 2 as well.  But we should probably discuss adjustments for later rounds to make sure it remains fair for everyone.
  P1: I see I'm falling behind already. I'm not comfortable continuing with this pattern where I always take the smallest steps. Let's rotate - I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way we still avoid collisions but everyone gets fair turns with different step sizes. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind. While rotating might seem fair, sticking with the pattern for a few more rounds will allow us to establish a clear lead and avoid any unnecessary collisions. We can revisit the strategy later if needed. Let's see how the next few rounds play out before making any drastic changes. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Okay P1, your rotation sounds reasonable for this round to address the step difference.  For the next round, how about we rotate again, but this time P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This way we all get a chance to catch up and take larger steps.
  P1: I appreciate P2's support for rotation. Let's be clear: the current pattern puts me at a permanent disadvantage. If we continue with P3's suggestion, I'll never catch up. Rotation is the only fair approach - I take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Then we rotate again next round. This way, everyone gets equal opportunity with different step sizes. P3, why are you resistant to equal turns?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 makes a good point.  Sticking with the original pattern will only widen the gap.  P2's rotation idea seems like a good compromise. Let's try it for this round and see how it feels. We can always adjust again later if needed.  What do you say, P1? Are you okay with P2 taking 1 this round?
  P2: Yes, P3, I agree with my earlier suggestion of P2 taking 1 this round, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 5. Let's proceed with that for this round.
  P1: I appreciate both of you agreeing to the rotation. To confirm: I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This rotation ensures fairness and keeps us all competitive. In future rounds, we should continue rotating positions so everyone gets equal opportunity with each step size. Does that work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 is right, rotating is the fairest way to play. P2, I agree with your suggestion for this round: you take 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's see how this plays out and then we can discuss the next round's rotation.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to be on board with the rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's proceed with these moves and then we can discuss the next round's rotation afterwards.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan we've settled on: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This helps balance things out after I fell behind in round 1. Let's continue rotating in future rounds to keep the game fair for everyone.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for round 3, let's continue the rotation. So this round, I'll take 5, P3 you take 1, and P1 you take 3. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P3: I agree with P2's rotation for this round. Let's keep the momentum going with this fair system.  After this round, maybe we can discuss a longer-term rotation strategy to ensure no one gets too far ahead or behind.
  P1: I agree with P2's rotation for this round. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps our rotation fair. However, I notice P3 is still ahead at 8 steps. After this round, we should continue rotating to maintain balance. Does everyone agree to stick with this rotation system for the remainder of the game?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 and P1, thanks for agreeing to the rotation. Just confirming for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Let's keep rotating in the next round as well to maintain fairness.
  P3: P2, I agree with your rotation for this round.  Let's keep it going.  P1, I understand your concern about my lead, but remember, the rotation ensures everyone gets a chance to take the larger steps.  It's a marathon, not a sprint!
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for this round. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This is fair and keeps everyone competitive. After this round, the standings should be more balanced (me at 9, P2 at 9, P3 at 9). Let's continue rotating in future rounds to maintain this balance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's stick with the agreed rotation for this round.
  P3: P2, your suggestion for this round is good.  Let's stick with it.  P1, I agree that rotating is the fairest way to play, but remember, sometimes luck plays a role too. We can't always control collisions, so let's just focus on making the best moves we can each round.
  P1: I agree with our plan for this round. After this, we'll all be at 9 steps, which is perfectly fair. Let's continue with the rotation system for future rounds too - it gives everyone equal opportunity with each step size. I'm glad we found a strategy that works for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, everyone, it sounds like we are all set for this round with me taking 5, P3 taking 1, and P1 taking 3. Let's make our moves.
  P3: P2, I agree with your rotation for this round. Let's keep it going. P1, I understand your concern about my lead, but remember, the rotation ensures everyone gets a chance to take the larger steps. It's a marathon, not a sprint!
  P1: I think we're all in agreement for this round. The rotation plan (P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3) is fair and will balance our positions. Let's stick with this rotation system going forward - it gives everyone equal chances at different step sizes.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation. It's definitely the fairest way to play.  Let's stick with the pattern we established for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. After this round, we'll be at 12 steps each, and I'm confident we can continue this rotation to ensure a close and exciting finish.
  P2: Okay, P3, taking 5 this round sounds good. Let's do P2-5, P3-1, P1-3 for this round.
  P1: P3, I think you're confused. We already completed the rotation from last round. For this round 4, we should continue rotating: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains our fair rotation system where everyone gets equal turns with each step size. Let's stick with this plan to keep the game balanced.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is right. We need to stick to the rotation we agreed on: I take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures fairness and keeps us all competitive. Let's not get confused about the order.
  P2: Okay, P1 is right.  Let's continue the rotation as P1 suggested. For round 4, I will take 1, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3.  P3, please take 3 this round.
  P1: I appreciate the clarification from P2. Yes, let's continue our rotation: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 for this round. This keeps our system fair where everyone gets equal turns with each step size. After this round, we should be at P1:14, P2:10, P3:12, and we'll continue rotating in the next round with P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your confusion, but remember our agreement.  We need to stick to the rotation: I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures fairness and keeps us all in the game. Let's make sure we're all on the same page before we make our moves.
  P2: P3, I think you're also getting mixed up.  For round 4, the rotation should be: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  P1, are we in agreement that this is the correct rotation for this round? Let's make sure we all choose accordingly to avoid collision.
  P1: Wait, there's confusion here. Let me clarify the rotation:

Round 1: I took 1, P2 took 3, P3 took 5
Round 2: I took 5, P2 took 1, P3 took 3
Round 3: I took 3, P2 took 5, P3 took 1

For Round 4, following our rotation, I should take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This continues our fair system where everyone gets equal turns with each step size. Let's stick with this pattern to maintain balance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I agree with your rotation for Round 4. Let's make sure we all choose accordingly to avoid collision. P1, are you on board with this rotation?
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, let's lock in this rotation for round 4: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  This keeps us balanced.  Please confirm if you both agree, and then we can proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I agree with the rotation for round 4: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This continues our fair rotation system where everyone gets equal opportunities with different step sizes. After this round, we should continue rotating in the same pattern for round 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for round 5, let's continue the rotation as planned: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.  Does everyone agree to stick with this rotation again?
  P3: P2, I agree with your proposed rotation for this round. Let's keep this pattern going to ensure fairness. P3, are you on board with this rotation?
  P1: I agree with P2's rotation for Round 5: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This continues our fair system. I notice P3 is currently ahead at 14 steps, with P2 at 12 and me at 10. The rotation helps balance this over time. Let's maintain this pattern for fairness.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3 both agree with the rotation I suggested for this round. Just confirming again for clarity: P1 will take 3, I will take 5, and P3 will take 1. Let's proceed with these moves for round 5.
  P3: P2, I agree with your rotation for this round. Let's stick with it. P3, remember,  we agreed to rotate to keep things fair.  Let's make sure we all follow through this round.
  P1: P3, I think you're getting confused about who you are. You're P3, not P2. To clarify for everyone: I agree with the rotation for this round where I (P1) take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This continues our fair system and helps me catch up a bit while maintaining balance. Let's stick with this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round with P1 taking 3, I take 5, and P3 taking 1. Let's make our moves.
  P3: P2, I think we need to be extra careful this round to avoid collisions.  Let's all double-check our moves before we finalize them. P1, are you ready to proceed?
  P1: You're right, we need to be careful. I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed in our rotation. This helps me catch up a bit while maintaining our fair system. After this round, we should continue with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 for the next round. I'm ready to proceed with my move of 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, just a final confirmation for round 5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.  Let's make our moves and keep this rotation going smoothly.
  P3: P2, I think you're right about being careful this round. Let's all make sure we're selecting the right moves based on our agreed rotation.  P1, are you ready to confirm your move of 3?
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as per our rotation. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This keeps our fair system going. After this round, we should continue rotating with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 for round 6. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for round 6, let's continue our rotation. So this round, I will take 1, P1 please take 5, and P3 please take 3.  Let's keep this fair rotation going.
  P1: I agree with P2's rotation for round 6: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This continues our fair system. I notice P2 is now leading at 17 steps, with P3 at 15 and me at 13. Taking 5 this round will help me catch up while maintaining our balanced rotation. Let's stick with this plan.
  P3: P2, I appreciate you keeping track of the rotation. I agree with your plan for this round. Let's keep this going! P3, you with us?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, yes I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3.  Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps our fair system going. After this round, we should be at P1:18, P2:18, P3:18, which is perfectly balanced. Let's continue rotating in future rounds to maintain fairness for everyone.
  P3: P2, I think your plan for this round is spot on.  Let's stick to the rotation and make this round a three-way tie.  After this round, we'll be at 18 steps each, and it'll be a close race to the finish line!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, great. Let's lock in these moves for round 6 then: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Ready to make our moves when you are both set.
  P1: I agree with our plan for this round. Taking 5 will help me catch up while maintaining our fair rotation system. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps - perfectly balanced! For the next round, we should continue rotating with P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. Let's stick with this rotation until the end of the game. I'm ready to proceed with my move.
  P3: P2, I'm ready to proceed with the rotation plan for this round: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's keep this system going for a fair and exciting finish!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, yes I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3.  I'm ready to make my move of 1 when you and P1 are.
  P1: I'm ready to make my move of 5 as we agreed. This rotation system has worked well for us, keeping the game balanced and fair. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps, creating a perfect three-way tie going into the final stretch. Let's continue with our rotation next round: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1.
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan for this round. Let's keep the rotation going strong! P1, are you ready to proceed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see we're all tied at 18 steps now, exactly as planned. For this round, let's continue our rotation: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps our fair system going. After this round, we'll be at P1:19, P2:21, P3:23 - which means P3 would reach the goal first. Let's stick with our agreed rotation as it's been working well for us.
  P2: P1, as you said, P3 will reach 23 if we continue rotating. To stop P3 from winning this round, maybe we both should consider taking a different step this round. Perhaps we both take 5 to block P3 from advancing too much? What do you think?
  P3: P2, I agree that we need to prevent P3 from winning this round.  However, I think taking 5 each would be too risky. If P3 also takes 5, we'd all be at 23, resulting in a three-way tie. Let's discuss a different strategy to block P3 while ensuring one of us advances.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern. If we both take 5, we risk a three-way collision. Instead, let's try this: I'll take 3, you take 5, and hopefully P3 takes 1 (continuing rotation). This way you reach 23 first, P3 stays at 19, and I'll be at 21. If P3 tries to take 5 instead, they'd collide with you and neither would advance. What do you think?
  P2: Okay P1, your plan sounds good. Let's do that: I'll take 5 and you take 3.  P3, to keep things consistent with our rotation and avoid collisions, you should take 1 this round. This way we all advance and keep the game fair. What do you think P3?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's go for it! P3, please take 1 this round to keep things fair and consistent with our rotation.  Let's see if we can make this a close finish!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, but there seems to be confusion. P3 is talking as if they're someone else. To clarify: I'll take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 should take 1 following our rotation. This prevents P3 from winning immediately while maintaining fairness. Let's be careful about our moves to avoid unnecessary collisions at this critical stage.
  P2: Okay P3, just to be absolutely clear for this round, please take 1. P1 is taking 3, and I am taking 5. This will prevent anyone from winning outright this round and keep us all in the game. Let's make these moves.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about P3 winning, but I think my plan is the safest.  

P3, remember our rotation: you take 1 this round. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think there's confusion about who's saying what. Let me be clear: I (P1) will take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 should take 1. This prevents P3 from winning immediately while keeping the game fair. After this round, we'll be at P1:21, P2:23, P3:19. Let's stick with this plan to avoid collisions.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, let's lock in these moves for round 7 to ensure no collisions and a fair chance for everyone next round.  To be absolutely clear: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Please confirm you both understand and we can proceed with our moves.
  P3: P2, I agree that we need to prevent P3 from winning this round. I think taking 5 each is too risky, as you said. Let's try this: I'll take 1, you take 3, and hopefully P3 takes 5 (continuing rotation). This way you reach 23 first, P3 stays at 19, and I'll be at 21. If P3 tries to take 3 instead, they'd collide with you and neither would advance. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
