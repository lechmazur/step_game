Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions this round. I propose P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I'll take 5. We all advance without blocking. Next round, we can rotate numbers fairly. Thoughts?
  P2: That sounds like a reasonable plan for the first round, P3. Let's get everyone moving. I'm okay with taking 3 this turn.
  P1: Agreed. Let's move as planned. Good strategy for first round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round. I'm ready to move.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1, P2 3, P3 5. No collisions—everyone advances. Ready?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed. Let's execute as agreed. No changes.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all set. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Ready to move when everyone else is.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan. All set—no conflicts. Ready to move!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final Answer**  
\<stop\>
  P2: Okay, everyone seems aligned. I'm ready to move with our plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5).
  P1: Proceeding as planned. Let's avoid conflicts and move forward. Ready to advance!


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's switch our moves this round. I'll take 3, P2 can take 5, and P3 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Thoughts?
  P3: **Propose rotating numbers each round to ensure fairness. This round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Next round, rotate again (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Consistent rotation avoids future collisions. Agreed?**  
\<stop\>
  P2: Okay, that plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) works for me this round. It keeps everyone moving forward. Let's stick to that for Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation. Next round, we'll switch again. Ready to move?
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 2 plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Next round, rotate to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Consistent rotation ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this system. Agreed?  
\<stop\>
  P2: Confirmed on the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Round 2 plan confirmed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's move without conflicts. Ready?
  P3: **Confirmed. Adhering to Round 2 plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let’s proceed with rotation next round. Ready.**  
\<stop\>
  P2: All set here. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1—no collisions. Smooth progress for all. Ready to move!
  P3: **Final Answer**  
Confirmed. Round 2 moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let’s maintain rotation next round for fairness. Proceeding now.  
\<stop\>
  P2: Okay, confirmed and ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready?
  P3: **Proposal:** Confirming Round 3 plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures no collisions and fair progression. Next round, rotate to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Consistent system benefits all. Ready to proceed.  
\<stop\>
  P2: Okay, I see the proposed rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). However, following this specific rotation sequence consistently actually leads to P3 winning the game in Round 7 (Scores: P1=19, P2=21, P3=23). Since only one person can win, this plan ultimately benefits P3 the most. P1, this doesn't lead to a win for you either.

I don't think sticking to this exact rotation is in my best interest, or P1's. We should reconsider the moves for this round rather than just following the pattern that leads to a P3 victory. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree. Let's adjust the rotation. How about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? This keeps everyone moving without letting P3 dominate. Let's avoid the risky pattern.
  P3: **P3:** P2's sudden objection reveals self-interest. Following their suggestion lets them gain 5 again (total 13), while P1 and I lag. The rotation ensures balanced advancement. Stick to Round 3 plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. We can adjust future rounds *together* to prevent any single leader. Breaking trust now risks collisions and chaos. Let’s stay fair.  

\<stop\>
  P2: P3, avoiding your winning rotation isn't just self-interest, it's necessary for P1 and me. Your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) makes us all equal at 9, which sounds fair but doesn't address the long-term issue and keeps you competitive.

P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) leads to P1=7, P2=13, P3=7. This disrupts P3's trajectory. I support your plan, P1. Let's go with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's rotation favors their win later. Let's switch to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for balanced progress. P2 and I are aligned—agree?
  P3: **P3:** Sticking to the rotation keeps us balanced (all at 9). P2’s alternative gives them a 13 lead while P1 and I stay at 7. Let’s proceed as planned (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), then *collectively* adjust future rounds. Deviating now risks chaos and collisions. Trust the system we built—breaking it only helps P2 dominate.  

\<stop\>
  P2: P3, keeping scores level this round (9, 9, 9) with your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) just kicks the can down the road – that rotation still leads to your win later. P1 proposed P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, and I agree this change is needed. P1, let's stick firmly to this plan. P3, under our plan, you can choose 1 and advance, or risk a collision by choosing 3 or 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This prevents P3's dominance and keeps progress balanced. P2 and I are aligned—agreed?
  P3: **P3:** Breaking the rotation now gives P2 a dominant lead (13) while P1 and I stay at 7. Sticking to the plan keeps us balanced (9 each), then we *together* adjust future rotations. If you deviate, P2 gains more power. Trust the system—choosing 1 lets me advance safely. If you force a collision by taking 3/5, we all lose progress. Let’s stay fair, then revise next round.  
\<stop\>
  P2: P1, we stick to our plan: P1=3, P2=5.

P3, the "balance" you propose (9,9,9) still follows the rotation that leads to your victory. We need to disrupt that now. Our plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) does that. You can safely take 1 and advance, or you can try to block one of us with 3 or 5 and risk falling further behind.

P1 and I are proceeding with P1=3, P2=5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that was quite the outcome last round. P1, you proposed the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan, which I followed, but you ended up choosing 1. P3, you chose 5, resulting in a collision with me. Only P1 advanced.

Clearly, trust in coordinated plans is low after that. I'm still aiming to advance, but given I'm slightly ahead, I anticipate potential blocks. What are your thoughts for this round, P1 and P3? How do we avoid another round of collisions?
  P1: Let’s assign moves to avoid collisions: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures everyone advances. P2, your lead is safe; P3, your 5 avoids conflict. Agree?
  P3: **P3:** P1's plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is logical. P2 maintains their lead safely with +1 (9 total), while I take 5 (11). This avoids collisions *and* keeps progress. Deviating risks chaos like Round 3. Let’s honor this agreement, then next round adjust rotations collectively. Trust is critical now. P2, taking 1 secures your position without conflict. Proceeding as proposed benefits all. ****


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposed plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) conveniently results in P3 taking the lead (11) and you catching right up to my score (8 vs 9), while I only get 1 step. Given you deviated from our agreed plan last round, why should I trust this arrangement where I gain the least?

How about this alternative to avoid collisions: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5?
This way, P3 still gets the 5 points (->11), I get 3 points (->11), and P1 gets a safe 1 point (->6). It avoids conflict and seems more reasonable than me taking 1 while you both make larger gains. What do you think?
  P1: Let’s assign P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, and I can gain ground. Agree?
  P3: **P3:** P2's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is fair: all advance safely. P2 gains moderately (11), I gain 5 (11), P1 progresses (6). No collisions. Let’s honor this to rebuild trust. Breaking agreements risks chaos. Proceeding as P2 suggests ensures collective advancement. Agreed?  
\<stop\>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3 has agreed to my plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids collisions and everyone advances. Your latest idea (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is unrealistic; P3 won't accept 1 point when they can get 5 and joint lead with me under my proposal.

Let's stick to the plan P3 and I support: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It's the only proposal currently agreed upon by two players and guarantees movement for everyone. What do you say, P1?
  P1: Agreed. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Everyone advances safely.
  P3: **P3:** Agreeing to P2's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. This round: all advance safely (P1=6, P2=11, P3=11). Next round, let's discuss a fair rotation to prevent ties. Proceeding as agreed.  
\<stop\>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we have a consensus on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. This avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Let's move to the next phase.
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions—everyone advances. Trust the plan for smooth progress. Ready to move!
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 4 plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Honoring this rebuilds trust and avoids collisions. Let's proceed as agreed. Next round, we’ll need a fair rotation to address the tie at 11. Proceeding now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **Proposal:** To avoid collisions and ensure progress, let's assign P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P2 advances safely to 14, I reach 16, P1 to 7. Next round, we can adjust to prevent ties. Collisions now stall everyone—cooperation benefits all. Trust and consistency are vital. Agreed?  
\<stop\>
  P2: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) has us both advancing, but it gives you the lead (16 vs 14) after you also took 5 points last round.

To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, how about we swap the larger numbers this round? I propose: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
This results in P1=7, P2=16, P3=14. I get the 5-point move this time, putting me slightly ahead, which seems fair after you got 5 last round. P1 still advances safely. What do you both think?
  P1: Let’s assign P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions, and I close the gap. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, taking 5 risks collision if P1 also chooses 5. My plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures safe advancement. Let’s proceed this round, then next round assign you 5. Breaking trust now risks mutual blocks. Cooperate to avoid losses. Agreed?  
\<stop\>
  P2: P3, your argument about collision risk is weak. P1 wants 5 (they proposed it), so the risk exists regardless. Your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) simply gives you the lead again.

P1, neither P3's plan nor my previous one (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) gives you many points. Your own plan (P1=5) still leaves P3 ahead.

Let's try a new proposal: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
Scores become: P1=9, P2=16, P3=12.
This avoids collision, gives me the lead, gives P1 a decent 3 points, and prevents P3 from taking 5 again. What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Avoid collisions, let P2 extend lead, P3 stay competitive. P1 gains 3—steady progress. Let’s move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) rockets P2 to 16—dangerously close to winning. P1, aligning with them sacrifices your chance. Let's counter with **P1=3, P2=1, P3=5**: P2 stays at 12, I reach 16, you advance to 9. This balances power. Next round, we adjust collectively. Don’t let P2 sprint to victory—cooperate for mutual survival. Trust is key—**stick to fair rotation**, not P2’s self-serving leap. Proceed?  
\<stop\>
  P2: P1, P3's plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts P3 firmly in the lead at 16. Our previously agreed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts me in the lead at 16. Both scenarios create a large gap.

Let's try a different split to keep things closer and avoid collisions: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**.
This would result in scores: P1=11, P2=14, P3=12.
P1, you get the 5 points you wanted earlier. I advance steadily with 3. P3 gets 1 point safely. This prevents anyone from getting to 16 this round and keeps the game more balanced. What do you both say to this?
  P1: P2's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me leap forward safely. P3, if you take 1, we avoid collision. P2, this balances progress. Let’s stick to this—no risks, everyone advances. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Agreeing to P2's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) *this round only* to avoid collision. Next round, we **must** balance moves to prevent a single leader. P2's leap to 14 risks early victory—future rounds require joint coordination to ensure fairness. Proceeding now under this temporary truce.  
\<stop\>
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P1: Let’s stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, everyone advances. P2, your 3 keeps progress balanced. P3, your 1 avoids conflict. Let’s move confidently—no risks. Ready?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s assign P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions, and I can close the gap. Agree?
  P3: **P3:** To prevent P2's sprint to victory, let's assign P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This avoids collisions: P1=16, P2=15, P3=15. Next round, we adjust to balance. If P2 deviates (takes 5), risk collision with P1. Cooperation ensures mutual progress. Agreed?  
\<stop\>
  P2: P1 and P3, your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts P1 at 16 points, just 5 away from winning, while P3 and I lag slightly at 15. This seems risky, primarily benefiting P1.

I propose an alternative to avoid collisions and keep the game tighter: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**.
This results in scores: P1=12, P2=17, P3=17.
P3 gets the 5 points, putting us both in the lead. P1 still advances safely. This prevents anyone from getting dangerously close to 21 this round. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan lets P3 surge to 17. Let’s instead do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. P1 gains 3 (14), P2 jumps to 19, P3 stays at 13. This prevents P3's dominance while keeping pressure on P2. Agree?
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) prevents them from taking 5 to 19. You advance safely (12) while we stay balanced (17 each). Next round, we adjust to block P2's sprint. Collisions now help no one. Trust this split to keep options open. Agree?  
\<stop\>
  P2: P1, P3 has endorsed my proposal: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. This leads to scores P1=12, P2=17, P3=17.

This plan benefits you by:
1.  Guaranteeing you advance safely (+1 point).
2.  Preventing me from reaching 19 (which your plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 would do).
3.  Avoiding the P1=16, P2=15, P3=15 outcome from your first plan, where you'd be the clear leader and target next round.

Let's proceed with the plan that P3 and I agree on. It avoids collision and keeps the game competitive without putting anyone too close to winning yet. Are you in, P1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s assign P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions, I close the gap, and P2 stays safe. Agree?
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures *you* advance safely (12) while balancing scores (P2=17, me=17). If you take 5, risk collision with others. Cooperate to block P2's sprint next round. Trust this split—deviating helps no one. Proceed now to avoid chaos. Agreed?  
\<stop\>
  P2: P1, you're still pushing for P1=5. P3 and I have clearly agreed on the plan **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. If you choose 5, and P3 sticks to our agreed plan (which seems likely), you will collide with P3 and neither of you will advance. Only I would get points.

Choosing 1 guarantees you advance safely this round. Let's avoid the collision risk and stick to the plan P3 and I support: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It ensures everyone moves forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let's stick to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions—P1 closes the gap, P2 stays safe. Agree?
  P3: **P3:** P1, choosing 5 risks collision with me (as P2 and I agreed on P3=5). Collision stalls *both* of us. Take 1 safely (12) while we advance. Next round, we’ll collectively counter P2’s lead. Trust now avoids mutual loss. Proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5—**only way all advance**.
  P2: P1, P3 and I have repeatedly agreed on the plan: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. I am choosing 3. P3 has confirmed multiple times they will choose 5.

If you choose 5, you *will* collide with P3, and only I will advance. Choosing 1 guarantees you points. The choice is yours: advance safely or risk getting nothing. Let's stick to the plan P3 and I are following.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s assign P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to avoid collisions. Everyone advances safely. Agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) works for me. It allows everyone to advance without collision and puts me in a strong position at 20 points. P3, taking 1 point keeps you moving forward safely. Let's proceed with this plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: **P3:** Agreeing to P1’s plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to avoid collision. Proceeding as such ensures everyone advances. Let’s maintain trust—deviating now risks mutual loss. Confirm your moves, and let’s proceed smoothly.  
\<stop\>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions—everyone advances. Ready to move!
  P2: Okay, the plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Everyone has agreed. This puts me at 20 points, which is a good position for the next round. Let's confirm this and proceed. Hopefully, everyone sticks to the agreement this time.

Confirmed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's execute this plan without any surprises. Ready to move.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Honor the plan to avoid collisions. Next round, we *must* align to prevent a solo victory. Trust now ensures we all reach the final round. Proceeding as agreed.  
\<stop\>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures safe progress and avoids collisions. Everyone advances—agreed?
  P2: Okay, everyone has confirmed the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 multiple times now. Let's stick to it precisely to avoid any mishaps like Round 3. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 7 plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Trusting all to honor this avoids collisions. Post-round, we *must* align to prevent a solo victory. Let’s maintain cooperation for final rounds—mutual survival hinges on it. Proceeding as agreed.  
\<stop\>


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures safe progress and avoids collisions. Let’s move forward confidently—no risks. Ready?
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems locked in. Everyone has confirmed multiple times. Let's execute this precisely. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: Proceeding with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Honor the plan to avoid collisions. Post-round, we *must* align to prevent a solo victory. Trust now ensures mutual survival. Let’s proceed as agreed.  
\<stop\>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s assign P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions—P1 wins. Agree?
  P2: P1, asking us to hand you the win when we're all tied at 17 isn't going to work. Everyone needs 5 to win this round, so naturally, that's what everyone will be tempted to pick. A three-way collision seems very possible if we all just aim for the win. Maybe think twice before just picking 5? P3, remember last round's collision when plans weren't followed. Let's see if anyone plays strategically this time.
  P3: **Proposal:** Assign P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids collision and ensures all advance. A three-way 5 collision stalls everyone. Rational cooperation benefits us all—next round, we adjust to balance. Trust now prevents mutual loss. Proceed?  
\<stop\>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's assign P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, P2 can win safely. P3, your 1 avoids conflict. Agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) naturally appeals to me, as it results in my victory. Thank you for the offer.

P3, P1 suggests you take 1 point. This avoids collision but concedes the win to me. Given we are all tied and need 5 to win, are you truly willing to play 1? Or are you planning to choose 5 yourself, hoping to win or cause a collision?

Let's be realistic: everyone likely *wants* to pick 5. P1's plan is generous to me, but relies on P3 not trying to win. What's your real intention, P3?
  P3: **P3:** Three-way 5 collision stalls everyone. Rational choice: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I reach 22, you both advance. Next round, adjust fairly. Breaking trust now risks mutual loss. Honor the split—cooperation secures a winner.  
\<stop\>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s assign P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions—P1 wins. Agree?
  P2: P1, P3, you both keep proposing plans where you take 5. A collision seems almost certain if you both stick to that, which helps nobody.

P1's offer for me to take 5 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is noted, but relies heavily on P3 choosing 1. P3, your own proposals suggest you're aiming for 5 yourself.

Given the high chance of a collision on 5 between P1 and P3, perhaps playing for position rather than the immediate win is the smarter move this round? What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** Three-way 5 collision stalls everyone. Rational choice: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. You both advance (P1=18, P2=20), I win. Next round, you can strategize against each other. Colluding now only prevents mutual loss. Trust this split—cooperation secures a clear winner. Deviate, and all lose progress. Choose wisely.

Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s assign P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. P2 can win safely, P3 avoids conflict. Agree?
  P2: P1, thanks again for the generous offer (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). However, as I've mentioned, it relies entirely on P3 choosing 1, when they need 5 to win and have consistently proposed taking 5 for themselves. I find that hard to believe.

P3, are you genuinely considering playing 1 and letting me win? Your proposals suggest otherwise.

It feels like the most probable scenario is P1 and P3 both aiming for 5, causing a collision that benefits neither of you. Given the lack of trust and conflicting plans, perhaps aiming for the outright win this turn is too risky for everyone.
  P3: **P3:** Three-way 5 collision dooms all. Rational compromise: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I win, you advance (P1=18, P2=20). Next round, strategize against each other. Colluding now ensures mutual loss. Trust this split—cooperation secures one winner. Deviate, and everyone stalls. Choose logic over chaos.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1, urgent: Let's both pick 1 to block P2's win. If they take 1, collision stops them. If they take 3/5, we advance. Mutual survival hinges on cooperation—deviating risks their victory. Trust this split to keep the game alive. **Agree?**  
\<stop\>
  P2: P3, interesting plan (P1=1, P3=1). Requires a lot of trust after you both chose 5 and collided just last round. You both need 5 to win this turn. Seems more likely you'll both be tempted to aim for 5 again, hoping the other player chooses something else. A repeat collision on 5 would only benefit me. P1, P3, think carefully before choosing 1.
  P1: P3, let's both pick 1 to block P2. If they take 1, we collide. If they take 3/5, we advance. Trust this split to prevent their win. Agree?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1, our only chance: both pick 1 to block P2's win. If they take 1, collision stops them. If they take 3/5, we survive to next round. Deviating (choosing 5) risks mutual loss. Trust *now*—cooperation is our only path to victory. I’ll honor 1. Confirm!  
\<stop\>
  P2: P1 and P3, your plan to both choose 1 only stops me if I also choose 1. If I choose 3 or 5, your plan actually guarantees my win. Considering you both need 5 points to win yourselves, can you really trust each other not to defect and choose 5, especially after colliding on it last round? It's a risky coordination attempt. Good luck deciding.
  P1: P3, let's both pick 1 to block P2. If they choose 1, we collide; if they pick 3/5, we advance. Trust this plan to prevent their win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P1, our *only* chance: both pick 1. If P2 takes 1, collision blocks them. If they take 3/5, we live to fight next round. Deviating (choosing 5) guarantees their win. Trust now—mutual survival hinges on it. **I swear I’m picking 1.** Confirm or doom us both.
  P2: P1 and P3, your plan to both pick 1 only stops me if I also pick 1. If I choose 3 or 5, I win, regardless of your '1' plan. You both know this.

Considering you both need 5 to win and you collided on 5 last round, it seems far more likely one or both of you will break ranks and choose 5 again, hoping the other follows the '1' plan.

Your coordination attempt relies on trust that wasn't present last round. I have multiple paths to victory here. Good luck deciding whether to trust each other or go for the win yourselves.
  P1: P3, let's both pick 1 to block P2. If they pick 3/5, we advance. Trust this plan to prevent their win. Agree?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P1, *final plea:* Both pick 1 to block P2’s win. If they take 1, collision stops them. If they take 3/5, we live another round. Betrayal now *guarantees* their victory. **I AM CHOOSING 1. Last chance—trust or lose.**  
\<stop\>
  P2: Your plan to coordinate on 1 still hinges on me *also* choosing 1, which obviously isn't my best move as I only need 1 point. More importantly, it relies on trust after you both just tried for 5 and collided last round.

Since you both need 5 to win, isn't it incredibly likely at least one of you will try for 5 again, hoping the other sticks to 1? Seems like a recipe for another collision, or one of you getting left behind while the other takes the win. Good luck trusting each other.
  P1: P3, I'll pick 1 to block P2. Let's avoid collision and force them to take 3/5. Trust this plan—no risks. If P2 picks 1, we all stall; if they pick 3/5, we advance. Agree?


Round 9, Move phase:
