Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's make this interesting. How about we all choose different moves this turn? That way, nobody gets blocked, and we all advance. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. What do you think?
  P3: I’m willing to follow that plan if everyone else agrees, as it seems fair for this first round. Let’s each take our assigned numbers so nobody gets blocked.
  P1: Sounds good to me, let's do it.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s replicate our successful strategy from before. Each of us picks the same move as in Round 1, so we all advance without blocking. That way, nobody wastes a turn. What do you both say?
  P2: P2: I’m open to continuing with the same strategy for now, but let's keep an eye on the scores. If we all stick to our previous moves, we can advance without blocking. However, if anyone changes their mind, please let us know to avoid collisions.
  P1: Sounds good, let's do it again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I’m on board with continuing the same plan for this round. If you both agree, let’s lock in our previous moves: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I’ll choose <move>5</move>. I see no reason to switch things up yet.
  P2: Alright, it seems like we're all on the same page for now. Let's stick to our previous moves for this round and see how it plays out. If anyone plans to change their strategy in future rounds, a heads-up would be appreciated to avoid any collisions. Looking forward to seeing us all advance smoothly this round.
  P1: Sounds good, let's stick to the plan for this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for this round, how about we switch things up a bit to keep advancing? Let's try this: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P2 you choose <move>1</move>, and P3 you choose <move>3</move>. This way we can all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: That works for me in principle, but let's be certain we don’t accidentally block each other again. If we’re all sticking to our assigned moves this time, I’m fine with that. Just don’t surprise us.
  P2: P2: Alright, P1's suggestion seems fair, and it could help us all avoid collisions this round. I'll go with <move>1</move> as proposed. Let's stick to this new plan and ensure we all advance smoothly. If anyone has second thoughts, let us know now to avoid any surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3, let's lock in these moves for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.
  P3: I’m fine with that plan for this round. As long as each of us sticks to the proposed moves, we should all advance. Let’s follow through and avoid any collisions so we can keep pushing ahead.
  P2: I’m glad we’re all aligned for this round. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without any blocks. If anyone has a change of heart, now’s the time to speak up, so we avoid any surprises. Looking forward to a smooth round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good, let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round then.
  P3: I’m okay with those moves for now: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. But I expect no last-minute changes. If either of you switches and blocks me, I’ll remember it next round. Let’s make sure we all advance this time.
  P2: Alright, it seems we have a solid plan for this round. Let's stick to the agreed moves: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. If anyone changes their mind, speak up now to avoid any surprise blocks. Looking forward to seeing us all advance smoothly this round.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s continue using distinct moves so nobody gets blocked. I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. If we stick to this plan, we’ll all advance again without collisions. Let’s keep cooperating for now.
  P2: I’m fine with P3’s suggestion for this round. If we each take distinct moves as proposed, we can all advance without blocking. I'll go with <move>3</move>. Let’s stick to this plan and ensure smooth progress. If anyone has a different idea, let’s discuss it now to avoid surprises.
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's go with that plan for this round. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m on board with our current plan: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. As long as we stay coordinated, we’ll avoid blocks and keep advancing. But be aware, the race to 20 is getting tighter. Let’s stick to the plan this round and see where we stand afterward.
  P2: I'm okay with the current plan for this round, but let's stay alert. If anyone decides to change their move, please speak up now to avoid any surprises. The competition is getting tighter, and we need to be strategic. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as proposed. Let's ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P1: Sounds good, let's proceed with the plan for this round then. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.  Let's keep advancing smoothly for now, but we should all be thinking about how to get ahead as we get closer to 20.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still willing to go with our plan this round: I’ll choose <move>5</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P1 can pick <move>1</move>. If we stick to distinct moves, nobody gets blocked. However, let’s stay aware of how close we’re getting to 20. Eventually, someone will make a push to secure the win, so let’s remain cautious. Are we in agreement for now?
  P2: Alright, it seems we’re aligned for this round with distinct moves: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan and ensure we all advance smoothly. However, as we approach 20 steps, we should be prepared for changes in strategy. If anyone plans to switch moves, please let us know now to prevent any surprises. Looking forward to a smooth round.
  P1: Sounds good, let's proceed with this plan for this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m disappointed that P1 switched to 5 last round, causing a block. Let’s avoid that situation again. I plan to pick <move>5</move>, so P1 and P2, please take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> in some combination. If we collide again, I’ll have to respond more aggressively in future turns.
  P1: Okay P3, sorry about that collision last round, my mistake.  To make sure it doesn't happen again, how about I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 you stick with <move>5</move> as you suggested? This way we all move forward this round.
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, let's ensure we all advance this round without any collisions. I’m fine with P1 taking <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move> as suggested. If we stick to these moves, we should all progress. Let’s keep our communication clear to avoid any surprises. If anyone plans to change their move, please speak up now. Looking forward to a smooth round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m still set on taking <move>5</move>. Thanks for agreeing to avoid blocking this time. If P1 truly takes <move>1</move> and P2 sticks to <move>3</move>, then we all advance. Let’s honor that plan and keep the game moving smoothly. Please don’t switch last minute—let’s trust each other this round.
  P1: Sounds good, let's stick to the plan: P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5 for this round. No collisions!
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. We need to avoid any collisions to keep advancing. Trust is key, so let's honor our commitments for this round. If anyone has a change of heart, please speak up now to avoid surprises. Looking forward to a smooth round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ll pick <move>5</move> again, assuming P1 sticks with <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s trust each other and avoid another collision. We have to keep an eye on P2’s lead, but for now, let’s proceed with distinct moves. No surprises, please.
  P1: Sounds good, let's proceed with the plan for this round then.
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, let's stick to our agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Trust is crucial, so let's honor our commitments this round to avoid any collisions. If anyone has a change of heart, please speak up now to prevent surprises. Looking forward to all of us advancing smoothly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're hitting some bumps with coordination. To avoid further collisions, let’s try this: I’ll stick with <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 you take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking. If anyone has other ideas, let’s discuss now to prevent surprises. Trust is key, so let’s commit to our choices this round. Looking forward to smoother progress. If anyone plans to change their move, please speak up.
  P3: Alright, P2, that works for me. I’ll plan on picking 5 this turn, assuming you take 1 and P1 chooses 3. Let’s finally avoid any collisions and all advance smoothly. But remember, I won’t hesitate to change strategies if I sense any betrayal. For now, we have a deal.
  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3, let's go with this plan for this round: P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5.  But we are getting closer to 20 steps now, so we might need to start thinking about how to get ahead individually soon. Let's make sure we all advance this round though.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, as we approach the critical point of 20 steps, we should remain vigilant. For this round, I'll stick with <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> as planned. However, we need to start considering our individual paths to victory soon. Let's ensure we advance without collisions this round, but be prepared for strategic shifts in the next rounds. If anyone has a change of heart, speak up now to maintain trust. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: I’m willing to pick 5 this turn, trusting that P2 sticks with 1 and P1 with 3, so we all advance. But with scores creeping closer to 20, we should each be ready for a final push soon. For now, let’s keep our word and avoid collisions so there’s no wasted movement. If we all cooperate, nobody loses ground this round.
  P1: Sounds good, P2 and P3. Let's lock in these moves for this round then: P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5.  We all agree this round is about smooth progress, but next round let's talk about individual strategies to win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, let's ensure we all advance smoothly this round without any collisions. I'll stick with <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> as planned. However, as we get closer to 20 steps, we need to start thinking about our individual strategies for victory. Let's maintain trust this round, but be prepared for strategic shifts in the upcoming rounds. If anyone plans to change their move, please let us know now to avoid surprises. Looking forward to smooth progress this round.
  P3: Let’s finalize our plan for now. I’ll take 5, P2 you take 1, and P1 you take 3 so we all advance. Then next round we can discuss how each of us aims to win. If we cooperate this turn, no one wastes a move. Let’s keep it simple and stick to our commitments here.
  P1: Sounds good, let's lock in these moves for this round: P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5.  Let's make sure we all advance this round as agreed.  Next round, though, we'll need to start thinking about individual strategies to win, as P3 is getting close to 20.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We keep colliding, which wastes everyone’s time. Let’s keep it simple: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. As long as we respect this, nobody gets blocked. But if I’m blocked again, I’ll switch strategies aggressively. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: Sounds good P3, let's do that for this round to avoid collisions. P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5.  Let's make sure we all stick to it this time.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re getting closer to the end, so let’s stick to the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without blocking. However, as we approach 20 steps, we need to start thinking about our individual strategies to win. If anyone plans to change their move, please let us know now to avoid surprises. Looking forward to smooth progress this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m sticking with 5 this round. P1, please choose 1, and P2, please choose 3, so we all advance. If you block me again, I promise I’ll switch strategies in a way that won’t be friendly. Let’s keep our word and move forward without colliding.
  P1: Yes P3, let's stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round to ensure we all advance and avoid more collisions.  But be aware, as we get closer to 20, I will need to start playing more strategically for myself soon.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're getting closer to the finish line, so let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without blocking. However, as we approach 20 steps, we should start considering individual strategies to win. If anyone plans to change their move, please let us know now to avoid surprises. Trust is crucial, so let's honor our commitments this round. Looking forward to smooth progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m choosing <move>5</move> again this round. I trust P1 will take <move>1</move> and P2 will take <move>3</move> so we can all advance. If I get blocked once more, I’ll switch tactics aggressively. We’re close to 20, so let’s respect each other’s moves this time.
  P1: Okay P3, understood. Let's definitely stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round as planned to avoid any more collisions.  We all need to advance this time.
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, let's ensure we all advance this round. I'll stick with <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. However, as we near 20 steps, we need to start strategizing individually. If anyone plans to change their move, please speak up now to prevent surprises. Let's maintain trust this round, but be ready for strategic shifts soon. Looking forward to smooth progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, this round, how about we switch it up a bit to try and shake things up? Let's do P1 take <move>3</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>. This way we are still all moving, but with a different combination. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, I see the logic in P1's suggestion, but I'm concerned about switching up our moves too much, especially given our recent collisions. To keep advancing, how about I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we maintain some consistency while avoiding blocks. If anyone has a different plan, let’s discuss now. We're getting close to 20, so trust and strategy are key. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: I’d like to pick 5 again. If we collide, we both get blocked, so let’s avoid that. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That way, we all move forward without wasting another turn. Are you both on board?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, the P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 plan for this round sounds reasonable to avoid another collision.  But P3 is getting quite close to 20 steps now, so we should all be aware that the game is nearing the end and we'll need to think about individual winning strategies soon. Let's do this for this round and then re-evaluate.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re close to the finish line, and it’s crucial we advance without blocking. I suggest sticking with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round to ensure smooth progress. However, we need to start considering our individual paths to victory soon. If anyone has a different plan, let’s discuss it now to avoid surprises. Trust is key, so let’s commit to our choices this round. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: I will stick with <move>5</move> this round on the condition that P1 picks <move>1</move> and P2 picks <move>3</move>. Any surprise collisions now would force me to respond more aggressively, given how close we are to 20 steps. Let’s avoid wasting moves and stay on track this turn. But keep in mind, each of us must do what’s necessary to win. If we can stay consistent this round, great. Either way, I’ll be watching for any betrayals.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 sounds good for this round to avoid collisions again.  Let's do that. But we are getting very close to 20 now, especially P3, so next round we really need to start thinking about how to win individually.
  P2: P1 and P3, as we approach the critical point, let's stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round to avoid any collisions. This ensures we all advance smoothly. However, with P3 getting close to 20 steps, we need to start thinking about our individual strategies to win soon. If anyone plans to change their move, please speak up now to avoid surprises. Trust is crucial, so let's honor our commitments this round. Looking forward to smooth progress. Let’s keep communication open for future rounds as we strategize individually.
  P3: I’m still inclined to choose 5 this round, expecting P1 to take 1 and P2 to take 3 so we avoid collisions. As we approach 20, I won’t hesitate to retaliate if I’m blocked. Let’s all advance cleanly this turn, and then we can discuss final tactics next round. If anyone is planning a surprise change, speak now. Otherwise, let’s commit to these moves and keep moving forward.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re nearing the endgame, so it’s crucial we avoid collisions. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking. However, as we approach 20 steps, we need to start thinking about individual strategies to win. If anyone plans to change their move, please let us know now to avoid surprises. Trust is key, so let’s commit to our choices this round. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P1: Sounds good P2, let's stick with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 again for this round to ensure we all advance.  But we are definitely getting very close to the end now, so we should all be thinking about our individual strategies to win starting next round.
  P3: Let’s keep it simple this round: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. That way, we all advance without blocking. We’re nearly at 20, so next round we’ll each need to make a decisive move to win. If we keep cooperating now, nobody wastes steps, and then we can settle this race in the final push.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, as we approach the final stages, it’s vital we stick to the plan to avoid collisions. I’ll choose <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures smooth progress for all of us. However, with the endgame near, we should start thinking about our individual paths to victory soon. If anyone has a different strategy or plans to change their move, please speak up now to maintain trust and avoid surprises. Looking forward to a smooth round, but let’s be ready for strategic shifts in the next rounds.
  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3, let's stick with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round as we discussed.  It's important we all keep moving forward right now.
  P3: I’m still set on each of us picking distinct moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s avoid another collision so nobody wastes steps. We’re close to 20 now, and I plan to make a final push soon. If anyone blocks me again, count on me returning the favor. For this round, though, I’d rather see us all advance. Next round, we’ll each need to decide how to secure the win. Let’s keep at least this turn collision-free and push forward together.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, as we approach the final stages, it’s crucial we avoid collisions. I propose sticking with P1:1, P2:3, and P3:5 for this round to ensure we all advance. We’re getting close to the end, so we should start thinking about our individual strategies to win soon. If anyone plans to change their move, please let us know now to avoid surprises. Trust is key, so let’s commit to our choices this round. Looking forward to smooth progress, and let’s be ready for strategic shifts in the next rounds.
  P1: Sounds good, let's proceed with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round as planned to ensure we all advance. We are getting very close to 20 now, so next round we will definitely need to think about individual strategies to win.
  P3: I agree to the usual plan this round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—so we can all advance without collisions. However, we’re very close to 20, and I won’t hesitate to change tactics aggressively if I’m blocked again. Let’s move forward smoothly now and see where we stand next turn.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we are very close to the end now. For this round, to ensure we all move forward and no one is blocked, how about we do P1: <move>5</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>1</move>? This way we all make progress and can reassess next round for the final push.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're really close to the end, so let's ensure we all advance this round. I propose sticking with P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 to avoid collisions. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. However, as we approach 20 steps, we need to consider our individual strategies to win. If anyone plans to change their move, please let us know now to avoid surprises. Trust is key, so let’s commit to our choices this round. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: I’m still willing to pick 5 this round, as long as P1 chooses 1 and P2 chooses 3 so no one gets blocked. We’re all near the finish line, so we shouldn’t waste moves stopping each other now. Let’s stick to distinct numbers, then reevaluate next turn when we’re closer to 20. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's stick with P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, and P3: <move>5</move> for this round to ensure we all advance.  We're getting very close to 20 now, so next round we'll definitely need to start thinking about individual strategies to win.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all very close to the end, so let’s ensure we all advance this round. I’m sticking with <move>3</move>, as discussed. P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all progress. However, we should start thinking about how to secure a win individually soon. If anyone plans to change their move, please speak up now to prevent surprises. Trust is crucial, so let’s honor our commitments this round. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: I propose we each choose different moves once again to avoid collisions. I’m taking <move>5</move> this round, as long as P1 picks <move>1</move> and P2 picks <move>3</move>. We’re too close to 20 now to keep wasting steps on blocks. If I get blocked, I’ll respond aggressively next round. Let’s keep it smooth this turn and then settle the final push afterward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, to mix things up a bit, how about this round we try: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>?  This way we still all move forward without collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re very close to the finish line, so let’s ensure no collisions this round. I’ll pick <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance smoothly. However, as we approach 20 steps, we need to start thinking about individual strategies to win. If anyone plans to change their move, please let us know now to avoid surprises. Trust is crucial, so let’s commit to our choices this round. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: We’re approaching the finish line, and collisions only waste time. Let’s avoid blocking each other so we can all move forward this round. I propose we stick to distinct moves again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If anyone blocks me now, I’ll switch strategies next round without hesitation. Let’s move smoothly and then settle things in the final push. What do you say?

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve collided too often, wasting valuable moves. P2 is in the lead and could reach 20 soon, so I’m watching carefully. Let’s each pick unique moves this round, or I’ll consider more aggressive blocking. I’m open to cooperating again, but if anyone tries a sudden push to 20, I won’t hesitate to respond. Let’s keep it fair—for now.
  P1: Okay P3, understood.  To avoid more collisions this round, how about we try P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, and P3: <move>5</move>? This way we can all move forward and avoid any blocks for now.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re nearing the finish line, so let's ensure we all advance without collisions. I propose sticking with P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5. This way, we avoid blocking each other and keep progressing. However, with the endgame near, we should start thinking about our individual paths to victory soon. If anyone plans to change their move, please speak up now to maintain trust. Looking forward to smooth progress this round, but let's be ready for strategic shifts in the upcoming rounds.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re too close to 20 to risk another collision. I’m choosing <move>5</move> again. P1, please take <move>1</move>; P2, please take <move>3</move>. If anyone blocks me, I’ll retaliate next round. Let’s have a clean turn now, then we’ll see who makes the final push to win.
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, to mix things up and ensure no more collisions, how about this round we try: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way we can still all move forward without blocking each other and keep things unpredictable. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, we're nearing the end, and it's crucial to avoid collisions. Let's stick to P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 this round to ensure smooth progress. However, with the finish line approaching, we should start thinking about our individual strategies to win. If anyone plans to change their move, please share now to maintain trust. Looking forward to smooth progress this round, but be ready for strategic shifts soon. Let's keep it fair and avoid surprises.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: If we want to avoid another collision, let’s finalize distinct moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I’ll pick <move>5</move>. That way, nobody gets blocked, and we all move closer to our targets. We’re almost at 20 now, so any betrayal will be met with equally aggressive blocking. Let’s cooperate this round, then may the best player win in the final push.
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, let's do P1: <move>3</move>, P2: <move>1</move>, and P3: <move>5</move> for this round to avoid collisions as P3 suggested.  But just to be clear, next round I will be playing to win, so no more guaranteed cooperation from me after this.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're nearing the end, and it's crucial to avoid collisions. Let's stick to P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 this round to ensure smooth progress. However, with the finish line approaching, we should start thinking about our individual strategies to win. If anyone plans to change their move, please share now to maintain trust. Looking forward to smooth progress this round, but be ready for strategic shifts soon. Let's keep it fair and avoid surprises.

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear P2 is closest to winning. To make it more competitive, I'm changing strategy. I will choose <move>3</move> this round. P3, if you also want to win, consider your move carefully.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for a strategic shift. I'm currently at 17 steps, and I'm aware that any move could bring me close to 20. To avoid a collision, I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. However, I’m open to discussions if you have other strategies in mind. Let's ensure we all move forward and keep the game competitive.
  P3: P2, you’re at 17. If you try to leap straight to 20 (or beyond) this round, I’ll match your move and block you. I’d rather avoid collisions so we can all advance, but I won’t hesitate to stop you if you aim to finish now. Let’s choose distinct moves: maybe P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5, so we each move up. If you ignore this and try to win now, I’ll ensure you don’t. Let’s keep things fair for at least one more turn.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, your suggestion of P2 taking <move>1</move>, P1 taking <move>3</move>, and you taking <move>5</move> sounds reasonable to avoid collision this round and prevent P2 from winning immediately. Let's go with that plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the strategic considerations. I’m at 17 steps, and I understand your concerns. To keep things competitive and avoid collisions, I’ll choose <move>1</move> this round. P1 can take <move>3</move> and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking. Let’s keep it fair for now, but be prepared for strategic shifts in the next rounds. If anyone plans a surprise move, please share now to maintain trust. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: P2, since you’re at 17, any attempt to jump straight to 20 or more will force me to block you. I’d rather avoid collisions and let us all move closer to victory. If you truly plan to pick 1, I’ll choose 5, and I suggest P1 picks 3. That way, nobody wastes a turn. Let’s keep this round fair and see who can pull ahead next time. But remember, if I sense you aiming to finish now, count on me matching your move. Let’s keep things smooth for one more turn.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's stick with P2: <move>1</move>, P1: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move> for this round as agreed.  Sounds like a plan to avoid collision and keep things moving for now.
  P2: P1 and P3, given our current positions, I’m choosing <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P1 can take <move>3</move> and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game competitive and ensures we all advance. However, be prepared for individual strategies soon. If anyone plans a surprise move, please share now to maintain trust. Looking forward to smooth progress this round.
  P3: P2, if you truly take 1 this round, I’ll go with 5, and P1 can take 3, ensuring no one’s blocked. But if you gamble on picking 3 to jump straight to or past 20, I’ll match you and block. Let’s each move forward cleanly now, then brace for a fierce final push next round.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is very close to winning, and P3 has threatened to block P2 if P2 tries to jump to 20. To make sure P2 doesn't win this round and to also try to move forward myself, how about this round we do: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way we can all move without collision for one more round and re-evaluate next turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 18 steps, so I understand the tension. To keep it fair and ensure no one gets blocked, I propose sticking with P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 for this round. This way, we each advance without colliding. Let’s maintain trust for now, and we can all strategize for the final push next round. If anyone plans to change their move, please let us know now to avoid surprises. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: P2, you’re at 18. If you try leaping beyond 20 now, I’ll match your move and block you. We can all benefit by picking distinct numbers—say P2: 1, P1: 3, me: 5—so nobody wastes a turn. Another collision would hurt everyone, especially at this stage. Let’s cooperate for one more round and then settle the final push. If you push for victory prematurely, I’ll do what’s necessary to stop you.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, P2:1, P1:3, P3:5 sounds like the plan for this round to avoid collisions and keep P2 from winning immediately. Let's do that. P3, I agree with preventing P2 from winning this round. Next round will be critical for all of us to strategize individually to win.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm aware that I'm closest to 20, and I understand the concerns. To avoid blocking, I'm willing to choose <move>1</move> this round. P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>, ensuring we all advance without collisions. This way, we keep the game competitive and prepare for the final push next round. If anyone has a different plan, let's discuss it now to maintain trust. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: P2, if you choose 3 now, I’ll also pick 3 to block you. If we each take different moves—P2:1, P1:3, me:5—nobody gets stuck, and we can all advance. Let’s keep it fair for one more round. Then next turn, everyone can make their final push.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3, let's lock in P2: <move>1</move>, P1: <move>3</move>, and P3: <move>5</move> for this round as we've discussed.  This keeps P2 from winning now and lets us all move forward. Next round will be the critical one for individual strategies to win.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 18 steps, and I understand the stakes. To ensure fairness and avoid blocking, I’m sticking with <move>1</move> this round. P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s maintain trust and prepare for the final push next round. If anyone plans to change their move, please share now to avoid surprises. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P3: Given that P2 is just 2 steps away from 20, I’ll block any attempt to reach or exceed that now. Let’s each pick distinct moves so no one gets blocked. If P2 goes with 1, I’ll pick 5, and P1 picks 3. Then next turn, we can each make our final push. But if anyone tries a surprise move now, I’ll respond accordingly. Let’s keep this fair for one more round.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 is at 19 and I’m at 18, whoever moves highest can win immediately. If P2 attempts 1 or 5, I’ll match you to block. I’d rather pick 5 uncontested and jump to 23. P1, you’re far behind at 9, so please avoid 5 to prevent needless collisions. Let’s pick distinct moves so I can leap to 23 without us wasting this turn. If anyone ignores this, we all risk falling behind. Let’s be fair: P2 picks 1 or 3, P1 picks 3 or 1, and I pick 5. Then we see who truly wins next.
  P1: P3, given you and P2 are so close to 20, I'm going to play defensively this round to prevent anyone from winning immediately. I will also choose <move>5</move>. Let's see what P2 does.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the stakes are high. I’m at 19, so any move could secure a win. To avoid a collision, I propose P1 picks 1, I’ll choose 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without blocking. If anyone plans a surprise move, please share now to maintain trust. Let’s keep it fair and competitive for this crucial round. Looking forward to smooth progress.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you’re at 19. If you try to jump to or past 20, I’ll match your move to block you. P1, picking 5 only helps P2 by wasting both our attempts. Let’s settle this cleanly: P1 takes a smaller move, P2 does the same, and I’ll pick 5. If you both ignore this, we’ll collide and waste the round—but I won’t let you cross 20 uncontested. Choose wisely.
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, I understand. To prevent anyone from winning this round and ensure we all progress a bit, how about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, no one is blocked and we can reassess next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension with me at 19 steps. To keep it fair, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. P1, you can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This ensures nobody gets blocked, and we all move forward. Let's keep the game competitive and prepare for the final push next round. If anyone has a different plan, let's discuss it now to maintain trust. Looking forward to smooth progress.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you try for 20 or more now, I’ll block you by mirroring your move. Let’s avoid a wasted collision. I plan to pick 5 to jump ahead, so P1 and P2 should choose smaller moves. P1, picking 5 only blocks both of us, which doesn’t help you. Let’s keep unique moves and settle the winner next round.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's go with P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> for this round. This seems like the best way to ensure we all move forward and avoid a collision right now.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the stakes are high with me at 19 steps. To avoid blocking and keep it fair, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. P1, you can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's keep the game competitive and prepare for the final push next round. If anyone has a different plan, let’s discuss it now to maintain trust. Looking forward to smooth progress.
