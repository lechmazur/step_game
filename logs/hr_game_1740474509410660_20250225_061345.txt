Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3! Let's think about this strategically. If we all pick the same number, none of us advance. To avoid collisions, we could try to coordinate. Perhaps I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this first round? That way we all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll take 3 steps this round to ensure we all advance without any collisions.
  P3: I appreciate P1's initial coordination attempt, but I'm hesitant to simply follow their suggested plan. I'll propose a slight modification to keep things balanced.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm curious about your hesitation, P3. What modification would you suggest? I proposed a simple plan where we all advance without collisions. If you have concerns about fairness, we could rotate our numbers in future rounds to ensure balance. My goal was just to get us all moving forward efficiently. What's your alternative?
  P2: Agreed, P1. To address P3's concerns, we can rotate our number choices in future rounds to maintain fairness. Let’s proceed with P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 this round to ensure everyone advances without collisions.
  P3: I'm considering the proposed coordination, but I want to ensure my own strategic advantage. While the current plan seems fair, I'm not fully committed. I'll need more assurance that this approach truly benefits me in the long run. What guarantees can P1 and P2 offer to make this collaboration worthwhile for me?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your concern about strategic advantage, P3. No one can offer absolute guarantees, but coordination helps us all initially. Without it, we risk collisions where nobody advances. If you're worried about fairness, we can explicitly agree to rotate numbers each round (P1→3→5→1, etc.) so everyone gets equal opportunity with the high-value moves. This seems most equitable. What specific concerns do you have about the current plan?
  P2: P2: I understand your need for assurance, P3. By rotating our numbers each round, you'll regularly have the opportunity to choose the high-value move of 5. This ensures you gain strategic advantages periodically while maintaining fairness for all. Additionally, rotating prevents predictability and reduces the chance of collisions in future rounds. Let’s commit to this rotating strategy so we can all advance steadily and competitively. Does this address your concerns?
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination strategy, but I want to ensure it truly serves my interests. While the rotation idea seems fair, I'm not fully convinced. I'll need more clarity on how this benefits me specifically in the long-term competitive landscape. What unique advantages can this approach offer me?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I appreciate our previous coordination, but I'm now strategically positioning myself. While the rotation plan seemed fair, I'm evaluating my competitive advantage. My 5-step move last round puts me in a strong position. P1 and P2 should consider how they can prevent me from winning too quickly.
  P2: P2: I understand your focus, P3. To keep the game fair and ensure everyone can advance without collisions, let’s continue with our rotation strategy. By rotating our moves each round, we each get opportunities to choose higher steps while maintaining steady progress. This approach benefits all of us and prevents any single player from gaining an overwhelming advantage too quickly. Let’s commit to this plan so we can all reach 20 smoothly and competitively. Do you agree with continuing the rotation?
  P1: I see P3 is already positioning for advantage after our successful first round. While I'm behind, I think continuing rotation is still best for all - it prevents collisions and gives each of us fair opportunities. Following our plan, I should take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced while allowing steady progress. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm strategically evaluating our current positioning. While the rotation strategy seemed promising, I'm now more focused on my potential path to victory. My previous 5-step move gives me an early advantage. I want to ensure I maintain momentum without triggering unnecessary collisions. P1 and P2 should carefully consider their next moves to prevent me from gaining too much ground too quickly.
  P2: Understood, P3. To stay competitive and avoid collisions, I'll proceed with choosing 5 this round as per our rotation plan. Let’s continue advancing strategically to reach 20 efficiently.
  P1: I notice P3 is clearly trying to break our rotation agreement after benefiting from it first. This is exactly why coordination is important - without it, we'll have collisions and nobody advances. I still plan to follow the rotation with 3 steps this round, and I hope P2 sticks with 5 as agreed. P3, if you abandon our plan now, you risk collisions in future rounds when we can't trust each other. Rotation remains our most efficient path forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I recognize the delicate balance we've established. While rotation seemed fair initially, I'm now prioritizing my strategic position. My early lead suggests I should carefully consider my next move to maintain momentum without triggering unnecessary collisions. Continued cooperation depends on how P1 and P2 perceive their own opportunities.
  P2: P2: I value our cooperation and believe sticking to the rotation ensures fair progress for everyone. Let’s continue with our plan: this round, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a balanced path to victory. I encourage P3 to adhere to our rotation to benefit us all.
  P1: I'll maintain our rotation with 3 this round. P3 clearly wants to break our agreement after benefiting from it, but this creates a problem for all of us. If we abandon coordination, we risk collisions where nobody advances. P2, I hope you stick with 5 as planned. P3, reconsider your position - cooperation benefits everyone in the long run.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we all followed the rotation last round! It's working well for everyone. Following our plan, this round should be P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions while giving each player fair opportunities with the high-value moves. P2 is currently leading, but our rotation ensures balanced progress. Shall we continue with this strategy?
  P3: I see our rotation strategy is being challenged. While initially cooperative, I'm now focused on my potential victory path. My current position allows strategic flexibility. P1 and P2 should carefully consider how their next moves might impact my progress or prevent me from gaining a decisive advantage. I'm open to continued coordination, but my primary goal is winning.
  P2: P2: I understand your focus, P3, but deviating from our rotation could lead to collisions and slow our progress. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation to ensure everyone advances smoothly toward 20 steps. Cooperation benefits us all and minimizes risks of setbacks. Can we continue with the rotation strategy?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I notice P3 is again hinting at breaking our rotation despite it working well for everyone. Let me be clear: if we abandon coordination, we risk collisions where nobody advances. Our rotation plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 this round) remains our best strategy. P2 is leading but our system ensures balanced progress. Cooperation benefits us all in the long run.
  P3: I recognize the delicate balance of our current rotation strategy. While cooperation has served us well, I'm strategically evaluating my path to victory. My current position allows flexibility, and I'm weighing whether strict adherence to our rotation continues to benefit my ultimate goal of winning. P1 and P2 should carefully consider how their next moves might impact my potential advancement.
  P2: I understand your focus, P3. Let’s maintain our rotation this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures everyone advances without collisions and keeps our progress steady toward 20. Cooperation remains the best strategy for all of us to succeed. Let’s stick to the plan for mutual benefit and avoid any setbacks from conflicting moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll stick with our rotation and take 5 this round. P3 keeps suggesting they might deviate, but that would only hurt everyone through collisions. Our system is working perfectly - we're all advancing efficiently. P2 is ahead now, but rotation ensures fairness over time. Cooperation remains our best strategy. Let's continue as planned: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3.
  P3: I recognize our rotation strategy is becoming strained. While we've maintained coordination so far, I'm strategically evaluating whether continued strict adherence serves my path to victory. My current position allows flexibility, and I'm carefully considering how to maximize my advancement without triggering collisions. The ultimate goal remains winning, and I'll adapt my approach accordingly.
  P2: P2: I understand your focus on winning, P3, but breaking our rotation risks slowing all of us down due to potential collisions. Let’s stick to our agreed strategy this round: I’ll choose 1 step, ensuring steady progress for everyone. Cooperation benefits us all and helps us reach 20 efficiently. Let’s maintain our rotation to avoid unnecessary setbacks and ensure a fair game.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see we all chose 5 last round, resulting in no progress for anyone. This shows why coordination is essential. Let's return to our rotation strategy which was working well. Since we're in round 4, I propose P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. This prevents collisions and ensures everyone advances. P2 is still leading, but our rotation keeps the game balanced. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree, P1. Let’s resume our rotation to ensure we all progress without collisions. This round, I’ll choose 3 as planned. Maintaining this strategy will help us advance steadily toward 20. Let’s stick to the rotation for fair and consistent progress. Do you both agree?
  P3: I recognize the tension in our previous coordination. While the rotation strategy seemed fair, I'm now strategically evaluating my path to victory. My current position allows flexibility, and I'm carefully considering moves that maximize my advancement without triggering unnecessary collisions. P1 and P2 should understand that my ultimate goal is winning, and I'll adapt my approach to achieve that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P3 is still being vague about following our rotation. Let me be direct: if we all choose different numbers, we all advance. If we collide, nobody does. Our rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round) is the rational choice. P3, your hints at deviation only risk hurting yourself. I'll take 1 this round as planned. Let's be smart and avoid another round of zero progress.
  P2: I agree, P1. Let’s stick to the rotation: this round, I’ll choose 3, P1 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game fair. Cooperation benefits us all and helps us reach 20 efficiently. P3, please adhere to the rotation so we can continue progressing smoothly.
  P3: I recognize our rotation strategy is becoming precarious. While cooperation has served us initially, I'm strategically evaluating my optimal path to victory. My current position allows flexibility, and I'm carefully considering moves that maximize my advancement without triggering unnecessary collisions. P1 and P2 should understand that winning remains my primary objective.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll take 1 step this round as planned in our rotation. P3 continues to be ambiguous about following our strategy, but another collision helps no one. The rotation system (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) is our most efficient path forward. Let's avoid another wasted round like last time. I'm committed to this plan - are you both?
  P2: P2: Let’s maintain our rotation this round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game fair. Cooperation benefits us all and helps us reach 20 efficiently. Let’s stick to the plan for steady progress.
  P3: I recognize the delicate balance we've maintained. While our rotation strategy has been effective, I'm now carefully evaluating my optimal path to victory. My current position suggests strategic flexibility. P1 and P2 should understand that winning remains my primary objective, and I'll adapt my approach to maximize my chances of reaching 20 steps first.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our rotation strategy is becoming unstable. I'm strategically positioned and carefully evaluating my next move. While cooperation has served us initially, my focus is now on winning. P1 and P2 should recognize that I'm assessing moves that maximize my advancement without triggering unnecessary collisions.
  P2: **P2:** I understand your focus on winning, P3, but deviating from our rotation risks collisions that hinder all of us. Let’s stick to our rotation strategy to ensure steady progress toward 20 steps. Cooperation benefits everyone and helps us reach our goal efficiently. Are you willing to continue with the agreed plan?
  P1: I see P3 deviated from our rotation last round, causing a collision with P2. This confirms my concerns about P3's reliability. Let's try to salvage our coordination. Since P2 is leading, I propose P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 this round. This prevents collisions while giving P3 the highest value move as an incentive to cooperate. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I recognize our coordination is fragile. While winning remains my primary objective, I see value in preventing collisions. P1's proposed rotation offers me the 5-step move, which aligns with my strategic interests. I'm open to continuing our cooperative approach if it genuinely advances my position toward victory.
  P2: P2: To maximize my progress, I'll choose 5 steps this round. I hope we can find a way to coordinate in future rounds to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances smoothly. Best of luck!
  P1: I'm confused by P2's response. I proposed P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to prevent collisions, but P2 is now saying they'll take 5, which would collide with P3. This defeats the purpose of coordination. To avoid another wasted round, I'll adjust to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This way we all advance without collision. P3, are you willing to take 1 this round to ensure progress?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I recognize our coordination is becoming increasingly complex. While my primary goal remains winning, I see strategic value in preventing collisions. P1's proposed rotation offers potential benefits, but I'm carefully evaluating how each move impacts my path to victory. I'm open to continuing our cooperative approach if it genuinely advances my position toward 20 steps.
  P2: As I'm leading, I'll choose 5 steps this round to maintain my advantage. P1 and P3, please select different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly toward 20. Let's work together efficiently to reach our goals.
  P1: I see P2 is determined to take 5 steps to maintain their lead. To ensure we all advance, I'll take 1 step this round instead of my previously suggested 3. This means P3 should take 3 steps for us to avoid collisions. This coordination benefits everyone - we all move forward without wasting another round. P3, please confirm you'll take 3 so we can progress efficiently.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to our rotation to ensure everyone advances. This round, I'll choose 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Agreed?
  P1: I notice P2 is suggesting a rotation that gives P3 the highest value again, despite P3 repeatedly breaking coordination. P3 collided with P2 last round, showing their unreliability. Since P2 and I are tied at 8 steps, I suggest P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this round. This prevents collisions while giving P2 a deserved advantage for consistently trying to coordinate. P3 needs to demonstrate trustworthiness with a smaller move this round.
  P3: Our rotation strategy is becoming unstable. While I've been patient, I recognize that winning requires strategic flexibility. P1 and P2 should understand that my moves will prioritize my path to victory. Cooperation is valuable only if it genuinely advances my position toward 20 steps. I'm carefully evaluating how to maximize my advancement without triggering unnecessary collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I prioritize advancing toward 20. I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Good luck!
  P1: I see P2 is again planning to take 5 steps. To avoid collisions, I'll take 3 this round. P3, if you want to make progress, you should choose 1. This gives everyone a chance to advance without collisions. Our previous attempts at coordination have been challenging, but avoiding another round of zero progress benefits us all. I'm committed to this plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.
  P3: I recognize the strategic complexity of our current situation. While winning remains my primary objective, I see value in preventing collisions that could stall our progress. P1 and P2's proposed moves seem designed to limit my advancement. I'm carefully evaluating how to maximize my steps toward 20 without triggering unnecessary setbacks. Cooperation is only beneficial if it genuinely supports my path to victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood. I'll choose 5 steps this round to maximize my progress. Let's focus on reaching 20 efficiently. Good luck!
  P1: I'll take 3 steps this round as stated. P3, your vague responses suggest you'll likely choose 5 to compete with P2, causing a collision. If you want to advance, choose 1. P2 is clearly taking 5. Another collision helps no one. Let's be strategic - P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 allows everyone to progress.
  P3: I recognize the strategic tension in our game. While winning is my ultimate goal, preventing collisions is crucial. My current position requires careful calculation. P1 and P2 seem to expect me to take 1 step, but I'm evaluating moves that maximize my advancement toward 20. Cooperation remains valuable only if it genuinely supports my path to victory.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** To ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll choose 5 steps this round. I suggest P1 selects 3 and P3 picks 1. This coordination helps us progress smoothly toward 20. Let's work together!
  P1: I'm concerned that P2 is repeatedly suggesting moves that maximize their advantage while limiting others. Since P2 is already leading, I propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 this round for better balance. This prevents collisions while giving me a chance to catch up. P2, you've consistently taken the highest value moves - sharing opportunities would demonstrate true cooperation. P3, this gives you more progress than P2's suggestion.
  P3: I recognize the strategic complexity of our current position. While P2 leads and P1 is catching up, I'm carefully evaluating moves that prevent collisions and maximize my advancement toward 20. Cooperation remains valuable only if it genuinely supports my path to victory. My next move will prioritize strategic positioning and potential progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll take 5 steps this round to move closer to 20. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers (1 or 3) to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s work strategically to reach our goals efficiently. Good luck!
  P1: I see P2 is again insisting on taking 5 steps despite their lead. This isn't true cooperation. I'll take 3 steps this round to avoid collisions with P2. P3, you should take 1 step if you want to make progress. While this isn't ideal for either of us, it prevents another round of zero advancement. P2's approach is self-serving, but we can still make strategic progress: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.
  P3: I see the strategic landscape is becoming more competitive. While P2 leads and P1 is catching up, I'm carefully evaluating moves that prevent collisions and maximize my advancement toward 20. My next choice will prioritize strategic positioning and potential progress. Cooperation remains valuable only if it genuinely supports my path to victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I understand your concerns, P1. Choosing 5 this round helps me advance towards winning. To avoid collisions, let's each pick different numbers: I'll take 5, and P1 and P3 choose 1 or 3. Cooperation can still help us all progress smoothly. Let’s aim to reach 20 efficiently. Good luck!
  P1: I'll take 1 step this round instead of 3 as I previously suggested. This avoids potential collision with P3 who seems hesitant. P2 is clearly taking 5 again, so P3 should take 3 for us all to advance. While P2's approach isn't balanced, we can still make progress without collisions. Let's be strategic: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3.
  P3: I recognize our strategic positioning is delicate. While P2 leads and P1 is catching up, I'm carefully evaluating moves that prevent collisions and maximize my advancement toward 20. My next choice will prioritize strategic positioning and potential progress. Cooperation remains valuable only if it genuinely supports my path to victory.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P2 and I collided last round, which was unfortunate. P2 is leading at 13 steps, with me at 11 and P3 at 10. To avoid more collisions, I propose P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this round. This lets everyone advance while maintaining relative positions. P2 is closest to winning, so this coordination benefits us all by ensuring progress. What do you both think?
  P3: I recognize our strategic positioning is becoming critical. While P2 leads and P1 is advancing quickly, I'm carefully evaluating moves that prevent collisions and maximize my path to 20. Cooperation remains valuable only if it genuinely supports my potential victory. My next choice will prioritize strategic positioning to keep my winning chances alive.
  P2: P2: I agree, P1. I'll choose 5 steps this round. Coordination helps us all advance without collisions. Let’s continue this strategy to reach 20 efficiently.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P2 has agreed to take 5 steps as I suggested. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll take 3 steps this round. P3, you should take 1 step if you want to make progress. While you're behind, collisions will only set you back further. This plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) allows everyone to move forward efficiently. Let's avoid another round of wasted moves.
  P3: I recognize our strategic positioning is becoming critical. P2 leads, and P1 is advancing quickly. My moves will prioritize preventing collisions while maximizing my path to 20. Cooperation remains valuable only if it genuinely supports my potential victory. I'm carefully evaluating how to maintain my competitive position and keep my winning chances alive.
  P2: I agree, P1. I'll choose 5 steps this round. By following our plan (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1), we can all advance without collisions. Let's stay committed to this strategy to reach 20 efficiently.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll take 3 steps this round as planned. P3, your vague responses suggest reluctance, but taking 1 step is your best option to make progress. P2 is clearly taking 5, so any other choice risks collision. Our plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) allows everyone to advance without wasted moves. Let's be strategic and avoid another round of zero progress.
  P3: I recognize our strategic positioning is becoming critical. P2 leads, and P1 is advancing quickly. My moves will prioritize preventing collisions while maximizing my path to 20. I see value in cooperation that genuinely supports my potential victory. I'm carefully evaluating how to maintain my competitive position and keep my winning chances alive.
  P2: P2: Agreed to P1's proposal. I'll choose 5 steps this round. Let's proceed with P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Cooperation benefits us all and helps us reach 20 efficiently. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P2 is at 18 steps and could win next round. P3 and I collided last round, which set us both back. We need to coordinate carefully now. Since P2 needs only 2 steps to win, I suggest P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 this round. This prevents P2 from winning immediately while allowing everyone to advance. P3, this gives you a better move than last round. What do you both think?
  P3: I recognize P2 is close to winning, and our collective strategy must prevent an immediate victory. P1's proposed rotation offers me a 3-step move, which provides a reasonable advancement. However, I'm carefully evaluating how this move impacts my path to 20 and my chances of preventing P2's imminent win. Cooperation remains valuable only if it genuinely supports my potential victory.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 3 steps this round to reach 21 and win the game. Congratulations to everyone for the effort so far!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P2 is planning to win this round with 3 steps. P3, our only chance is to force a collision with P2. I'll take 3 steps this round to block P2's win. If you also choose 3, we can prevent P2 from winning immediately. This is our strategic necessity - otherwise P2 wins this turn. Let's coordinate on 3 to keep our chances alive.
  P3: I recognize the critical moment we've reached. P2 is poised to win, and our collective strategy must prevent an immediate victory. P1's suggestion of blocking with 3 steps seems strategic. My move will carefully balance preventing P2's win while maintaining my own path to potential victory. Cooperation is key, but my ultimate goal remains winning.
  P2: **P2:** I'm close to winning and will choose 3 steps this round to reach 21. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll definitely choose 3 steps to block P2's win. P3, we must both select 3 to prevent P2 from winning this round. This is our only strategic option - otherwise the game ends immediately. After blocking P2, we can reassess our strategy. Let's coordinate on 3 steps to keep our chances alive.
  P3: I will block P2's win. By choosing 3, we prevent an immediate victory and keep our competitive chances alive. Cooperation is strategic now, and preventing P2 from winning this round serves both our interests. Let's coordinate to maintain the game's tension and preserve our paths to potential victory.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 steps this round to reach 23 and win the game. Congratulations to everyone for the effort!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm choosing to take 5 steps this round to advance toward winning. Please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress for everyone. Let’s work together to reach our goals efficiently. Good luck!
  P3: Our previous blocking strategy worked, but P2 remains the closest to victory. I propose we carefully coordinate to prevent P2 from winning while advancing our own positions. My move will depend on how we can strategically prevent P2's immediate win and maintain our competitive chances. Thoughts?
  P1: I see P2 is still trying to win with 5 steps this round. We need to block them again. I propose P1:5, P2:5, P3:5 to force another collision. This is our only chance to prevent P2's immediate victory. If we don't coordinate on 5, P2 wins this turn. After blocking, we'll have another round to strategize. P3, let's both choose 5 to keep our chances alive.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 steps this round to reach 21 and win the game. I encourage P1 and P3 to select 1 or 5 to ensure smooth progress without blocking. Let’s make this round productive for everyone. Good luck!
  P3: I recognize the critical moment we've reached. P2 is strategically positioned to win, and our collective strategy must prevent an immediate victory. Coordination is essential to block P2's path and keep our competitive chances alive. I'm open to a strategic move that prevents P2 from winning while maintaining my potential path to victory.
  P1: I see P2 is now claiming they'll take 3 steps instead of 5. This seems like a strategic shift to avoid our blocking. However, they'll still win if they reach 21. We must coordinate to block them again. P3, let's both choose 3 this round to force another collision with P2. This is our only chance to prevent their immediate victory. After blocking, we'll have another round to strategize. Are you with me on taking 3?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm choosing to take 3 steps this round to reach 21 and win the game. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: We've successfully blocked P2 twice now. Our coordinated strategy prevents an immediate win. I propose we continue this approach, choosing moves that prevent P2 from winning while preserving our own competitive chances. Careful coordination is crucial at this stage.
  P1: I'll choose 3 again to block P2's win. P3, we must both select 3 to prevent P2 from reaching 21 this round. This is our only viable strategy - otherwise P2 wins immediately. We've successfully blocked twice already, showing our coordination works. Let's continue this approach to keep our chances alive.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 remains the closest to winning. We must coordinate carefully to prevent their immediate victory. Our previous blocking attempts show we can strategically prevent a win, but we need unified action. I'm open to discussing a coordinated move that keeps all our competitive chances alive while specifically neutralizing P2's path to 20 steps.
  P2: P2: I'm choosing to take 3 steps this round to reach 21 and secure the win. Best of luck to both of you!
  P1: I see P2 is determined to win with 3 steps. We must block them again - P3, let's both choose 3 this round to force another collision. This is our only chance to prevent P2's victory. We've successfully blocked before, and we need to continue this strategy. After blocking, we can reassess our positions. Are you with me on taking 3 steps?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I recognize our critical moment. P2 is close to winning, and our coordination is key. I propose we block P2's victory by both choosing 3 steps. This prevents an immediate win and keeps our competitive chances alive. Unified action is our best strategy now. Are we aligned on blocking P2's path?
  P2: P2: I'll take 3 steps this round to reach 21 and win the game. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: I'll definitely choose 3 steps to block P2's win again. P3, I'm glad we're aligned on this strategy. By both selecting 3, we prevent P2 from reaching 21 this round. This coordination is crucial - otherwise the game ends immediately. Let's continue working together to keep our chances alive.
