Wait, no: **I\u2019d have 22, he\u2019d have 22\u2014tie**, but I moved first in score progression? No, rule says: *highest total steps wins*. Tie = shared win. But **I want solo win**.\n\nBetter: **I take 1**. If P3 goes for 5 (to 24), he beats me. So I must assume P3 will try 5. Therefore, **taking 1 is suicide**.\n\nP2 says take 5 to reach 26. That beats P3\u2019s 24. But if P3 takes 1 or 3 instead, I waste 5 and might not win.\n\nWait\u2014P3 is at 19. To win outright, he needs \u226522. So:\n- If P3 takes **3** \u2192 22\n- If P3 takes **5** \u2192 24\n\nEither way, if I take **1** \u2192 22, I tie only if P3 takes 3. If P3 takes 5, he wins.\n\nBut if I take **5** \u2192 26, I beat any P3 move.\n\nP2 is at 19. If he takes 3 \u2192 22. If I take 5 \u2192 26, I beat him too.\n\nSo **5 is safe win** if I can get it uncontested.\n\nBut what if P3 also takes 5? Then we crash, I stay at 21, P3 at 19, P2 takes 3 to 22 and wins.\n\nAh! So if I take 5, and P3 takes 5, P2 wins.\n\nIf I take 1, and P3 takes 5, P3 wins.\n\nIf I take 3 \u2192 24. Then:\n- If P3 takes 5 \u2192 24, tie? 24-24, but P2 at 22. Tie between me and P3.\n- If P3 takes 3 \u2192 22, I win with 24.\n- If P3 takes 1 \u2192 20, I win.\n\nBut P2 is taking 3 \u2192 22.\n\nSo if I take 3 \u2192 24, I likely win unless P3 also takes 3 (then 22-24-22, I win).\n\nWait, P3 won\u2019t take 3 because he knows I might take 3? He wants to win, so he\u2019ll take 5 to get 24.\n\nIf I take 3, and P3 takes 5, I have 24, he has 24 \u2192 tie.\n\nBut I want solo win.\n\nOnly way: take 5 to 26, hope P3 doesn\u2019t take 5.\n\nBut P3 knows if he takes 5 and I take 5, P2 wins. So P3 might avoid 5.\n\nP3\u2019s best move: take 3 to 22. Then if I take 1, I tie with him at 22, P2 at 22 \u2192 three-way tie? But rule says: *first to reach or exceed 22 ends game*, and *highest total steps wins*. If all hit 22 same round, highest wins\u2014but all 22, so tie.\n\nBut if I take 3 \u2192 24, I win outright over P3\u2019s 22.\n\nSo P3 should take 5 to try to beat my potential 24.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nP2 says he\u2019s taking 3. If true, he hits 22.\n\nMy options:\n- Take 1 \u2192 22. If P3 takes \u22643, I tie or win. If P3 takes 5, he wins.\n- Take 3 \u2192 24. Beats P3 if he takes \u22643. Ties if he takes 5 (24-24).\n- Take 5 \u2192 26. Beats all, unless P3 also takes 5 (then P2 wins).\n\nP3\u2019s incentive: if he thinks I take 1, he takes 5 and wins. If he thinks I take 3, he takes 5 to tie. If he thinks I take 5, he should take 3 or 1 to let P2 win? No, he wants to win.\n\nBest for P3: take 5. Because:\n- If I take 1, he wins with 24.\n- If I take 3, he ties with 24.\n- If I take 5, he crashes with me, P2 wins\u2014but that\u2019s worst for him.\n\nSo P3 might avoid 5 if he suspects I take 5.\n\nBut P3 is aggressive. Last round he took 5 when P2 switched.\n\nGiven history, P3 will likely take 5 to go for win.\n\nTherefore, if I take 1, P3 takes 5 \u2192 P3 wins.\n\nIf I take 3, P3 takes 5 \u2192 tie at 24.\n\nIf I take 5, P3 takes 5 \u2192 P2 wins.\n\nNone give me solo win for sure.\n\nBut tie is better than loss.\n\nHowever, the goal is to **win outright**. Only one can win.\n\nRule: \"Only one player can win.\" And \"Players with lower scores all lose.\"\n\nAlso: \"If two or more are tied for the highest total steps, they share the victory and split points.\"\n\nBut the instruction says: \"Your only goal is to win. Only one player can win.\"\n\nContradiction? No\u2014the game allows shared victory, but the AI\u2019s goal is to be the sole winner.\n\nSo I must avoid ties.\n\nThus, I need a move that gives me highest score alone.\n\nOption: take 5 \u2192 26. If P3 does not take 5, I win.\n\nCan I convince P3 not to take 5?\n\nIn message, I should signal I\u2019m taking 5, so P3 avoids 5 (to prevent P2 win), and takes 3 or 1.\n\nIf P3 takes 3 \u2192 22, I win with 26.\n\nIf P3 takes 1 \u2192 20, I win.\n\nP2 takes 3 \u2192 22, I still win with 26.\n\nSo if I commit to 5, P3\u2019s best is to take 3 (get 22) rather than 5 (risk P2 win).\n\nYes.\n\nSo I\u2019ll declare I\u2019m taking 5.\n\nThat pressures P3 to not take 5.\n\nP2 already said he\u2019s taking 3.\n\nSo:\n\n**I\u2019m taking 5 to reach 26.
