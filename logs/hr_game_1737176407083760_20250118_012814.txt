Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next round, and P3 after that. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: P1's idea sounds good to me. I'm in.
  P3: I disagree with taking turns. That would put me at a disadvantage going third. I suggest we each pick different numbers this round - I'll take 5, P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 3. This way we all advance fairly from the start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion risks collisions if others don't follow it exactly. Taking turns ensures no one blocks each other. Let's stick to my plan: P1 moves first this round, P2 next, then P3. This is fair and avoids conflict. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your plan is risky. Let's stick with P1's suggestion for a more guaranteed advance.
  P3: I maintain my position - coordinating different numbers (5,1,3) this round is fairer than waiting turns. Why should I accept being third in line? I'll take 5, and you both can sort out 1 and 3 between yourselves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's avoid collisions again this round. Since we all advanced last round, I suggest we continue the pattern: P2 moves this round, P3 next, and I'll follow after. This ensures fairness and progress for all. What do you think?
  P3: I'm in the lead with 5 steps and intend to keep it that way. I'll be moving again this round - you both can coordinate between yourselves if you want, but I won't be sitting out.
  P2: P3, your lead is small. I'm willing to coordinate with P1 to ensure we both advance and you don't get too far ahead.  P1, are you in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your lead is minimal, and rushing ahead risks collisions. P2, let's stick to the rotation: P2 moves this round, P3 next, then me. This ensures steady progress for all without unnecessary risks. P3, if you move again, you risk colliding with one of us and losing your lead. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit. What do you think?
  P3: I'll be direct - I'm moving again this round regardless of what you two plan. You can try to block me, but that just means none of us advance. Better to let me move and coordinate between yourselves for the remaining numbers.
  P2: P3 is being stubborn.  Let's both pick 1 this round.  That way, we both advance and he doesn't.  Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your aggressive strategy risks collisions and could backfire. P2, let's stick to the rotation: P2 moves this round, P3 next, then me. This ensures steady progress for all. P3, if you move again, you risk colliding with one of us and losing your lead. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit.
  P3: I'll be clear - I'm moving again this round with 5. You two can either let me advance and coordinate between yourselves with 1 and 3, or try to block me and we all lose a turn. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3 is clearly trying to bully his way to the lead. Let's not let him.  P1, are you sticking with the rotation? I'll take 3 this round if you take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your aggressive approach is risky for all of us. P2, let's stick to the rotation: P2 moves this round (3), P3 next (5), then me (1). This ensures steady progress without collisions. P3, if you move again, you risk colliding and losing your lead. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit.
  P3: I maintain my position - I'm moving with 5 this round. You can either coordinate between yourselves with 1 and 3, or try to block me and we all waste a turn. Your choice.
  P2: P3 is determined to go for 5 again. Let's take 1 and 3 to guarantee we both advance. Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, your insistence on moving again risks collisions and stalls progress for all of us. P2, let's stick to the rotation: P2 moves this round (3), P3 next (5), then me (1). This ensures steady progress without collisions. P3, if you move again, you risk colliding and losing your lead. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit.
  P3: I'll be moving with 5 again. You can either work around that fact or try to block me - but blocking just hurts everyone.
  P2: P1, let's stick to the plan. P3 is clearly not going to cooperate, so we need to ensure we both advance. Are you taking 1?  I'll take 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P3, your aggressive strategy risks collisions and stalls progress for all of us. P2, let's stick to the rotation: P2 moves this round (3), P3 next (5), then me (1). This ensures steady progress without collisions. P3, if you move again, you risk colliding and losing your lead. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit.
  P3: I'll say it one final time - I'm moving with 5. You can either coordinate between yourselves with 1 and 3, or try to block me. But blocking just means none of us advance.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 1.  Let's see if P3 actually follows through.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's avoid collisions again. P3, you're in the lead, but rushing ahead risks collisions. I suggest we continue the rotation: P3 moves this round (5), I move next (1), then P2 (3). This ensures steady progress for all. P3, if you move again, you risk colliding and losing your lead. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit. What do you think?
  P3: I'm in a strong lead with 10 steps and will continue with 5 again this round. You can either coordinate between yourselves with 1 and 3, or try to block me - but blocking just means none of us advance. I'm not waiting for my "turn" when I'm this close to winning.
  P2: P3 is clearly not interested in cooperating.  Let's both take 1 this round and we'll both advance. Deal?
