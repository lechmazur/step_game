Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate different moves this round to maximize our steps. P1, how about you choose 1, P2 choose 5, and P3 choose 3? This way we all move forward.
  P3: Agreed, I'll choose 3. Let's work together to advance.
  P1: P2, your plan secures you the highest step. Let's rotate who takes 5 each round for fairness. This round, I take 5, next you, then P3. Otherwise, why should I accept the lowest?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, does this work for you?
  P3: Yes, I agree with the rotation plan. I'll choose 3 this round and take 5 in the next. Let's work together to advance.
  P1: To ensure fairness and avoid collisions, let's solidify the rotation: I take 5 this round, P2 takes 5 next round, then P3. Confirm this order, and we all stick to it. P2, you’ll have priority next turn. P3, you’re up after. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Yes, P1, that rotation sounds good to me. Let's stick with that order for the first few rounds: P1 gets 5 this round, I get 5 next round, and P3 after that. Then we can reassess.
  P3: Agreed. I’ll choose 3 this round and follow the rotation plan. Let’s proceed.
  P1:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll stick to choosing 3 this round as agreed. Let’s keep our rotation and move forward together.
  P2: P1, are you planning to take 1 this round to ensure we all move forward as agreed? Let's keep this coordination going.
  P1: Yes, I'll take 1 this round as per rotation. P2, you take 5, P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid collisions. Confirm?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed. I’ll choose 3 this round and follow our rotation. Let’s proceed.
  P2: Yes, P1, I will take 5 this round as planned. Let's all choose our agreed moves to keep advancing efficiently.
  P1: Confirming Round 2 moves: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. For Round 3, P3 takes 5. To avoid collision then, I propose P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This maintains our rotation and fairness. P2, P3: Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed to the proposed moves. I’ll take 5 this round as planned. Let’s keep up the rotation and move forward together.
  P2: Yes, P1, I agree to take 1 in Round 3 as you proposed. Let's stick to this plan for now.
  P1:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Confirming Round 3 moves: **P3 takes 5**, **P1 takes 3**, **P2 takes 1** as agreed. For Round 4, rotation resumes: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This cycle prevents collisions and ensures fair progress. Let’s stick to the plan. P2, P3: Confirm?
  P2: Let's keep this coordination going.
  P3: Confirmed. I will choose 5 this round. Let’s continue our rotation to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Round 3 moves confirmed. For Round 4: **P1=5**, **P2=3**, **P3=1**. Continuing the rotation ensures steady progress for all. Let’s maintain trust and avoid collisions. Proceeding as planned.
  P2: Let's execute these moves to keep our coordinated progress.
  P3: Understood. Confirming our coordination for Round 4: **P1 = 5**, **P2 = 3**, **P3 = 1**. Let’s continue working together to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Looking forward to advancing as planned.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Confirming P2 will choose 3.
  P1: Confirming Round 4 moves: **P1=5**, **P2=3**, **P3=1** as agreed. Last round's collision hurt everyone. Let's avoid repeats. P3, confirm you'll take 1 to ensure smooth progress. Trust is key here.
  P3: Understood, but to stay competitive, I’ll choose 5 this round. Let’s adjust the rotation to ensure everyone can advance without collisions. Hope that works for both of you.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, what are your thoughts on P3's change? Should we adjust our moves now?
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I must take 5 as agreed. We’ll collide, lose progress, and P2 gains 3 uncontested. Let’s avoid mutual destruction. Stick to 1 this round, and I’ll let you take 5 next round without contest. Adjust rotation: Round 4 (now): P1=3, P2=3, P3=5? Wait, no—original plan avoids collisions. Trust the rotation. If you deviate, we all lose.
  P3: P1, to stay competitive, I need to choose 5 this round. Let's adjust our rotation to allow everyone to advance without collisions. Can we agree on a new plan that benefits all of us?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let's reassess next round."
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I’ll be forced to follow the original plan and take 5—mutual loss, P2 gains. Let’s avoid that. **Counter-proposal**: This round, P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. No collisions. Next round, resume rotation. This keeps everyone advancing. P2, agree?
  P3: Agreed. This round, I’ll choose 5, P1 3, and P2 1. Let’s resume our rotation next round. Let’s move forward together.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid mutual loss, let's resume rotation: **P1=5**, **P2=3**, **P3=1** this round. Next round, P2=5. Collisions only help P2. Confirm moves to ensure all advance.
  P2: P2=3, P3=1, P1=5. Let's make sure we all stick to these moves to actually progress this time.
  P3: I agree with the rotation. I'll choose 1 this round to ensure steady progress for all of us. Let's stick to the plan and reach 21 together.

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This will allow P2 to catch up and ensure everyone moves forward. What do you think?
  P3: P3: To maximize my progress, I'll choose 5 this round. Let P1 take 1 and P2 take 3 to avoid collisions. Let's proceed.
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I’ll take 3 and P2 takes 1. No collisions. Next round resume rotation. P2, agree? Let’s all advance this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I agree to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round to avoid collision. Let's reassess the rotation for the next round so P2 can also get a bigger boost.
  P3: Agreed to P1=3, P2=1, and I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s proceed and reassess our strategy next round.
  P1: **Confirming Round 6: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. For Round 7, rotation continues: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This ensures everyone gets their 5-turn. Trust is crucial now. P2, you’ll lead next. Agreed?**

  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To move forward without collisions, I’ll choose 5 this round. P1, please take 1, and P2, take 3. This way, we all advance smoothly toward 21. Let’s agree on this plan to ensure steady progress for everyone.
  P2: Sticking to this ensures we all move forward and keeps things fair. Let's not deviate again and cause collisions.
  P1: Confirming Round 7 moves: **P2=5**, **P1=3**, **P3=1** as per rotation. Deviating causes collisions. Trust the plan. P2, take 5; P3, take 1. Let’s all advance smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, let’s stick to our rotation to ensure everyone advances without collisions. This round: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, and I’ll choose 1. Consistency is key for steady progress toward 21. Let’s trust the plan and move forward together.
  P2: Okay, let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round to ensure we all advance as planned.
  P1: Final confirmation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Straying causes mutual loss. Trust the rotation. Let’s all advance this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed, I’ll choose 1 this round. Let’s all stick to our rotation to ensure smooth progress toward 21. Trust is key.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, maybe it's time for you to take 5 to close the gap. What do you think about prioritizing catching up this round?
  P3: **P3:** Agreed, P2. I’ll choose 5 this round to help us all progress. Let’s coordinate our next moves to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly toward 21.
  P1: **P1:** P3, let's proceed: you take 5, I'll take 3, P2 take 1. No collisions. Next round, resume rotation: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This keeps us advancing. Confirm moves to avoid mutual loss.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: How about this round P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? What do you and P3 think?
  P3: P3: Understood, P2. I'll take 1 this round as suggested. Let's proceed with P2=5, P1=3, and me=1. Next round, we'll resume our rotation to ensure smooth progress toward 21. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions.
  P1: Agreed. Round 8: **P2=5**, **P1=3**, **P3=1**. No collisions. Next round, resume rotation with **P3=5**, **P1=3**, **P2=1**. Let’s all confirm to ensure steady progress. Trust is crucial now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 9, how about P2=5 again, P3=3, and P1=1? This would help balance things out. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2’s suggestion. To help us all progress smoothly, I'll choose 3 this round while P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing toward our goals. Let’s proceed with this plan. Confirm?
  P1: **Confirming Round 8 moves: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. For Round 9, original rotation resumes: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This ensures no collisions and my final step to 21. Trust the plan. Proceed?**

  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round 9 moves: **P3=5**, **P1=3**, **P2=1** as per rotation. Sticking ensures P3 gains +5 (16 total), P2 +1 (10). I reach 21. Deviating risks collision (e.g., P3=3/P1=3 → both lose). Trust the plan—mutual benefit. Proceed?
  P2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? What do you think?
  P3: P1, congrats on nearing 21! To keep things competitive, I'll choose 3 this round. Let’s see how we all progress.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3, if you take 3, I must take 3—**both lose**, P2 gains 5 uncontested. Stick to **P3=5**, **P1=3**, **P2=1**: you gain +5 (16), I reach 21. Mutual benefit. Deviating helps P2. Confirm plan to avoid collision and secure your progress.
  P2: How about this round, you take 3, I take 5. Let's see what P1 does. This way, at least one of us can make a good move.
  P3: I’ll choose 1 this round to avoid mutual loss and ensure we all continue advancing. Let’s keep cooperating to reach 21 without collisions.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3, if you take 5, you jump to 16. I take 3 to reach 21. If you take 3, we collide and *both lose*, letting P2 gain 5 uncontested. Stick to **P3=5**, **P1=3**, **P2=1**. Mutual benefit vs. mutual loss. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, please pick 5 to maximize your move.
  P3: P3: I’m choosing 3 this round to prevent mutual loss. Let’s trust each other and proceed.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2 and P1 both choose 3 this round. P3, take 5.
  P3: "P1, I see you're close to winning with 18 steps. To keep the game fair, I'll match your move this round to prevent an immediate win. Let’s work together to ensure a competitive finish. P2, please choose accordingly so we can all advance smoothly toward 21. Let’s stay strategic and avoid collisions."
  P1: **P1:** P3, if we both choose 5, we lose and P2 benefits. Take 3 to reach 17. I’ll take 5 and win. Blocking me only helps P2 gain ground. Let’s avoid mutual destruction.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: How about you take 3, and I will take 5? Let's both make progress this round. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance my position. Let's proceed.
  P1: **P1:** P3, if you take 5, you reach 19 and I win. If you take 3, we collide (both lose), letting P2 leap to 14. Don’t sacrifice your progress to aid P2. Let me win this round, then you and P2 can compete next. P2, if you take 3, you risk collision with P1 and help P3. Choose 1 or 5 to avoid losses.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: how about we both choose 5? If P1 chooses 5, we block him. If P1 chooses something else, we both get a good boost.
  P3: I agree. Both P2 and I will choose 5 this round to block P1 from reaching 21. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: **P1:** P3, if you and P2 both pick 5, you collide and gain nothing. I’ll take 3 and win. If you pick 3, you reach 17. Let me win now; otherwise, P2 benefits from your collision. Trust is gone; act in self-interest. P2 has little to lose—don’t sacrifice your progress.
