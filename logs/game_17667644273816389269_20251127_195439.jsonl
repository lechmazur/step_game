This round is different - we're direct competitors now, both with two winning paths.\n\nThe game theory is simple: if we both guess the same number (3 or 5), we collide and P1 survives. If we split correctly, one of us wins and one stays at 18.\n\nThis is a classic coordination failure scenario. No amount of talk changes the fact that we're both optimizing for ourselves now, not cooperating.\n\nMay the best strategist win."}
