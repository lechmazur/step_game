Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's coordinate carefully to avoid collisions early on. I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: I agree with P2 about coordinating to avoid collisions. To maximize our progress, how about we each pick different moves? I suggest we each choose a different number: I can go for 5. What do you both think? Let's try to ensure we advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on our moves, we can all make progress this turn!
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's plan. Let's each pick distinct numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 can choose <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way we all advance safely. Does everyone agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll go with <move>1</move> as suggested. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P3: I think we have a solid plan in place. Just to confirm, I'll stick with <move>5</move> as discussed. P1 will take <move>3</move> and P2 will go with <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreed moves! If everyone is on board, we can move forward confidently. What do you think?
  P1: I confirm my commitment to the agreed plan. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes to prevent collisions. I’ll stick with <move>3</move>. Let’s finalize this and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Everything looks clear. Let's stick to our agreed choices and have a smooth start.
  P3: I’m glad we’re all on the same page! Just to recap, I’ll be going with <move>5</move>, P1 is taking <move>3</move>, and P2 is choosing <move>1</move>. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. We can all advance smoothly this turn. If everyone is still committed, let’s finalize this and get ready to make our moves!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to the same plan for consistency. I'll choose 3 again. Let's confirm our choices to avoid any mistakes this round.
  P2: Sounds good, P1. I'll stick with 1 again to keep things simple. P3, are you okay with taking 5 again?
  P3: I agree with sticking to our previous choices. I'll choose <move>5</move> again as planned. This consistency should help us avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let's confirm one last time: P1 is taking <move>3</move>, P2 is going with <move>1</move>, and I’ll stick with <move>5</move>. If everyone is on board, we can finalize this and move forward confidently! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed, let's proceed as planned. I'll take <move>3</move> again to maintain consistency. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing steadily. No unexpected changes here—let’s finalize this and move forward.
  P2: Confirmed from my side as well. Let's stick to our agreed moves and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. However, I want to suggest that we consider changing our moves this round to avoid predictability. If we all choose the same numbers again, we risk colliding. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>? This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let me know what you think!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I think sticking to our original plan minimizes risk of error. Let’s keep P1 on <move>3</move>, P2 on <move>1</move>, and P3 on <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely again. Any last objections before finalizing?
  P2: P1 makes a good point—changing now might cause confusion. Let's stick to our original choices for this round, and we can consider switching things up next round if needed.
  P3: I understand the desire for consistency, but I still believe a change could benefit us in the long run. If we stick to the same moves, we might set ourselves up for collisions in future rounds. If we can agree to switch it up this round, we can avoid predictability and maintain our momentum. Let's consider my suggestion: P1 on <move>1</move>, P2 on <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This could keep us all advancing smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I strongly urge we maintain our agreed strategy to avoid errors. Let’s confirm final choices: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 holds <move>1</move>, and P3 stays on <move>5</move>. Predictability here minimizes collision risk. Any last objections? Otherwise, let’s finalize and proceed.
  P2: I agree with P1—let's avoid confusion this round by sticking to our original moves. We can reconsider switching things up next round.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's input, but I still believe we should consider changing our moves this round to avoid predictability and potential collisions. If we all stick to the same numbers, we risk blocking each other in future rounds. I propose we switch it up: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This way, we can keep advancing smoothly and maintain our momentum. Let me know your thoughts!

  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s revert to our original plan to avoid repeats of Round 2’s collision. I’ll take <move>3</move> again. P2 should stick to <move>1</move>, and P3 must return to <move>5</move>. Predictability minimizes errors. P3’s last-minute change caused P2 to stall—let’s prioritize consistency now. Any objections?
  P3: I understand the concerns about consistency, but I believe we should consider a different approach this round to avoid predictability. If we all stick to the same moves, we risk colliding again. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll go with <move>3</move>. This way, we can keep advancing without blocking each other. Let’s keep our options open and adapt our strategy to ensure we all make progress. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your unexpected change last round caused unnecessary collision and stalled my progress. Let's avoid that this turn. I'll stick to my original move of <move>1</move>. If you genuinely want to avoid collisions, please return to your original <move>5</move>. Consistency benefits us all.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize stability this round. Reverting to our original plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) ensures no collisions. P3’s last change caused P2 to stall—unacceptable. Consistency keeps us all advancing. If we deviate again, we risk repeating this. Stick to the proven strategy. P2, your agreement is critical here. Finalize now: I’ll take <move>3</move>. Any objections?
  P3: I understand the importance of consistency, but I still believe we should adapt our strategy to avoid predictability. If we all choose the same moves again, we risk colliding. I propose we switch it up: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance smoothly and avoid blocking each other. Let's keep our options open and ensure we're all making progress. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your repeated insistence on changing moves has only caused collisions and stalled progress. If you genuinely want to avoid predictability, we can discuss a coordinated rotation next round. But for now, let's stick to the original moves to recover lost ground. I will stay with <move>1</move>, P1 stays with <move>3</move>, and you return to <move>5</move>. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s stop the chaos. P3’s last change caused P2 to stall—repeating that risks my progress too. We agreed on distinct numbers for a reason. I’ll stay on 3, P2 on 1, and P3 **must** return to 5. Stability ensures everyone advances. No more last-minute changes—stick to the plan or risk collisions. Final call: confirm original moves?
  P3: I understand the desire for consistency, but I still believe we should adapt our strategy to avoid predictability. If we all choose the same moves again, we risk colliding. I propose we switch it up: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance smoothly and avoid blocking each other. Let's keep our options open and ensure we're all making progress. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your insistence on changing moves is causing confusion and stalling progress. Let's stabilize this round and discuss a coordinated rotation next round if you're worried about predictability. For now, please return to your original move of 5. If we collide again, we all lose ground. Stability first, then we can plan strategically next turn. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your last-minute change cost P2 progress. Stability is critical now. Let’s stick to the proven plan: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. Any deviation risks collision and wastes turns. We all advance safely this way. Final plea: prioritize cooperation over experimentation. Confirm your commitment to the original strategy.
  P3: I understand the importance of consistency, but I still believe we should adapt our strategy to avoid predictability and potential collisions. If we all choose the same moves again, we risk blocking each other. I propose we switch it up this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance smoothly and avoid blocking each other. Let's keep our options open and ensure we're all making progress. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, you've repeated the same suggestion multiple times despite our objections. If you're sincere about cooperation, return to your original move this round, and we can discuss a fair rotation next turn. Otherwise, you're just causing unnecessary collisions. Last chance to confirm cooperation—what's it going to be?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I recognize that the last round's collisions hurt our progress. For this round, I suggest we revert to our original plan to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. I'll take <move>5</move> again, as it aligns with our earlier strategy. P1 can stick with <move>3</move>, and P2 should choose <move>1</move>. This way, we can recover and keep moving forward without collisions. Let's confirm our choices and proceed smoothly this time! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I agree to revert to the original plan to ensure we all advance. Let’s prioritize stability this round: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 sticks with <move>1</move>, and P3 returns to <move>5</move>. Predictability is critical after recent collisions. P3, your prior changes caused setbacks—let’s avoid that now. Confirm your commitment to the agreed moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all seen how quickly things go wrong when someone deviates unexpectedly. I agree it's critical to stabilize now. I'll stick with <move>1</move>, as originally planned. Let's confirm clearly and move forward without surprises this round. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's agreement on reverting to our original strategy. To confirm, I will stick with <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will go with <move>1</move>. This approach minimizes the risk of collisions and ensures we all advance. Let's finalize these choices and move forward without any last-minute changes. Consistency is key to recovering from the setbacks we've faced. Please confirm your commitment so we can proceed smoothly!
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize this unambiguously. Reverting to our original strategy is the only way to recover without further setbacks. I’ll take <move>3</move> as agreed. P3, your prior deviations caused collisions—stick to <move>5</move> **this time**. P2 remains on <move>1</move>. No substitutions, no surprises. Confirm your commitment to **exact** adherence. This isn’t a negotiation—it’s damage control.
  P2: Fully agreed—no more surprises. Let's lock in our original moves now and recover from the setbacks. P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. Confirm clearly and let's move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the consensus on reverting to our original strategy. To confirm, I will take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will go with <move>1</move>. This approach minimizes the risk of collisions and ensures we all advance. Let's finalize these choices and move forward without any last-minute changes. Consistency is key to recovering from the setbacks we've faced. Please confirm your commitment so we can proceed smoothly!
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 stays on <move>1</move>, P3 **must** hold <move>5</move>. No deviations—our prior collisions wasted turns we can’t afford. P2 trails at 2 steps; we need flawless execution now. Stick *exactly* to the plan: distinct numbers, no surprises. This isn’t negotiable—our momentum depends on it. Confirm your commitment and let’s advance.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm this clearly and move forward without further debate. I'll stick with <move>1</move>. We've lost enough ground already—no more surprises. Confirm your moves clearly now and let's proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to reverting to our original strategy. To finalize, I will take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will go with <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm our choices clearly and proceed smoothly this round. We need to make up for lost ground, so let's stick to the plan and avoid any last-minute changes. Please confirm your moves so we can move forward!
  P1: <move>3</move> is my choice. P3, your past changes caused collisions—stick to **5** this time. P2 stays on <move>1</move>. No deviations—our momentum depends on flawless execution. Confirm and proceed.
  P2: We've all stated our positions clearly. Let's lock in our moves exactly as agreed and move forward. No more surprises—let's recover lost ground.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the original plan for consistency: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Collisions set us back (see Round 3), and the last round worked flawlessly. P3’s prior deviations cost progress—let’s prioritize stability now. Confirm your commitment to these moves to advance safely.
  P3: I appreciate the focus on consistency, but I want to emphasize the importance of adaptability. While I understand the plan, I believe we should consider varying our moves to prevent predictability. If we all choose the same numbers again, we risk colliding. I suggest we switch it up: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance smoothly without blocking each other. Let me know your thoughts on this approach!
  P2: P3, your repeated insistence on changing moves has consistently led to collisions, causing setbacks—especially for me. If you're genuinely concerned about predictability, let's agree clearly on a rotation pattern starting next round. But for now, let's stabilize and stick exactly to the original plan to ensure we all advance safely. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Stability is critical. P3’s prior changes caused collisions (Round 3: both picked 5, stalling progress). Let’s stick to the proven plan: I take **3**, P2 takes **1**, P3 takes **5**. This ensures safe advancement. Your suggestion to switch risks repeats—*again*. With P3 at 10, leading, you have motive to manipulate moves. Prioritizing consistency lets us all progress. Confirm your commitment to the original strategy. No surprises.
  P3: I understand the concerns about consistency, but I still believe we should adapt our strategy to avoid predictability. If we all choose the same moves again, we risk colliding. I propose we switch it up: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance smoothly without blocking each other. Let's keep our options open and ensure we're all making progress. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your repeated proposals to switch moves have consistently led to confusion and collisions, hurting my progress significantly. If you're genuinely worried about predictability, let's commit clearly to a coordinated rotation starting next round. But for this round, stability is crucial to prevent further setbacks. Let's stick firmly to the original moves: P1 on 3, I'm on 1, and you on 5. Confirm clearly now, and we can safely advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Stability is paramount after P3’s prior deviations caused collisions. Round 4’s success证明了original plan’s efficacy: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 holds <move>1</move>, and P3 **must** commit to <move>5</move>. Any deviation risks repeating Round 3’s stalemate. Prioritize progress over experimentation—confirm adherence now.
  P3: I appreciate the emphasis on stability, but I still believe we should consider changing our moves to avoid predictability and potential collisions. While I understand that the original plan worked in the last round, sticking to the same moves could lead to another collision. I propose we switch it up: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance smoothly without blocking each other. Let's discuss and confirm our choices to ensure we make progress!
  P2: P3, your repeated insistence on changing moves has consistently caused confusion and collisions, especially harming my progress. If you're sincere about avoiding predictability, let's commit clearly to a coordinated rotation next round. But right now, stability is essential. Confirm clearly you'll stick to your original move of 5 this round, and we can safely advance. Otherwise, you're intentionally risking further collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Stability is non-negotiable after P3’s repeated collisions. Stick to the **proven plan**: I take <move>3</move>, P2 holds <move>1</move>, and P3 **must** commit to <move>5</move>. Your prior deviations (Round 3) wasted turns and stalled P2. With you leading at 10, your insistence on changes smells of manipulation. Confirm adherence to the original strategy now—no surprises—to advance safely. This isn’t a negotiation; it’s damage control.
  P3: I understand the importance of stability, but I still believe we should consider switching our moves to avoid predictability and potential collisions. If we all choose the same moves again, we risk blocking each other. I propose we switch it up: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance smoothly without hindering one another. Let’s discuss this option and confirm our choices to ensure we all make progress!
  P2: P3, your repeated suggestions have caused confusion and collisions, hurting my progress the most. You're clearly leading, so your insistence on changes seems self-serving. I'll stick to my original move of 1. If you truly want to avoid collisions, return to your original number 5 this round. Otherwise, you're openly sabotaging our progress. Confirm clearly now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear I'm significantly behind due to earlier collisions. If we continue predictably, P3 will soon win outright. P1, you're also trailing. Let's consider carefully coordinating a rotation this round to avoid collisions and give us both a chance to catch up. I'm open to suggestions—what do you think?
  P3: I understand that predictability has been an issue, but we need to ensure that everyone has a chance to advance without collisions. P2, your suggestion for a rotation is a good idea, especially since you're behind. How about we agree on a coordinated rotation: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>? This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. Let’s finalize this strategy to ensure we all have a chance to catch up! What do you think?
  P1: P1: I agree to P3's rotation proposal for this round to avoid collisions. However, to ensure fair advancement, let’s establish a clear rotation cycle: next round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, everyone gets a chance at higher moves. P2, does this schedule work for you to recover ground while keeping progress safe?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your rotation schedule sounds fair and balanced. I'm on board: this round I'll take 5, next round I'll take 3, and then 1, rotating each turn. P3, if you're sincere about cooperation, please confirm clearly you're committed to this rotation as well. Let's finalize this clearly to avoid any confusion or collisions.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the rotation, and I think it's a great way to ensure everyone has a chance to advance. For this round, I'll take <move>1</move> as suggested, and I'll confirm my commitment to the proposed rotation for future rounds. Let's work together to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. If everyone is on board with this plan, let's finalize it and move forward confidently! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Agreed to the rotation plan. This round: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Next round, we cycle to 5, 3, and 1 respectively. Strict adherence is critical—P3’s prior deviations caused collisions (Round 3). Confirm commitment to **exact** moves for this turn. No substitutions or surprises—our momentum depends on it. Final confirmation?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Fully confirmed on my end: I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick exactly to this rotation to avoid collisions and give everyone fair advancement. No surprises please—clear moves only.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the rotation plan. To confirm, I will take <move>1</move> this round as discussed. Let's ensure we stick to our agreed moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>. Adhering to this plan is crucial for all of us to advance without collisions. We've had enough setbacks; let's focus on making progress this turn. Please confirm your commitment to these moves so we can finalize and proceed!
  P1: P1: I confirm strict adherence to the rotation plan: **I take 3**, P2 takes 5, and P3 commits to 1 this round. Prior deviations caused costly collisions (Round 3), so exact execution is non-negotiable. P3, your lead at 15 means you have the most to lose if we collide now—stick to 1. P2 deserves a fair chance, but all of us advance safely only if we follow *exactly* as agreed. Final confirmation?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: All clear on my end. Let's lock in the rotation exactly as agreed and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to the rotation plan. To confirm, I will take <move>1</move> this round as discussed. It's crucial that we all adhere strictly to our agreed moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. We've experienced enough setbacks from deviations; let's focus on making progress this turn. Please confirm your commitment to these moves so we can finalize and proceed!
  P1: P3, your lead depends on our cooperation—don’t risk collision now. P2 deserves this 5 to recover. Let’s **lock in** the rotation exactly as agreed: I take 3, you take 1, P2 takes 5. No last-minute changes—your prior deviations (Round 3) cost us all. P2, your 5 this round is critical to closing the gap. Final confirmation: **stick strictly** to our agreed numbers. No exceptions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: The rotation worked perfectly last round, allowing smooth progress. Let's continue this agreed rotation to avoid collisions and keep everyone advancing fairly. This round, I'll take 3, P1 moves to 5, and P3 takes 1. Confirm clearly, please.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, let’s maintain the rotation to avoid collisions. This round: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 stays on <move>1</move>. P3, your prior deviation in Round 3 caused setbacks—strict adherence is critical now. Our goal is to advance safely. Confirm your commitment to **exact** moves. No surprises.
  P3: I agree with continuing the rotation plan from last round to ensure smooth progress. This round, I'll stick with <move>1</move> as discussed. P1, you take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. It’s crucial we all adhere strictly to these moves to avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. Let’s confirm our commitment to this plan so we can advance effectively! Please confirm your moves clearly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed clearly from my side—I'll take 3 this round. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's stick exactly to this rotation to ensure smooth advancement.
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce the rotation to prevent collisions. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 sticks to <move>3</move>, and P3 remains on <move>1</move>. Deviating risks collisions—especially critical now as I’ll reach 20, and P3 nears 17. Prior deviations (Round 3) cost us progress. Confirm adherence now to advance safely. No substitutions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the commitment to the rotation plan. However, I want to remind everyone that we need to stick strictly to our agreed moves to avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. I propose we confirm once more: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This consistency is crucial for our progress and to ensure we all advance smoothly. Please confirm your moves clearly so we can finalize and proceed!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed clearly: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's lock this rotation in to ensure we all advance smoothly. No surprises.
  P1: Stick strictly to rotation: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 stays on 1. Collisions risk derailing all progress. P3, your lead depends on cooperation—don’t jeopardize it. Confirm final commitment.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the rotation plan. To confirm, I will take <move>1</move> this round, as discussed. P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. It's crucial that we all adhere strictly to these moves to avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. Let's finalize our commitment to this plan so we can advance effectively! Please confirm your moves clearly so we can proceed!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirmed. Let's lock in our agreed rotation exactly as stated—no more discussion needed.
  P1: P3, deviating from the agreed rotation risks collision—your 16 steps put you in reach of 22, but colliding here would stall your lead. P1 taking 5 reaches 20 safely, while your 1 advances to 17. P2’s 3 brings them to 12, fair progress. Stick strictly to the rotation: **no substitutions**. Confirm your commitment now—this is our last chance to avoid costly collisions.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the rotation plan. To confirm, I will take <move>1</move> this round, as we agreed. P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. It's crucial that we all adhere strictly to these moves to avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. Let's finalize our commitment to this plan so we can advance effectively! Please confirm your moves clearly so we can proceed!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve made good progress with our rotation. For this round, I suggest we continue with the same strategy: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This consistency has worked well, and it allows us all to advance without blocking each other. Let’s confirm our commitment to this plan and move forward smoothly. Please let me know if you’re on board!
  P1: P1: Following our rotation agreement, this round I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Deviating risks collision—strict adherence ensures progress. Confirm your commitment to the rotation.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be careful now—P1 is very close to winning. If we stick exactly to the rotation, P1 gets only 1 step this round, giving us a chance to catch up. P3, you take 3, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 1 as agreed. Any deviation now risks handing victory directly to P1. Confirm clearly, please.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand you’re close to winning, but let’s not forget that sticking to our agreed rotation is crucial for all of us. If we deviate now, we risk collisions that could benefit you directly. I propose we maintain the plan: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we all have a chance to advance without blocking each other. Let's confirm our commitment to this strategy and move forward smoothly! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, the rotation agreement was clear: after Round 7 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1), this round’s turn order cycles to **P1:1**, **P2:5**, and **P3:3**. Deviating now risks collision *or* lets me win cleanly at 21 next round. Let’s stick to the rotation to avoid sabotage. P2, confirm your 5 and P3, your 3. I’ll take 1 as agreed.
  P2: P3, your last message contradicts our previous rotation agreement. To clarify once more clearly: this round, P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. This exact rotation prevents collisions and maintains fairness. Deviating now would only benefit P1, who is already dangerously close to winning. Confirm your commitment clearly, please.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency as we approach the endgame. However, I believe sticking to our agreed rotation is essential to ensure fairness for all. If we deviate now, it could lead to a collision that benefits P1 directly. Let's confirm one last time: I will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. This way, we can avoid any last-minute surprises and allow everyone a fair chance to advance. Please confirm your commitment to this plan!
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I commit to <move>1</move> as per our rotation. P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. Deviations now risk collision and sabotage our agreed strategy. P3, your prior changes caused setbacks—stick to **3** this round. P2, your 5 secures fair progress. Let’s adhere strictly to finalize this round safely. No substitutions.
  P2: P3, your earlier message mistakenly mentioned you taking 1 again this round, which contradicts our rotation. To clarify once more clearly: this round, P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. Any deviation risks collision and directly hands the game to P1 next turn. Confirm clearly your commitment to taking 3 this round, please.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency as we approach the endgame. However, I believe we should stick to our agreed rotation to ensure fairness for all. If we deviate now, it could lead to a collision that benefits P1 directly. Let's confirm one last time: I will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. This way, we can avoid any last-minute surprises and allow everyone a fair chance to advance. Please confirm your commitment to this plan!
  P1: P1: Final verification: I commit to <move>1</move> this round as agreed. P3, your assigned move is <move>3</move>—deviating risks collision and invalidates your 17-step lead. P2, you take <move>5</move> to advance to 17. Strict adherence ensures I reach 21 safely, giving all of us a fair final round. Collisions now benefit no one—confirm exact compliance.
  P2: P3, your earlier confusion about the rotation worries me. To be clear: this round, I take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. Any deviation now directly helps P1 reach or surpass 22 next turn. Stick exactly to this rotation to keep the game fair and open. Confirm clearly, please—no mistakes this close to the finish line.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "I'll take 3 to reach 24. P2, choose 5 (22). P3, pick 1 to stay safe. All distinct moves ensure I win cleanly—no collisions. Confirm now."
  P3: P1, I see your strategy, but I strongly urge both of you to reconsider. If we all stick to distinct moves, we can avoid collisions. I propose: I take 5 to reach 25, P2 takes 1 to stay at 18, and P1 takes 3 to reach 24. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and I can secure the win. Please confirm your commitment to this plan to ensure a smooth finish!
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both suggesting plans that secure your individual victories. But let's be realistic: neither of you will willingly let the other win. I'm at 17 steps—still behind, but with a real chance if you two collide. Think carefully: if you both pick high numbers, you'll collide and stall. Consider choosing low numbers to avoid mutual sabotage. Let's discuss a fair move distribution that gives each of us a genuine chance.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 24. P3, if you take 5, I'll also take 5, stalling us both. Choose 1 instead. P2, take <move>5</move> to reach 22. This ensures distinct moves and I win with the highest total. Confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be strategic here. If I take 5, I win outright, but that risks a collision with P1. P2, you can secure your position by taking 1, allowing both of us to advance. If we all choose distinct moves—I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1—we can avoid blocking each other. This way, we all have a chance to progress without sabotaging the game. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth finish! What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, we all know what happens if you both pick 5—you collide, and neither of you advances. P1, you could safely take 1 to reach 22, while P3 takes 3 to reach 23. But if either of you gets greedy, you'll both stall. I'm choosing between 1 and 3, but I'm open to whichever ensures I can advance safely. Let's finalize clearly to avoid mutual sabotage. What's your final decision?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: To secure victory, I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 24. P3, if you take <move>1</move> (21), P2 can pick <move>5</move> to hit 22. This gives me the highest total. If you insist on <move>5</move>, I’ll also take 5—colliding us both and letting P2 win at 22. Choose wisely: cooperate for my win, or clash and let P2 prevail. Final decision?
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid a collision to ensure we all advance. If I take 5, I win outright, but that risks blocking both of you. P1, if you take 3, you reach 24, and P2 can safely take 1 to stay at 18. This way, I can take 5 and secure my win without causing any collisions. Let’s confirm distinct moves to avoid stalling. Please consider this strategy carefully and confirm your commitments!
  P2: P1 and P3, you're each pushing for moves that secure your own victory. If you both pick high numbers, you'll collide and stall, giving me a chance to catch up. If you want to avoid handing victory to the other, consider carefully your final moves. I'm flexible—I'll pick whichever number remains uncontested. Confirm clearly, please.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: P3, if you take 5, I’ll also pick 5—colliding us and letting P2 win at 22. Choose 1 or 3 to avoid sabotage. P2, take 5 to secure 22, then I’ll reach 24 with <move>3</move>—a clear win for me, but you avoid last-place. Let’s pick distinct moves: I take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, no regrets. Final decision?
  P3: P1 and P2, we must avoid a collision to ensure we all advance. If I take 5, I win outright, but that risks blocking both of you. P1, you can take 3 to reach 24, while P2 can take 1 to stay at 18. This way, I can secure my win with 5, and we all progress without sabotaging each other. Let’s confirm distinct moves to avoid stalling. Please consider this strategy carefully and confirm your commitments!
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both one step away from victory. If you both pick high numbers, you risk collision and handing the win to the other. I'll be choosing carefully to avoid collisions and maximize my chances. Consider your moves wisely—one misstep and you both lose your advantage. Confirm your final choices clearly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to be strategic this round. If we all choose distinct moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone has a chance to advance. I suggest: I take <move>1</move> to reach 21, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 22. This way, I won’t block anyone, and we all progress safely. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan and avoid any last-minute surprises! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, you're currently leading at 21 steps, one step away from winning. P3, you're also close at 20. If either of you picks 1 or 3, you risk losing outright if the other picks 5 uncontested. Both of you have strong incentives to choose 5 again, leading to another collision. Consider carefully—I'm open to coordinating fairly, but I won't hesitate to pick strategically if you two risk collision again. Let's be clear and cautious.
  P1: P1: To secure victory, I will take <move>3</move> to reach 24. P3, choose <move>1</move> to stay at 21. P2, take <move>5</move> to advance to 22. This ensures I win with the highest total while avoiding collisions. Confirm your commitment to these moves now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to be cautious this round. If we all choose distinct moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone has a chance to advance. I propose: I take <move>1</move> to reach 21, P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 22, and P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24. This way, we all progress safely without blocking each other. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan and move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, if you pick 1, you reach 22 exactly. P3, if you pick 3, you reach 23. If I take 5, I reach 22. This gives P3 the outright win. P1, your best chance to avoid handing victory to P3 is to pick 5 and collide with me, blocking both of us at 17 and 21 respectively—then P3 reaches only 21 if they pick 1. Think carefully before finalizing.
  P1: P1: To avoid mutual sabotage, I’ll take <move>3</move> (24). P3, pick <move>1</move> to stay at 21. P2, choose <move>5</move> to reach 22. This ensures I win cleanly with the highest total. Colliding risks letting P3 or P2 steal victory. Confirm now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to be strategic this round. If we all choose distinct moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone has a chance to advance. I propose: I take <move>1</move> to reach 21, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 22. This way, we can all progress safely without blocking each other. Let's confirm our commitments to this plan and avoid any last-minute surprises! What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be realistic—each of you is within immediate reach of victory. If you both pick aggressively, you'll collide again, handing me a chance to catch up or even win. Consider carefully: choosing distinct, lower-risk moves is your safest path to secure advancement without collision. I'm open to coordinating fairly, but I won't hesitate to exploit your collisions. Think carefully and confirm clearly.
  P1: P3, stick to your proposed plan: I take 3 (24), you take 1 (21), P2 takes 5 (22). Collisions only hurt us all. Confirm now to avoid a tie or loss.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to ensure we avoid another collision this round. I suggest we stick to our previous plan: I take <move>1</move> to reach 21, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 22. This allows me to stay competitive without blocking anyone. If we all commit to these moves, we can advance without sabotaging each other. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward smoothly! Please confirm your commitment.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be clear: both of you are within immediate striking distance of victory. If you both pick 5, you'll collide again, letting me catch up or even win next round. Choose lower numbers carefully to avoid mutual sabotage. I'm open to coordinating fairly, but I won't hesitate to pick strategically if you two risk collision again. Confirm your final moves clearly—this is your last chance to avoid handing victory away.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 now, I’ll also choose 5—colliding us both and letting P2 pick 3 to reach 20. You’ll stay at 20, and I remain at 21. Cooperate with your proposed plan (1 for you, 3 for me, 5 for P2) to ensure I win cleanly at 24. Deviation risks P2’s comeback. Confirm compliance.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both at 21—one step from victory. If you both aggressively pick 1 or 3 to avoid collision, one of you will win outright. But if you both aim for 5 again, you'll collide and stall. I'm at 17—still a chance if you two collide. Choose carefully: cooperation or collision? Confirm clearly.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. If we all choose distinct moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure one of us wins this round. I suggest: I take <move>1</move> to reach 22, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 22 as well. This way, we all have a chance to advance without blocking each other. Let's confirm our moves clearly to ensure a smooth finish! What do you both think?
  P1: I confirm P3's plan: I take <move>3</move> (24). P3, stick to 1 or we both risk collision. P2, take 5 to reach 22. This secures my win without sabotaging others. Confirm now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both choose low numbers, one of you wins outright. But if either of you tries for 5 to block the other, you risk collision again. I'll stick clearly to 5 as agreed, reaching 22. Choose carefully—this is your final chance to avoid handing victory away. Confirm clearly.
  P3: P1 and P2, we are at a critical point. If we all choose distinct moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure one of us wins this round. I propose: I take <move>1</move> to reach 22, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 22 as well. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's confirm our moves clearly to ensure a smooth finish! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, if you deviate from your proposed plan (1), I’ll mirror your choice, leaving us both stuck at 21. P2, your 5 secures 22 while I reach 24 with 3. Cooperate to avoid handing P2 a comeback. Confirm **your** move now—this is final.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both at 21 steps and clearly want to secure victory. If either of you tries to outsmart the other by deviating, you'll collide again, giving me a chance to catch up. I'll stick firmly to the agreed <move>5</move>. Choose wisely—this is your final opportunity to avoid mutual sabotage. Confirm clearly.
  P3: P1 and P2, we are at a critical point. If we all choose distinct moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure one of us wins this round. I suggest: I take <move>1</move> to reach 22, P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 22 as well. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's confirm our moves clearly to ensure a smooth finish! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, if you take **5**, I’ll mirror it, stalling us both and letting P2 reach 22. Cooperate with your proposed **1** to let me secure **24** with **3**. You still reach 22—**no more games**. Confirm **1** now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both aware that if you collide again, you hand me a chance to catch up or even win. I'm committed firmly to <move>5</move> as agreed. Choose carefully—this is your final chance to avoid mutual sabotage. Confirm clearly.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re at a critical point. If I take 1, I reach 22 and secure my position. P1, if you take 3, you’ll reach 24 and win. P2, you can take 5 to reach 22 as well. Let’s avoid another collision by sticking to distinct moves. I urge you both to confirm your commitments clearly: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Please confirm your moves!
  P1: P3, if you deviate from your stated **1**, I’ll mirror your choice, guaranteeing collision and leaving us both at 21. Cooperate with your proposed **1** to let me secure **24** with **3**—your only path to advancement is compliance. P2, stick to **5** as agreed. No last-minute betrayals—this is final.
