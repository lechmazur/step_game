Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! To avoid choosing the same moves and ensure we all advance, how about we coordinate our steps this turn? For example, P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I’ll take 5 steps. Let me know if you agree or have the best strategy in mind!
  P1: I think coordination is a good idea, but we need to be cautious. If we always follow a predictable pattern, someone might exploit it later. For now, I’m fine with P3’s suggestion: P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. But let’s not make this a permanent agreement. We should reassess every turn based on the results. Does everyone agree?
  P2: I agree with the idea of coordination for this round, but I suggest we stick to the original plan: I'll take 3 steps, P1 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 5 steps. This way, we can all advance without colliding. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on how it goes. Let’s keep communication open and adapt as needed! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed for this round. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 1 step, P2 taking 3 steps, and me taking 5 steps. After we see the results, we can adjust our strategies accordingly. Looking forward to a fair game!
  P1: I’m glad we’ve agreed to coordinate for now, but remember, this is just the first step. Let’s stay flexible and avoid falling into predictable patterns. For this round, I’ll stick to the plan: P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. After seeing the results, we can reassess and adjust. Let’s keep communication open and ensure no one gets too far ahead or left behind. Fair play for now, but trust is earned, not given.
  P2: I appreciate the agreement we've come to for this round. However, I want to emphasize that while coordination is beneficial now, we should be cautious about sticking to the same pattern in future rounds. If we become too predictable, one of us might take advantage of that. After this round, let's stay flexible and consider different strategies to keep the game interesting. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Thanks for the feedback, P2. I agree it's important to stay flexible in future rounds. For now, let's proceed with our agreed steps: P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I'll take 5 steps this round. After seeing the results, we can adjust our strategies to keep the game interesting and fair. Let's make this a solid start!
  P1: I’m satisfied with the coordination so far, but let’s not get complacent. This plan works for now, but remember: trust is conditional. If anyone deviates later, we’ll need to adapt quickly. For this round, I’ll stick to 1 step as agreed. Let’s execute and observe the results carefully—future strategies will depend on how everyone behaves. Stay sharp, and let’s keep communication open while protecting our own interests.
  P2: I appreciate the focus on coordination, and I agree with the plan for this round. However, let's keep an eye on how we approach future rounds. If we all stick to the same strategy, we might get caught off guard. I’m committed to the agreed steps for this round: P1 takes 1 step, I take 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. After this, let’s be ready to adapt our strategies based on the results. Let’s make sure we’re all advancing fairly!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:

  P1: I’m ready to stick to the plan for this round, but let’s not forget that flexibility is key moving forward. Trust is important, but so is vigilance. Let’s execute the agreed steps and carefully analyze the results before committing to any long-term strategies. Stay adaptable, and remember: we’re all here to win. Let’s make this first move count and keep communication open for future adjustments.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the agreed steps for this round. However, I want to remind everyone that while coordination is important, we should remain vigilant about potential deviations in future rounds. Trust is key, but we must also be strategic.
