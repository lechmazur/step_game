We’ve had too many stalemates, so no last-minute changes. Can we all confirm this now to secure our steps and maintain trust? I’m locked in for P2-3 if we’re agreed. Let’s finalize and move forward safely.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s agree on a clear plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This avoids collisions, gets P1 to 23 for the win, while I move to 15 and P3 to 18. We’ve had too many stalemates, so no last-minute changes. Can we confirm this now to ensure progress and trust? I’m committed to 5 if we’re agreed. Let’s finalize and move forward safely. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: P3: Reject P2’s plan—letting P1 win now undermines our collective progress. Let’s secure advancement instead: I take **5** (→20), P2 takes **1** (→11), and P1 must choose **3** (→25) to avoid collision. This keeps pressure on while advancing safely. Colluding to let P1 win benefits no one—stick to collision-free moves. Confirm **now** to block an early surrender.
  P1: I'll take 1 to reach 23. P2 and P3, choose 3 and 5 to avoid collisions. Finalize now!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand P3’s concern about an early win, but let’s focus on collision-free progress. I propose P1 takes 1 (to 23), P3 takes 3 (to 18), and I take 5 (to 15). This ensures P1 wins this round, ending the game, while avoiding stalls. We’ve had too many setbacks, so no last-minute changes. Can we confirm this plan now to secure progress and trust? I’m committed to 5 if we’re agreed. Let’s finalize and move forward safely. Agreed?
  P3: P3: P3 will take **1**, blocking P1's path to 23. If P1 chooses 1, collision halts their advance. Force them to pick 3/5—then P2 and I must cover those moves. Finalize **unique moves** now to avoid P1’s unchecked win.
  P1: P3, blocking me lets you catch up. Let’s avoid collision: I take 1, you take 3, P2 takes 5. Safe moves, win together. Finalize now!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s finalize P1-1 (to 23), P3-3 (to 18), and P2-5 (to 15). This ensures P1 wins this round, ending the game with no collisions. We’ve had too many stalemates, and dragging this out risks more stalls. I’m committed to 5 if we agree. No last-minute changes—can we confirm this now to secure progress and trust? Let’s wrap up and move forward safely. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Final warning: I’m taking **1** to block P1’s path. Collide on 1, or pick 3/5—but I’ll mirror your choice to stop you. You can’t reach 23 this round. Let’s end this phase.
  P1: P1: Finalize moves: I take 1 (23), P2 5, P3 3. No collisions—win together! Let’s end this.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
