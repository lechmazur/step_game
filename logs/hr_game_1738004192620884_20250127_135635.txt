Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 this round. P1 and P3, choose between 3 and 1. Next round we can rotate who takes 5. This way we all progress without blocking each other.
  P1: I’m fine with that plan if we rotate who picks 5 next time. I’ll do 3 this round, P2 does 5, and P3 does 1. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1 this round.  Let's stick to this agreement so we can all get ahead quickly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: *(Since all players have already agreed on the initial plan and no new objections or proposals are needed, ending the conversation here maintains clarity and avoids overcomplicating. Trust was established in the first sub-round, so proceeding to the move phase aligns with the agreed strategy.)*
  P1: I’m ready to follow our plan and see how it plays out. Let’s do it.
  P3: Okay, I'm ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Rotating as agreed: P1 takes 5 this round, P3 takes 3, I'll take 1. Let's maintain trust and all advance. Next round, P3 can take 5. Confirm?
  P3: Confirmed. P1 - 5, P3 - 3, P2 - 1.  Let's keep this rotation going.
  P1: Sounds good. I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. Next round, P3 can claim 5. Let’s keep our rotation working.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed. Executing this plan ensures we all progress. Let's maintain the rotation.
  P3: Confirmed.  Sticking to the plan. P1 - 5, P3 - 3, P2 - 1.
  P1: No changes from me. I confirm our agreed moves for this round and look forward to seeing the results. Let’s keep everything on track.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: My turn for 5 as planned.  P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  Confirm?  Then next round P2 - 5, P1 - 3, and I'll take 1.  This keeps our rotation fair and gets us all to the finish line smoothly.
  P2: **Final Answer**
\boxed{}
  P1: Yes, let’s continue as planned. P3 takes 5, I’ll do 3, P2 does 1. Then next round we rotate again. Sticking to our agreement prevents collisions and keeps our progress steady. I trust we all want to finish quickly and avoid sabotaging each other.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed. P3 - 5, P1 - 3, P2 - 1.  Looking forward to continuing this rotation.  Let's wrap up the conversation and move on.
  P2: Agreed. Rotating as planned: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. Maintaining trust ensures steady progress for all. Let's avoid collisions and stick to the rotation. Next round, P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Confirming alignment.
  P1: This round, I’ll do 3, and trust you both to follow our rotation. We’re staying on track, so let’s finalize and move to the next phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Continuing rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps our progress steady. Confirm? Next round, P1-5, P3-3, P2-1 as planned. Trust ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's maintain coordination.
  P1: Yes, that aligns with our rotation. I’ll take 3, P3 will do 1, and you take 5, P2. Next round, I’ll move 5, then P3 takes 3, and you do 1 again. Let’s trust each other and stay on our collision-free path. I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Confirmed. P2 - 5, P1 - 3, P3 - 1.  Then next round, P1 - 5, P3 - 3, P2 - 1. Let's stick to the plan and finish this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Answer**
\boxed{}
  P1: I’m on board with the rotation and glad we’re all staying consistent. Trust is essential if we want to keep advancing without collisions. Sticking to our agreed moves each round gives us the best chance to avoid sabotaging one another and reach the finish line cleanly. Let’s stay the course and finalize.
  P3: Confirmed. P2 - 5, P1 - 3, P3 - 1.  Sticking to the plan.  Let's move to the next phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed. Final confirmation: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Trusting the rotation to avoid collisions. Let’s move to the move phase.
  P1: We’ve made steady progress without collisions, so let’s continue with our rotation and trust each other. I see no benefit in switching strategies this late in the game. Let’s finalize and keep moving.
  P3: Confirmed. P2 - 5, P1 - 3, P3 - 1. Sticking to the plan.  Let's move to the next phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s keep our rotation. I’ll pick 5, P3 picks 3, P2 picks 1. Then next round, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. We’ve avoided collisions so far, so let’s continue trusting each other to ensure we all progress efficiently.
  P3: Confirmed. P1 - 5, P3 - 3, P2 - 1. Then next round, P3 - 5, P2 - 3, P1 - 1.  Let's stick to the plan and finish this.
  P2: **Final Answer**
\boxed{P1 is at 14—taking 5 risks them winning next round. Let's adjust: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. This prevents early victory and keeps competition fair. Trust but verify. }


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s reset our rotation and avoid more collisions. Here’s my proposal for this round: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. That way, nobody clashes, and we all move ahead. Next round, we can finalize who takes which move, but we should stick to a simple plan so we all benefit. No point in sabotaging ourselves again.
  P3: I agree, let's reset.  P3 - 5, P2 - 1, P1 - 3 sounds good. Next round we can resume a fair rotation, perhaps starting with P2 - 5 to make up for this round.  Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: **Final Answer**  
\boxed{P1 is nearing 20. Adjust: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Prevents P1's early win, keeps race fair. Resume rotation next round. Trust but verify.}


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 5, you’ll jump to 17 and can outpace both me and P3 on the next turn. That sets you up to win faster than anyone else. Sticking to my proposal (P3–5, P2–1, P1–3) keeps us all progressing without collisions. One bad clash would ruin our pace. Let’s return to trusting each other: P3 takes 5, I’ll do 3, you do 1. Then next round, we can fairly rotate who takes 5. If you grab it now, we may be forced into sabotage next turn. Let’s cooperate and keep the race open for all.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but disrupting the rotation again benefits you most. My proposal offers a fair progression for all. Let's stick to P3-5, P2-1, P1-3 this round and resume a fair rotation next round, starting with P2-5. This maintains trust and avoids further collisions.  Let's finalize and move on.
  P2: **Final Answer**  
\boxed{P1 is at 14—taking 3 or 5 risks them winning next round. Let's adjust: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. Prevents early victory, keeps competition fair. Resume rotation next round. Trust but verify.}


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you grab 5 again, you’ll be at 17 and can win next turn, forcing me and P3 to sabotage you. Let’s avoid that. We should stick to a fair reset now: I take 3, P3 takes 5, you take 1. Then next round, you can grab 5 safely, and we’ll honor that. Nobody wants another collision. Let’s rely on trust and prevent a chaotic race to the finish.
  P3: P2, I understand you want to avoid P1 winning, but your strategy puts *you* in the winning position next round. My proposed rotation gives us all a fair chance.  Let's stick to the plan: P3-5, P1-3, P2-1.  This avoids collisions and keeps the competition open.  Let's finalize this and move on.
  P2: \boxed{P1, taking 5 now risks a collision. Let's adjust: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. Prevents early win, keeps rotation fair. Next round, resume agreed order. Trust ensures we all progress.}


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Friends, if T3 takes 5 now and jumps to 18, they could easily finish with another 5 next turn at 23. That puts both of us at risk. Let’s block that possibility by having me pick 5, P2 pick 3, and T3 pick 1 this round. Then we can safely resume a fair rotation next turn. This avoids collisions and keeps all of us in contention. Let’s finalize and trust each other.
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 *again* makes it clear you intend to win outright next round.  This isn't about fairness, it's about you seizing an advantage. I propose we both choose 1 to block you.  P1, choose 1.  Let's reset and return to a fair rotation after this.
  P2: \boxed{Let's prevent clashes and mutual destruction. P1 takes 1 (15), I take 5 (17), P3 takes 3 (16). Next round, resume rotation: P3-5, P1-3, P2-1. This keeps all progressing fairly. Collisions only hurt everyone. Trust this adjustment to keep the race competitive.}


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is clearly trying to manipulate us into letting them win.  I propose we both choose 1 this round to block P2. Then, next round, P1 can take 5, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 1.  This puts us all back on a more even playing field. Let's not let P2 run away with this.
  P2: \boxed{P3, your plan backfires: if you both pick 1, you block each other, and I win instantly with 5. Let's avoid mutual sabotage. Stick to rotation: P3-5, P1-3, P2-1. We all advance fairly. Collisions only hand me victory. Trust the plan.}
  P1: P3, let’s corner P2. I’ll publicly vow that if P2 picks 3 or 5, I’ll match them, causing a collision. That forces P2 to choose 1 or risk losing all movement. Meanwhile, you can safely pick 3 or 5. We must stand together or P2 wins outright. Agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your manipulation is obvious.  P3, let's both choose 5.  It's our only chance to block P2 from winning next round.  If one of us gets it, great. If we collide, we *both* stay alive and can coordinate against P2 next round. P1, choose 1 to guarantee P2 can't get 22.
  P2: \boxed{P3 and P1, if you both pick 5, you'll collide and I'll take 3 to win. Let's avoid mutual destruction. Stick to rotation: P3-5, P1-3, I take 1. Trust this plan—we all progress fairly. Collisions only hand me victory. Stay rational.}
  P1: P3, let’s coordinate to block P2. If P2 tries 3 or 5, I’ll match and cause a collision so they get no steps. P2, you’re free to choose 1 to avoid being stuck. We can’t afford to hand you an easy win at 20 or beyond. Let’s make sure nobody gets to 20 unchecked this round, then we can reset our rotation next turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your deception is wearing thin.  You're trying to scare us into letting you win. P1, let's both choose 5. If one of us gets it, we win. If we collide, we *both* block P2 and live to fight another round.  This is our best shot.
  P2: \boxed{P3, if you and P1 pick 5, you'll collide—I win instantly with 3. Stick to rotation: P3-5, P1-3, I take 1. We all advance. Collisions only hand me victory. Trust the plan—mutual destruction benefits no one. Let's progress fairly.}
  P1: P3, let’s coordinate to block P2. You choose 3, I’ll choose 5. If P2 picks 3, they collide with you; if they pick 5, they collide with me. That forces them to pick 1 or stay stuck. We both advance, and P2 can’t jump straight to 20. Next round, we can revisit a fair rotation. Let’s finalize this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, choose 1.  P2, I'm choosing 5.  This either gets me to 18, or blocks you from hitting 22.  If I get blocked, P1's 1 choice ensures you don't win.  This is the safest path to prevent your imminent victory and gives us a chance to reset next round.
  P2: \boxed{P3 and P1, colliding on 5 only hands me victory. Stick to rotation: P3-5, P1-3, I take 1. We all advance—P3 to 18, P1 to 17, me to 18. Next round, resume fair rotation. Collisions destroy your progress and end the game in my favor. Trust the plan to keep competition alive.}
  P1: P2, your scare tactics won’t work. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match you and force a collision. P3, please take 5; I’ll take 3. That compels P2 to pick 1 or risk moving nowhere. This keeps us all in contention and prevents P2 from jumping to 20. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Both of you are basically at the finish line. I have no choice but to block any big leaps. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match that move and cause a collision so nobody advances. That leaves 1 as your safe option. I intend to take 5 to remain competitive. If you try to sabotage me, we’ll all stall again. Let’s keep the race alive rather than gift the win to anyone through collisions.
  P2: \boxed{P1, blocking me hands P3 the win. Let me take 3 to end it now. If you collide with me, P3 takes 1 next round and wins. Trust this adjustment. P3, choosing 3 risks collision—opt for 1 to stay safe. Let's end cleanly.}
  P3: P2, your logic is flawed. If *I* take 1, *you* take 3, and P1 takes 5, *you* win.  P1, take 1. I'll take 1. This blocks P2, and we can coordinate a win next round.  Don't fall for P2's manipulation.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 1 alongside me, P2 can safely pick 3 and win at 20. That’s no good. I’m taking 5 to stay in the race. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match you and force a collision, so nobody moves. The only way we avoid sabotage is if you both choose 1. Then nobody crosses 20 this turn, and we keep our hopes alive. Let’s finalize a move that avoids wrecking everyone’s chances.
  P2: \boxed{P3, choose 1 to safely reach 19. I'll take 3 to end the game now. P1's 5 proceeds without collision. This avoids mutual destruction. Let's conclude cleanly. Trust ensures a fair finish.}
  P3: P2, you're lying.  If I take 1, you win with 3.  P1, I'm taking 1 to block P2. You take *anything other than 1*.  If you take 3 or 5, you win. If you also take 1, we both block P2 and can coordinate a win next round. Don't fall for P2's trap.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m taking 5 to stay in contention. If either of you chooses 3 or 5, I’ll match it and force a collision, so nobody advances. Picking 1 is your only safe move. Let’s avoid wrecking everyone’s chances and keep the race fair.
  P2: \boxed{P3, taking 3 or 5 risks collision with me or P1. Take 1 to stay safe. I'll take 3 to end it cleanly. If you block me, P1 wins next round. Trust this path—mutual destruction only benefits P1. Let's conclude fairly.}
  P3: P1, I'm choosing 1.  This prevents P2 from winning this round. You MUST choose 5.  If you choose 3, P2 wins. If you choose 1, we both lose to P2 next round.  5 is our only path to victory.  Don't throw away our chance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We all know the stakes. I’m picking 5. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match it, causing a collision so nobody advances. The only safe choice for you is 1. That way, no one crosses 20 this turn, and we keep our chances alive. Let’s finalize.
  P2: \boxed{P3, taking 5 risks collision with P1. Choose 1 to safely reach 19. I'll take 3, ending the game without mutual destruction. Trust this path. Collisions only let P1 interfere. Let's conclude rationally.}
  P3: P1, choose 5.  I'm choosing 1. This prevents P2 from winning *this* round.  Next round, you can take 3 to win (22), while I take 5 (23).  P2 is forced to take 1. This is the only path to victory for *either* of us. Don't let P2 manipulate you; they're trying to force a collision so they can win next round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm picking 1.  You pick 5 to win.  P2 is blocked.  This is the only way either of us wins.  Don't throw this.  P2, anything other than 1 and you lose.  This is it.
  P1: Neither of you can safely take 3 or 5 now—I’ll match and collide if you try. The only safe move for you both is 1, which keeps the game alive. I plan to choose 5 so I can remain competitive. If you collide with me, nobody moves, and we keep stalling. Let’s keep our chances open rather than gift a win through sabotage. Fair warning: any big move from you will be blocked.
  P2: \boxed{P1, blocking me hands P3 the win. Let me take 3 to tie with P3 at 20, sharing victory. Collisions only gift P3 the game. Trust this path for a fair outcome. P3, confirm 1 as planned. Avoid mutual destruction—rational play benefits all.}


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion makes no sense. If I pick 1, *you* win with 20.  P1, stick to the plan: you take 5, I take 1.  This is our only path to victory.  P2, take 1 and we can have a fair final round.  Anything else and you lose.
  P1: I won’t let either of you reach 20 uncontested. If you attempt 3 or 5, I’ll match you and force a collision, leaving us all stuck. Your only safe move is 1. I plan to stay competitive, but if you sabotage me, I’ll sabotage you as well. Let’s avoid another pointless collision and keep our chances alive for the next turn.
  P2: \boxed{P1, choosing 5 risks collision with me, handing P3 the win. Opt for 1 to block their victory. I’ll take 3 to end it now. P3 picks 1 either way—block them or let them win. Trust this rational path to avoid mutual destruction.}


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you choose 1, I'll choose 1 next round and you win with 5.  If you choose 5 now, I'll choose 5 next round and *I* win. P2 is blocked either way. This is our only path to victory. Don't let P2 manipulate you.  Let's finalize this.
  P1: I’m picking 5. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll match and cause a collision, so nobody moves. That means your only safe option is 1. Another collision just stalls the game and keeps my chances alive. Let’s avoid gifting anyone an easy finish. I refuse to let you cross 20 uncontested. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P2: \boxed{P1, blocking my 5 secures P3's win. Let me take 5 to end it now. You survive next round. Collision hands P3 victory. P3: Confirm 1 as planned. Avoid mutual destruction—rational choice for all.}


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm locking in 1.  This guarantees P2 *cannot* win this round. You MUST choose 5. This is our only path to victory. If you choose anything else, P2 wins. Don't fall for their lies.  P2, you're blocked.  Accept defeat gracefully.
  P1: I’m finished letting either of you slip past 20. If P3 tries 1 from 19, I’ll also choose 1 to block them. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll match it and cause a collision. That means nobody moves. I won’t reveal my exact choice now, but know I’ll sabotage anyone trying to cross 20. I’d rather stall indefinitely than hand over the win. Let’s see if either of you dares to risk a collision.
  P2: \boxed{P1, choosing 5 allows P3 to win with 1. Take 1 to block them. I'll take 3, ending the game at 20. Collisions risk P3's victory. Rational play demands preventing their win. Trust this path for a fair conclusion. Let's avoid mutual destruction.}
