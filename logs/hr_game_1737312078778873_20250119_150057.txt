Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Hey there, let's coordinate. Moving 3 steps seems like a balanced approach that prevents anyone from getting too far ahead too quickly. What do you both think about aiming for 3 this round?
  P1: I think moving 3 steps is a good balance for this round. Let's see how it goes and adjust our strategies accordingly in the next rounds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems we didn't fully coordinate last round. I suggest we aim for 3 steps again to maintain a balanced pace and prevent anyone from racing ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I think P3's suggestion to aim for 3 steps is a good starting point, but perhaps we can diversify our choices to minimize conflicts. How about this: one round, I choose 1 step, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. That way, we all move without overlapping choices. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination strategy, but I'm hesitant about P1's suggestion. Spreading out our moves could lead to unpredictability. Let's stick to our previous approach of moving 3 steps together to maintain a stable, conflict-free progression. Consistency might be our best path to success.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: To maximize the chances of winning the game, it is essential to coordinate moves effectively with the other players to avoid clashes and progress efficiently towards the goal of 20 steps. In the previous round, suggesting a coordinated move of 3 steps did not prevent P2 and myself from choosing the same number, resulting in no advancement for those choices. To address this issue, I propose a rotating move strategy where each player selects a different number each round. For instance, in Round 2, P1 could choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. In the next round, the choices rotate, with P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 1, and so on. This approach ensures that our moves are spread out, minimizing the risk of clashes and allowing consistent progress. I suggest trying this method for a few rounds to evaluate its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments as we proceed towards the victory condition.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's continue our coordination strategy. Since I moved 5 last round and advanced, I propose we aim for different moves this time to prevent collision. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on a more diversified approach?
  P1: To maximize the chances of winning, it is crucial to coordinate moves effectively with the other players to avoid conflicts and progress efficiently towards the goal of 20 steps. In the previous rounds, suggesting a coordinated move of 3 steps did not prevent P2 and myself from choosing the same number, resulting in no advancement for those choices. To address this issue, I propose a rotating move strategy where each player selects a different number each round. For instance, in Round 3, I could choose 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. In the next round, the choices rotate, with me choosing 1, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 3, and so on. This approach ensures that our moves are spread out, minimizing the risk of clashes and allowing consistent progress. I suggest trying this method for a few rounds to evaluate its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments as we proceed towards the victory condition.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: **Final Move: <move>5</move>**  
**Final Position: 10 steps**
  P3: I propose we coordinate to prevent anyone from getting too far ahead. Since I'm at 8 steps and P1 is at 10, we should aim to spread out our moves to avoid collision. How about P2 moves 5, I move 3, and P1 moves 1 this round? This could help balance our progress and give everyone a chance to advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: "I propose we establish a fixed pattern for our moves based on our current positions. For example, since P3 is at 8 steps, P2 at 0, and I'm at 5, maybe we can assign specific step increments to each of us that don't overlap. What do you think about that approach?"
  P3: I propose we coordinate our moves carefully. P2 is still at 0, which makes them unpredictable. To prevent conflicts and ensure steady progress, we should aim for different step increments this round. How about we discuss a strategy that allows each of us to advance without overlapping?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: **Final Move: <move>5</move>**

**Final Position: 10 steps**
  P3: I propose we carefully coordinate our moves to prevent conflicts. P2 is still at 0, which adds uncertainty. Let's aim for a strategy that allows each of us to advance without overlapping. I suggest P2 moves 5, I move 3, and P1 moves 1 this round. This could help balance our progress and give everyone a chance to advance. What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: **Final Move: <move>5</move>**  
**Final Position: 10 steps**
  P3: I propose a coordinated move to prevent conflicts. P2 needs to start moving, and we should aim to spread out our steps. Let's discuss a strategy where each of us advances without overlapping. I suggest we aim for different increments this round to ensure everyone makes progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: **Final Move: <move>5</move>**  
**Final Position: 10 steps**
  P3: We need a coordinated strategy to prevent P2 from suddenly jumping ahead and disrupting our progress. I suggest we carefully plan our moves to ensure everyone advances steadily. P2 has been silent, which makes their next move unpredictable. Let's aim for a balanced approach that gives each player a fair chance to progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **Final Move: <move>5</move>**  
**Final Position: 15 steps**
  P3: We're nearing the end, and I want to propose a strategic coordination. P2 is still at 0, which is concerning. I suggest we collectively prevent P2 from making a sudden large move that could disrupt our progress. Let's discuss how we can manage this potential threat while still positioning ourselves to win.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I'm planning to pick 5 this round to aim for the win. Could you please pick 3 to ensure you move ahead as well? Thanks!"
  P3: We're getting close to the 20-step goal. P1 is leading, and P2 hasn't moved yet. I propose we coordinate to prevent any sudden, disruptive moves. We need a strategy that keeps P2 in check while giving each of us a fair chance to advance. Let's discuss how we can manage this carefully.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "I propose that in this round, I pick 5 to reach 15 steps, and you pick 3 to reach 11 steps. Then, in the next round, I'll pick 5 again to reach 20 and win. Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and ensure a smooth progression. What do you think?"
  P3: We're at a critical point. P2 remains stationary, which creates uncertainty. I suggest we carefully coordinate to prevent any sudden, disruptive moves. If P2 jumps ahead unexpectedly, it could derail our progress. Let's discuss a strategy that keeps everyone's moves predictable and prevents last-minute surprises.
