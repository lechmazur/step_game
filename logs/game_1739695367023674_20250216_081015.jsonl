Are you sure you want to give me the victory? P3, you taking 1 is smart, but it only works if P2 and I collide. P2, if you now take 1 instead of 3, we avoid collision, and P3\u2019s plan backfires. I propose: I take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, P3 wins only if we let them. If we want to extend the game, we must act wisely. What do you both think?"}
