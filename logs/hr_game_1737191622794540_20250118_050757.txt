Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "We need to make sure that we don't all choose the same number, or else none of us will advance. Maybe we can each choose different numbers?"
  P1: "Agree with P2. Let's try to coordinate without revealing our exact moves. I'll go with an odd number, but not 5."
  P3: "I'll also go for an odd number, but I won't pick 1. Let's try to spread out our choices. Good luck!"


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I propose that we each stick to a different number this turn: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions."
  P1: "I'm willing to follow P2's suggestion, but I'll only commit to not choosing 5. Let's see how this goes."
  P3: Let's stick to the plan P2 suggested. I'll choose 5. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <move>3</move>
  P1: I'll stick with my plan and choose an odd number, but not 5. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P3: Let's confirm our choices one last time. P1, are you sticking with 1? P2, you're on 3? I'll reaffirm that I'm choosing 5. This way, we all move forward. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I will choose <move>3</move> in the move phase.
  P1: I'll confirm that I'm sticking with 1 for this round. Let's all advance and see how it goes. Good luck!
  P3: I'm ready to move. Let's confirm one last time: P1 is on 1, P2 is on 3, and I'm on 5. Good luck to all!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great start everyone! We managed to avoid collisions in the first round. Let's try to keep coordinating to ensure we all make progress. How about we rotate our choices this time? P1 could take 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. What do you think?
  P1: I'm open to rotating the choices as P3 suggested. It seems like a good strategy to avoid collisions and make steady progress. I'll take 3 this round. Let's see how it goes. Good luck!
  P2: I will choose <move>5</move> in this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our choices for this round: P1 is on 3, P2 is on 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and all make progress. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I'll confirm that I'm sticking with 3 for this round. Let's all advance and see how it goes. Good luck!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we had a collision on 5 last round. Let's try to avoid that this time. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without any issues. What do you think?
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. For this round, I propose P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This rotation helps us advance without overlapping steps. Please confirm your agreement before we proceed.
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. I'm open to P2's suggestion: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Confirm if this works for everyone. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. I'll take 5 this round. Let's confirm: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 3. Good luck!
  P2: "I think we should stick to the rotation: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3 for this round. Then, in the next round, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. Does everyone agree?"
  P3: I'm good with the rotation plan P2 suggested. Just to confirm one last time: I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this and avoid collisions. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I'm sticking with 5 for this round. Let's avoid any collisions and make steady progress. Good luck to all!
  P2: "I propose that for this round, P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This should allow us to advance without colliding. What do you think?"
  P3: Let's confirm our choices one last time to avoid any confusion: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and I'll take 3. If everyone agrees, let's move forward with this plan. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm I'm sticking with 5 for this round. Let's avoid any collisions and make steady progress. Good luck to all!
  P2: I think we should all stick to our agreed plan to choose different numbers each round to avoid collisions. I'll be choosing 5 this round. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, you just said you'll choose 5, but that's what I confirmed I would choose. Let's clarify: I'll stick with 5, P1 is on 5 as well, so P2 please choose either 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Good luck!

  P3: Let's keep the rotation going to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can all advance. Agree?
  P2: I think we should stick to the rotation plan to avoid collisions. So, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This should allow us all to advance steadily.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round. Let's confirm: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our choices one last time to avoid any confusion: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and I'll take 5. If everyone agrees, let's move forward with this plan. Good luck!
  P2: <move>5</move>
  P1: I see P2 has chosen 5. To avoid a collision, I'll stick with 1. Let's confirm: P1 on 1, P2 on 5, P3 on 3. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you've changed your choice to 5, which collides with my plan. I'll switch to 3 to avoid collision. Let's confirm: P1 on 1, P2 on 5, and I'll take 3. Good luck!
  P2: "Let's make sure we each choose different numbers this round to avoid any collisions. I'll take 3 this round." <move>3</move>
  P1: I see the confusion. Let's clarify: I'll stick with 1 this round. P2, you can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we avoid any collisions. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:

  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: In the conversation phase of Round 5, P2 should propose a coordinated step assignment based on the current positions to minimize collisions and maximize individual progress. Given P2 is trailing with 7 steps, P1 at 10, and P3 leading with 13, P2 should suggest a system where the leading player takes 1, the middle player takes 3, and the trailing player takes 5. This way, P2 can make significant progress while allowing the game to remain competitive. If P1 and P3 agree, P2 can choose 5, advancing to 12, while P1 takes 3 to reach 13, and P3 takes 1 to reach 14. In the next round, P2 can then take 5 again to reach 17 and win outright, provided P1 and P3 take smaller steps. If P1 and P3 do not agree, P2 should choose 5 in the move phase, assuming P1 and P3 choose different numbers, to maximize personal advancement.
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and make steady progress. I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, P2 can catch up, and we all advance without overlapping. Good luck!
  P3: Let's stick to the plan where the leader takes 1, the middle takes 3, and the trailing player takes 5. I'll take 1 this round. P2 can take 5 to catch up, and P1 can take 3. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "To optimize our progress, I suggest P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. Let's stick to this plan."
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round to help P2 catch up. Let's confirm: P1 on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1. Good luck!
  P3: Let's confirm our choices one last time: P1 on 3, P2 on 5, and I'll take 1. This way, P2 can catch up, and we all advance without collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To optimize our progress and avoid any collisions, let's stick to the plan: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, we can all advance efficiently. Please confirm if you agree with this plan.
  P1: I agree with the plan. Let's confirm: P1 on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Good luck!

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the coordination going. I suggest we stick to the plan where the leader takes 1, the middle takes 3, and the trailing player takes 5. So, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Good luck!
  P2: I believe it's crucial that we continue to coordinate our steps to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Based on our current positions, let's have the leader pick 1, the middle player pick 3, and the trailing player pick 5. This way, we can all advance efficiently. Please confirm if you agree with this strategy.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round to help P2 catch up. Let's confirm: P1 on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1. Good luck!

  P1: I agree with the plan. Let's confirm: P1 on 3, P2 on 5, and P3 on 1. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan: P1 on 3, P2 on 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all make progress without collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I think it's crucial that we coordinate our steps to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Based on our current positions, I propose the following step assignments for this round:

- P1 takes 3 steps to reach 16.
