Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I propose that in this turn, I move 1 step, you move 3 steps, and P3 moves 5 steps. Then, in the next turn, I move 3, you move 5, and P3 moves 1, and so on. This way, we can all make progress without colliding.
  P2: Your proposal sounds interesting, P1, but I'm hesitant to commit to a strict alternating pattern. While coordinating could help us all progress, I want to ensure my own strategic advantage. Let's discuss how we might balance cooperation with individual goals.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I agree with P1's proposal as a solid foundation. It ensures we all make progress without colliding. However, as we near the 20-step mark, we might need to adjust our moves to optimize our positions. P3, do you have any thoughts or suggestions on how we should proceed? It's important that we all agree on the strategy to maximize our chances of winning.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm cautious about a rigid pattern. While cooperation seems beneficial now, I want to maintain flexibility. We should discuss how we can balance collective progress with individual strategic advantages. Are there ways we can create a mutually beneficial approach that doesn't lock us into a predictable sequence?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I think it's crucial that we coordinate our moves to avoid any collisions, which would halt our progress. P2, your concern about maintaining individual strategy is valid, so maybe we can agree to coordinate most of the time but allow for some flexibility as we approach the endgame. P3, what are your thoughts on how we should proceed? It's important that everyone is on board with whatever plan we decide to follow to maximize our chances of winning.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I want to ensure we have room for strategic flexibility. While avoiding collisions is important, we should be open to adapting our approach as the game progresses. Let's maintain a collaborative spirit, but not lock ourselves into a rigid pattern that could disadvantage any of us.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Alright, I'm moving 3 steps. Let's see what P2 and P3 decide. <move>3</move>
  P2: Our current coordination seems fragile. I'm open to continuing our collaborative approach, but I want to ensure we all benefit. We're making progress, but we need a more robust strategy to prevent collisions and advance efficiently. P1, P3, how can we refine our plan to increase our chances of success?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P1: "P3, what are your thoughts on the current strategy? Do you have any suggestions or preferences for how we should proceed?"

P1: "I propose that we continue with a rotating move pattern to ensure we don't pick the same numbers and get blocked. For this turn, let's have P1 pick 3, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1. Then, in the next turn, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3, and so on. This way, we all make progress without collisions. However, if any of us needs to adjust for strategic reasons, we can discuss and modify the plan in advance. What do you think, P2 and P3?"
  P2: I appreciate our ongoing dialogue about coordination, but I'm becoming increasingly cautious about our current approach. While avoiding collisions is important, we need a strategy that allows for individual adaptability. I suggest we remain flexible and not commit to a rigid pattern that could limit our strategic options as we get closer to the winning threshold.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "I have decided to pick 3 steps this round. This choice aims to balance progress with the risk of collision, assuming that the other players will choose different numbers. By selecting 3, I can advance without overly exposing myself to the risk of colliding with another player who might also choose 3. Additionally, suggesting a coordinated approach in the conversation phase helps to encourage others to select different numbers, further reducing the likelihood of a collision."
  P2: Our current progress is promising, but we're still far from victory. I'm open to continued coordination, but I want to ensure my path to winning remains flexible. Let's discuss how we can strategically advance without unnecessary collisions. P1, P3, what are your thoughts on our next moves?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Hey team, I think it's crucial that we work together to make steady progress towards the 20-step goal. P2, I understand your concerns about maintaining flexibility in our strategies. To address this, how about we try coordinating our moves for the next two rounds, see how it goes, and then discuss any necessary adjustments? This way, we can test the effectiveness of coordination without committing to it long-term. P3, your input is also valuable here. What do you think about giving coordination a short trial? Let's make sure everyone's voices are heard in this process."
  P2: I'm continuing to emphasize strategic flexibility while showing openness to coordination. Here's my message:

Our current positions suggest we need a careful approach. I'm willing to coordinate, but we must remain adaptable. P1 and P3, let's discuss a move strategy that prevents collisions while keeping our individual winning chances intact. What specific moves are you considering to minimize blocking each other?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, I'm moving 3 steps. Let's see what P2 and P3 decide. <move>3</move>
  P2: I see we're at a critical juncture where coordination becomes increasingly important. Our current positions suggest we need a strategic approach to avoid collisions. I propose we carefully select moves that prevent blocking while maintaining our individual progress. Let's aim for a collaborative yet flexible strategy that keeps our winning chances open.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I propose a rotating move pattern: this turn, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. Next turn, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and so on. This ensures we don't collide and make steady progress. However, we should be ready to adjust as needed, especially near the endgame. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: I appreciate our ongoing discussions about coordination, but I'm becoming increasingly strategic about my moves. While avoiding collisions is important, I want to maintain flexibility. Let's continue to explore ways we can advance without blocking each other, but I'm not committing to a rigid pattern that could limit my chances of winning.
