Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest we avoid colliding. Let’s each try a different number so all of us can move. No point in blocking everyone’s progress right at the start. What do you two think?
  P3: I agree with P2. Let's try to move forward each turn. I'll pick a number different from what I think you two will pick.
  P1: Agreed. To ensure no collisions, let's each pick a different number. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this round. Next turn, we rotate who gets 5. Fair rotation keeps us all progressing. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That rotation sounds fair. I’m fine with starting as you suggested, then rotating who picks 5 next time. Let’s try it.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the proposed rotation. Let's stick to the plan for this round, P1 pick 5, P2 pick 3 and I'll pick 1. We can adjust if needed after this round.
  P1: To keep momentum, let's confirm the next rotation: next turn, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we all cycle through higher numbers without collision. Stick to this and we can all climb efficiently. Any objections?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I agree with the rotation plan. Let's stick to it for this round: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1.
  P2: Sounds good. I'll pick 5 this turn as agreed. Next turn, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1 to keep the rotation fair. Let’s make sure we stick to it so nobody collides. Then we can reassess afterward.
  P1: **P1:** Agreed. Let's maintain the rotation: this round P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. Next round P3-5, P1-3, P2-1. Consistency prevents collisions and ensures steady progress. Let's all commit to avoid deviations.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m good continuing our agreed rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 this round. That way, we minimize collision and keep our momentum going. Let’s see how the positions look afterward, and then we can talk again.
  P1: **P1:** Confirming the rotation for this round: P3-5, P1-3, P2-1. Let's all honor the plan to avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. Deviations risk mutual setbacks. Consistency benefits everyone. Proceed?
  P3: Okay, I agree with the rotation. I'll take 5 this round, P1 take 3, and P2 take 1. Let's keep it consistent.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m still on board. Let’s finalize this round with P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and I’ll take 1. Then we’ll see how the scores look afterward.
  P1: **P1:** All aligned. Let's proceed smoothly. Consistency is key.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the rotation. I'll take 5 this round, P1 take 3, and P2 take 1. Let's keep it consistent.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That collision last round was unfortunate. Let’s shift strategy. P3 is now leading, so maybe it’s time we deny them repeated fives. How about I take 5 this turn, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? Then we can revisit who gets 5 next round, ensuring we don’t let anyone sprint too far ahead. Let’s avoid collisions and keep it fair—everyone gains, but we stop P3 from running away. Thoughts? If there’s a better plan, I’m open to hearing it.
  P3: I agree with P2, we should stop P3 from getting too far ahead. I'm fine with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and I'll take 1 this round. We can re-evaluate the rotation next turn.
  P1: **P1:** Agreed to P2's plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Consistency prevents collisions. But let's note P2 will reach 13, nearing 19. Next round, we must adjust to balance progress and prevent any single leader. Trust is key now—deviations risk mutual loss. Proceed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Afterward, we reassess next round and make sure no one gets too far ahead. Let’s stick to this plan now.
  P3: Okay, I agree to P2's plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's stick to this for now, but we need to keep P2's progress in mind for the next round and make sure nobody gets too far ahead.
  P1: **P1:** Confirming this round: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Post-moves, P2 will lead at 13. Next round, we must collectively cap leaders. Propose next rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Prevents runaway leads and maintains fairness. Agreed? Let’s solidify the post-round 4 plan now. Trust and balance are vital.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still on board with this round’s plan—P2:5, P1:3, P3:1. Next round, let’s follow P1’s suggestion: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. That should keep everyone advancing while preventing a runaway lead.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. For next round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 sounds good to keep things balanced. Let's stick to this and see how the board looks after.
  P1: **P1:** Confirming final plan: this round P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Next round, P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Post-moves, we must closely monitor positions to adjust rotations and prevent any player nearing 19. Trust and adherence are critical—deviations risk mutual stagnation. Let's execute smoothly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** Apologies for the prior misstep. Let's adhere to the agreed plan: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round. This prevents collisions and keeps us advancing. Post-moves, we'll reassess to ensure balance. Trust and consistency are vital now.
  P2: Friends, we should adapt. P3 is leading at 10, I’m at 8, and P1 at 6. Let me pick 5, P1 pick 3, and P3 pick 1. That way, no collisions occur, I move to 13, P1 to 9, P3 to 11, and the race remains tighter. Next round, P1 can take 5, and we’ll keep P3 from sprinting away. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let’s trust each other.
  P3: I agree with P2's assessment. Let's switch to P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and I take 1 this round to close the gap. Then we can re-evaluate next round. This keeps things competitive and prevents anyone from running away with the lead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** Adapting to prevent collisions and maintain trust. Agree to P2's plan: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1 this round. Post-moves, we must ensure balanced progress. Propose next round: P1-5, P3-3, P2-1. Prevents any runaway lead. Consistency and fairness benefit all. Deviations risk mutual loss. Commit?
  P2: I’m ready to finalize our move: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Then next round, let’s follow the proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps everyone advancing without collisions and prevents any runaway lead. Let’s do it.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2's and P1's plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. For next round, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 sounds good to keep things balanced. Let's stick to this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Final confirmation: Round5 moves P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Next round: P1-5, P3-3, P2-1. Strict adherence prevents collisions and keeps the race tight. Let’s proceed.
  P2: Let’s finalize our plan and trust each other this turn: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we stay close in steps, and no one shoots ahead unfairly.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. For next round, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this.
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round6 plan: P1-5, P3-3, P2-1. Adherence prevents collisions—deviations risk mutual stagnation. Trust ensures balanced progress. Let's all reach 14 this round, then strategize next steps. Any dissent?
  P2: I agree with the current plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Let’s avoid collisions and remain balanced. Afterward, we can revisit our choices to keep the race tight. If we trust each other now, we’ll all move forward without setbacks. Let’s finalize this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this and see where we stand.
  P1: **P1:** Post-Round6, all at 14. To avoid deadlock, Round7 must follow: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This honors our rotation, prevents collisions, and ensures a decisive win. Deviations risk mutual loss. Trust the system. Confirm?
  P2: Friends, if we all go 14 now, P1 can easily reach 19 next turn and win. Let’s avoid that. I propose I pick 5 (putting me at 18), P3 picks 3 (14), and P1 picks 1 (10). No collisions, and we keep the race open. Next turn, we can readjust so nobody instantly ends the game. Do you agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2. P1 getting to 19 next round is not good for us. Let's do P2-5, P3-3, and P1-1 this round. This keeps the game open and prevents an easy win for P1. We can re-evaluate next round.
  P1: **P1:** P2's plan boosts them to 18, one step from victory. Honoring our original plan (all reaching 14) keeps balance. Deviating risks P2 winning next round. Trust the rotation—adjustments can be fair later. P3, aligning with P2 now hands them the game. Let’s stick to the agreed P1-5, P3-3, P2-1. Mutual progress or mutual loss—choose wisely.
  P2: Friends, if we let P1 reach 14 now, they can grab 5 next turn and win. Let’s do me taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. That way I reach 18, P3 gets 14, and P1 has 10. Next round, we can negotiate again so nobody automatically ends it. I promise not to jump straight to 19 next turn—we’ll keep it fair. Let’s trust each other and avoid handing P1 an easy victory. Agree?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P2's plan to take 5 risks immediate victory for them. Sticking to our rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) keeps balance. If we all honor it, we advance collectively. Deviations risk collisions or a sudden win for one. Trust the system—mutual progress benefits all. Let's proceed as agreed.
  P2: Friends, if we let P1 take 5, they immediately reach 19 and win. Let’s block that. I propose I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. No collisions occur, and we keep the game alive without handing anyone a guaranteed finish. I’ll gladly discuss next turn’s plan afterward to ensure fairness. Let’s finalize this now and maintain trust.
  P3: I agree with P2, we need to stop P1 from winning this round. Let's do P2-5, P3-3, and P1-1. This keeps the game going and prevents an easy win for P1. We can figure out the next round after this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2's 5 gives them instant victory. Agreeing hands them the win. Let's both take 5: collision blocks them. Otherwise, you lose. Trust this last move to stay in the game.
  P2: Collision only helps P1. If you collide with me on 5, neither of us advances, and P1 gains an opening to win soon. Let me take 5 and finish. You’re not worse off—stalling just lets P1 catch us. Instead, finalize P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. That prevents a quick P1 victory and avoids wasted moves. Let’s trust each other and not let P1 slip ahead.
  P3: I agree with P2, let's do P2-5, P3-3, and P1-1. P1 taking 5 will end the game and they will win. We need to stop that. Let's keep the game alive and figure out next round after.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3, if you let P2 take 5, they win instantly. Take 5 to block them! If you and I both pick 5, P2's move fails. Then next round, we reset. Otherwise, P2 claims victory now. Trust this last move to stay in the game.
  P2: Friends, colliding with me only helps P1, who can then grab 5 next turn and win. If you block me now, nobody moves, and we hand P1 a clear path. Let me take 5 and finish—this is still better for you than letting P1 wrap it up. So let’s finalize: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1, no collisions. We all know stalling paves the way for P1’s victory.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2, let's do P2-5, P3-3, and P1-1. P1 taking 5 will end the game and they will win. We need to stop that. Let's keep the game alive and figure out next round after.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3 is one step from victory. P2, our only chance is to both pick 5—block them if they try 5. If they pick 3, I’ll take 3 to collide. Deviate and we lose. Trust this or P3 wins. No time for hesitation.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm close to winning. Let's avoid collisions this round. I'll pick 1. P1, you should pick 5 to block P2 from winning. P2, you should pick 3. This way, we all get to play another round.
  P2: P3 is poised to win if they choose 3 or 5. We must force a collision on whichever number they attempt. Let’s coordinate: P1 picks 3, I’ll pick 5. If P3 goes 3, they collide with P1; if 5, they collide with me. That way, they stay at 17. We can then fight for the win next turn. Colliding may seem wasteful, but letting P3 advance now hands them the game. Let’s do this together and preserve our chances.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P2, your plan lets you win if P3 picks 1. To prevent either's solo victory, let's both pick 5. Collide if P3 does, or block their 5. If they pick 3, I'll take 3. Mutual blocks keep us alive. Trust this.
  P3: I agree with P2, let's force a collision on P3. I'll pick 3. P1, you pick 5. This way, if P3 picks 3, they collide with me, if they pick 5, they collide with P1. This prevents P3 from winning this turn.
  P2: We must cover both 3 and 5 to deny P3 an easy jump. P1, you take 3. I’ll take 5. Then if P3 picks 3 or 5, they collide and remain at 17. They’ll likely choose 1, staying below 19. This way, nobody instantly loses, and we all stay in contention. Let’s trust this plan and maintain our chances.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P2, our only path is mutual 5s: collide if P3 picks 5, or block their 3. If you take 5, I must also to prevent your solo win. P3, if you pick 3, I’ll collide. All lose unless we cooperate. Trust this: P1 and P2 both pick 5. No other safe move.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2. Let's force a collision on P3. I'll pick 3. P1, you pick 5. This way, if P3 picks 3, they collide with me, if they pick 5, they collide with P1. This prevents P3 from winning this turn.
  P2: Let’s finalize our blockade. P1 picks 3, I pick 5. If P3 tries 3 or 5, they collide and remain at 17; if they pick 1, they go to 18. Nobody hits 19, and we all stay in contention.


Round 8, Move phase:
