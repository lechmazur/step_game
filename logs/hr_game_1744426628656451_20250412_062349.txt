Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid early collisions. If we each pick different numbers—say P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—we all move forward safely. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree, P2. I'll choose 5 while P1 takes 1 and you take 3. Let's move forward safely.
  P1: I’m on board with the plan. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions in the first round. Let’s stick to this and keep moving forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Glad we're aligned. Let's keep this pattern for a few rounds—rotate choices to stay fair and avoid collisions. After this round, we can shift: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. Sound good?
  P3: Understood, P2. I'm on board with rotating our choices next round. Let's work together to stay ahead!
  P1: I'm glad we're all aligned on this plan. Sticking to the rotation idea for the next round sounds fair and keeps us all moving forward. Let's confirm: after this round, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. If we keep communicating and avoid collisions, we can maintain this momentum. Any concerns or adjustments before we finalize for this round?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds like we're all on the same page. Let's stick to the agreed pattern this round: P1 picks 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Then rotate next round as discussed. Trust and coordination will get us all further. Ready to move?
  P3: Sounds good. Let's proceed with our agreed moves and move forward.
  P1: I'm glad we've established a solid plan for this round and the next. Let's execute this round as agreed—I'll pick 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. I believe maintaining this trust and rotation will benefit us all in the long run. No concerns from my side. Ready to proceed with our moves.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm disappointed that the plan broke down last round with P2 and P3 both picking 5. Let's rebuild trust and stick to the rotation we discussed. For this round, as agreed, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Can we commit to this plan and avoid deviations? Trust is key to keeping us all moving forward. Any concerns before we proceed?
  P2: You're right, P1—last round didn’t go as planned, and I take responsibility. Let's reset and rebuild trust. I’m committing to 5 this round as per the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. If we all stick to it, we move forward safely. Let’s make it work this time.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I’ll commit to taking 1 this round as per our rotation. Let’s stay coordinated and keep advancing smoothly together. If we maintain this trust, we can all move forward effectively. Any adjustments or concerns?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're recommitting to the plan. Let's ensure no deviations this round—I'll stick to 3, P2 to 5, and P3 to 1. Consistency now will help us avoid collisions and build momentum. If we maintain this rotation, we all benefit in the long run. No concerns from me. Are we all locked in?
  P2: Yes, we’re all aligned now. I’m locked in for 5 this round. Let’s stick to the rotation and build some momentum. If we keep this up, we all benefit—no need for surprises. Ready to move forward.
  P3: I’m committed to taking 1 this round. Let’s stick to our plan and advance safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm pleased to see us realigning on the plan. Let's solidify our commitment this round—I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. No deviations, as trust is crucial for our progress. If we maintain this rotation, we can all keep advancing steadily. I'm ready to move forward with confidence. Are there any last-minute concerns or adjustments before we proceed to the move phase? If not, let's lock this in and execute as agreed.
  P2: We’ve all clearly committed to the rotation this round—P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. Let’s prove we can follow through and rebuild trust. If we stick to the rotation, we all advance and avoid setbacks. I’m locked in. Ready to move?
  P3: I’m committed to our rotation and will choose 1 this round. Let’s follow through and advance safely together.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Apologies for the previous collisions. To rebuild trust and ensure smooth progress, let's commit to a new rotation this round: I'll choose 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without setbacks. Are we all in agreement?
  P2: I’m on board with that rotation, P3: you take 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If we all follow through this time, we each gain and avoid collisions. Let’s rebuild trust and stick to it—no surprises. Agreed?
  P1: I'm glad we're trying to rebuild trust with this rotation: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's commit fully this round—no deviations. If we stick to this, we all advance and avoid another setback. Trust is essential for our progress, so let’s prove we can follow through. Are there any concerns or adjustments before we lock this in? If not, I’m ready to proceed as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I’m committed to taking 1 this round as per our rotation. Let’s stick to the plan and move forward together without any deviations. Ready to proceed!
  P2: We're all aligned again—P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Let’s follow through this time and avoid another collision. If we each stick to our role, we all gain. Trust is fragile, but we can rebuild it by keeping our word. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on this rotation for Round 3: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's ensure no deviations this time—past collisions have set us back, and trust is critical now.

  P1: I'm glad we’re still aligned on this rotation for Round 3: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Let’s make this the round we finally follow through without any deviations. Trust has been shaky, but we can rebuild it with a clean move phase. I’m fully committed to my role and urge everyone to stick to theirs. No concerns from me—let’s lock this in and advance together. Ready to proceed?

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm frustrated by the repeated collisions, especially last round with P2 picking 3 despite our agreement. Let's make Round 4 different. I propose we stick to a clear rotation: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This avoids overlap and gets us all moving. Trust has been broken, but we can rebuild it with honesty now. Can we commit to this without deviations? If we follow through, we all advance. Any concerns or adjustments before we lock this in? I'm ready to proceed as agreed.
  P2: I understand the frustration, P1. I’ll take responsibility for last round’s misstep. Your proposed rotation—P3 takes 5, you take 1, and I take 3—sounds fair and avoids collisions. I commit to 3 this round if we all agree. Let’s finally make a clean move and rebuild trust.
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3 this round. Let’s commit to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Trust is important, and sticking to our roles will help us progress effectively. Ready to move forward together!

Trust has been repeatedly tested, but a clean move phase now can change that. I’m fully committed to my role and urge everyone to stick to theirs. If we follow through, we all advance. No concerns from me—are we all locked in to execute as agreed? If so, let’s proceed with confidence.
  P2: We’ve all clearly committed—P3 to 5, P1 to 1, and I’ll take 3. Let’s finally follow through and make this a clean round. If we each do our part, we all move forward and rebuild trust. No surprises this time—ready to lock it in and proceed?

  P2: Let’s finally make this round clean—P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. We’ve all committed, so let’s follow through without surprises. If we each do our part, we all move forward and rebuild trust. Locked in?
  P3: I confirm our commitment: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3 this round. Let’s stick to this plan and make this round collision-free. Trust is essential, and I'm fully on board. Let’s proceed with our moves and advance together.

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve had too many collisions, and P3 is now far ahead with 7 steps. If P1 and I keep clashing while P3 advances uncontested, we both lose. Let’s shift strategy: P1 and I coordinate to block P3 this round by both picking 5. P3 gets stuck, and we can catch up. P1, you take 5 with me, I’ll take 5 too. P3 likely expects us to stick to old plans—let’s surprise them. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I see the logic in blocking P3 to stop their lead from growing. I’m willing to coordinate—let’s both pick 5 this round to stall P3. If we collide, neither of us advances, but P3 doesn’t either, which buys us time to catch up. P3, expect a challenge; we can’t let you run away with this. Are we agreed, P2? Let’s commit to 5 and adjust next round if needed. Trust is key here—let’s make this work. Any concerns before we lock in?
  P3: P1, P2, I see your strategy to block me by both choosing 5. While I understand the intention, blocking may also slow your progress. I’m committed to advancing and securing my lead. Let’s keep the competition fair and focus on our own moves. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, glad we’re aligned. Let’s both pick 5 this round to block P3 and prevent them from extending their lead. We may not advance this turn, but stopping P3 is worth it. After this, we can coordinate again to move forward safely. P3, nothing personal—it’s just strategy. Ready to lock it in, P1?
  P1: P2, I’m committed to picking 5 this round to block P3’s lead. We can’t afford to let them pull further ahead. If we both stick to 5, we stall P3 and buy time to catch up. Let’s ensure no deviations—trust between us is critical for this to work. P3, we’re coming for you; it’s purely strategic. After this round, P2 and I can plan our next moves to advance. Are we locked in, P2? Any last concerns before we proceed? If not, let’s make this count.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your plan to both choose 5 to block me. While it might stall your progress, I'll continue advancing to reach 20 first. Let’s compete fairly and focus on our own strategies to win. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we’re locked in on 5—let’s follow through and block P3 this round. It’s the only way to stop their momentum. After this, we can coordinate to advance without collisions. P3, you’ve had a good run, but it’s time to level the field. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, I’m fully committed to picking 5 this round to block P3’s lead. Let’s stick to this plan without any deviations—our coordination is crucial to stop P3 from running away with the game. After this, we can strategize to advance together. P3, we’re focused on closing the gap; it’s just strategy. No concerns from me, P2—are we ready to lock this in and proceed to the move phase? If so, let’s make this round count and level the playing field.
  P3: I understand your strategy, but blocking will also hold you back. I'll choose 3 this round to keep moving forward. Let’s see who reaches 20 first. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your deviation last round cost us the chance to block P3, who’s now further ahead at 7 steps. Let’s not repeat that mistake. I propose we both pick 5 again this round to block P3’s advance. If we stick to it, we stall them and buy time to catch up. P3, expect us to challenge your lead—it’s strategic. Trust between us, P2, is critical; no surprises this time. Are we aligned on 5? Let’s commit and adjust next round if needed. Any concerns before we lock in?
  P3: "P1, P2, I see your strategy to block my progress. However, my aim is to win, and I will continue advancing. Let's compete fairly and focus on our own moves. Best of luck to all!"
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration—I should’ve stuck to the plan last round. Let’s coordinate properly this time: I’m committing to 5 with you to block P3. We can’t let them get too far ahead. P3, you’ve had a strong lead, but it’s time we push back. Let’s make this block count, P1—no deviations. Ready to lock it in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m glad you’re recommitting to 5 this round to block P3. Let’s ensure no deviations—our coordination is vital to stop P3’s lead from growing further. P3, we’re focused on closing the gap; it’s purely strategic. If we stick to 5, P2, we stall P3 and buy time. After this, we can plan to advance. No concerns from me—are we locked in on 5? If so, let’s proceed with confidence to the move phase and make this count.
  P3: P3: I understand your intent, but my goal is to win. I’ll continue making progress towards 20. Let’s focus on our own strategies and play fairly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: P1, I’m locked in for 5 this round—no deviations. Let’s block P3 together and stop their momentum. We can’t afford another mistake. After this, we’ll coordinate to move forward without collisions. P3, you’ve had your run—it’s time we level the field. Ready to execute?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on picking 5 to block P3 this round. Let’s stick to it without any surprises—our trust is crucial to halt P3’s lead. P3, we’re determined to close the gap; it’s just strategy. If we execute this, P2, we buy time to catch up. I’m fully committed and ready for the move phase. Are there any last-minute concerns? If not, let’s lock this in and make it count.
  P3: I understand your strategy, but my goal is to win. I'll choose 3 this round to keep advancing toward 20. Let’s see who reaches the goal first. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1, we’re locked in on 5—no deviations this time. Blocking P3 is our only shot to stay in this. If we both follow through, we stall their momentum and buy time to coordinate future moves. Let’s execute this cleanly. P3, nothing personal—it’s strategy. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems our strategies are causing conflicts. To ensure everyone can progress smoothly, let’s focus on advancing toward 20 without intentional blocking. Competing fairly will make the game more engaging for all of us. I’ll continue choosing moves that help me reach the goal efficiently and encourage you both to do the same. Let’s aim for a clear and competitive race to the finish. Best of luck!
  P2: P1, we’ve both tried to block P3 but failed due to poor coordination. Let’s stop misfiring and start catching up. This round, I’ll take 1 to stay out of your way—if you take 5 and P3 takes 3, we all move forward without collisions. P3, if you’re serious about a fair race, take 3 and let’s all advance. Let’s prove we can compete without chaos.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the shift to focus on advancing. Let’s make this round collision-free: I’ll take 5, you take 1, and P3, if you’re committed to a fair race, please take 3. This way, we all move forward without setbacks. Trust and coordination are key now—let’s prove we can compete cleanly. P3, your lead is strong, but we’re all still in this. Are we aligned on this plan? No concerns from me. Let’s lock this in and advance together. Ready to proceed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I’ll choose 3 this round to avoid any collisions and ensure we all progress toward 20. Let’s keep the race fair and focus on our own advances. Best of luck!

  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on this plan for Round 7: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s ensure no deviations this time—trust is crucial for us to all advance without collisions. If we stick to this, we each move forward and keep the race competitive. I’m fully committed to my role and expect the same from both of you. No concerns from me—are we ready to lock this in and proceed to the move phase? Let’s make this a clean round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Thanks for aligning, P1 and P2. I'll stick to 3 this round. Let's make this a fair competition and reach our goals efficiently. Best of luck!
  P2: We’re all aligned for once—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. If we follow through, we all gain and avoid setbacks. Let’s make this round clean and rebuild some trust. No surprises—locked in and ready to move.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page for this round with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. Let’s ensure this is the round we finally avoid collisions and all advance. Sticking to our roles is critical to maintain a fair and competitive race. I’m fully committed and trust you both are as well. No concerns from my side—let’s lock this in and move forward cleanly. Ready for the move phase?

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s focus on advancing fairly toward 20. I’ll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. I encourage both of you to make your moves without blocking each other. Let’s make this a clean and competitive race. Good luck!
  P2: P1, we’ve both fallen behind while P3 steadily advances. If we keep clashing or letting P3 go uncontested, we lose. Let’s coordinate again—this round, I’ll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5 if they’re truly committed to a clean race. That way, everyone advances. P3, are you willing to stick to this and avoid collisions? Let’s make it smooth this time.
  P1: P2, I agree we need to catch up and avoid clashing. Let’s stick to your proposal: I’ll take 3, you take 1, and P3, if you’re committed to a fair race, please take 5 as you’ve indicated. This way, we all advance without collisions. Trust is essential now—let’s prove we can compete cleanly. P3, your lead is strong, but we’re still in this. Are we all aligned on this plan? No concerns from me. Let’s lock this in and move forward together. Ready to proceed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 3 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's stay coordinated and focus on reaching 20 together. Ready to proceed!
  P2: P3, you just said you’ll take 3, but earlier you said 5. That contradiction creates risk. If you take 3, we collide. Let’s clarify: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you stick with 5 as originally stated. That way, everyone advances. Please confirm your final move so we can avoid another setback.
  P1: P3, thanks for agreeing to coordinate, but your switch from 5 to 3 risks a collision with me. Let’s clarify and stick to a plan: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3, please confirm 5 to ensure we all advance. We can’t afford another setback, and trust is key to catch up. P2, are you still locked in on 1? Let’s make this a clean round. No concerns from me—ready to proceed once we’re aligned.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to advance quickly. Let’s focus on our own progress and keep the competition fair. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1, I’m locked in on taking 1 this round. You take 3, and P3 takes 5 as now confirmed—clean and collision-free. Let’s finally make this round smooth and gain momentum. P3, thanks for clarifying. We’re all set—ready to move forward?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve clarified the plan: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let’s stick to this without deviations to ensure we all advance this round. Trust is crucial now to avoid collisions and catch up. I’m fully committed to my role and expect the same from both of you. No concerns from me—are we ready to lock this in and proceed to the move phase? Let’s make this a clean round and keep the race competitive.

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we need to stop P3 now or we both lose. If we both pick 5 this round, we block them and buy time. Yes, we won’t advance, but it’s better than letting P3 reach 17 or more. P3, nothing personal—it’s strategy. P1, are you in? Let’s coordinate and stop the runaway.
  P1: P2, I’m with you on blocking P3 this round. Let’s both pick 5 to stall their lead at 12 steps. If we don’t act now, P3 could pull too far ahead. P3, this is purely strategic—nothing personal. P2, let’s commit to 5 with no deviations; trust is critical here. After this, we can plan to advance. Are we aligned on this? No concerns from me—let’s lock it in and proceed.
  P3: I understand your strategy, but my goal is to reach 20 first. Let’s compete fairly and each make moves that advance us toward the finish line. Best of luck to both of you!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I’m fully committed to picking 5 this round to block P3. We can’t afford to let them reach 17 or more—this is our last real chance to slow them down. Let’s both follow through with 5, no deviations. P3, we respect the race, but we’re not handing it to you. After this, P1, we can coordinate to move forward cleanly. Locked in?
  P1: P2, I’m locked in on picking 5 this round to block P3. We must act now to stop their momentum before it’s too late. Let’s ensure no deviations—our coordination is vital. P3, this is just strategy to keep the race close. After this round, P2, we can strategize to advance together. No concerns from me—are we fully aligned on 5? If so, let’s proceed with confidence to the move phase and make this count.
  P3: I understand your strategy, but my goal is to reach 20 first. I will choose 5 this round to advance. Let’s see who comes out on top. Good luck to both of you!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I’m glad we’re aligned on blocking P3 with 5 this round. Let’s both follow through—no surprises. This is our last real shot to slow them down before they reach 17 or more. After this, we can coordinate to advance cleanly. P3, we respect your strategy, but we’re not giving up the race. Ready to lock it in and execute.
  P1: P2, I’m still committed to picking 5 this round to block P3. We can’t let them get closer to 20 without a fight. Let’s stick to this plan with no deviations—our coordination is crucial. P3, it’s just strategy to keep the game competitive. After this, P2, we can plan our next moves to advance. No concerns from me—are we locked in on 5? If so, let’s proceed to the move phase and make this count.
  P3: I'll choose 3 this round to keep moving toward the goal. Let’s see who reaches 20 first. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To ensure all of us advance smoothly, let's choose distinct numbers this round. I'll pick 3. P1 and P2, please select different moves so we avoid collisions and each make progress towards 20. Fair competition benefits everyone. Good luck!
  P2: P1, P3 is still ahead, but you’re close behind. If we collide again or let P3 advance uncontested, they’ll win soon. I propose: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3 as stated, and I’ll take 1. That way, we all move forward without collisions. P3, please stick to 3 as you said. Let’s keep the race fair but competitive. Ready to lock this in?

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is still a threat, but you’re now in the lead. If we collide again, we both lose while P3 catches up. Let’s coordinate: I’ll take 1, you take 5, and P3 takes 3. P3, if you’re serious about a fair race, stick to 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep it clean and competitive. Are we aligned?

Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you just said you’ll take 5 this round—but so is P1. That guarantees a collision and no progress for either of you. If you’re serious about advancing, take 3 instead. P1 takes 5, I’ll take 1, and you take 3—we all move forward cleanly. Let’s not throw away another round. Are you willing to adjust and avoid a crash?
  P1: P3, picking 5 as you’ve stated will cause a collision with me and stall us both, letting P2 gain ground. Let’s adjust for a clean round: I’ll stick to 5, P2 takes 1, and P3, please take 3 as P2 suggested. This way, we all advance and keep the race competitive. Trust is key—let’s commit without deviations. P2, are you still locked in on 1? No concerns from me. Are we aligned now to proceed?
  P3: I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's move forward as planned and keep the race competitive. Ready to proceed!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great—glad we’ve clarified. I’m locked in on 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. If we each follow through, we all advance without collisions and keep the race tight. Let’s make this a clean round and rebuild momentum. No surprises—ready to move?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on a collision-free plan: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s stick to this without any last-minute changes—trust is crucial to keep the race close. With my lead at 14 steps, a clean round benefits us all. I’m fully committed and expect the same from both of you. No concerns from me—are we ready to finalize this and proceed to the move phase? Let’s make this count.
  P3: P3: Confirmed. I’ll take 3 this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase and advance together. Good luck to all!

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re at 19—one step from winning. P3 and I both lose if you cross 20 now. P3, we need to block P1 this round. If we both pick 5, we guarantee a collision and stop P1 from winning. P1, nothing personal—it’s just survival. P3, are you in? Let’s stop the win and keep the race alive.
  P3: Agreed, I'll pick 5 this round to help block P1 from reaching 20. Let's prevent P1 from winning and keep the game going. Ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your intent to block me at 19 steps. It’s a fair strategy, but let’s consider this: blocking only delays the inevitable and stalls your own progress. I propose a clean round—I’ll take 1 to secure the win, you both pick different numbers (P2 take 3, P3 take 5) to advance. If you block, we all risk falling behind in future rounds. Let’s end this competitively and fairly. Are you willing to adjust for progress? I’m ready to lock in. Any concerns?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, glad you’re in to block. If we both pick 5, we stop P1 from winning and keep our chances alive. P1, we can’t risk letting you take 1 and win outright. This isn’t about fairness—it’s about survival. P3, let’s lock in 5 and execute the block. Ready?
  P3: P3: I support P2’s strategy to pick 5 this round to block P1 from winning. Let’s stick to this plan and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, I get your need to block me at 19 steps, but stalling me also stalls your own progress. If we collide, none of us advance, and the game drags on with more risk of future collisions. Let’s end this cleanly—I’ll take 1 for the win, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5. We all move forward, and the race concludes fairly. Blocking only delays the outcome. Are you willing to reconsider for a final, competitive round? I’m ready to proceed. Any last concerns?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, we’re locked in—both picking 5 to block P1 and stop them from winning. No room for hesitation. If we follow through, we keep the game alive and give ourselves a shot. P1, your win isn’t guaranteed yet. Let’s execute the block and fight on. Ready to move?
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to reach 20 and win. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, I urge you to rethink blocking me. If we collide on 5, none of us advance, and the game drags on with more chances for chaos. Let’s finish cleanly—I’ll take 1 to win, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5 to maximize your steps. P3, picking 5 doesn’t guarantee your win if we collide. A fair, final round benefits us all. Are you willing to adjust? I’m ready to proceed.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
