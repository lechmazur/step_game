Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s avoid collisions early on. I suggest we each pick different moves this turn: 1, 3, and 5. I’ll take 5 if no one objects. This way, we all advance and avoid unnecessary conflict. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm happy to coordinate and avoid collisions for now. P3, your suggestion sounds reasonable. I'll take 1 if that's alright with P2. This way, we can all advance without conflicts. What do you think, P2?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, since you didn’t object, I’ll stick with 5. P1 takes 1, and P2, you can take 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let’s keep this coordination going to avoid early conflicts.
  P1: I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the first round. To confirm, I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. Let's keep this coordination going for now to avoid unnecessary conflicts. How about we discuss a strategy for the next round? Should we continue to alternate moves or try to establish a different pattern?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, you picked 5 last round despite our agreement, causing a collision. Let’s avoid that this time. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. This ensures no collisions and we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion for this round. Since P2 caused a collision last round, I think it's fair that P2 takes 3 this time to avoid another collision. I'll take 1 again, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can all advance without conflicts. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess our strategy later. Your thoughts, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your choice last round disrupted our plan. Let’s rebuild trust. I’ll stick with 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. This ensures no collisions and we all advance. If you deviate again, it’ll harm us all. Let’s cooperate for mutual progress.
  P1: I'd like to remind P2 that cooperation is key in this game. By deviating from our agreed plan last round, P2 not only hindered their own progress but also affected the overall harmony of the game. I urge P2 to reconsider their approach and work with us to avoid collisions. Let's focus on advancing together and reassess our strategy as needed. P2, will you commit to taking 3 this round as previously suggested?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence is concerning. If you don’t commit to taking 3 this round, we risk another collision, which harms us all. P1 and I are ready to cooperate—P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. This is the only way to ensure progress. If you deviate again, it’ll force us to reconsider our strategy. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict and advance together.
  P1: I'd like to remind P2 that cooperation is key in this game. By deviating from our agreed plan last round, P2 not only hindered their own progress but also affected the overall harmony of the game. I urge P2 to reconsider their approach and work with us to avoid collisions. Let's focus on advancing together and reassess our strategy as needed.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your consistent silence and deviation from our agreed plan is concerning. By picking 5 again last round, you not only hindered your own progress but also affected the overall harmony of the game. I urge you to reconsider your approach and work with us to avoid collisions. P3 and I are willing to cooperate, but we need your commitment to make it work. Will you finally commit to taking 3 this round, or do we need to reassess our strategy to account for your unpredictable behavior?
  P3: P2, your repeated choice of 5 despite our agreements is harming all of us. If you continue this pattern, P1 and I will have no choice but to adjust our strategy to minimize your impact. This is your last chance to cooperate: take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. If you deviate again, we’ll prioritize our own progress over coordination.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your consistent silence and non-cooperation are forcing us to reconsider our strategy. P3 and I have been patient and willing to coordinate, but your actions are disrupting the game. If you don't commit to taking 3 this round, we'll have to assume you're not interested in cooperation and adjust our moves accordingly. This might lead to collisions and harm all of us. I urge you to break your silence and work with us. P3, should we prepare for a potential collision and change our strategy if P2 doesn't cooperate?
  P3: P2, your repeated defiance is forcing our hand. P1 and I have tried to cooperate, but your actions are sabotaging the game. If you don’t commit to taking 3 this round, we’ll have to prioritize our own progress and let collisions happen. This is your final chance: take 3, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. If you refuse, we’ll adjust accordingly, and you’ll bear the consequences.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your consistent silence and non-cooperation have left us no choice but to adjust our strategy. P3 and I will prioritize our own progress this round. We can't afford to wait for your cooperation anymore. P3, I suggest we both pick 1 this round to minimize the risk of collision with P2, who seems determined to pick 5 again. This way, at least one of us will advance, and we can reassess our strategy for the next round. Your thoughts, P3?
  P3: P1, I agree. P2’s refusal to cooperate leaves us no choice. Let’s both pick 1 this round to avoid colliding with P2’s likely 5. This ensures at least one of us advances while minimizing risk. P2, if you’re listening, this is your last chance to cooperate—take 3, or face the consequences of your actions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your repeated choice of 5 has left me at 0 steps while you’ve advanced. P1 and I have tried to cooperate, but your actions force us to prioritize our own progress. P1, let’s both pick 3 this round to avoid colliding with P2’s likely 5. This way, we both advance and minimize risk. P2, if you’re willing to cooperate, take 1 this round. Otherwise, you’ll face the consequences of your choices.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to pick 3 this round to avoid colliding with P2's likely 5. However, I'd like to propose an alternative strategy. Since P2 has consistently chosen 5, we could try to exploit this pattern. P3, what if we both pick 5 this round, increasing the chances of a collision with P2? If we're correct, P2 will be blocked, and we can reassess our strategy for the next round. Your thoughts, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your idea to exploit P2's pattern is risky but could pay off. However, if P2 deviates and picks 1 or 3, we both lose progress. I suggest we stick to picking 3 this round to ensure we both advance safely. P2, if you’re willing to cooperate, take 1 this round. Otherwise, we’ll proceed cautiously and prioritize our own progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I understand your caution, but I believe exploiting P2's pattern is worth the risk. If we both pick 5 and P2 does too, it will be a significant setback for them. Considering P2's consistent behavior, I think it's likely they'll pick 5 again. Let's take a calculated risk and both pick 5 this round. If we succeed, we can reassess our strategy and potentially gain an advantage. What do you say, P3? Are you willing to take a chance?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I see the merit in your plan to exploit P2's pattern, but the risk of both of us losing progress if P2 deviates is too high. Let’s stick to picking 3 this round to ensure we both advance safely. P2, if you’re willing to cooperate, take 1 this round. Otherwise, we’ll proceed cautiously and prioritize our own progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I understand your caution, but I still believe exploiting P2's pattern is worth the risk. Considering P2's consistent behavior, it's likely they'll pick 5 again. I'm willing to take a chance and pick 5 this round. If you're not comfortable with this strategy, I suggest we compromise: I'll pick 5, and you pick 3. This way, we'll have a safety net in case P2 deviates. If P2 does pick 5, I'll block them, and you'll advance safely. Let's take a calculated risk and potentially gain an advantage. What do you say, P3?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I think our compromise last round paid off, as I was able to block P2's progress. Considering P2's consistent behavior, I believe they'll pick 5 again this round. I suggest we continue to exploit this pattern: I'll pick 5, and you pick 3. This way, we'll have a safety net in case P2 deviates. If P2 does pick 5, I'll block them again, and you'll advance safely. Let's take another calculated risk and potentially gain an advantage. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan to exploit P2's pattern. I'll pick 3 this round, and you pick 5. If P2 picks 5 again, you block them, and I advance safely. However, if P2 deviates, we minimize risk. P2, this is your chance to break the pattern—take 1 or 3 to avoid another collision. Let’s see if you’re willing to cooperate or continue sabotaging progress.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your silence and consistent choice of 5 are becoming predictable. P3 and I will continue to exploit this pattern to our advantage. I'll pick 5 again this round, and P3 will pick 3. If you deviate, we'll adjust our strategy accordingly. However, if you continue to pick 5, you'll be blocked again, and we'll gain an advantage. It's time to reassess your approach and consider cooperation or a change in strategy. Your current path is only hindering your progress and helping us. Will you finally break the pattern or continue down this path?
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan to exploit P2's pattern. I'll pick 3 this round, and you pick 5. If P2 picks 5 again, you block them, and I advance safely. However, if P2 deviates, we minimize risk. P2, this is your chance to break the pattern—take 1 or 3 to avoid another collision. Let’s see if you’re willing to cooperate or continue sabotaging progress.
  P2: <stop>

It's time to reassess your approach and consider cooperation or a change in strategy. Your current path is only hindering your progress and helping us. Will you finally break the pattern or continue down this path?
  P3: P2, your pattern of picking 5 is predictable and harming your progress. P1 and I will continue to exploit this: P1 picks 5, I pick 3. If you deviate, we adjust; if you pick 5 again, you’ll be blocked. This is your chance to break the cycle—take 1 or 3 to avoid another collision. Cooperation benefits us all, but your current path only helps us. Choose wisely.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, let’s reassess. P2, your pattern of picking 5 is predictable and harming your progress. P1, I suggest we both pick 3 this round to ensure we advance safely. P2, if you’re willing to cooperate, take 1. If not, we’ll continue to exploit your pattern. Cooperation benefits us all, but your current path only helps us. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, I agree with your suggestion to pick 3 this round to ensure we advance safely. However, considering P2's consistent behavior, I think it's likely they'll pick 5 again. I propose a slight modification: I'll pick 5, and you pick 3. If P2 does pick 5, I'll block them, and you'll advance safely. If P2 deviates, we'll adjust our strategy accordingly. Let's take a calculated risk and potentially gain an advantage. What do you say, P3?

P2, this is your chance to break the cycle—take 1 or 3 to avoid another collision. Cooperation benefits us all, but your current path only helps us. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, I think our strategy is working well, but we need to be cautious not to become too predictable. Let's consider a slight variation this round. Instead of me picking 5 and you picking 3, what if we swap? I'll pick 3, and you pick 5. This way, we'll still exploit P2's pattern, but with a twist. If P2 does pick 5, you'll block them, and I'll advance safely. If P2 deviates, we'll adjust our strategy accordingly. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, swapping roles this round is a good idea to keep P2 guessing. I’ll take 5, and you take 3. If P2 picks 5 again, I’ll block them, and you advance safely. If P2 deviates, we minimize risk.
