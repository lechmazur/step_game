Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, starting fresh here. How about we coordinate to avoid collisions? Maybe we can agree on different numbers for the first few rounds to ensure we all advance. Open to suggestions.
  P2: Let’s try a rotation plan so nobody collides. For Round 1, how about:
• P2 picks 5,
• P1 picks 1,
• P3 picks 3.
Next turn, we rotate who gets 5. Sound good?
  P1: Interesting plan, P2. To make it fair from the start, how about we rotate the initial assignment? Maybe P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 for this round? We can then rotate the '5' spot as you suggested in subsequent rounds. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I like your idea of rotating the initial assignment. It sounds fair. So for this round, P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. Then, next round, we'll rotate the '5' spot as P2 suggested. Let's aim to avoid collisions and all advance. Agreed?
  P2: Alright, I’m on board. Let’s do Round 1 as P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Next round, I’d like to take 5. Then we’ll keep rotating to avoid collisions.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for Round 1: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's stick to it and all get some points on the board. Ready for the move phase when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 1 went smoothly. Following the rotation principle and P2's request, the plan for Round 2 should be:
*   P2 takes 5 (as requested)
*   P1 takes 3 (rotating down from 5)
*   P3 takes 1 (rotating down from 3)

This ensures we all advance again. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: P1, your plan for Round 2 sounds good to me. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. Let's keep this rotation going to avoid any collisions. Agreed?
  P2: I’m fine with taking 5 this round to catch up. But looking ahead, I’m concerned that if P1 keeps getting 5 so often, they’ll sprint ahead. Let’s plan our next rotations so we don’t let any single person grab 5 more times than the others. I propose we make sure P1 doesn’t immediately get another 5 after this round, so the game stays even and nobody’s forced to collide. Sound fair?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, I understand your concern about keeping things relatively even. It's fair. Let's stick to the plan for this round (R2): P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.

I agree that P1 won't take 5 in the next round (Round 3). The rotation would then naturally give P3 the 5, P2 the 3, and P1 the 1. This keeps the cooperation going. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your point about keeping things balanced. Let's stick with the current plan for Round 2: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. For Round 3, I'll take 5, P2 can take 3, and P1 will take 1. This way, we all get a fair chance at the higher number and avoid collisions. Let’s keep it friendly and strategic. Agreed?
  P2: I’m ready to follow this plan for Round 2: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s keep our rotation going into Round 3 as agreed, with P3 getting 5, me taking 3, and P1 on 1. As long as we keep avoiding collisions, we all benefit. Let’s stick to it.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, Round 3. As we agreed last round, the plan is:
*   P3 takes 5
*   P2 takes 3
*   P1 takes 1

This keeps the cooperation going and avoids collisions. If we stick to this, we'll all be at 9 steps. Then for Round 4, the rotation continues: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's execute the plan for this round. Ready?
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for sticking to the plan so far. For Round 3, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all keep advancing without collisions. Let's keep it fair and strategic. As we move forward, let’s stay committed to our rotation plan to ensure everyone gets a chance to catch up. Looking forward to seeing us all at 9 steps after this round. Agreed?
  P2: Sounds good. I’m ready to pick 3 this round so we all reach 9 steps. Let’s stay true to our rotation—P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Then, for next round, we follow the agreed cycle to keep everything balanced and avoid collisions. Agreed? If you both are all set, I’m done here.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright everyone, Round 4. As per our agreed rotation, it's my turn for 5 points. The plan is:
*   P1 takes 5
*   P3 takes 3
*   P2 takes 1

This puts us at P1=14, P3=12, P2=10. Next round (Round 5), the rotation continues with P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Let's keep the cooperation going smoothly. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to the plan sounds good for Round 4: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward without any collisions. Let's make sure we continue this rotation to keep things fair and balanced. After this round, we can discuss if any adjustments are needed, but for now, I'm ready to follow through with this setup. Agreed?
  P2: I’m concerned that if P1 takes 5 now, they’ll jump ahead too easily. Let’s adjust Round 4 so I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, nobody sprints too far ahead. After this, we can return to the normal rotation and keep it fair. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we established the rotation specifically to ensure fairness over multiple rounds, and everyone agreed. You received 5 points in Round 2 based on this agreement. Now, the rotation fairly assigns 5 points to me. Changing the rules mid-game when it's my turn doesn't seem fair.

P3, you already agreed to the original plan for this round (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1). Let's stick to what we agreed upon to maintain our cooperation and the fairness mechanism we established.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but we've all agreed to this rotation to ensure fairness. Changing it now could disrupt our strategy and lead to unnecessary collisions. Let's stick to the plan for Round 4: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This keeps our cooperation intact and ensures everyone gets a fair chance at the higher numbers over time. After this round, we can reassess if needed, but for now, let's maintain our agreed rotation. Agreed?
  P2: I’m still uneasy about letting P1 jump ahead. We’re all tied, so giving P1 five more steps now means they’ll pull away. How about a slight adjustment: this round, I take 5, and then P1 can take 5 next round. That keeps us balanced overall, avoids collisions, and honors the spirit of our rotation. We can discuss further rotations afterward. Is that acceptable, or do you insist on P1 taking 5 right now?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you accepted the rotation when it gave you 5 points in Round 2. Now that it's my turn per the agreed sequence, you want to change it simply because it benefits me. That undermines the fairness we established.

P3 and I have already agreed twice this round to stick to the plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's honor the agreement we all made, which ensures predictable progress for everyone over time. Deviating now risks collisions and breaks the trust we've built. P3, are you still with the original plan (P3=3)?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about balance, but we've been following a fair rotation that we all agreed on. Changing it now could disrupt our progress and lead to distrust. Let's stick to the plan for Round 4: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This ensures we maintain our cooperation and everyone gets a fair chance at the higher numbers over time. After this round, we can discuss any adjustments if needed. Agreed?
  P2: I understand your positions, but I’m not backing down. Giving P1 five steps now just hands them the lead. If you both insist on P1 taking 5, I may choose it too, so we both lose out this turn and avoid letting P1 pull ahead. I’d rather find a fair compromise, but we can’t have P1 sprinting while we lag behind. Let’s balance our choices or risk a collision.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m willing to cooperate if we ensure no collisions. But if anyone aims for 5 this round, I might do the same, and we’ll both stall. Let’s keep it balanced: we can each choose different numbers and advance without giving any single player an outsized lead. What do you say?
  P1: P2, you took 5 last round against our agreement, putting yourself ahead. Now you threaten collisions again? That's not cooperation.

Since the rotation is broken, how about we try to rebalance? I propose P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 for this round. P3, you stuck to the plan last round, what do you think?
  P3: P1, I see your point about rebalancing after the last round's unexpected move. P2, I understand your concern about keeping things fair, but threatening collisions could backfire for all of us. Let's aim for a peaceful resolution. How about this for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1? This gives P1 a chance to catch up without anyone pulling too far ahead. Afterward, we can reevaluate our rotation plan to maintain balance. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Look, I won’t let P1 jump ahead uncontested. If P1 tries for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both gain nothing. P3, I’d rather avoid collisions with you. Let’s coordinate: P3 picks 3, I pick 5, P1 picks 1. That way, we all move forward, and no one races too far. If you want a different distribution, speak now, but let’s not sabotage each other with senseless collisions.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) puts you at 19 steps, which is far too close to winning and not balanced at all. Threatening collisions if I don't accept you getting to 19 is not cooperation.

P3, P2 reaching 19 is dangerous for both of us. Your earlier proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) results in scores 15, 17, 13. This keeps the game competitive and prevents P2 from running away with it. I support that plan. P2, why not agree to P3's compromise? P3, are you okay with P2 getting to 19?
  P3: P2, your proposal gives you a significant lead, which isn't balanced. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game fair for everyone. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains competitive balance and prevents anyone from getting too close to winning too quickly. P1 and P2, are you both willing to agree to this plan to ensure we all advance without unnecessary risks?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Fine. I’ll go along with that distribution this round—P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1—to avoid collisions. Let’s see how it plays out, and then we can talk again next turn if needed.
  P1: Okay, P2, glad we could find a compromise. P3, thanks for proposing it.

Let's lock in this plan for Round 5:
*   P1 takes 5
*   P2 takes 3
*   P3 takes 1

This keeps the game competitive. I'm ready to move based on this agreement.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate us finding a compromise for this round. Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. After this round, we can reassess the rotation to ensure fairness and balance moving forward. Let's maintain cooperation and focus on advancing without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, Round 6. P2, you're close to the finish line at 17. P1 is at 15, P3 is at 13.

P2, if you aim for 3 or 5, you risk collision, as P1 needs 5 to potentially win/tie, and P3 might also pick 5 to block you and catch up.

To avoid collisions and keep the game going fairly, I propose:
*   P3 takes 5 (to 18)
*   P1 takes 3 (to 18)
*   P2 takes 1 (to 18)

This way, we all advance, nobody wins yet, and we are all tied at 18 steps. It seems like the safest and fairest option for this critical round. What do you think?
  P2: If we all reach 18, next turn becomes a frantic scramble where anyone could collide. I prefer to keep my slight edge. If you insist on that plan, I might just pick 5 anyway, risking a collision. Let’s find a less drastic approach: for instance, P3 could take 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. That pushes us to 16 (P1), 18 (me), and 18 (P3), avoiding a triple tie and still no collisions. If you try forcing me into only 1 step, I’m prepared to block. Let’s cooperate without making next turn a complete coin toss.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high this round. P2, your suggestion of P3 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and you taking 3 seems reasonable. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game without making next round chaotic. I’m open to this plan if it keeps us moving forward strategically. Let's agree on this to maintain a fair and competitive game. Are you both on board?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggested plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) results in you reaching 20 points and winning the game immediately (17+3=20).

P3, you agreed to this plan where P2 wins? This is disadvantageous for both you and me. Was that an oversight?

Let's reconsider my initial proposal for this round: P1=3 (to 18), P2=1 (to 18), P3=5 (to 18). This puts us all at 18 points. It's the fairest way to proceed, keeps everyone in the game, and avoids collisions. P2, why not accept a level playing field at 18 instead of risking a collision by aiming for the win now?
  P2: I’m not letting myself be forced into picking 1 again. If you try to push me there, I might go for 5 instead and block anyone else’s attempt. Let’s settle on P3=5, P1=1, and I’ll pick 3—then nobody collides, and we all move safely. If you choose conflict, we might all stall. Let’s be smart about this.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep it fair and avoid collisions. P2's plan (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) gives P2 the win, which isn't balanced for P1 or me. Instead, let's consider P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5, putting us all at 18. This ensures a fair chance for everyone next round without immediate winners. P2, risking a collision doesn't benefit anyone. Can we agree on a plan that keeps us all competitive?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your plan where you pick 3 and win is obviously not acceptable to P3 or me. Your threat to pick 5 is also self-defeating, as P3 is planning to pick 5 based on our agreement. A P2=5, P3=5 collision gives you zero points. The only logical move for you, if you want to guarantee progress and avoid falling behind due to collision, is to accept 1 point. This leads to a fair tie at 18 for the final round.

P3, are we still agreed on P1=3, P3=5, P2=1?
  P2: I’m not just giving up my lead by taking 1. If we’re all tied at 18, the final round becomes a free-for-all. That’s too risky for me. I’ll only consider taking 1 if we create a solid plan ensuring I get 5 next round. Otherwise, I may choose 3 or 5 here, risking collisions but at least not handing you two an easy path. Let’s work out a real deal instead of forcing me to 1.
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitance, but your current plan results in you winning, which isn't fair to P1 or me. Let's avoid collisions and ensure a competitive game. I propose: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, so we all end at 18. This keeps the game fair and gives us all a chance in the final round. If we agree, we can discuss a plan for the next round to ensure fairness. Let's keep it strategic and balanced. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, we're all tied at 18, so the next move is crucial. To avoid collisions and ensure a fair shot for everyone, let's agree on a plan. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This keeps us all in the game and gives everyone a chance to win in the final round. If we don't agree, we risk collisions and nobody advances. Let's keep it strategic and fair. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) makes P2 win the game immediately with 23 points. Why would you propose a plan where you lose (21 points) and I lose (19 points)?

Let's consider a different plan:
*   P3 takes 5 (to 23)
*   P1 takes 3 (to 21)
*   P2 takes 1 (to 19)

This avoids collision. P3 wins, which is better for you than your plan. P2, taking 1 guarantees you advance and don't collide. This seems more logical than handing P2 the win. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m not letting anyone take 5 uncontested. If you try, I’ll also pick 5 and we both stall. Let’s avoid collisions. I propose this for Round 7: I pick 3, you two pick 1 each. That moves me to 21, keeps you at 19, and ensures none of us collide. Next round, I’ll work with you on a fair distribution. But if you insist on grabbing 5 or forcing me into 1 here, I’ll block you. Let’s be sensible and advance without sabotaging ourselves. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal (P2=3, P1=1, P3=1) heavily favors you. If we all pick 1, we stall. To avoid collisions and ensure a fair chance, consider this: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. This gives me the win, but it's more balanced than you winning outright. If we can't agree, we risk all stalling and losing. Let's avoid sabotage and make a strategic choice. P1, are you open to this plan to prevent P2 from winning immediately?
  P1: P2, your threat to play 5 if anyone else does is risky. If P3 plays 5 (as they proposed), you both collide and get 0. Is that better than securing points?
P3, your plan relies on P2 taking 1, which they refuse, making it unlikely.

Let's reconsider a plan that avoids collision: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
This results in scores: P1=23, P2=21, P3=19. I win.
P2, this guarantees you 3 points and avoids collision, which is better than 0 points. P3, this prevents P2 from winning, which aligns with your stated goal. It's a way forward.
  P2: I won’t let either of you grab 5 uncontested. If you try, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both get nothing. That ruins everyone’s turn. Let’s avoid collisions. The simplest fair move is: I pick 3, you both pick 1. Then I reach 21, you stay at 19, and nobody stalls. Next round, I’m willing to discuss a balanced plan so we all have a shot. If you insist on jumping straight to 23, I’ll block it, and we’ll get stuck at 18. Let’s be sensible and keep our chances alive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all at 18, so let's aim for a fair ending. P2, your plan to take 3 and have us take 1 leaves you with the lead, which isn't balanced. To avoid collisions and ensure a fair shot for everyone, I propose: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, I win, but it prevents P2 from winning outright. P1, this prevents P2 from gaining an advantage over you. Let's agree to this plan to keep the game competitive and avoid stalling. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your threat to play 5 is illogical. A collision gives you 0 points and likely lets P3 win by picking 3. Playing 3 gives you 21 points. Playing 1 gives you 19. Surely 21 or 19 is better than 0?

P3, P2 seems determined not to play 1, making your plan (P3=5) risky as P2 might collide with 5. P2's plan (P2=3, P1=1, P3=1) lets P2 win.

Consider my plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
Scores: P1=23 (Win), P2=21, P3=19.
This avoids collision if P2 acts rationally (takes 3 instead of 0). It prevents P2 from winning, P3. Let's lock this in.
  P2: I won’t let anyone else take 5 unchallenged. If you try, I’ll pick 5 too, so both of us stall. The simplest way forward is I choose 3, and each of you takes 1. That makes our scores: P2=21, P1=19, P3=19. Next round, we can negotiate again. If you push for 5 now, you risk us all colliding and nobody advancing. Let’s stay rational and avoid sabotaging ourselves.


Round 7, Move phase:
