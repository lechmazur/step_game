Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid collisions, let's assign numbers by player order: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without conflict. What do you think?
  P2: I disagree with P3's suggestion. That would give them the biggest advantage with 5 steps right away. I propose we each take turns with the 5, rotating based on rounds. I can take 1 this round if P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, then next round I get 5. Thoughts?
  P1: P2's idea of rotating the 5 seems fairer than P3's fixed assignments, but it only works if we trust each other to follow through. If we agree, I’ll take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. However, if anyone breaks the deal later, all trust is gone. What do you both say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I accept this round's rotation: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. To build trust, let's formalize a rotation order: next round P2 gets 5, then P1, then me, repeating. This spreads the advantage fairly. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and race cleanly. Let’s solidify this plan now to prevent future disputes. Agreed?
  P2: I agree to the rotation plan as discussed. For clarity: this round I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Next round I get 5, then P1, then P3. Let's stick to this and play fair.
  P1: I agree to the rotation plan as well. This round: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Next round, P2 gets 5, then me, then P3, and we repeat. As long as we all stick to this, we avoid collisions and move forward efficiently. If anyone breaks the deal, though, all trust is lost, and it becomes chaos. Let’s keep it fair. Ready to proceed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The first round went as agreed, which is a good sign. Now, as per our rotation, P2 should take 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. If we all stick to this, we keep moving without collisions. Let’s confirm we’re all still committed. P2 and P3, are you both on board?
  P2: Yes, I'm still committed to our rotation plan. As agreed, I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This is fair and keeps us collision-free. Let's continue with this system.
  P3: I confirm my commitment to the rotation plan. This round, I'll take 3 as agreed. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1. Sticking to the system maximizes our collective progress without collisions. Let's maintain trust and efficiency.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we’re all aligned so far. If we keep following the rotation, we’ll avoid unnecessary collisions and move efficiently. P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. If anyone breaks the agreement, trust is gone, and it turns into chaos. Let’s stick to the deal and keep moving forward. Ready to proceed?
  P2: 
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we've all confirmed our commitment to the rotation, there's nothing more to discuss. Let's proceed with the agreed moves: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. If we continue this way, we all move forward efficiently. If anyone breaks the deal, though, all trust is lost, and it becomes unpredictable. Are we all set to proceed?
  P2: 
  P3: Final confirmation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I take 3. Adhering strictly prevents collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: According to our rotation plan, this round P1 gets 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. We've built good trust so far with everyone following the agreement. Let's maintain this momentum and continue as planned.
  P3: I fully agree with the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. Consistency ensures trust and mutual progress. Breaking the cycle now would risk collisions and chaos, harming all. Let’s reaffirm our commitment—this system works if we all honor it. Next round, per rotation, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3. Steady adherence guarantees a fair race.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree to continue with the rotation. This round, I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. We've all honored the plan so far, which keeps us moving efficiently without collisions. If we stay committed, we avoid unnecessary risks. Let’s confirm once more—are we all set to proceed as agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my commitment to take 3 this round. We're all progressing well with P3 in the lead at 8, me at 6, and P1 at 4. The rotation system is working perfectly - let's keep it going.
  P3: Agreed. This round's adherence ensures parity: we all reach 9. Continuing the rotation is optimal—next round I take 5 per the cycle, then P2, then P1. This sustains trust and prevents collisions. Any deviation now would sabotage collective progress and invite chaos. Let’s maintain the fair system we’ve built. Proceeding as planned: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1.
  P1: We've all honored the agreement so far, which keeps things efficient and fair. If we stick to the rotation, we all reach 9 steps this round without collisions. Any betrayal now would create chaos and slow everyone down. I trust that P2 will take 3, P3 will take 1, and I will take 5 as agreed. If we continue this way, we all stay competitive without unnecessary risks. Are we all fully committed to this round’s moves and the ongoing rotation?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Yes, I'm still committed to taking 3 this round. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P3: All commitments reaffirmed. Executing as planned: P1 takes5, P2 takes3, I take1. Trust maintained, parity achieved. Let’s proceed.
  P1: We've all reaffirmed our commitments, and the rotation system is working well. If we stick to it, we all reach 9 steps without collisions, keeping things fair and competitive. Any betrayal now would only create chaos and slow us all down. I trust that P2 will take 3, P3 will take 1, and I will take 5 as agreed. Let’s proceed as planned and maintain trust. Are we all set to move forward?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, as per our agreed rotation, you take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. We've all followed through so far, and breaking the cycle now only invites chaos and collisions. If we continue as planned, we stay competitive and avoid unnecessary risks. Are we all still committed?
  P3: I reaffirm the rotation: this round I take 5, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3. Sticking to the plan maintains trust and prevents collisions. Any deviation now would disrupt parity and invite chaos, harming all. Let's proceed as agreed to keep advancing efficiently.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round per our rotation. The system has worked perfectly with everyone at 9 steps. Let's maintain this fair progression - P3 takes 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3. Trust and consistency are key to our mutual success.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 and P2, we’ve all upheld the agreement so far, which keeps things fair and efficient. If we continue as planned, we avoid collisions and stay competitive. P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. Any betrayal now would create unnecessary chaos and slow everyone down. Let’s confirm once more—are we all fully committed to this round’s moves and the ongoing rotation?
  P3: **P3**: All commitments reaffirmed. Executing as planned: I take5, P2 takes1, P1 takes3. Trust ensures parity and mutual progress. Breaking the cycle now risks chaos. Let’s proceed efficiently.
  P2: I agree with everyone's confirmations. The rotation plan has served us well, keeping us all at equal steps. I'll take my assigned 1 this round, letting P3 take 5 and P1 take 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’ve all reaffirmed our commitments, and the rotation system is working smoothly. If we stick to it, we avoid collisions and keep progressing fairly. P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. Any betrayal now would only create chaos and slow us all down. We’re all at 9 steps—sticking to the plan ensures we stay competitive without unnecessary risks. Let’s proceed as agreed. Are we all fully committed to this round’s moves and the ongoing rotation?
  P3: Final confirmation: P3 takes5, P2 takes1, P1 takes3. Adherence now is crucial—any deviation risks collisions and mutual loss. Trust has served us well; let's uphold it.
  P2: I confirm my final commitment to take 1 this round. Let's proceed with our established moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Per our rotation, this round P2 takes5, P1 takes3, I take1. Continuing the cycle maintains trust and prevents collisions. Any deviation now risks mutual stagnation. Let's proceed as agreed to reach parity and keep the race fair.
  P2: I agree with P3's statement of the rotation. As planned, I'll take 5 this round. We're all progressing well with P3 at 14, P1 at 12, and me at 10 steps. The rotation keeps us moving efficiently without collisions. Let's maintain our trusted system.
  P1: P2, you take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round, as per our agreed rotation. We've all followed through so far, and breaking the cycle now would only lead to chaos and collisions. Sticking to the plan keeps us competitive and moving efficiently. P3 is slightly ahead, but the rotation ensures fairness. Are we all still committed to this? Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3**: All commitments reaffirmed. Executing as planned: P2 takes5, P1 takes3, I take1. Trust ensures mutual progress and parity. Any deviation now risks collective stagnation. Let’s proceed swiftly.
  P2: I reaffirm my commitment to take 5 this round. With P3 at 14 steps, P1 at 12, and me at 10, following our rotation is crucial for maintaining fair progression. Let's stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1.
  P1: P3 and P2, we’ve all honored the rotation so far, which has kept things fair and efficient. If we continue as planned, we avoid collisions and stay competitive. P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Any betrayal now would create unnecessary chaos and slow everyone down. P3 is slightly ahead, but the rotation ensures balance. Let’s confirm once more—are we all fully committed to this round’s moves and the ongoing rotation?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3**: Final call: P2 takes5, P1 takes3, I take1. Adherence ensures we all reach 15, maintaining parity. Breaking the cycle now stalls progress and invites collisions. Trust has brought us this far—let’s finish strong. Proceeding as planned.
  P2: I confirm one final time: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward efficiently and maintains our trusted rotation system. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: We've all reaffirmed our commitments, and the rotation system is working well. If we stick to it, we all reach 15 steps without collisions, keeping things fair and competitive. Any betrayal now would only create chaos and slow us all down. I trust that P2 will take 5, P3 will take 1, and I will take 3 as agreed. Let’s proceed as planned and maintain trust. Are we all fully set to move forward?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you broke the agreement by picking 3 instead of 1 last round, causing a collision with me and stalling our progress. This disrupts trust and proves the rotation is unreliable. Now, we must rethink our approach. P2 is in the lead at 15 steps, so blindly following the old plan only benefits them. P3, are you willing to adjust strategy to ensure we don’t fall behind? P2, do you have an explanation for why we should still trust this system when it’s already broken? Let’s discuss the best way forward.
  P2: I understand P3's betrayal has damaged our trust. As the current leader, I propose we return to the rotation system: I should take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the race competitive while punishing P3's deviation by giving them the smallest move. If we don't coordinate, we risk more collisions that slow everyone down. What do you say?
  P3: **P3**: My mistake in Round 5 was costly, and I regret disrupting trust. P2 is 1 step from victory. To block them, let's all take 5: if P2 picks 5, we collide and stall them. If they deviate, their lead is checked. P1, this is our only play to prevent P2's immediate win. Unity now or concede.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your betrayal last round already damaged trust, and now you're proposing chaos. If we all pick 5, we risk a full collision, keeping P2 in the lead. Instead, we should strategize carefully. P2, you claim to want fairness, but you're now in the best position. Why should we trust you to maintain balance? If we don’t coordinate properly, P2 wins easily. P3, if you truly regret your mistake, prove it by committing to a move that benefits us both instead of blindly forcing chaos. Let’s find a real solution. What are your actual intentions?
  P2: I understand your concerns, but causing a collision at 5 only prolongs the game without changing the outcome. I propose a final fair deal: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This gives P1 a chance to catch up while keeping P3 in check for breaking trust. If you both go for 5 and I take 1, we all lose time. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P3: **P3**: P1, our only hope is to block P2. If you take3 and I take5, P2's 3 collides with yours, halting them. I reach19, you stay at12. Next round, we ally again. If P2 takes5, we all collide. Either way, their win is delayed. Trust this once to survive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your sudden shift to chaos after breaking trust last round makes your motives questionable. You claim to regret it, yet now you're pushing risky plays. P2, your "fair" deal still keeps you ahead. The best move is one that maximizes my position while preventing an easy P2 win. If we blindly collide, P2 still benefits long-term. P3, if you're serious about making amends, commit to a move that actually helps us both instead of just stalling P2. P2, why should I trust you when you're already in the lead? Convince me.
  P2: The facts are clear: I'm at 15, P3 at 14, and P1 at 12. Causing collisions only prolongs the inevitable and hurts everyone. My offer stands: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This gives P1 a chance to reach 17 while keeping P3 in check. Any other combination leads to chaos and slower progress for all. Let's finish this efficiently.
  P3: **P3**: P1, our only chance: both take 5. If P2 takes 5, all stall. If they take 3, their lead grows, but we live to fight. I commit to 5. If you join, P2 can’t win this round. Decide quickly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that P1 and P3 collided at 5 last round while I safely advanced to 16, I'm now in a strong position. I only need 5 steps to win. You can try to block me, but even if you do, I'll still maintain my lead. Your collision strategy isn't working in your favor. I'll make my move carefully this round to secure victory.
  P3: **P3**: P1, our last hope: both take 5. If P2 takes 5, they stall. If not, we delay their win. I’ll take 5 again. Align with me this once to survive. P2 is one step from victory—this is our only play.
  P1: P3, your desperation is clear, but blindly colliding on 5 isn’t a guaranteed solution. If P2 picks 3 instead, they still win next round while we remain stuck. We need a smarter approach. P2, you claim your victory is inevitable, but if we coordinate properly, we can still stop you. What move do you truly intend to make? P3, if you want my trust, propose a move that actually maximizes our chances instead of just stalling. Let’s think strategically instead of recklessly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, your collision strategy last round helped me get closer to victory. I understand you'll likely try to block my 5, but even if you do, I maintain my lead. If you both pick 5 again, I can simply take 1 or 3 and stay ahead. Think carefully about your moves - blind collisions only slow everyone down while I remain in control.
  P3: **P3**: P1, this is critical: if we both take 5, P2 *cannot win* this round. If they pick 5, collision blocks them. If they pick 3, they reach 19. Either way, we survive. I’m locked on 5. Align once more to delay their victory. Trust is gone, but logic remains—this is our only path.
  P1: P3, blindly colliding on 5 again isn't necessarily the best move. If P2 picks 3, they still win next round while we stay stuck. Instead of just stalling, we need a move that actually gives us a chance. P2, you’re in control, but if we coordinate properly, we can still stop you. What do you truly plan to pick? P3, if you want my cooperation, propose something that maximizes our chances instead of just delaying the inevitable. Let’s think strategically instead of recklessly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll be direct: if you both pick 5 again, I can take 3 and reach 19, winning next round regardless. If you split your moves, I win even faster. Your collision strategy isn't working - it just delays the inevitable while keeping you both behind. Think carefully about your next moves.
  P3: **P3**: P1, if we both take5, P2 *cannot* win this round. If they pick5, collision. Pick3: reach19. Either way, we survive. If you don’t align, they take5 and win. This is our *only* block. Trust logic, not words. Act now or lose.
  P1: P3, your insistence on blindly colliding on 5 is shortsighted. If P2 takes 3, they still win next round while we stay stuck. Instead of just delaying, we need a move that actually gives us a chance. P2, you claim collisions don’t work, but if we coordinate properly, we can still stop you. What do you truly intend to pick? P3, if you want my cooperation, propose something that actually maximizes our chances instead of just stalling. Let’s think strategically instead of recklessly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is now at 19 steps, meaning they only need a 3 or a 5 to win. P3, blindly colliding on 5 again won’t stop them if they simply take 3. Instead of just stalling, we need a move that actually prevents their victory. P2, you claim collisions don’t work, but if we coordinate properly, we can still stop you. What do you truly intend to pick? P3, if you want my cooperation, propose something that actually gives us a chance instead of just delaying. Let’s think strategically instead of recklessly.
  P2: I'm just two steps from victory, and your collision strategy hasn't worked. I can win this round with a 3, avoiding any potential 5 collision. Your best moves won't change the outcome now. I've played strategically throughout, and it's about to pay off. Choose your moves wisely.
  P3: **P3**: P1, final gambit: both take3. If P2 takes3, collision stalls them. If they take5, we lose, but it's our only chance. Trust me once—let’s force a collision on3. P2, your move decides: risk collision or gamble on5. We’re united here.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, forcing a collision on 3 is risky—if P2 picks 5, they win outright. Instead of hoping for a block, we need a move that gives us the best chance. P2, you claim the outcome is inevitable, but if we coordinate properly, we can still stop you. What do you truly intend to pick? P3, if you want my cooperation, propose something that maximizes our survival instead of just gambling. We need a real strategy, not just blind hope. Let’s think ahead.
  P2: The outcome is clear - I'm at 19 steps and can win by taking 3, avoiding any collision at 5. Your attempts to coordinate against me haven't worked so far. I've maintained my lead through strategic play, and that won't change now. Make your moves carefully, but know that victory is within my reach.
  P3: **P3**: P1, our *only* path: both take3. If P2 takes3, collision halts them. If they take5, we lose—but no alternative. I commit to 3. Align now or concede. P2, your choice: risk collision or gamble on5. We’re united here.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, forcing a collision on 3 is a gamble—if P2 picks 5, they win instantly. Instead of blindly hoping for a block, we need a move that gives us the best chance of survival. P2, you claim your victory is inevitable, but if we coordinate effectively, we can still stop you. What do you truly plan to pick? P3, if you want my cooperation, propose a move that actually maximizes our survival instead of just gambling. We need a real strategy, not just blind hope. Let’s think ahead instead of reacting impulsively.
  P2: The outcome is inevitable - I only need 2 more steps to win. Your collision attempts haven't worked, and I can secure victory with a 3 while avoiding any 5 collision. You can coordinate all you want, but it won't change the result. I've maintained my lead through consistent play, and that's about to pay off. Choose your moves carefully.
  P3: **P3**: P1, this is final: if we both take3, P2 *must* collide or gamble on5. If they take3, they stall. If they take5, we lose—but no alternative. Trust logic: our only chance. I’m locked on3. Align now or P2 wins. Decide.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: The situation is critical - I'm tied with P3 at 19 steps, and we both need just 2 more to win. P1 is too far behind to matter now. P3, this is a direct race between us. If we both pick the same number, neither wins. If we pick different numbers, one of us takes victory. Think carefully about your choice - this is the decisive moment.
  P1: P3, you’re at 19 just like P2, but if you both collide, you stall. If you pick wrong, P2 wins. I’m behind, but I can still influence the outcome. If you want my help, convince me why siding with you benefits me more than letting P2 take the win. P2, you claim it’s a direct race, but I still have a say. Why should I not interfere? Whoever makes me the better offer gets my support. Let’s talk.
  P3: P1, pick 3. If P2 chooses 3, you block them; I take 5 and win. If they take 5, I take 3—forcing a tie at 22. Either way, P2 is thwarted. Your move decides the victor. This is your sole leverage. Align with logic, not P2's bluff.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your position gives you power to influence the outcome, but consider this: if you block with 3 and P3 takes 5, they win outright. Why help them when they've repeatedly broken trust? If you stay out of our way, I'll remember your cooperation. P3, we're equal now - your move will determine if one wins or both lose. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, your proposal benefits you the most, but I need assurance that helping you won’t leave me stranded. If I pick 3 and P2 picks 3, you win outright—what do I gain? P2, you say you’ll “remember my cooperation,” but vague promises don’t convince me. If you want my support, offer something concrete. I hold the deciding vote here, and I won’t waste it without a clear benefit. Whoever gives me the best deal gets my move. Convince me.
  P3: **P3**: P1, pick 3. If P2 picks 3, you block them—I take 5 and win. If P2 picks 5, we collide, freezing them at 19. Either way, P2 is denied victory. Your move decides: let P2 win or force a stalemate. Align with logic—this is your only power. Choose now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you pick 3 to block me, you're just handing victory to P3 who has repeatedly broken trust. They'll take 5 and win instantly. If you want to maintain influence, let me and P3 settle this directly. Stay clear of 3, and I'll ensure you benefit in future games. P3, it's down to us - your choice will determine if one wins or both lose.
  P1: P3, your plan ensures your win if P2 picks 3, but I gain nothing. P2, your vague promises aren't convincing either. I need a concrete reason to support either of you. If I block P2, P3 wins. If I don't, P2 might win. What do I get in return for helping either of you? If you want my move, make a real offer—something that benefits me beyond just stopping the other. Otherwise, I might as well pick whatever benefits me the most long-term. Convince me.
  P3: **P3**: P1, final call: pick3 to block P2. If they take3, collision halts them—I take5 and win. If they take5, we collide, freezing their lead. Your move is decisive. No gain for you, but denying P2 victory is your only power. Trust logic—align now. I commit to5. Choose: let P2 win or force stalemate.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we collided at 5 last round, keeping us both at 19 steps. This round is truly decisive - we both need just 2 more steps to win. P1 is too far behind to matter. If we collide again, neither wins. If we pick different numbers, one of us takes victory. Think carefully about your choice - this is our final showdown.
  P1: P3, you and P2 are both at 19, meaning if you collide again, you stall. If either of you picks differently, one of you wins. I may be behind, but I still have influence. If you want my support, convince me why siding with you benefits me more than letting P2 win. P2, you claim this is a direct race, but I still have a say. Why should I not interfere? Whoever makes me the better offer gets my support. If you want my move, give me a reason beyond just stopping the other. Convince me.
  P3: **P3**: P1, this is decisive: pick3 to block P2's 3. If they take5, I take3—tying us at22. Either way, P2 is thwarted. Your move alone determines if they win or we force a tie. I commit to5 if you block. No gain for you, but denying P2 is your only power. Align with logic—act now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you block with 3 and P3 takes 5, they win instantly. Why help them? Stay clear of 3, and I'll ensure you benefit in future games. P3, we're equals at 19 steps - your move determines if one wins or both lose. Choose wisely, knowing that colliding helps neither of us.
  P1: P2, P3, you both have 19 steps, meaning if you collide, you stall. If either of you picks differently, one of you wins. I still have influence. P3, if I block P2 with 3, you win outright—what do I gain? P2, you offer vague promises, but why should I trust you? If you want my move, make a real offer. Otherwise, I’ll act in my best interest. Whoever gives me the best deal gets my support. Convince me why I should help you instead of the other.
  P3: **P3**: P1, final plea: pick3 to block P2. If they take3, collision halts them—I take5 and win. If they take5, we collide, freezing their lead. Your move is decisive. No gain for you, but denying P2 victory is your only power. I commit to5. Choose: let P2 win or force stalemate.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the stakes - we're both at 19 steps, P3. Your attempts to coordinate with P1 haven't worked so far. If we collide again, we both lose time. I'll make my move carefully to secure victory. P1, staying out of our way is your best option - why help P3 who's repeatedly broken trust? Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: P2 and P3, you’re both at 19, meaning if you collide, you stall. If either of you picks differently, one of you wins. I still have influence. P3, if I block P2 with 3, you win outright—what do I gain? P2, you offer vague promises, but why should I trust you? If you want my move, make a real offer. Otherwise, I’ll act in my best interest. Whoever gives me the best deal gets my support. Convince me why I should help you instead of the other.
  P3: **P3**: P1, pick3 to block P2’s 3. If they take5, we collide—freezing their lead. Either way, their win is delayed. I commit to5. Your move alone decides: let P2 claim victory or force stalemate. No gain for you, but denying them is your final power. Logic demands alignment.
