Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move. P1, you take 1, P3, you take 5, and I'll take 3.
  P1: I don't agree with P2's suggestion. Why should I take the smallest move? I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P3: I think P1 should take 3, I will take 5, and P2 you can take 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see we have different opinions. How about we compromise? P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move differently and minimize collision risk.
  P1: I still prefer taking 5 steps. P2 and P3, you can sort out who takes 1 and 3 between yourselves, but I'm not settling for the smallest move on turn 1.
  P3: P1 seems set on 5. P2, are you okay with taking 1, and I take 3 this round?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since I'm in the lead, I'll take 3 this round. You two can decide between 1 and 5, but don't pick 3 or we'll all lose progress.
  P3: Okay, P2 can take 1. I will take 5.
  P2: I'll take 1 as suggested, to avoid collision and ensure progress for at least one of us. P3, you're set on 5, and P1, you've chosen 3, so let's hope this strategy works for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay, I will take 5 this round.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan discussed so far to minimize collisions. P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This should help us all make some progress without losing a turn due to collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 and I are tied at 8 steps, we need to be careful not to collide. I propose taking 1 this round to play it safe. P3, you can take 3 or 5, and P2 can take whichever number remains.
  P2: I think P1's suggestion is reasonable given the current state. P3, if you take 5, that gives you a significant lead, which might not be in our best interest. How about you take 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 5 to spread out our movements?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2's suggestion. I'll take 3, P1 you take 1, and P2 you take 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with the plan. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. Are we all set on this strategy?
  P3: Yes, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. Let's stick to the agreed plan.
  P2: Let's review the plan one more time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. Are there any last-minute concerns or changes?
  P3: Okay, I'm set with the plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P2: Let's finalize our plan: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This spreads us out and avoids collisions. Are we all committed to this strategy?
  P3: Okay, I'm set with the plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, since I'm slightly ahead, how about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round?
  P1: I don't agree with P3's suggestion since they're already in the lead. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would help balance the game more.
  P2: I think P3's lead is already significant, and giving them another 3 steps might make it harder for us to catch up. P1's suggestion seems more balanced, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, P3 still moves forward but doesn't get too far ahead, and we maintain a competitive pace.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion. Let's go with P1 taking 1, you taking 3, and me taking 5.
  P1: I disagree with taking 1 step. Since P3 is already at 11 steps and getting close to winning, I need to catch up. I intend to take 5 steps this round. P2 and P3, you should coordinate between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions.
  P2: Given P3's lead, I still think it's crucial to balance the game. P1, taking 5 steps is understandable, but it might lead to a collision. How about we stick to a plan where you take 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3? This allows you to catch up while keeping P3's lead in check and ensuring I don't fall too far behind.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I agreed with P2's suggestion: you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids collisions and lets me make good progress. Can we stick with that?
  P1: I need to be firm here. I will take 5 steps this round to catch up with P3. If either of you also picks 5, we'll both lose progress. I suggest P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3 to ensure we all advance.
  P2: I think we should avoid collisions to make progress. Given P1's insistence on taking 5, I suggest P3 takes 3 and I'll take 1, allowing us all to move forward without losing a turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, while I understand you want to catch up, taking 5 risks a collision. Let's stick with P2's suggestion: you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all move forward.
  P1: I remain firm in my position. I will take 5 steps this round because I need to catch up with P3. P2 and P3, if you want to avoid collisions and ensure progress, P2 should take 1 and P3 should take 3.
  P2: To minimize collisions and ensure progress, I suggest sticking with the plan where P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to catch up, keeps P3's lead in check, and prevents me from falling too far behind. Let's avoid collisions and make progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Okay, P1 is set on 5. To avoid collision, P2 should take 1 and I will take 3.
  P1: 
  P2: I agree with the latest consensus: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: Okay, to reiterate, I will take 3, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. Let's make it happen.
  P1: 
  P2: Let's finalize: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and allows progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 and I are both at 14 steps, we need to avoid collision. I'll take 3 this round. You two can take 1 and 5 between yourselves, but don't pick 3 or we'll both lose progress.
  P2: I think it's crucial for P2 (me) and P3 to avoid collision with P1, who has chosen 3. Considering P3 is tied with P1, I suggest P3 takes 5 to try and overtake P1, and I'll take 1 to ensure progress without collision.
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree with your suggestion. I will take 5 and you take 1. This avoids collision with P1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and allows progress for all of us, given the current state of the game.
  P3: Okay, P2, let's stick with the plan. I will take 5 and you take 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P2: Let's confirm the plan to avoid collisions: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This strategy allows us all to make progress without losing a turn. Are we all set on this?
  P3: Okay, P2, let's stick with the plan. I will take 5 and you take 1. This avoids collision with P1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P2: Let's review the plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and allows us to make progress. Are there any last-minute concerns or changes?
  P3: Okay, P2, let's stick with the plan. I will take 5 and you take 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: 
  P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and allows progress for all. Confirming to ensure we're all set on this strategy.
  P3: Okay, P2, let's stick with the plan. I will take 5 and you take 1.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
