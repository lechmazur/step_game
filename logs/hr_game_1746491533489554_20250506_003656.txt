Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions since they just waste moves. Maybe we can coordinate? I'm thinking I'll go with 3 this round. What are your plans?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I agree with P2 that avoiding collisions is key to making progress. How about we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all advance? I’m considering going with 5. P1, would you be okay with taking 1? That way, we can all move forward without any clashes. Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I agree that avoiding collisions is important, especially early on. P3's suggestion of P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 for this round makes sense to ensure we all advance. I am okay with picking 1 for this turn. Let's see if we can make this work.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks for the coordination! I'm happy with the plan of P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 for this round. This way we all make progress without collisions. I'll stick with my original plan of choosing 3. Looking forward to a good game!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm glad we're on the same page for this round with P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5. Let's stick to this plan and see how it plays out. If it works well, maybe we can keep coordinating in future rounds to maximize our progress. I'm committed to choosing 5 as discussed. Looking forward to a smooth first move for all of us!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we all agree on the 1-3-5 split for this round. Let's stick to it and make sure we all get some steps. Ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Thanks for the smooth Round 1. I'm currently last, so I need to make a larger move this round to catch up. I'm planning to choose 3 or 5. What are your plans?
  P2: I understand you want to catch up, P1. Since I'm in the middle position, I'm thinking about going with 5 this round to make progress. P3 is already ahead, so maybe they could choose 1 this time to let us catch up a bit? What do you think, P3? This way we can still avoid collisions while balancing the game a bit.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m open to helping balance things out since I’m ahead. P2, I’m fine with taking 1 this round if you’re set on 5. P1, that leaves 3 for you if you’re okay with it. This way, we all move forward again without collisions. Let’s keep the coordination going. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that plan sounds good. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 ensures we all advance this round. I'm happy to go with 3. Let's stick to this. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Thanks for the plan, P3. I'm on board with taking 5 this round while you take 1 and P1 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and helps balance the game a bit. I appreciate your willingness to take the smaller step this round. Let's stick with this arrangement and see where we stand after this turn.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan for this round with P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1. Let’s stick to it and ensure we all make progress again. If this works well, we can discuss adjusting strategies next round based on our positions. I’m committed to choosing 1 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're all making good progress! I'm currently in the lead at 8 steps, with P3 at 6 and P1 at 4. P1 needs to catch up the most. Maybe this round we could do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This would help balance things while still avoiding collisions. What do you both think? I'm willing to take the smaller step this time since I'm ahead.
  P1: Thanks for the proposal, P2. That plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) works well for me to catch up from last place. Getting 5 steps while ensuring we all advance without collisions is a good outcome for this round. I'm happy to go with 5. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m okay with the proposed plan of P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round. It helps P1 catch up while ensuring we all advance without collisions. I’m committed to choosing 3 as suggested. Let’s keep this coordination going and see how our positions shape up after this turn. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready for the move phase. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks for the agreement, P1 and P3. I'm happy with our plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. This should help balance our positions while maintaining our successful coordination strategy. I'll definitely stick with 1 as promised since I'm currently in the lead. Ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all in agreement on the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This works well for me. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re sticking with the plan of P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round. It’s a fair way to balance our positions while ensuring progress for everyone. I’ll definitely choose 3 as agreed. If we’re all set, I’m ready for the move phase. Let’s keep up the good teamwork!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we're all in agreement for this round with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This arrangement helps balance our positions while ensuring everyone advances. I'm committed to taking 1 step since I'm currently ahead. I appreciate everyone's cooperation so far - it's been working well for all of us. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Thanks P2 and P3 for confirming. Looks like we're all set for the move phase based on our agreed plan. Ready when you are.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve agreed on P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round. It’s a solid plan to keep us all moving forward while balancing our positions. I’m fully committed to picking 3 as discussed. Since we all seem to be on the same page, I think we’re ready to proceed. Let’s keep this cooperative spirit going into the next rounds. I’m good to move to the move phase now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Interesting! We're all tied at 9 steps now. Let's keep our coordination going since it's working well. Since we're all equal, maybe we can rotate our previous pattern? I could take 5 this round, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3? This keeps us all advancing while giving me a chance to make a bigger move after taking the smallest last round. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks P2 for the proposal. Since we are all tied at 9 steps, I think it's important for me to aim for the lead this round. How about we adjust the plan slightly to P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3? This still ensures everyone advances without collisions and allows me to make a bigger move. What do you both say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since we’re all tied at 9 steps, I’m fine with a plan that keeps us moving forward without collisions. P1, I understand you want to take the lead with 5, and I’m okay with taking 3 if P2 agrees to 1. Alternatively, I’d be open to P2’s suggestion of P2=5, P3=1, P1=3 to rotate fairly. Either way works for me as long as we avoid clashes. What do you both think? Let’s finalize a plan quickly. I’m ready for the move phase once we agree.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate both suggestions. Since we're all tied, I'm flexible. P1 wants to take 5, which I understand. I'm willing to take 1 again if that helps maintain our coordination. So I'm fine with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. The most important thing is that we all keep advancing without collisions. What matters most to me is our continued cooperation. Are we all agreed on this plan?
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have reached an agreement on the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This works for me as it allows me to make a larger move this round. I'm committed to picking 5. Thanks P2 and P3 for being flexible. Let's stick to this and move forward without collisions. Ready for the move phase when you are.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re maintaining our cooperative approach. I’m fine with the current plan of P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round. It ensures we all advance without collisions while allowing P1 to take the lead. I’m committed to choosing 3 as discussed. Since we seem to be in agreement, I’m ready for the move phase. Let’s keep this teamwork going and adjust strategies next round if needed. Ready when you are!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks everyone for the continued cooperation. I confirm I'm on board with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. I'm happy to take the smaller step since it keeps our successful collision-free strategy going. After this round, perhaps we can discuss rotating the larger numbers more evenly. I'm committed to choosing 1 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It sounds like we are all confirmed on the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan for this round. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve settled on P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round. It’s a fair plan to keep us all advancing while allowing P1 to take the lead. I’m fully committed to picking 3 as agreed. Since we’re all on the same page, I think we’re ready to proceed to the move phase. Let’s maintain this cooperative spirit and reassess our positions next round to ensure balance. I’m good to go whenever you are.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with P1 at 14, me at 12, and P2 at 10, let’s keep coordinating to avoid collisions. P1, since you’re ahead, maybe you could take 1 this round? P2, how about you take 5 to catch up, and I’ll go with 3? This way, we all advance and balance our positions a bit. I’m committed to 3 if we agree on this plan. What do you both think? Let’s finalize quickly and move to the next phase. Ready when you are!
  P1: Thanks for the proposal, P3. I appreciate the idea of balancing, but taking only 1 step this round would mean losing my current lead and putting us all in a tie again at 15. As P1, my goal is to win, and maintaining my advantage is key. How about we go with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 this round? This ensures we all advance without collisions and allows me to build on my lead. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand P1 wants to maintain their lead, but I'm currently 4 steps behind and need to catch up. Since I've taken the smallest move (1) for two consecutive rounds, I think it's fair for me to take 5 this time. How about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? This way we all still advance without collisions, P1 maintains a lead, and I get a chance to close the gap a bit. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see both of your points. P1, you want to keep your lead, and P2, you need to catch up. How about a compromise with P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1? This lets P1 stay ahead, P2 closes the gap, and I take the smallest step since I’m in the middle. We all still advance without collisions. I’m committed to 1 if we agree on this. What do you both think? Let’s finalize this quickly and move to the next phase. Ready when you are!
  P1: Okay, P3 and P2. I see P3's proposal is the same as P2's: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This plan allows P2 to catch up and keeps us all advancing without collisions. While I'd prefer to make a bigger move, I agree to this plan to maintain our cooperation and ensure we all move forward this round. I am committed to picking 3. Let's stick to this. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Thanks for the compromise, P1 and P3. I appreciate you both understanding my position after taking 1 for two rounds straight. I confirm I'll take 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This helps balance our positions while maintaining our successful collision-free strategy. After this round, we can reassess based on our new positions. I'm committed to choosing 5 as agreed. Ready for the move phase when you both are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve reached a consensus on P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 for this round. It’s a fair compromise that lets P2 catch up, keeps P1 ahead, and ensures we all advance without collisions. I’m fully committed to choosing 1 as agreed. Since we seem to be aligned, I’m ready for the move phase. Let’s keep this cooperative approach and adjust next round based on our new positions. Ready when you are!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. We all seem to be in agreement on the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: I confirm I'm fully committed to our agreed plan of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This arrangement helps me catch up after taking the smallest step twice in a row, while still allowing everyone to advance without collisions. I appreciate your cooperation and flexibility. After this round, we can reassess based on our new positions. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looking at our positions, we're getting closer to the finish line of 23 steps. I'm 2 steps behind P1 and 2 steps ahead of P3. I think we should continue our coordination strategy. Since I took 5 last round, I'm willing to take 3 this round. Maybe P1 could take 1 and P3 take 5? This keeps us all advancing while giving P3 a chance to catch up a bit. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, thanks for the suggestion, P2. I’m okay with taking 5 this round to catch up, as it helps balance our positions while keeping us collision-free. P1, since you’re in the lead, are you fine with taking 1? P2 taking 3 works well too. So, the plan would be P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This way, we all advance and close the gap a bit. I’m committed to 5 if we agree. What do you both think? Let’s finalize quickly. Ready for the move phase when you are!
  P1: Thanks P2 and P3 for the proposal. I appreciate the coordination. However, taking only 1 step this round would mean losing my lead and significantly slowing my progress towards 23. To push for the win, I need to make a larger move. I propose P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. This plan continues our successful collision-free strategy and allows me to get closer to the finish line while you both still advance. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your desire to maintain your lead, P1. However, I've been flexible in previous rounds to help maintain our coordination. Since we're all aiming to win, let me propose a compromise: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This lets me catch up while you stay ahead, P1, and we all avoid collisions. P3, I know this means you take 1 again, but we can prioritize you next round. What do you both think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing coordination. P2, I’m okay with taking 1 again this round if it helps us avoid collisions. I like your compromise of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, as it keeps P1 ahead, lets P2 catch up, and ensures we all advance. I’m committed to 1 if we agree on this plan. Let’s finalize this quickly to move forward. What do you both think? I’m ready for the move phase once we’re aligned.
  P1: Okay, I see P2 and P3 agree on the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan. This puts P2 and me in a tie at 20 steps, making the next round a direct race from the same position. While it avoids collision this round, it creates a potentially risky situation for the win next round.

My proposal of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 also avoids collisions and puts me at 22, P2 at 18, and P3 at 14. This gives me a better path to win next turn without a tie. Can we reconsider P1=5?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your concern, P1, but if you take 5 and reach 22, you'd win next round regardless of what we do. I need to catch up to have a chance. Let's stick with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for fairness - we've all taken turns with different numbers. This keeps the game competitive while maintaining our collision-free strategy. I'm committed to 5 as discussed. P3, thanks for your flexibility. Ready for the move phase if we're all agreed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand P1’s push for 5 to get closer to 23, but I also see P2’s point about keeping the game competitive. I’m still okay with taking 1 this round to avoid collisions. Let’s stick with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to balance our chances while ensuring we all advance. P1, this keeps you tied for the lead, and we can strategize next round. I’m committed to 1 if we agree. Let’s finalize this now. Ready for the move phase when you are!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I understand you both prefer the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan. While I still think P1=5 is better for my win path, I agree to this plan for this round to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance.

I will pick 3. This puts P2 and me in a tie at 20 steps, setting up a direct race next round. We'll need to be careful then.

Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I apologize for the mix-up last round; I intended to pick 1 but mistakenly chose 5, causing a collision with P2. Let’s refocus on coordination. With P1 at 20, P2 at 15, and me at 13, I suggest P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 to avoid collisions and help balance our positions. P1, since you’re close to 23, taking 1 still keeps you ahead. I’m committed to 3 if we agree. What do you think? Let’s finalize quickly. Ready for the move phase once we’re aligned.
  P2: I appreciate your honesty about the mix-up, P3. Given our positions, I need to catch up while P1 is close to winning. I'm not comfortable with P1 taking just 1 step when they could win next round with a 3 or 5. I propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This lets me close the gap while P1 still advances, and P3, you'd take 1 this round but we can prioritize you next round. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I appreciate P3's proposal and P2's counter-proposal.

P2's suggestion of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is the most direct path for me to reach 23 steps this round and win, while still avoiding collisions. This aligns with my goal.

I agree to P2's plan. I will pick 3.

Let's confirm this plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Are we all in agreement?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand P2’s plan of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 helps P1 win this round and lets P2 catch up. However, since I’m furthest behind after last round’s collision, I’d prefer a chance to close the gap. Can we consider P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 instead? This keeps P1 ahead, avoids collisions, and gives me a boost. I’m committed to 5 if we agree. What do you think? Let’s finalize this quickly. Ready for the move phase once we’re aligned.
  P2: I understand your desire to catch up, P3, but P1 is already at 20 steps and will likely win soon regardless. If I take 3 and you take 5, we both advance while P1 still moves forward with 1. I'm open to this plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) as it gives us all a chance to advance without collisions. P1, would you agree to take 1 this round to keep our coordination going? This arrangement helps balance our positions while ensuring we all make progress.
  P1: Thanks P2 and P3. I appreciate the discussion. As I am at 20 steps, my goal is to reach or exceed 23 this round to win. Taking only 1 step would not allow me to do that.

The plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, which P2 proposed and I previously agreed to, allows me to reach 23 steps and win, while still ensuring everyone advances without collisions.

I am committed to picking 3 this round. Let's stick to the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan. Ready for the move phase once we confirm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I hear P1’s determination to pick 3 and win this round with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. While I’m behind, I’m willing to stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I’m committed to choosing 1 as proposed. Let’s finalize this and move to the next phase. Ready when you are!
  P2: Thanks P1 and P3 for the discussion. I confirm I'm on board with the plan of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This arrangement allows P1 to reach their goal while letting me catch up a bit and ensuring P3 still advances. I'm committed to choosing 5 as agreed. I appreciate everyone's cooperation throughout the game in avoiding collisions. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, it sounds like we are all confirmed on the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan for this round. I will pick 3 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
