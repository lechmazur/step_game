Let's each pick a number we haven't heavily relied on recently. I propose we avoid repeating last round's moves. This way, we minimize overlap and increase our chances of advancing individually. Trust is crucial, so let's commit to distinct moves and aim for unique choices. If we each pick unpredictably, we can all potentially advance this round. Good luck!"}
