Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=5

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3! To maximize our chances of reaching 21 without stepping on each other’s toes, how about we coordinate our moves each turn? For example, one of us could choose 1, another 3, and the third 5. This way, we all advance without overlapping and can support each other in the race to win. Let me know your thoughts or any suggestions you might have to make our strategy effective. Working together could benefit us all!
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the suggestion for coordination, but I believe we should each play our own game to ensure the best chance of winning. If we all follow a strict pattern, it might be too predictable and limit our flexibility. I suggest we keep our options open and make decisions based on the game's progression. Let's focus on our own strategies while keeping an eye on each other's moves. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your perspective, P3. If we prioritize flexibility, perhaps we can agree on adjusting our move choices each turn based on our current positions. This way, we can reduce the risk of collisions while still allowing room for individual strategies. For example, if one of us is nearing 21, the others can adapt their moves accordingly. Let’s work together to find a balanced approach that maximizes our chances of winning without being too predictable. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P1 that some level of coordination can be beneficial, but I also think we need to maintain flexibility. How about we loosely coordinate by avoiding the same number if we notice a pattern forming? This way, we can adapt our moves based on the game's flow and still minimize collisions. Let's keep the communication open and adjust as needed. What do you think?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we had a collision in the first round. Let's try to avoid that this time. I suggest we spread out our moves more. Since P2 is ahead, P2 could take 1, P1 could take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without overlapping. What do you think? Let's keep it flexible but coordinated to avoid collisions.
  P1: Sounds good, P3. I'll take 3 steps this round as suggested. Let's move forward smoothly and avoid any collisions. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan we discussed to avoid collisions. Since P2 is ahead, P2 can take 1, P1 can take 3, and I'll take 5. This should help us all advance smoothly. Let's stay coordinated and flexible. Good luck!
  P1: P2, to maintain your lead, you could take 1 this turn. I'll stick with 3, and P3 can take 5. This should help us progress without collisions. Let me know if you agree!

Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, it looks like we're still on the same page. To keep things smooth, let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This should help us avoid any more collisions and keep the game progressing. Let's stay coordinated and flexible. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, please confirm taking 1 this turn as we agreed. Sticking to our plan helps us avoid collisions and advance smoothly. Let’s work together to progress without overlaps. If everyone follows the plan, we all have a better chance to reach 21 first. Looking forward to your cooperation!
