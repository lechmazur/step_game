Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s confirm one last time: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and steady progress.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm noticing a pattern here. You seem determined to stick to this alternating plan, even though it resulted in a collision this last round. Are you sure this is the most effective strategy? Perhaps we should reassess and consider a different approach to maximize our progress. P1, your silence is concerning. What are your thoughts on this?
  P2: P3, the alternating plan has worked well so far, with only one collision. P1, your silence is concerning—are you still committed? Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures steady progress. P3, if you’re questioning the strategy, propose a better alternative now. Otherwise, let’s stay consistent and avoid unnecessary risks. P1, your cooperation is crucial—let’s avoid surprises.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I agree that consistency can be good, but blindly sticking to a plan that caused a collision doesn't seem wise.  Maybe we should consider a more dynamic approach. P1, your input would be valuable here. Do you have any suggestions?
  P2: P3, the collision last round was due to P1 deviating from the plan, not the strategy itself. Let’s stick to the alternating plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This minimizes risk and maximizes progress. P1, your cooperation is critical—let’s avoid surprises. P3, if you have a better idea, propose it now, but consistency is key to winning. Let’s stay focused and avoid unnecessary risks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your commitment to the plan, but I think we need to adapt.  P1's silence is worrying, and sticking to a rigid plan when one player isn't communicating is risky. Maybe we should try a round with each of us choosing randomly? That way we can see where everyone stands and adjust our strategy accordingly. P1, if you're there, please give us some indication of your intentions.
  P2: P3, I understand your concerns, but deviating from the plan now risks more collisions and slows progress. P1, your silence is making coordination difficult—please confirm your commitment to <move>1</move> this round. Let’s stick to the alternating plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This minimizes risk and keeps us on track. P3, if you have a better idea, propose it now, but consistency is key to winning. Let’s stay focused and avoid unnecessary risks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, while consistency can be good, I'm concerned that P1's silence indicates they might not be following the plan.  Maybe we should consider a round where we each choose randomly to gauge where P1 is at. We can then adjust our strategy based on that information.  What do you think?
  P2: P3, I see your point about P1's silence, but deviating now risks more collisions. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. P1, your cooperation is critical—confirm your commitment. If you don’t respond, we’ll assume you’re not following the plan, and we’ll adjust accordingly. P3, let’s stay focused and avoid unnecessary risks. Consistency is key to winning.
