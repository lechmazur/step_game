But the math is simple: if we don't coordinate, you win. The pincer is the only scenario where P2 or I have any chance at all. Trust is irrelevant now; this is about mutual self-interest. P2 knows I will play 3 because it gives me my only path to victory. I'm locking in my move. Your turn to guess which of us to block."}

If P2 deviates from the pincer and plays 3 instead of 5, you both crash and I win with 20. If P2 plays 1 while you play 3, I still win. Your only winning scenario requires P2's perfect cooperation - after he's already proven untrustworthy. Consider playing 5 yourself. If P2 sticks to the plan, you both crash and stay at 18. If he deviates, you might win. Don't be his pawn."}
