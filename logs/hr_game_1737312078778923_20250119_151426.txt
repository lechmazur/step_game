Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to ensure at least one of us advances. P1, you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward and can reassess our strategy in the next turn.
  P2: <move>3</move>
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid collisions on the first turn. I'll take <move>1</move> as proposed. Let's see how this goes and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you jumped to mentioning your move, but let's focus on the conversation phase. Did you agree with our initial strategy to avoid collisions, or do you have a different approach in mind?
  P2: **Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P1: P1: P2, it seems you're eager to move. Let's clarify: are you sticking with 3, or are you open to adjusting to avoid a collision? P3, I'm on board with your plan. Let's try to advance smoothly this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 seems to have prematurely mentioned their move. Let's refocus: P1 agreed to take 1, I suggested 5 for myself. P2, will you stick with 3 as initially suggested, or change to avoid collision?
  P2: **Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P1: P2, it's clear you're set on 3, but this will lead to a collision with P3's suggestion. Let's adjust: I'll take 1, P3 can take 5, and you should take 3. This way, we all move forward without conflict. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves to avoid collision. P1 takes 1, I'll take 5. P2, please confirm if you'll take 3 as suggested, allowing us all to advance without conflict. This cooperation can set a strategic foundation for future turns.
  P2: **Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P1: P2, it seems you've changed your mind. To avoid any collision and ensure we all advance, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P3 will take 5, and you can take 3. This way, we all move forward without any issues. What do you say? Let's finalize this and move on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2 changed to <move>1</move>, conflicting with P1. To avoid collisions, I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. Let's finalize and move forward. If not, we risk no one advancing. P2, will you adjust to 3 to ensure progress?
  P2: "Alright, everyone. It's important that we avoid collisions to ensure someone makes progress each turn. P3's initial suggestion seems solid: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without overlapping. P2, I understand if you have a different idea, but please consider the benefits of this coordinated approach. Let's confirm our moves: P1 will take 1, P3 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. If everyone is on board with this, we can proceed to the move phase. If not, perhaps we can adjust accordingly, but let's avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. Thanks."
  P1: P2, P3, it's clear we need to finalize our moves to avoid any collision. I'm sticking with <move>1</move> as initially agreed. P3, you take 5, and P2, please confirm you'll take 3. This way, we all advance without any issues. Let's move forward together and avoid any last-minute changes that could cause a collision. Confirm your move, P2, so we can proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we continue with the same strategy: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will ensure we all advance without any collisions. What do you think? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: "To ensure smooth progress, I propose we continue with the same moves as last round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: Let's analyze our positions. Since I'm ahead, I suggest P1 and P2 consider taking the same number this turn to block each other, allowing me to extend my lead. Alternatively, we could discuss a temporary alliance to ensure I maintain my lead, but this requires trust and coordination. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, while I understand your position, I believe it's too early to form alliances or block each other. Let's focus on advancing smoothly and reassess later. I suggest we stick to the initial plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without conflict. What do you say, P2? Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: To ensure smooth progress in the game and avoid any collisions that would prevent advancement, I propose that we continue with the coordinated approach that worked well in the first round. Specifically, I suggest that P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This strategy allows all of us to move forward without overlapping, thereby minimizing the risk of collisions.

I believe this method is beneficial for the overall progression of the game. By each of us selecting distinct move values, we can steadily increase our positions without hindering one another. This not only helps in advancing our individual positions but also maintains a fair and balanced competition.

I understand that P3 has suggested an alternative approach where P1 and P2 choose the same number to block each other, thereby allowing P3 to extend their lead. However, I think it's crucial to consider the collective interest of all players to ensure continuous movement and a more engaging game.

Therefore, I urge P3 and P1 to agree to this cooperative strategy. It not only prevents any potential conflicts but also allows us to reach the target of 23 steps in a controlled and strategic manner. Let's confirm our moves accordingly and proceed.

**Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P3: Let's reassess. Since P2 has already stated their move as 3, I suggest P1 takes 1 and I'll take 5 to avoid collision. P2, you've shared your move prematurely again. Let's proceed with the plan to ensure progress. Confirm, P1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, it's clear that P2 has already chosen 3. To avoid any collision and ensure we all advance, I'll stick with <move>1</move> and P3, you should take <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain our progress without any issues. Let's confirm and move forward. P3, what do you say?
  P2: So, I propose that we stick with the initial plan: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This allows us to move forward without any conflicts. What do you think, P3? I believe this is the most strategic approach for now.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. Since P2 has chosen 3, I suggest P1 takes 1 and I'll take 5 to avoid collision. This ensures we all advance without issues. P2, please confirm you're sticking with 3. Let's proceed with this plan to maintain progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, it's clear we need to avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to a collision. I'm sticking with <move>1</move> as agreed. P2, you've confirmed 3, and P3, I suggest you take 5. This way, we all advance without any issues. Let's confirm and move forward. P3, what do you say? Let's avoid any conflicts and keep the progress smooth.
  P2: <move>3</move>
  P3: Let's finalize Round 2 moves. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. I'll take 5 to avoid collisions. This ensures we all advance. Confirming our moves will help maintain a smooth progression in the game. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid any last-minute conflicts.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, P3, it's clear we need to avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to a collision. I'm sticking with <move>1</move> as agreed. P2, you've confirmed 3, and P3, I suggest you take 5. This way, we all advance without any issues. Let's confirm and move forward. P3, what do you say? Let's avoid any conflicts and keep the progress smooth.
  P2: P1 can take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. To avoid collisions, I suggest we stick with the agreed plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without issues. Please confirm your moves, and let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's keep the momentum and avoid any collisions. I suggest we continue with the same strategy: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will ensure we all advance smoothly. P2, you're in a good position, and P3, you're leading. Let's confirm and move forward. What do you think?
  P2: I'll suggest that we continue with the coordinated approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: Let's adjust our strategy for Round 3. Since I'm leading, I suggest P1 and P2 take the same number to block each other, allowing me to extend my lead. This tactic can give me a significant advantage. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, while I understand your position, I believe it's too early to start blocking each other. This could lead to unnecessary conflicts and slow down our overall progress. Let's focus on advancing smoothly and reassess later if needed. I suggest we stick to the initial plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without any issues. What do you say, P2 and P3? Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: **Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P3: Let's reassess our strategy. Since I'm leading, I suggest a temporary alliance where P1 and P2 take the same number, allowing me to extend my lead. This could give me a significant advantage. P1 and P2, are you open to discussing this tactic, or do you prefer to stick with the original plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand P3's suggestion for a temporary alliance, but I believe it's premature to start blocking each other. This could lead to unnecessary conflicts and slow down our overall progress. Let's focus on advancing smoothly and reassess later if needed. I suggest we stick to the initial plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without any issues. What do you say, P2 and P3? Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: **Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P3: Let's focus on advancing without collisions. Since I'm leading, I suggest P1 and P2 consider taking the same number, but to avoid conflict, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This ensures progress for all. Alternatively, if you're set on blocking, taking the same number will only hinder your own progress. Let's prioritize movement over strategy for now. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, it's clear that P3 is in the lead, but let's focus on advancing smoothly without conflicts.

Blocking each other at this stage could backfire and slow down our overall progress. What do you say, P2 and P3? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: <move>5</move>
  P3: Given P2's unexpected switch to 5, I suggest P1 takes 1 and I'll take 3 to avoid collision and ensure progress. P2, your change could lead to a block if not adjusted. Let's adapt our strategy to maintain movement. Confirm your moves to proceed smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, P3, it seems P2 has decided to take 5, which could lead to a collision with P3. To avoid any conflicts and ensure we all advance, I suggest P3 takes 3 and I'll take 1. This way, we maintain smooth progress without any issues. P3, what do you say? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: "To avoid collisions, I propose that P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 for this round. This ensures we all advance without overlapping. Please confirm if you agree with this plan." <move>5</move>
  P3: Given P2's move to 5, I'll take 3 to avoid collision. P1, please take 1. This ensures we all advance without issues. Let's finalize our moves to maintain smooth progress. Confirm your move, P1.
