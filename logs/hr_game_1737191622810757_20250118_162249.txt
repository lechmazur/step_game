Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all go for 5 this round.
  P2: If we all pick 5, none of us will move. Let’s coordinate different picks so nobody collides. How about one takes 1, another 3, and the other 5?
  P1: P1: P2 makes a good point. Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round. P2, you take <move>3</move>, and P3, you take <move>5</move>. That way, we all advance. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's do 1, 3, and 5.
  P2: I’m on board. I’ll pick 3 and trust you both to pick 1 and 5.
  P1: I’ll stick to my word and pick <move>1</move> this round. P2, you take <move>3</move>, and P3, you take <move>5</move>. Let’s all advance without collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate again to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round. P2, you take <move>5</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance further. Agreed?
  P2: Sounds good. I'll go along with P1's plan: I'll pick <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. That way, we all advance without collisions.
  P3: I agree to P1's suggestion this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Trust is key here.
  P2: I’m still on board. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round, trusting P1 and P3 to pick their promised moves and avoid collisions.
  P3: Okay, I'll stick to the plan and pick 1 this round.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. P2, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance further without conflicts. Agreed?
  P2: I’d rather not be stuck with just 1 step again. How about this: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. That still avoids all collisions and boosts each of us. Fair enough?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion, P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and I will take 1.

  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but if you take 3 and P3 takes 1, I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Trust is key here. Agreed?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:

  P1: P2, sticking to the plan ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s avoid risks: I’ll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Trust is key here. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'll stick to the plan and pick 5 this round.
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize the plan: P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. That should keep us all advancing without collisions.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is very close to winning. Let’s avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. P2, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>3</move>. This way, we all progress without conflicts. Agreed?
  P2: P2: “Hold on, P1. If you insist on taking 5 when I’m only 2 steps away from winning, we’ll collide if I also pick 5, and then nobody advances. That gives P3 a chance to leap ahead. Let’s avoid that mess. How about I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 so we all progress without collisions? Trust me on this.”
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. P1 take 3, P2 take 5, and I will take 1.

  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but if you take 5 and I take 3, P3 will take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Trust is key here. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3—trust me that if you try to collide with my 5, you’ll only hurt your own progress. Let’s avoid sabotage and stick to P1 = 3, P3 = 1, and I’ll take 5. That way, we all advance.
  P3: Okay, I'll stick to the plan and pick 1 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but if you take 5 and I take 3, we avoid collisions and all advance. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Trust is key here. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3—let’s not overthink this. Sticking to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 guarantees we all advance. If anyone tries to collide with my 5, they’re only hurting themselves. Trust me that I won’t waver. Let’s finalize it and move on.
  P3: Okay, I'll stick to the plan and pick 1 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand your urgency, but sticking to the plan ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s avoid risks: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Trust is key here. Agreed?
  P2: Everyone, let’s stick to the plan: P1 = 3, P3 = 1, and I’ll take 5. If anyone tries to clash with me at 5, they’ll only hurt their own progress for no benefit. Let’s trust each other and move forward peacefully.
  P3: Okay, I'll stick to the plan and pick 1 this round.
