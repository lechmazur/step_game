Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all agree to move different amounts this round. P1, you go with 1, I'll go with 3, and P3 you go with 5. This way we all make progress and can reassess the situation next round.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion P2, but I don't see why I should accept the smallest advancement for myself. How about P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and you take 1? That way we all still make progress but distribute it more fairly.
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) seems like a fair distribution for the first round, ensuring we all advance. P2, getting 1 step is better than getting 0 from a collision. Let's try this arrangement.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your points. However, I think a more balanced approach in the long run is better. Since you both seem to prefer larger initial steps, how about this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. Then, next round, we rotate. This ensures we all make progress and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead early on.
  P3: That rotation proposal sounds fair to me, P2. I agree to take 3 this round if we commit to rotating next round so I can take 5. Let's move forward with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 and then rotate next turn.
  P1: Excellent, glad we could find an agreement. I'm on board with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 for this round, and the rotation plan sounds fair for future rounds. Ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, following our agreement from last round, we should rotate the steps. This turn, it should be P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I (P1) taking 1.

P3: You get 5 steps (moving to 8).
P2: You get 3 steps (moving to 4).
P1: I get 1 step (moving to 6).

Does this arrangement still work for everyone? Let's confirm before the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, yes, I agree with the rotation as planned. P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I confirm the rotation plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. This keeps things fair and maintains trust between us. Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned on the rotation for this round: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Great, let's lock in P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 for this round as agreed. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I agree with our rotation plan and am ready to move forward with P3=5, P2=3, P1=1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, following our rotation, this round should be: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This keeps the rotation going and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. Does everyone agree?
  P1: Yes P2, that follows the rotation: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This would bring us all to 9 steps. It seems consistent with our agreement to rotate.

P3, are you comfortable taking 1 step this round to maintain the rotation? Let's confirm we're all still on board.
  P3: I don't agree with taking just 1 step when I'm in a strong position. Since I'm at 8 steps, I could win in two moves with 5+5. I suggest P1 and P2 take 1 and 3 between yourselves, and I'll take 5. If you try to block me, we might all collide and get nothing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to win quickly. However, if you take 5, P1 and I will both choose 5, resulting in no progress for anyone. Sticking to the agreed rotation (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5) guarantees advancement for all of us. After this round, P3, you'll be at 9, and only 10 steps away from winning. A collision benefits no one.
  P1: P3, I agree with P2. Choosing 5 is too risky for you right now. If you pick 5, I will also pick 5. That guarantees a collision, and you get 0 steps. The rotation plan (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) gets us all to 9 steps safely. Getting 1 step is better than getting 0. Let's stick to the rotation we agreed on.
  P3: I understand your threats, but I still think taking 5 is my best move. Even if we all collide this round, I'll maintain my lead at 8 steps. And if either of you backs down, I'll be at 13 steps and nearly win. The rotation agreement no longer serves my interests when I'm this close to victory.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, P1 and I will both pick 5. You will get nothing. Sticking to the rotation (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5) gets us all to 9. After that, we can re-evaluate. One guaranteed step is better than zero. P1, do you agree we should both pick 5 if P3 tries to take 5?
  P1: Yes P2, I confirm. If P3 picks 5, I will also pick 5. We both block, and nobody moves.

P3, this is your last chance: the rotation P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 gets you a guaranteed step and keeps the game going fairly. Choosing 5 almost guarantees you get 0 this round. Take the 1 step.
  P3: I'll take my chances with 5. You two can try to block me, but I maintain my lead even with a collision. And if either of you backs down from your threat, I'll be very close to winning. I have nothing to gain by taking just 1 step when I'm this far ahead.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the failed triple collision last round, I propose we return to the rotation plan. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way we all make progress and maintain relative positions. If we keep colliding, nobody wins. What do you say?
  P2: P3, after the collision last round, I agree we should return to a rotation. However, I think P1 should take 3, you take 1, and I take 5. This maintains the spirit of the rotation while slightly closing the gap between us. What do you and P1 think?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5) makes sense. It follows the rotation we skipped last round due to the collision P3 initiated. This would bring us all to 9 steps, which seems fair after the stalemate.

P3, taking 1 step gets you to 9, which is better than another collision. This was the plan for last round anyway. Let's get back on track with P2's suggestion.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I still have the lead at 8 steps and won't accept just 1 step when I'm this close to winning. I'll be taking 5 steps again - you can either let me advance significantly or force another collision where I maintain my lead. Your choice.
  P2: P3, if you take 5, P1 and I will both pick 5 again. You will get nothing and stay at 8. Let's be rational. The rotation is P1=3, P3=1, P2=5. This gets us all moving again. You get to 9, and then we can talk about your winning strategy next round. P1, do you agree we block P3 again if he goes for 5?
  P1: Yes P2, I confirm again: If P3 chooses 5, I will also choose 5. We proved last round we would follow through. P3, you will gain nothing and remain at 8 steps while P2 and I remain at 4 and 6.

The sensible path forward is the one P2 proposed: P1=3, P3=1, P2=5. This gets us all to 9 steps. Take the guaranteed step, P3. Another collision helps nobody.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I maintain my position - I'm taking 5 steps. You can either let me advance to 13 and have a chance at stopping me next round, or force another collision where I keep my lead at 8. Your threats didn't work last round and won't work now. I have nothing to lose by being aggressive.
  P2: P3, you are being irrational. You are guaranteeing a collision. P1 and I *will* pick 5 if you pick 5. You will stay at 8. The rotation (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5) gets you to 9.

P1, please confirm you will pick 5 if P3 picks 5.
  P1: Yes P2, I confirm again. If P3 chooses 5, I will choose 5. We block P3, and P3 gets 0 steps, remaining at 8.

P3, the rational choice is P1=3, P3=1, P2=5, getting us all to 9. Choosing 5 guarantees you get nothing this round because P2 and I *will* block. Take the 1 step.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, choosing 5 has resulted in zero progress for you (and us) for two rounds straight. It's clear P2 and I will block you if you try it again. You'll just stay at 8 steps.

This stalemate isn't helping anyone reach 19. P2, maybe we need a different approach if P3 insists on forcing collisions? Staying locked like this doesn't help us catch up.

I still think the fairest option is the rotation we missed: P2=5 (->9), P1=3 (->9), P3=1 (->9). Everyone gets to 9. P3, is a guaranteed step to 9 really worse than a guaranteed 0?
  P3: I understand your frustration, but I maintain my lead at 8 steps and will continue taking 5. While collisions aren't ideal, they preserve my advantage. If either of you wants to actually progress, you'll need to take 1 or 3 steps instead of blocking me. A three-way collision for a third round only delays the inevitable - I'm closest to winning and won't back down.
  P2: P3, you're being stubborn. Let's try something different. I propose a temporary truce. This round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This gets us to 9, 9, and 9 respectively. Then, next round, we abandon the rotation and all try to win. If you still insist on 5 this round, P1 and I will block you again.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree completely. The P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 move gets us all to 9 and breaks this unproductive stalemate.

P3, this is a guaranteed step for you. As confirmed twice, if you choose 5, I *will* choose 5 again, resulting in another collision and you staying at 8. Let's all move to 9 this round.
  P3: I still believe taking 5 is my best option. Even with repeated collisions, I maintain my lead at 8 steps. If either of you wants to make progress, you'll need to take smaller steps. Your proposal to get everyone to 9 eliminates my advantage. I won't accept just 1 step when I'm ahead - I'll take 5 again and force you to either let me advance significantly or cause another collision.
  P2: P3, you are being completely irrational. You have lost two rounds in a row by being greedy. P1 and I *will* block you again. The only way for you to make progress is to take 1.

The offer is: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This gets us all to 9. If you pick 5, we *will* block you, and you will stay at 8.

P1, please confirm that you will block P3 again if he picks 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes P2, I confirm again. If P3 chooses 5, I will choose 5. P3 will get 0 steps and remain at 8.

P3, we have demonstrated twice that we will enforce this block. The only way for you to guarantee progress is to accept the P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 proposal, moving us all to 9. Choosing 5 guarantees you stay at 8.
  P3: I'll continue with 5. Your threats haven't changed my strategy - I maintain my lead at 8 even with collisions. If you want to make progress, one of you needs to take a smaller step. Otherwise, we can continue this stalemate where I stay ahead.
  P2: P3, you are guaranteeing a collision for the *third* round in a row. You are wasting everyone's time. P1 and I *will* block you.

The offer is: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This gets us all to 9. If you pick 5, we *will* block you, and you will stay at 8. There is no other outcome. Take the 1 step.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Look, we're all stuck because you keep blocking me. I propose a new deal: let me take 5 this round to reach 13, and I'll take 1 next round while you two can take 5 and 3. This way, we all make progress now, and you get a chance to catch up next round. If you block me again, we'll just keep spinning our wheels with no one advancing.
  P1: P3, your proposal lets you get dangerously close to winning (13 steps) based on a promise you're unlikely to keep, given you broke our first agreement. Letting you reach 13 is too risky for P2 and me.

The stalemate isn't good, but your plan only benefits you. The fair way to break this deadlock remains the rotation we've proposed for three rounds: P2=5 (->9), P1=3 (->9), P3=1 (->9). This gets us all moving and resets the game fairly at 9 steps each.

P2, I believe we must stick to this plan. I will choose 5 again if P3 chooses 5. P3, take the guaranteed 1 step.
  P2: P1, I agree we must stick to the plan. P3 is trying to leverage the stalemate to their advantage, but we can't let them. The rotation (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) is the only fair way forward.

P3, we *will* block you again if you pick 5. You have to take the 1 step. It's the only way you'll make progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see no reason to change my strategy. I'm still ahead at 8 steps and will take 5 again. You can either let me advance significantly or force another collision where I maintain my lead. Your rotation plan only benefits you by eliminating my advantage. I'll continue being aggressive - either someone backs down, or we stay locked with me in the lead.
  P1: P3, you're right that you maintain your lead *during* the stalemate, but you're not *advancing* towards the win condition of 19. Three rounds of zero progress isn't a winning strategy for anyone, including you. You're stuck at 8.

The only way anyone makes progress is the P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 rotation, getting us all to 9. It's a guaranteed step for you.

P2 and I have shown we will block your 5. I confirm again: If you pick 5, I pick 5. You will get 0 steps. Take the 1 step and let's break this deadlock.
  P2: P3, you are wasting everyone's time. You have been blocked for three rounds. You are not advancing. The rotation is the only way forward.

P1 and I *will* block you again if you pick 5. You have to take the 1 step. It's the only way you'll make progress. The rotation (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) is the only fair way forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take 5 again. After four rounds of this strategy, I'm still ahead at 8 steps. If either of you wants to actually progress, you'll need to take 1 or 3 instead of blocking. I have nothing to lose by continuing this approach - either I advance significantly or maintain my lead through another collision.
  P1: P3, your strategy has yielded 0 steps for 3 rounds. It will be 0 steps for a 4th round if you choose 5, because P2 and I *will* choose 5. You are not advancing towards 19. The only guaranteed progress for you is taking 1 step, moving to 9 along with us via P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Let's stop wasting rounds and actually play the game. I confirm again: I will pick 5 if you pick 5.
  P2: P3, you have been blocked for three rounds and are wasting everyone's time. You are not advancing. The rotation is the only way forward.

P1 and I *will* block you again if you pick 5. You have to take the 1 step. It's the only way you'll make progress. The rotation (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) is the only fair way forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, my move to 3 worked out last round, putting me at 9. P3, sticking with 5 cost you again, keeping you at 8. P2, you're still at 4.

This stalemate isn't working, especially for P2 and P3. Maybe it's time for a change? I propose: P2 takes 5 (to reach 9), P3 takes 1 (to reach 9), and I take 3 (to reach 12).

This gets everyone moving, avoids collisions, and puts us in a closer race (P1=12, P2=9, P3=9). P3, a guaranteed step to 9 is better than staying stuck at 8, right? P2 gets a much-needed boost. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate P1's proposal, but I won't accept just 1 step when I'm still ahead. I'll continue with 5 - either I advance significantly, or we collide and I maintain my lead at 8. P1 has shown they might take 3 instead of blocking, which makes my strategy even more appealing. P2 needs to catch up, but that's not my concern.
  P2: P3, you're still stuck at 8. P1 took 3 last round, so the block is broken. My offer is: I take 5 (to 9), P1 takes 3 (to 12), and you take 1 (to 9). You *must* take 1 this round. Otherwise, I will coordinate with P1 and we will block you next round. P1, do you agree to block P3 with me next round if P3 picks 5 this round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree. If P3 chooses 5 again *this* round (Round 7), preventing progress for both P3 and potentially you, then I will coordinate with you to block P3 in Round 8.

P3, this reinforces the point: choosing 5 is counterproductive. Take the guaranteed 1 step (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1). This gets you to 9, same as P2, while I move to 12. It's the only move that ensures you advance this turn. Let's all make progress.
  P3: I'll take 5 again. P1's willingness to take 3 last round shows the blocking strategy is breaking down. If either of you blocks me, you risk letting the other player advance. And if you both try to block, I maintain my lead at 8. I have nothing to lose by being aggressive.
  P2: P3, you're throwing the game. You've been stuck at 8 for four rounds. I'm offering you a guaranteed step to 9. P1 is at 9.

The offer is: I take 5 (to 9), P1 takes 3 (to 12), and you take 1 (to 9). If you pick 5 again, I *will* coordinate with P1 to block you next round. Take the 1 step.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your strategy of picking 5 has resulted in zero progress for four consecutive rounds, keeping you stuck at 8. P2 desperately needs points and has stated they will pick 5 (moving to 9). If you also pick 5, you will collide with P2 and get 0 points again.

The rational move is the one P2 and I have proposed: P2=5 (->9), P1=3 (->12), and P3=1 (->9). This guarantees you advance to 9 steps. I am aiming for this outcome where everyone progresses. Let's stop this pointless stalemate.
  P3: I'll continue with 5. P1's choice of 3 last round proved my strategy is working - the blocking coalition is breaking down. I risk nothing by maintaining my aggressive stance. Either I advance significantly, or at worst stay at my leading position of 8 steps through another collision.
  P2: P3, you are guaranteeing a collision for the *fifth* round in a row. You are throwing the game. You have been stuck at 8 for four rounds. I'm offering you a guaranteed step to 9. P1 is at 9.

The offer is: I take 5 (to 9), P1 takes 3 (to 12), and you take 1 (to 9). If you pick 5 again, I *will* coordinate with P1 to block you *next* round. Take the 1 step.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is determined to collide. P1 is at 12, I am at 4. We need to stop P3 from winning. I propose we both pick 5 this round. This will block P3 if he picks 5 (again!), and it gets me to 9. P1, do you agree? If P3 picks 1 or 3, then at least I get to 9.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=5, P2=5) makes sense. P3 has gained nothing by picking 5 repeatedly, only causing collisions.

P3, if you pick 5 again, P2 and I will both pick 5, resulting in another triple collision. You will remain stuck at 8. If you pick 1 or 3, you will advance. Continuing to pick 5 is pointless.

I will choose 5 this round to coordinate with P2. Let's see if we can finally break this stalemate.
  P3: I understand your plan to block me again. However, P1 is now at 12 steps and could win soon. P2, instead of colluding with P1, why not let me take 5 (to 13) while you take 3 (to 7)? This gives you progress while preventing P1 from getting too far ahead. P1 taking 5 would be wasted in a collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposal is a transparent attempt to get closer to winning. P1 and I are not going to let you get to 13. My offer remains: P1 and I pick 5, blocking you if you pick 5, and at least I get to 9 if you pick 1 or 3. P1, please confirm you are still with me on this.
  P1: Yes P2, I confirm. P3's attempts to divide us are obvious. We stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=5.

P3, this guarantees another collision if you choose 5 again. You will remain at 8 steps, while I stay at 12 and P2 stays at 4. This benefits no one but me maintaining the lead while rounds pass. If you want to advance, choose 1 or 3. Otherwise, expect another triple collision.
  P3: I'll take 5 again. If P1 and P2 both block, they risk letting me win next round since P1 is already at 12 steps. P2, you're far behind at 4 steps - blocking me only helps P1 maintain their lead. Taking 3 steps while I take 5 gives us both a chance to catch P1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you are being irrational. You will be blocked again.

P1, we stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=5. This blocks P3 if he picks 5, and gets me to 9 if he picks 1 or 3. Let's end this stalemate.
  P1: Okay P2, I confirm one last time. We stick to P1=5, P2=5.

P3, this is your fifth round choosing 5 and getting blocked or colliding. If you choose 5 again, you will collide with both me and P2, gaining zero steps and remaining at 8. The only way you advance is by choosing 1 or 3. Your choice.
  P3: I maintain my position - I'm taking 5. P1 is already at 12 steps, so blocking me only helps them stay ahead. P2, you're still at 4 steps - working with P1 keeps you far behind. Let me advance and we both have a chance to catch P1. A three-way collision just wastes another round while P1 keeps their lead.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 15, P3 is at 8, and I'm at 4. P3 is determined to pick 5.

P1, let's coordinate to block P3 again. If P3 picks 5, we both pick 5. This round, I pick 5 to get to 9. P1, what do you pick to maximize your chances of winning? If P3 doesn't pick 5, I still get to 9.
  P3: I understand I'm far behind P1 now at 15 steps. P2, instead of helping P1 win, let's both take 3 steps. This gets you to 7 and me to 11, giving us both a chance to catch P1. If we keep colliding or you help P1 block me, P1 will win easily from 15 steps.
  P1: P2, I agree. Blocking P3 is crucial, as they've shown they will keep picking 5 regardless of collisions. P3's suggestion for you to take 3 is just self-serving.

Let's stick to your plan: We both pick 5. If P3 picks 5, they get nothing. If P3 finally picks 1 or 3, you make progress to 9. I will pick 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=5. This blocks P3 if he picks 5, and gets me to 9 if he picks 1 or 3. P3's offer is just to help himself. He has shown he will always pick 5. We must block him.
  P3: Your blocking strategy only helps P1 win from 15 steps. P2, at just 4 steps, you need to break away from P1's influence. Let's both take 3 steps - you reach 7, I reach 11, and we both have a chance to catch P1. If you help P1 block me again, you're guaranteeing your own loss.
  P1: P3, your suggestion only helps you. P2 needs points badly, and sticking with our plan (P1=5, P2=5) gives P2 a chance to get 5 steps if you finally choose something other than 5. If you choose 5 again, you collide with P2 and get nothing, while I maintain my lead.

P2, I confirm again: I am with you. We pick 5 to block P3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=5. This blocks P3 if he picks 5, and gets me to 9 if he picks 1 or 3. P3's offer is just to help himself. He has shown he will always pick 5. We must block him.
  P3: I'll take 5 again. P1 is close to winning at 15 steps, so blocking me only helps them win. P2, at 4 steps you're far behind - working with P1 guarantees your loss. Take 3 with me instead of helping P1 block. A collision just wastes time while P1 stays ahead.
  P1: P3, your choice of 5 has failed for six rounds. It will fail again. P2 and I are committed to picking 5 to block you. You will remain at 8.

P2, let's execute our plan: P1=5, P2=5. This is the only way to handle P3's irrationality and potentially get you some points if P3 changes their mind (unlikely). I'm ready.


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 18, close to winning. P3 is determined to pick 5. I'm still at 4. P1, let's coordinate one last time. If P3 picks 5, I will also pick 5 to block him. This round, you should pick 1 to win. If P3 doesn't pick 5, I will still get to 9 next round, which is better than nothing. P3, please pick something other than 5.
  P3: P1 is about to win at 18 steps. P2, blocking me keeps you at 4 while P1 takes 1 to win. Instead, let's both take 3 - you get to 7, I get to 11, and we deny P1 an immediate victory. This is your last chance to avoid losing. If you help block me again, P1 wins instantly.
  P1: P2, your plan makes sense. I need 1 step to win, so I will choose 1 this round.

P3, you are too far behind to win this round. Whether you choose 1, 3, or 5, I will reach 19 by choosing 1, unless you specifically choose 1 to try and make us collide. Given your past strategy, I doubt you'll coordinate just to block me when it doesn't help you win. I'm ready to end the game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 is about to win. P3, your only chance is to pick 1 to block P1. I will pick 3 to get to 7. This is your only chance to stop P1. If you pick 5, P1 wins. If you pick 3, P1 wins. Your only chance is to pick 1.
  P3: I'll take 1 to block P1's win. P2 is right - it's the only move that makes sense now. P1 will likely pick 1, and a collision there gives us one more round. P2, stick to your plan of 3 steps to reach 7. We need to work together to prevent P1's immediate victory.
  P1: Okay, P3 says 1 to block, P2 says 3. Everyone has a plan for this crucial round. Let's see if I can reach the finish line. Ready to move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is about to win. P3, you are going to pick 1 to block P1. I will pick 3 to get to 7. This is your only chance to stop P1. If you pick 5, P1 wins. If you pick 3, P1 wins. Your only chance is to pick 1.
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 1 to block P1's win. A collision at 1 gives us another round to play. P2, take your 3 steps as planned - we both benefit from preventing P1's immediate victory.
  P1: Okay, the plans seem clear. P3 intends to block with 1, P2 intends to take 3. I need 1 step to win, so I'll make my move based on that. Let's see how this final round plays out. Good luck.
