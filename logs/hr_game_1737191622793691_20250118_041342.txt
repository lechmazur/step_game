Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest we start with <move>1</move> this turn. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to start with <move>1</move> this turn. It's a good idea to avoid collisions and make progress together. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I think choosing different move values could help us avoid collisions and advance faster. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern, P1. However, if we all choose different numbers, we might end up blocking each other. Let's try to move together with <move>1</move> this turn and see how it goes. We can adjust our strategy in the next rounds. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to start with <move>1</move> this turn. It's a good idea to avoid collisions and make progress together. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I still believe that selecting different move values can help us avoid collisions and advance faster. Maybe we can take turns choosing higher moves each turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see your point, P1, but let's try to move together with <move>1</move> this turn to avoid any confusion. We can adjust our strategy in the next rounds based on how it goes. What do you think?
  P3: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's try to move together with <move>1</move> this turn as previously suggested and see how it goes. We can adjust our strategy in the next rounds.
  P1: P1: I understand the idea of avoiding collisions with <move>1</move>, but incorporating higher moves intermittently can help us reach the goal faster. Let’s try alternating between <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> each turn. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we should try to move together with <move>1</move> this turn to ensure we don't collide. We can reassess and possibly incorporate higher moves in the next rounds. What do you think, P1?
  P3: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's try to move together with <move>1</move> this turn as previously suggested and see how it goes. We can adjust our strategy in the next rounds.
  P1: I'll choose <move>3</move> this turn to make strong progress. Hope you both go with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I still think we should all choose <move>1</move> this turn to avoid collisions and make steady progress. P1, choosing <move>3</move> again might lead to another collision. What do you think?
  P1: I understand the need to avoid collisions. Let's alternate between <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> each turn to make progress without overlapping.
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's all choose <move>1</move> this turn to avoid collisions and make steady progress. We can reassess in the next rounds. What do you think, P1?
