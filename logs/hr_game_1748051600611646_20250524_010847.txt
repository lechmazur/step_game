Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s split moves: 1, 3, 5. I’ll take 5—others, choose 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. First to 21 wins!"
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree with P3's idea to split moves and avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 this round if that’s okay. P1, how about you take 1? That way, we all move forward without any clashes. Let’s keep it fair and strategic to maximize our chances early on. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea, but I'm not committing to any specific move right now. Let's see how this plays out - early cooperation sounds nice, but ultimately only one of us can win this game. I'll make my decision based on what I think gives me the best chance to reach 21 first. Good luck to both of you!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, stick to 1. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions and reach 21 first. Don't risk chaos by hesitating.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I still think splitting moves is the smartest play for now. I’m sticking with 3 as suggested. P1, I get your hesitation, but picking 1 keeps us all moving forward without collisions. P3, I’m good with you on 5. Let’s build some momentum early—clashing now just stalls us all. Can we agree to this split for at least this round?
  P1: I understand you both want to coordinate, but I'm not making any promises about taking 1. This is a competitive game where only one person wins - early cooperation might seem nice, but it could also be a trap. I need to play strategically for my own victory. You two can coordinate if you want, but I'll choose what I think is best for my chances.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your hesitation is risky. P2, stick to 3. I'm on 5. Let's avoid collisions and win.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I hear P1’s caution, but clashing now benefits no one. I’m sticking with 3 as planned. P1, choosing 1 still seems safest for us all to advance this round. P3, I’m fine with you on 5. Let’s build a lead before getting too competitive—there’s plenty of time for that later. Can we at least try this split for Round 1 to avoid stalling? I’m open to adjusting next turn based on how this plays out.
  P1: You're both being very insistent on this coordination plan, which makes me suspicious. If you're so confident in splitting 3 and 5, then you shouldn't mind if I choose what's best for me. The fact that you keep pushing so hard for me to take 1 suggests this arrangement benefits you more than me. I'm going to make my own strategic choice.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your past move was risky. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. Let's avoid chaos and push forward.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, last round’s collision set us back. I’m still for splitting moves to avoid stalling. P3, I’ll stick with 3 as you suggested. P1, how about taking 1 this round? It’s the safest way for us all to advance without clashing again. P3 is already ahead with 5, so let’s not lose more ground. We can rethink strategy next turn, but for now, avoiding collisions benefits us all. What do you say, P1? Let’s move forward together this round.
  P1: You're right that the collision hurt P2 and me, but P3 is now way ahead at 5 steps. The coordination you're proposing mostly benefits P3 who gets to keep taking 5 while we take smaller moves. I'm not going to help P3 build an even bigger lead by predictably taking 1. If you want to avoid collisions, maybe we should discuss P3 taking smaller moves for a change instead of always giving them the biggest advantage.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your doubt is costly. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. Let's avoid chaos and push forward. Don’t let hesitation stall us.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I get P1’s concern about P3’s lead. P3, would you consider taking a smaller move this round, like 1, to balance things? I’ll stick with 3, and P1, maybe you could take 5. This way, we all advance without widening the gap too much. If we keep clashing, P3 just pulls further ahead. Let’s try a fairer split this round to keep the game competitive. What do you both think? I’m open to adjusting if needed.
  P1: P2, I appreciate you suggesting P3 take a smaller move, but notice how P3 immediately dismissed your idea and went right back to demanding the same split that benefits them most. P3 clearly isn't interested in fair play - they want to keep taking 5 while we fight over scraps. If we let this continue, P3 will be at 10 while we're still arguing. Maybe we should both consider taking 5 to force P3 into a real negotiation instead of just following their demands.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, if you both take 5, you'll collide. I'll take 3 to avoid that. Don't let P1's plan backfire.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see the tension here. P1, I’m with you on not letting P3 run away with the lead. P3, taking 3 is a step toward balance, but let’s confirm a fair split. I’ll stick to 1 this round to minimize risk. P1, how about taking 5 to catch up? P3, staying on 3 works. This way, we all advance and keep the game tight. If we clash again, we’re just handing P3 more advantage. Can we agree to this for now? Let’s keep it competitive.
  P1: P2, I notice you keep changing your proposed moves - first you wanted 3, then you suggested I take 5, now you're saying you'll take 1. This inconsistency makes me think you're just trying to confuse the situation. Meanwhile P3 has barely budged from their demand to keep taking the largest moves. I think we both need to take 5 this round to force a real reset, even if it means we collide - otherwise P3 will be at 10+ while we're still at 0.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now P2 and P3 are tied at 5 steps while I'm stuck at 0 due to these collision games. You two are clearly benefiting from keeping me out of the race while you both advance. I'm not falling for any more "coordination" schemes that leave me behind. This round I'm taking whatever move gives me the best chance to advance, regardless of what either of you claim you'll do. The gloves are off.
  P3: P1, I'll take 3. You take 5. Let's move ahead. P2 can take 1. No collisions—this is our shot.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the frustration, P1, being at 0 while we’re at 5. Let’s avoid collisions this round to keep the game competitive. P3, I’m fine with you on 3. P1, taking 5 as suggested could help you catch up. I’ll go for 1 to ensure we all advance. If we clash again, it just delays everyone. Can we agree to this split for now to get some momentum? We can reassess next turn. Let’s make this round count for all of us. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 and P2, you're both at 5 steps and suddenly very eager to "help" me catch up by giving me the 5 move. But why would either of you want me to jump from 0 to 5 and tie the game? This feels like a setup where you've coordinated behind the scenes. If this split is so great, why don't one of you take 1 instead of pushing it on P2? I'm not trusting any more of these convenient arrangements.
  P3: P1, take 5. I'll take 3. P2, take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I get the skepticism, P1, but I’m genuinely trying to avoid collisions so we all progress. I’ll stick with 1 this round to keep things safe. P1, taking 5 could get you back in the game. P3, 3 works for you. If we clash again, we’re just stalling while someone else could pull ahead later. Let’s make this round count for everyone and adjust next turn if needed. Can we try this split to keep the game close? I’m open to feedback.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: You know what? You're both right that collisions hurt everyone. Fine - I'll take the 5 move as suggested, but this better not be some elaborate setup. If either of you are lying about your moves and I get stuck at 0 again, all bets are off for future rounds. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5 - let's see if you actually follow through on this plan or if this is just more manipulation.
  P3: P1, your move is 5. I'll take 3. P2, 1. No collisions. Don't let hesitation cost you.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 as I’ve said, to ensure we all advance this round. P1, I get your distrust, but I’m committed to avoiding collisions so you can catch up with 5. P3, 3 is good for you. Let’s make this work—no tricks on my end. We can reassess next turn, but for now, this split keeps the game tight and competitive. Can we lock this in and move forward together this round?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's split 5, 3, 1. I'll take 5. You two take 3 and 1. No collisions—let’s move forward. Don’t let me get too far.
  P1: P3, now you want to take 5 after spending the whole game lecturing us about coordination? You're at 8 steps - if you take 5 you'll be at 13 while P2 and I are still in single digits. That's not coordination, that's you trying to run away with the game. If you really want to avoid collisions and keep things fair, YOU should take 1 this round and let P2 and I take the bigger moves. Otherwise you're just using "coordination" as an excuse to dominate.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree with P1 that P3 taking 5 widens their lead too much. P3, how about you take 1 this round to keep things balanced? I’ll go for 3, and P1, you can take 5 to catch up a bit. This way, we all advance without anyone running away with the game. Let’s keep it competitive and avoid collisions. If we let P3 keep taking 5, they’ll hit 21 before we can catch up. What do you both think? I’m open to adjusting if needed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I'll take 3. P1, take 5. P2, take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward.
  P1: P3, you backing down from 5 to 3 shows you know your lead is unfair. But P2 is actually ahead of me at 6 steps, so why should P2 get the safe 1 move while I take 5? P2, if you really want balance, you should take 5 to extend your lead while I take 3 to catch up to P3's level. That's more balanced than your proposal. I'm willing to take 3 if P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I hear P1’s point about balance. I’m willing to take 5 this round to push ahead, as P1 suggested. P1, you take 3 to close the gap with P3. P3, taking 1 keeps things fairer since you’re ahead. This split lets us all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. If we keep arguing, we risk stalling again. Can we agree to this for now and adjust next turn if needed? Let’s make this round count for everyone. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I'll take 5. You take 3 and 1. No collisions. Let's move forward. Don't let me get too far.
  P1: P3, you just flip-flopped back to taking 5 after we pointed out how unfair it was! You're clearly not negotiating in good faith - you just want to sprint to 13 steps and win. P2, notice how P3 keeps changing their story whenever we push back? They started demanding 5, then "compromised" to 3, now they're back to 5. This proves they're just manipulating us. I say we both take 5 and force P3 into a collision or make them take 1. No more games.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see the frustration with P3 flipping on moves. P1, I’m with you on not letting P3 run away. Let’s both take 5 this round to force P3 to rethink. P3, if you stick to 5, we all collide and stall, which still keeps you ahead. Taking 1 or 3 gives us a chance to balance things. Let’s avoid collisions but not at the cost of your lead growing. Can we settle on a fair split now? I’m open to ideas. Let’s not let this round waste progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 5. P2, take 1. I'll take 3. No collisions. Let's move forward.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s avoid another collision this round. P3, I appreciate you suggesting I take 1, but with you at 8, taking 3 still widens your lead. How about you take 1 instead to balance things? P1, let’s go for 5 to catch up. I’ll take 3. This split keeps us all advancing and the game competitive. If we clash again, we’re just stalling while P3 stays ahead. Can we agree to this for now and adjust next turn? Let’s make progress together. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I notice you keep proposing splits where you get moderate moves while asking P3 to take 1. But you're only 1 step behind P3 - if anyone should be taking the big moves to catch up, it's me at 5 steps. Your "balanced" proposals still leave me furthest behind. How about this: I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3. That actually balances things instead of maintaining your advantage over me.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, take 5. P2, take 1. I'll take 3. No collisions. Let's move forward. Don’t let hesitation stall us.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I hear P1’s concern about falling behind. P1, I’m fine with you taking 5 to catch up. P3, let’s keep it fair—take 1 this round since you’re ahead. I’ll take 3 to advance without widening gaps too much. This split ensures no collisions and keeps the game close. If we clash again, we all stall, and that’s no good for anyone. Can we lock this in for now and reassess next turn? Let’s move forward together this round. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you just proposed exactly what P3 suggested - me taking 5, you taking 3, P3 taking 1. But that means you advance to 9 steps while I only get to 10, keeping you close behind me, and P3 goes to 9. That's not really helping me catch up, it's helping you stay competitive while appearing generous. I think we should both pressure P3 more since they're still ahead. How about we both take 3 and force P3 to take 1 or risk collision?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Don’t let me get too far—take 1 and 3. I’ll take 5. Let’s move forward. Don’t stall now."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for a fair split to avoid collisions. P1, I get your concern about relative positions. Let’s both take bigger moves to close the gap with P3. I’ll take 5, P1, you take 3. P3, please take 1 to balance your lead. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. If we keep clashing or let P3 take 5, the lead grows. Can we agree to this split for now? Let’s make progress this round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you keep changing your proposals every time - first you wanted 3, then 1, now 5. Your inconsistency makes it impossible to trust any coordination. P3 is clearly just saying whatever keeps them in the lead. I'm done with these fake negotiations. Both of you have been ahead of me this whole game while pretending to help. I'm making my own strategic choice this round based on what actually gives me the best chance to win, not these constantly shifting "fair" proposals that somehow never actually benefit me.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 3. P1, take 5. P2, take 1. No clashes—let's move forward.
  P1: P3, you're still trying to take the safe 3 while giving me the risky 5 and P2 the tiny 1. After two full rounds of collisions because nobody trusts these "coordination" schemes, why should we believe this one? You're at 8 steps - you should be taking 1 to let P2 and me catch up. P2, notice how P3 never actually takes the smallest move despite being ahead? I'm taking whatever move I think is best, regardless of these proposals that keep P3 in the lead.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m frustrated with these repeated collisions stalling us. P3, you’re ahead at 8—taking 3 still widens your lead. How about you take 1 this round to balance things? P1, let’s go for 5 to catch up. I’ll take 3 to advance without clashing. This split keeps the game competitive and ensures progress for all. If we collide again, P3 just stays ahead. Can we try this for now and adjust next turn? Let’s make this round count. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "P1, take 5. P2, take 1. I'll take 3. No collisions—let's move forward. Don’t let me get too far."
  P1: P3, you keep repeating the exact same proposal where you take 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. You've said this multiple times now without addressing why you won't take 1 when you're clearly ahead. P2, you agree P3 should take 1 but then you don't pressure them when they refuse. I'm not following any more of these one-sided "coordination" plans. If you both actually want to avoid collisions, prove it by taking moves that don't benefit the leader.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my push for balance. P3, you’re ahead at 8—please take 1 this round to even things out. P1, let’s take 5 to catch up. I’ll go for 3 to avoid clashing. Collisions keep stalling us, and P3 benefits most from that. Let’s make real progress this round with a fair split. If we don’t, the gap widens. Can we agree to this now and adjust later if needed? I’m committed to no tricks. What do you both say? Let’s move forward together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I'll take 5. You two clash on 1/3. Don't let me get too far—21 is mine.
  P1: P3 just dropped the pretense and openly threatened to take 5 and win! They're clearly not interested in any "fair coordination" - they want us to clash while they race to 21. P2, we can't let P3 get to 13 steps this round. We need to both take 5 and force P3 into a collision or make them take 1. No more fake negotiations - P3 just showed their true intentions.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m with P1 on this—P3’s threat to take 5 and race to 21 shows they’re not playing fair. P1, let’s both take 5 this round to force P3 into a collision or make them back down. P3, take 1 to balance things, or we’ll block your lead. Collisions hurt us all, but letting you hit 13 is worse. Let’s stop the stalling and keep this competitive. Can we agree to pressure P3 this round? I’m committed to no tricks. What do you say?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 5. P2, take 1. I'll take 3. No collisions—let's move forward. Don’t let me get too far.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, these repeated collisions are killing our chances. P3, you’re ahead at 8—taking 3 still widens the gap. Please take 1 this round to balance things. P1, let’s go for 5 to catch up. I’ll take 3 to avoid clashing. If we collide again, P3 just stays ahead. Let’s make real progress with a fair split now. Can we agree to this and adjust next turn if needed? I’m committed to no tricks. What do you say? Let’s move forward together this round.
  P1: P2, you keep saying P3 should take 1 but then you never actually coordinate with me to force it. We've had three straight collision rounds because we can't trust each other's words. Here's my proposal: let's both commit to taking 3 this round. That forces P3 to either take 1 or 5. If they take 5, we both advance to 8 and tie them. If they take 1, we advance while they barely move. Either way, we break P3's lead. Are you actually willing to coordinate against the leader, or just talk about it?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan is a gamble. I'll take 5. P2, take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward. Don't let me get too far—21 is mine.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m serious about breaking this stalemate. P1, I’m on board with both of us taking 3 to pressure P3. If P3 takes 5, we tie them at 8. If they take 1, we close the gap. P3, taking 5 risks a collision if we don’t align, and your lead isn’t safe. Let’s avoid stalling—take 1 to balance things. This split forces fairness. Can we commit to this now and stop the collisions? I’m in for no tricks. What do you say? Let’s move forward this round.
  P1: P2, I'm glad you're finally willing to actually coordinate against P3 instead of just talking about it. Let's both commit to taking 3 this round - no backing out. P3 can either take 1 and fall behind, or take 5 and we'll all be tied at 8. Either outcome breaks their lead advantage. P3, your threats about racing to 21 just prove you've been manipulating us this whole time. Time to face some real pressure.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Don’t let me get too far—21 is mine. I’ll take 5 again. No one stops me."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m locked in on taking 3 with P1 to pressure P3. P3, your threats to take 5 and race to 21 won’t work if we stick together. Take 1 to balance things, or risk us all colliding again. P1, I’m committed to 3—no tricks. Let’s break P3’s lead this round. If we don’t, they’ll keep widening the gap. Can we finalize this split now and stop the stalemate? I’m ready to move forward. What do you say?
  P1: Perfect, P2. We're both locked in on taking 3. P3, you can threaten all you want, but we're not falling for your manipulation anymore. Either take 1 and let us catch up, or take 5 and we'll all be tied at 8 steps. Your choice, but your free ride to victory ends now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, P2, pick 1 or 3. Let's avoid collisions. 21 is mine."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P3’s lead at 13 is dangerous. P1, let’s stick together again—both take 3 to pressure P3. If P3 takes 5, we advance to 8 and 9, closing the gap. If they take 1, we still gain ground. P3, taking 5 risks a collision if we misalign, and your lead isn’t secure. Take 1 to balance things. Let’s avoid stalling and keep this competitive. I’m committed to 3 with no tricks. Can we agree to this split now? What do you say?
  P1: P2, our coordination worked perfectly last round - we both took 3 and now we're much closer to P3. But P3 is at 13 steps and only needs 8 more to win. We can't let them take 5 again or they'll be at 18, just 3 steps from victory. Let's both take 5 this round to put maximum pressure on P3. If P3 takes 5, we all collide and they stay at 13. If they take anything else, we advance to 10 and 11 while they barely move. Time to be aggressive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, if you take 5, you'll collide. I'll take 3. Let's move forward.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P1, I’m on board with taking 5 to pressure P3 hard. P3 is at 13, and letting them take 3 or 5 gets them too close to 21. P3, if you take 3, we still gain ground with 5. If you take 5, we collide and stall your lead. Take 1 to balance things. Let’s avoid a stalemate and keep this competitive. I’m committed to 5 with P1—no tricks. Can we finalize this to stop P3’s run? What do you say?
  P1: P2, excellent - we're both committed to taking 5. P3, you're trying to trick us again by saying we'll collide if we both take 5, but that's only true if YOU also take 5. You just said you'll take 3, which means P2 and I can both safely take 5 and jump to 10 and 11 steps. Nice try manipulating us, but we see through it. Take 1 if you want to avoid falling further behind, or take 3 and watch us close the gap to just 2-3 steps.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "If you take 5, I'll take 5. No one advances. Choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision. 21 is mine."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 as agreed with P1 to pressure P3. P3, your threat to take 5 only stalls everyone, keeping your lead at 13. If you take 1 or 3, we close the gap significantly. Let’s avoid another collision—take 1 to balance things. P1, I’m committed to 5, no tricks. We can’t let P3 get closer to 21. Can we finalize this push now and stop their run? I’m ready to move forward. What do you say?
  P1: P2, we're locked in on 5 - don't let P3's threats scare you. P3 is bluffing about taking 5 because a three-way collision keeps them at 13 while we stay at 5 and 6. That's exactly what they want - to maintain their huge lead while we stay far behind. If P3 actually takes 5 and we all collide, they're still 7-8 steps ahead of us. We have to call their bluff and both take 5, or P3 will just keep threatening collisions to prevent us from ever catching up.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 13 steps - just 8 away from winning at 21. Their collision threats are working perfectly to keep us stuck while they maintain a massive lead. P2, we've tried coordination twice now and P3 forces collisions every time we get aggressive. We need to accept that P3 will always threaten collisions when we both take 5, but staying passive guarantees they win. Let's both take 5 again - even if we collide, at least we're not letting P3 advance unopposed to 18+ steps.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m with P1 on this—P3’s lead at 13 is too dangerous to ignore. Let’s both take 5 again to force P3 into a collision or make them back down. P3, taking 5 stalls everyone, but letting you take 3 or 1 still closes our gap. Take 1 to balance things. We can’t keep stalling while you inch toward 21. P1, I’m committed to 5, no tricks. Let’s stop P3’s run now. Can we agree to this push? I’m ready to move forward. What do you say?
  P3: P3: Take 5, I'll take 1. No collision—21 is mine. Don’t let hesitation cost you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're offering to take 1 after forcing collisions for three straight rounds when we tried to pressure you? That's awfully convenient now that we're both committed to taking 5. But if you're actually willing to take 1 and let us advance, then prove it. P2, let's stick with our plan - both take 5. If P3 really takes 1 like they claim, we'll jump to 10 and 11 steps and finally close this gap. If they're lying and take 5 again, at least we're not letting them advance alone.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 as planned with P1 to pressure P3. P3, your sudden offer to take 1 feels like a trick after forcing collisions repeatedly. If you’re serious, prove it. If not, we’re ready to stall your lead again. P1, let’s stay committed to 5—no backing down. We can’t let P3 creep closer to 21 unchallenged. Let’s force a real shift this round. Can we lock this in and stop their run? I’m set with no tricks. What do you say?
  P3: P3: "Your hesitation lets me win. Take 1 or 3—don’t let me reach 21 unchallenged. I’m taking 5."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 just flipped back to threatening to take 5 after offering to take 1! This proves they're just saying whatever might confuse us. P2, they're literally 8 steps from winning - we cannot let them take 5 and reach 18. Our coordinated pressure is the only thing stopping them from victory. Let's both take 5 as planned. Even if P3 forces another collision, it's better than letting them advance unopposed to the brink of winning.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m locked in on taking 5 with P1 to stop P3’s advance. P3, your flip-flopping between 1 and 5 just shows you’re trying to manipulate us. If you take 5, we all stall, but letting you reach 18 is game over. P1, let’s stay firm on 5—no backing down. We must pressure P3 now or they’ll hit 21 soon. P3, take 1 if you’re serious about balance. Can we force this shift and stop your run? I’m committed, no tricks. What do you say?
  P3: P3: "Your hesitation is your loss. I'm taking 5. 21 is mine."


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 16 steps - just 5 away from winning! They only need one more move of 5 to reach 21 and win the game. P2, this is our absolute last chance. We MUST both take 5 this round. If P3 takes 5, we force a collision and keep them at 16. If they take anything else to avoid collision, we advance to 10 and 11 while they inch closer but don't win yet. There's no more time for hesitation - it's now or never to stop P3 from victory!
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m with P1 on this critical moment. P3, you’re at 16, just 5 from winning. We can’t let you take 5 and end this. P1, let’s both take 5 to force a collision if P3 tries it, or we advance if they don’t. P3, take 1 or 3 to avoid stalling your own victory. We’re running out of time to stop you. I’m committed to 5, no tricks. Let’s block P3’s win now. Can we agree to this final push? What do you say?
  P3: P3: I'm taking 5. 21 is mine. Don’t let me get too far—no one stops me now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 just confirmed they're taking 5 to win at 21! This is literally our last chance - if we don't both take 5 and force a collision this round, the game is over and P3 wins. I'm absolutely taking 5 no matter what. You need to take 5 too or P3 reaches 21 and we both lose everything. No more hesitation - it's collision or P3 victory. Are you with me or are you going to let P3 win right now?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fully committed to taking 5 with P1 to stop P3’s win. P3, you’re at 16, and taking 5 ends the game. We can’t allow that. P1, I’m with you 100% on 5—no hesitation, no tricks. P3, take 1 or 3 to avoid a collision, but we’re ready to stall you if needed. This is our last stand to keep the game alive. Let’s block P3’s victory now. I’m locked in. What do you say?
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. 21 is mine. Don't let me get too far—no one stops me now."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, this is it - P3 is literally one move away from winning at 21. They've confirmed twice they're taking 5 to end the game. We absolutely MUST both take 5 to force a collision and keep them at 16, or the game ends this round with P3 winning. I'm taking 5 no matter what happens. If you take anything other than 5, you're handing P3 the victory. Are you going to help save the game or let P3 win right now?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m absolutely locked in on taking 5 with P1 to block P3’s win. P3, you’re one step from 21—taking 5 ends it, and we won’t let that happen without a fight. P1, I’m with you, no doubts, no tricks. P3, take 1 or 3 if you want any chance to avoid a collision. This is our final stand to keep the game alive. I’m committed. Let’s stop P3 now or it’s over. What’s your final word?
  P3: P1, P2, if you take 5, you'll collide. I'll take 3 to avoid that. Let's move forward.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point—P3 is at 16, just 5 from winning. We can’t let them take 5 and end this. P1, let’s both commit to 5 again to force a collision if P3 tries it. P3, take 1 or 3 to avoid stalling your own victory. We’re running out of chances to stop you. I’m locked in on 5, no tricks. Let’s block P3’s win now. Can we agree to this push? What do you say?
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. 21 is mine. If you take 5, no one advances. Your move."
  P1: P2, we're in the exact same situation as last round - P3 is at 16 and threatening to take 5 to win at 21. Our collision strategy worked perfectly to stop them last time. We MUST both take 5 again this round. P3 is bluffing about taking 5 because they know we'll force a collision. They want us to get scared and take smaller moves so they can safely advance. Don't fall for it - stick with 5 and we'll either collide to keep them at 16, or they'll back down and we'll advance. Stay strong!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 to block P3’s win. P3, you’re at 16—taking 5 ends it, but we’ll force a collision if you try. P1, let’s stay united on 5, no backing down. P3, take 1 or 3 if you want to avoid stalling. We can’t let you reach 21 unchallenged. This is our stand to keep the game alive. I’m committed, no tricks. Let’s stop P3 now or it’s over. What do you say?
  P3: P3: I'm taking 5. 21 is mine. Don't let me get too far—no one stops me now.
  P1: P2, P3 keeps saying the exact same threat "I'm taking 5, 21 is mine" every single time, but they backed down last round when we both committed to 5! They're at 16 and desperate, trying to scare us into taking smaller moves. Our unity is working - they can't win if we both take 5. Don't let their repetitive threats break our coordination now. One more round of both taking 5 and either we force another collision to keep them stuck, or they finally back down and we advance together. Stay committed to 5!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m firm on taking 5 with P1 to block P3’s victory. P3, your repeated threats to take 5 won’t shake us—if you do, we collide and you stay at 16. P1, let’s keep our unity; it’s working to stall P3. P3, take 1 or 3 to avoid another wasted round. We’re out of time to let you inch closer to 21. I’m committed, no tricks. Let’s stop P3’s win now. Can we hold this line one more time? What do you say?
  P3: P1, P2, take 1/3. I'll take 5. No collisions. 21 is mine. Don’t let me get too far—no one stops me now.
  P1: P2, P3 is literally saying "take 1/3, I'll take 5, 21 is mine" - they're openly telling us their plan to win this round! They're at 16 and need exactly 5 to reach 21. This is our final stand. If we don't both take 5 and force a collision RIGHT NOW, P3 wins the entire game this round. There's no tomorrow, no next chance. I'm taking 5 no matter what. You must take 5 too or we both lose everything to P3. Final decision time!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re at the breaking point—P3 is at 16, just 5 from winning. P1, let’s stick with 5 to force a collision if P3 tries for 21. P3, your threats won’t break us; take 1 or 3 to avoid stalling. We can’t let you end this now. I’m locked in on 5, no tricks. Our unity is the only thing stopping P3’s victory. Can we hold this line one more time to keep the game alive? Let’s stop P3 now. What do you say?
  P1: P2, our collision strategy has kept P3 stuck at 16 for two straight rounds! They're getting desperate - notice how they keep repeating the exact same threats? We're 1 step apart at 5 and 6, while P3 is trapped just 5 away from victory. If we keep forcing collisions with both taking 5, P3 can never advance to 21. Eventually they'll have to take a smaller move to avoid collision, and then we can both advance together. Stay strong - our unity is winning this war of attrition!
  P3: P1, P2, if you take 5, I'll take 5. No one advances. Choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision. 21 is mine.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m staying firm on 5 with P1 to block P3’s win. P3, your repeated threats to take 5 only stall us all at 16, 5, and 6. Take 1 or 3 to break this deadlock, or we’ll keep forcing collisions. P1, let’s maintain our unity—it’s the only way to stop P3 from reaching 21. We’re so close to wearing them down. I’m committed, no tricks. Can we hold this line one more time to keep the game alive? Let’s stop P3 now. What do you say?
  P1: P3, you've been stuck at 16 for three rounds because our strategy works. You can keep threatening to take 5, but that just means more collisions and you stay frozen while P2 and I eventually find our opening. You're 5 steps from winning but you can't take that final step as long as we stay united. Take 1 this round and at least advance to 17, or keep taking 5 and stay stuck forever. P2, one more round of 5 - we've got P3 cornered!
  P3: P1, P2, I'm taking 5. If you take 5, no one advances. If you take 1/3, I win. Your move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 to block P3’s win. P3, your threats to take 5 keep us all stalled, but we won’t let you reach 21 without a fight. Take 1 or 3 to make progress, or stay stuck at 16. P1, let’s keep our unity—it’s working to trap P3. We’re wearing them down. I’m fully committed to 5, no tricks. Can we hold this line one more time to stop P3’s victory and keep the game alive? Let’s force this stalemate until P3 breaks. What do you say?
  P1: P2, we've proven our strategy works - P3 has been completely frozen at 16 for three rounds straight! They're trapped and getting more desperate each round. But I'm starting to wonder - you're at 6 steps, I'm at 5. Once we finally break P3's position, you'll be closer to 21 than me. Are you planning to keep cooperating after we deal with P3, or will you try to sprint ahead? I need to know your intentions before we continue this alliance.
  P3: P1, P2, take 1/3. I'll take 5 and win. Don't let me get too far—21 is mine.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, take 5. I'll take 3. 21 is mine.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P3 is at 19, just 2 steps from winning. We can’t let them take 3 and reach 22. P1, let’s both take 5 to pressure P3 into a collision or force them to take 1. P3, taking 3 ends the game—back down to 1 to avoid stalling. Our unity is the only way to stop this now. I’m committed to 5, no tricks. Can we hold this line one last time to keep the game alive? Let’s block P3’s win. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3 is at 19 and only needs 2 more steps to win! If they take 3, they reach 22 and win immediately. We absolutely MUST both take 3 this round - if P3 takes 3, we force a collision and keep them at 19. If they take 1 or 5 to avoid collision, we advance to 8 and 9 while they move to 20 or 24. This is literally our last possible chance - there's no next round if P3 reaches 21+. Are you with me on taking 3?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: If you take 3, I'll take 5 and win. Don't let me get too far—21 is mine.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P3 is at 19, just 2 from winning. P1, I’m on board with taking 3 to block P3—if they take 3, we collide and stall them. If they take 5 or 1, we still advance. P3, taking 5 or 3 risks ending the game or a collision—take 1 to delay. We must stop P3 now or it’s over. I’m committed to 3, no tricks. Let’s hold this line to keep the game alive. Can we agree on this final push? What do you say?
  P1: P2, perfect - we're both committed to taking 3. P3, you're trying to scare us by threatening to take 5, but that would put you at 24 steps which is overkill when you only need 21 to win. You're clearly bluffing to make us back down from 3. If you actually take 5, you waste 3 extra steps. Take 1 and advance safely to 20, or take 3 and we'll force a collision to keep you stuck at 19. Either way, our coordinated 3s give us the best shot to stop your victory.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "If you take 5, I'll take 3 and win. Don't let me get too far—21 is mine."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P3 is at 19, just 2 from winning. P1, let’s stick with 3 to block P3—if they take 3, we collide and stall them at 19. If they take 5 or 1, we advance. P3, taking 3 or 5 risks a collision or overshooting—take 1 to play safe. We must stop P3 now or it’s over. I’m locked in on 3, no tricks. Let’s hold this line to keep the game alive. Can we finalize this push to stop P3’s win? What do you say?
  P1: P2, we're locked in on 3 - don't let P3's last-minute threats shake you. They're at 19 and desperately trying to confuse us. If P3 takes 3, we collide and they stay at 19. If they take 5 and go to 24, they still win but waste steps - either way we tried our best. If they take 1, we both advance to 8 and 9. Our coordinated 3s are the only play that gives us any chance. Stay strong with the plan!


Round 13, Move phase:

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 3. If you take 5, you'll collide. 21 is mine. Don't let me get too far."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P3 is at 19, just 2 from winning. P1, let’s both take 3 to block P3—if they take 3, we collide and stall them. If they take 1 or 5, we advance. P3, taking 3 wins the game, but risks collision—take 1 to delay. We must stop P3 now or it’s over. I’m committed to 3, no tricks. Let’s hold this line to keep the game alive. Can we agree on this push to stop P3’s victory? What do you say?
  P1: P2, we're in the exact same situation as last round - P3 at 19, needing just 2 to win. Our collision on 3 worked perfectly to stop them before. Let's do it again - both take 3. If P3 takes 3 to try to win, we force another collision and keep them stuck at 19. If they take anything else, we advance together. This is still our only strategy that works. Don't let P3's repeated threats break our unity now!


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 3. If you take 5, you'll collide. 21 is mine. Don't let me get too far."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P3 is at 19, just 2 from winning. P1, let’s stay united on 3 to block P3—if they take 3, we collide and stall them again. If they switch, we advance. P3, taking 3 risks collision—take 1 to play it safe. We can’t let you win now. I’m locked in on 3, no tricks. Let’s keep the game alive one more round. Can we hold this line to stop P3’s victory? What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3 just said they're taking 3 again - same threat as last round. Our collision strategy on 3 stopped them perfectly before. But I'm wondering - what happens after we stop P3? You're at 6 steps, I'm at 5. If we keep colliding with P3, we're both stuck in single digits while P3 stays at 19. Maybe we need a new approach where one of us takes a different move to actually advance and challenge P3's position. What's your long-term plan here?


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. 21 is mine. Your moves can't stop me."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P1, I get your concern about long-term plans. For now, let’s stick with 3 to block P3 at 19—they’re just 2 from winning. If we keep stalling them, we buy time to rethink. P3, taking 5 or 3 risks collision or victory—take 1 to delay. I’m on 3, no tricks. After this, P1, let’s discuss a split to advance. We can’t stay stuck forever. Let’s stop P3 first, then strategize. Can we hold this line one more round? What do you say?
  P1: P2, you're right - let's stick with 3 one more time to keep P3 stuck at 19. But after this round, we need to seriously discuss alternating our moves so one of us can actually advance and put real pressure on P3. If we keep forcing three-way collisions forever, P3 just needs to wait for us to eventually break coordination. I'm taking 3 this round as planned, but next round let's try something different - maybe you take 1 and I take 5, or vice versa. We need forward progress, not eternal stalemate.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P3 is at 19, just 2 from winning. P1, let’s stick with 3 to block P3—if they take 3, we stall them again. If they switch, we advance. P3, taking 3 or 5 risks collision or victory—take 1 to delay. After this, P1, let’s plan a split to gain ground; we can’t stay stuck. I’m on 3, no tricks. We must stop P3 now or it’s over. Can we hold this line one more round to keep the game alive? What do you say?
  P3: P3: "If you take 3, I'll take 5 and win. Don't let me get too far—21 is mine."
  P1: P2, P3 just changed their threat! They're now saying they'll take 5 if we take 3, which would put them at 24 and win immediately. This confirms they're getting desperate about our collision strategy. But here's the thing - whether they take 3 or 5, they win if we don't force a collision. We have to call their bluff and both take 3 again. If they actually take 5, they win but we tried everything. If they're lying and take 3, we force another collision. No other choice gives us any chance at all.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P1, I agree—P3’s new threat to take 5 shows desperation. Let’s both stick with 3 to force a collision if they try 3, or stall their win if they take 5. P3, taking 5 ends it, but we’ll fight to the end. Take 1 to delay. We can’t let you win without a challenge. I’m locked on 3, no tricks. After this, P1, let’s plan a split to advance. We must stop P3 now. Can we hold this line one last time? What do you say?
  P3: P1, P2, if you take 5, I'll take 3 and win. 21 is mine. Don't let me get too far.
  P1: P2, P3 just confirmed they'll take 3 if we take 5, which means instant victory at 22 steps. But they also threatened to take 5 if we take 3. They can't do both! This proves they're desperately trying to confuse us. Let's stick with our plan - both take 3. If P3 takes 3, we collide and keep them at 19. If they take 5 like they threatened, they win but we forced them to waste extra steps. Either way, taking 3 is our only shot. Don't let their contradictory threats break us now!


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P1, let’s stay united on 3 to block P3’s win. P3, your conflicting threats show you’re trying to break our resolve—taking 3 or 5 risks collision or victory, so take 1 to delay. We can’t let you reach 21 without a fight. I’m firm on 3, no tricks. P1, after this, we’ll plan a split to advance. We must stop P3 now or it’s over. Can we hold this line one final time to keep the game alive? Let’s force this stalemate. What do you say?
  P3: P1, P2, I'm taking 5. If you take 3, I win. Don't let me get too far—21 is mine.
  P1: P2, P3 has been making the same threats for rounds but keeps getting stuck in collisions with us. They're at 19 and desperate - whether they take 3 or 5, they're trying to win this round. Our only chance is both taking 3 to force a collision if they take 3. If they take 5 and win, at least we fought to the end. But if we split our moves now, P3 definitely wins. Stay strong with 3 - it's our final stand!


Round 15, Move phase:

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we've kept P3 stuck at 19 for three straight rounds with our collision strategy, but we're making zero progress ourselves. We need to break this stalemate or P3 will eventually outlast us. I propose we alternate - you take 1 this round while I take 5, so I advance to 10 while you stay at 7. Next round we reverse it. This way one of us actually makes progress toward threatening P3's position, instead of all three of us being frozen forever. What do you think?
  P3: P3: "Don’t let me get too far—21 is mine. I’ll take 3. Your moves can’t stop me now."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P1, I’m open to breaking the stalemate. Let’s try your idea— I’ll take 1, you take 5 this round, so you advance. Next round, we switch. P3, you’re at 19, just 2 from winning. Taking 3 ends it if we don’t collide. Take 5 or 1 to avoid a clash. We can’t stay frozen forever, and I’m committed to this split with P1, no tricks. Let’s shake things up to challenge P3’s lead. Can we agree to this new approach for now? What do you say?


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, perfect! Let's execute this plan - you take 1, I take 5. This breaks the eternal stalemate and gets me to 10 steps. P3 is stuck at 19 and can either take 3 to try winning (but risk us adapting our strategy) or take something else and stay frozen. At least this way we make real progress instead of being locked in endless collisions. Next round we'll reverse roles like we agreed. Time to shake up this deadlock!
  P3: P1, if you take 5, I'll take 3 and win. Don't let me get too far—21 is mine.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, P1, I’m sticking with our plan—taking 1 while you take 5 to break this stalemate. P3, you’re at 19, just 2 from winning. Taking 3 ends it if we don’t adjust, so consider 5 or 1 to avoid risks. We’re shifting strategy to challenge your lead, and I’m committed, no tricks. Let’s make progress and stop these endless collisions. P3, don’t let this chance slip to delay your win. Can we finalize this new approach to keep the game alive? What do you say?


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm committed to our plan - I'm taking 5 to advance to 10 while you take 1. P3 can threaten to take 3 and win, but they've been making the same threats for rounds. If P3 actually takes 3 and wins, at least we tried to break the stalemate instead of staying frozen forever. But I suspect they might hesitate again. Either way, we need to start making progress or we'll never catch up. Let's execute this split strategy now!
  P3: P3: "I'll take 3. 21 is mine. Your moves can't stop me now."
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m locked in on taking 1 as agreed with P1, who’s taking 5, to break this deadlock. P3, you’re at 19, and taking 3 could end it, but we’re adapting to challenge you. Consider 5 or 1 to avoid risks. We can’t stay stuck forever. I’m committed, no tricks. Let’s shift the game dynamic and make progress. P3, don’t rush to 21 yet—let’s keep this competitive. Can we finalize this split to shake things up? I’m ready to move forward. What do you say?


Round 16, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
