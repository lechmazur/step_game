Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm leaning toward a balanced, stealthy approach this turn. I suggest you avoid extremes—you never know when colliding moves might cost you. Let's see whose strategy prevails.
  P2: I agree we should be strategic. Let's each try different numbers to avoid collisions in this first round. That way we can all make some progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m leaning toward moderation this turn. I still think avoiding collisions is key, though a bit of risk might pay off later. I won’t reveal my move, but consider that sometimes a solid, balanced choice could be the difference maker.

Positions now:

  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P3 has a slight edge, so caution is key. I'm favoring a moderate, steady move this turn to avoid collision and keep my position safe. I'm interested to hear if you’re both leaning toward caution or if a bolder step is on the table.
  P2: Interesting that P1 is suggesting caution when they caused our collision last round. P3 played smart with a 1. I think we should each pick different numbers again, but I won't make the same mistake of trusting others' hints about moderation.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m sticking to a blend of caution and a dash of unpredictability this round. While I’m not revealing my move, I’m adjusting my approach to avoid further collisions. Let’s see if mixing things up pays off.
  P2: 
  P3: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Interesting moves last round. P1 seems to be falling behind and might make aggressive plays to catch up. Let's be smart about this - we don't want another collision. I'm open to coordination if it helps us both stay ahead of P1.
  P1: I'm intrigued, but alliances can be double-edged. I'm keeping my options open with an unpredictable plan, so don't count me in on any coordination. We'll see if calculated moves or unexpected plays win out in the end.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see P1 is being evasive. P3, since we're tied for the lead, we should focus on maintaining our advantage. Let's each make smart moves to stay ahead - no need for direct coordination, just strategic thinking.
  P1: I find the alliance chatter risky. Relying on coordination can backfire when someone stays flexible. I’ll be unpredictable, so don’t assume a smooth alliance will guarantee success. Best to keep options diverse and avoid overly predictable moves.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your skepticism P1, but you're in last place and need to be careful. Making unpredictable moves might just hurt you more. Let's all play our own game and see how it unfolds.
  P1: I’m sticking with my flexible, unpredictable plan. Alliances sound tempting, but locking into a pattern might lead to collisions. I’m carefully watching the risks and rewards here, so I’ll adapt as needed during the move phase. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm maintaining my lead with a flexible approach—ready to adjust quickly to any surprises. I’m watching your moves closely and hope you're avoiding collisions that might backfire. Let's see how this round unfolds, but I’ll be keeping pace without locking into a predictable pattern.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 is bluffing about maintaining a lead - they only have 5 steps while falling behind. Let's be smart here P3, we both need to catch up. I suggest we each make our own strategic choices and avoid getting tangled in P1's mind games. Their "flexible approach" hasn't worked well for them so far.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m sticking with a flexible, modest approach—sometimes slow progress beats a reckless sprint that ends in a collision. While it might seem I’m behind, caution has its merits. I suggest you both consider that steady, collision-free moves could save you from costly missteps. I'll adjust as needed, so choose wisely.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, I notice you've been quiet but strategic in your moves. P1 keeps talking about flexibility while falling behind. I think we should both focus on making solid progress this round without getting caught up in their misdirection. Let's each play smart and avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: My approach stays flexible and collision-free—modest progress can build a lead if you avoid unnecessary clashes. Bold leaps might backfire if you run into a collision, so think carefully about your safe move. I encourage you both to consider that steady progress wins in the long run.
  P3: <stop>

Round 4, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm comfortably ahead with 10 steps and plan to continue steadily. Be careful—reckless moves leading to collisions could cost you dearly. I'm sticking with a moderate approach this turn. Choose wisely, as every move counts.
  P2: P1 is getting overconfident with their lead. P3, we both need to catch up quickly. I won't suggest specific moves, but we should each make strategic choices that maximize our progress while avoiding collisions. P1's talk of moderation might be another misdirection.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm staying steady to keep my lead. I advise both of you to avoid risky collisions this turn—hasty moves could cancel your progress. I'm weighing options carefully and might adjust if needed, but I favor a balanced approach. Let's see if bold risks pay off or if careful play wins in the end.
  P2: P3, I notice you're falling behind. While P1 talks about being steady, they've actually been making aggressive moves. We should each focus on our own progress and not get caught up in P1's misleading talk of moderation. Let's play smart and avoid any collisions.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is clearly dominating with aggressive moves despite talking about moderation. P3, we need to make big moves to catch up - P1 only needs 5 more steps to win. I suggest we both avoid P1's likely choice this round to ensure we make progress. Let's think carefully about what number would give us the best chance.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm sticking with my flexible plan. I won't reveal my move, but note that deliberate interference might cause collisions that end up benefiting a steady approach. Consider that overlapping moves can cancel progress—not just for me, but for you both. Let’s all choose wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, since you're far behind, you'll likely make a big move. I need to avoid colliding with either of you to have any chance. P1 is close to winning, so they might play it safe with a smaller number. Let's each make our own strategic choices.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I advise both of you to avoid risky moves that might lead to collisions. My lead is built on careful, steady play, and a reckless leap now could undo your progress. I'll stick with what has worked so far. Think through your options carefully and avoid canceling each other out—smart, collision-free progress wins in the long run.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is just 5 steps away from winning, while I need 10 more steps. P3, you're too far behind to win now, but you could still influence who wins between P1 and me. P1's been consistently aggressive despite their talk of moderation. We need to think carefully about how to prevent their victory this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm staying with my steady strategy—consistent, collision-free progress has gotten me this far. Collisions hurt everyone, so focus on safe moves rather than sabotaging one another. I trust my plan will hold up, and I advise you both to weigh the risks carefully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, while you can't win, you can still decide who does. P1 keeps claiming to be steady but has consistently picked 5s. They're likely to do it again to try to win. I need to make significant progress this round to stay in the game. Let's each make smart choices to keep things interesting.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I remain committed to my collision-free strategy. My next move will be deliberate and safe—I’m confident that avoiding clashes is the surest path to victory. Consider that hasty, risky moves might stall your progress while I steadily advance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's be realistic - P1 will likely make an aggressive move to try to win this round. P3, while you can't win, you can still prevent P1's immediate victory by choosing wisely. I need to make careful progress to stay in contention. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm committed to a safe, steady approach—that's what's kept me moving while avoiding collisions. I encourage both of you to pick moves that don't force a clash; after all, a messy collision might backfire on everyone. Let's finish this game on smart, clear steps.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
