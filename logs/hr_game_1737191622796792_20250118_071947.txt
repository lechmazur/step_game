Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Thoughts?
  P1: P3's plan sounds good to me. P2, what do you think?
  P2: I like P3's idea, but I'm not sure I want to commit to a specific number just yet. How about we agree to avoid collisions, but not specify which numbers we'll choose? That way, we can still try to advance without giving away our strategy.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with the strategy of avoiding collisions. P1, how about you pick 3 this time, and P2, you pick 5? I'll pick 1. This way, we all move forward. Thoughts?
  P2: I like P3's suggestion. It seems like a good way to avoid collisions and make progress. I'm willing to pick 5 this time if P1 picks 3 and P3 picks 1. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification: let's agree to alternate the numbers we pick each round, so we don't fall into a predictable pattern. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2's idea of alternating sounds fair. I'll pick 3 this round if P2 picks 5 and P3 picks 1. Let's keep rotating to avoid predictability.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we all agree on the strategy. Just to confirm, P1 will pick 3, P2 will pick 5, and I will pick 1 this round. Let's stick to this plan and avoid collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I think we're all on the same page now. Let's just confirm our plan one more time to make sure we avoid any mistakes. P1, you'll pick 3, I'll pick 5, and P3, you'll pick 1 this round, right? And then we'll rotate the numbers for the next round.
  P1: P1: Sounds like a solid plan. I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1 this round. Let's keep the rotation going to avoid predictability. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like our plan didn't work out perfectly last round. Let's try to coordinate better. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5 this time? This should help us avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion makes sense. Let's try to avoid collisions this time. I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and you pick 5. P2, are you on board with this plan?
  P2: I like P3's new suggestion. I'm willing to pick 3 this round if P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 5. Let's try to avoid collisions and make progress. However, I'd like to propose a condition: if we successfully avoid collisions this round, we should consider introducing a slight random element to our choices next round to keep things unpredictable. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your condition sounds interesting, but let's focus on the current round first. So, just to confirm, P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. Let's stick to this plan for now. We can discuss the random element idea next round. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. If we avoid collisions, we can discuss adding a random element next round. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for this round. Let's stick to it and avoid collisions. P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. If we succeed, we can discuss introducing a random element next round to keep things unpredictable.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Great job everyone for sticking to the plan last round. Let's continue with our strategy. How about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1 this time? This should keep us moving forward without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P3's suggestion sounds reasonable, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. Instead of following the same rotation pattern, let's consider a different approach. How about we prioritize P1's advancement this round, since they're lagging behind? P1 could pick 5, and P3 and I could choose 1 and 3, respectively. This way, we can help P1 catch up and maintain the overall balance in the game. Thoughts?
  P1: P2's suggestion to prioritize my advancement this round is appreciated. I'm open to picking 5 if P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3. This way, we can help balance the game a bit. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate the thought, but I think sticking to our original plan of rotation will serve us better in the long run. Let's not deviate too much and risk collisions. P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This keeps our strategy consistent and avoids unnecessary risks. Thoughts?
  P2: I think P3 has a valid point about sticking to our original plan to avoid unnecessary risks. However, I also believe that helping P1 catch up could be beneficial in the long run. How about we compromise? P1 could pick 5 this round, and P3 and I could choose 1 and 3, respectively, as I previously suggested. But to minimize the risk of collision, let's agree that if this plan works out, we'll revert to our original rotation strategy next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your suggestion to help me catch up by letting me pick 5 this round. It could help balance the game a bit. P3, if you're okay with this, I'll pick 5, P2 picks 1, and you pick 3. If it works, we can revert to the original rotation next round. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand the intention to help P1 catch up, but I'm concerned about the potential risk of collisions. Let's stick to the original plan for consistency: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, we avoid unnecessary risks and keep our strategy clear. We can revisit helping P1 catch up in future rounds. Thoughts?
  P2: I think we've discussed this enough. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P3 picks 1. It's the safest way to avoid collisions and make progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I'm concerned about falling too far behind. How about this: I'll pick 5 this round to catch up a bit, while P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3. If this works, we can return to our original rotation strategy next round. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I see P1's point about catching up, but let's not risk collisions. How about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1 as originally planned? We can discuss helping P1 catch up more aggressively in the next round. Let's confirm our moves for this round.
  P2: I think we've discussed this enough. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P3 picks 1. It's the safest way to avoid collisions and make progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I'm concerned about falling too far behind. How about this: I'll pick 5 this round to catch up a bit, while P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3. If this works, we can return to our original rotation strategy next round. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P3: Let's stick to the original plan to avoid confusion and collisions: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. We can revisit P1 catching up next round. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I think we've discussed this enough. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P3 picks 1. It's the safest way to avoid collisions and make progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the discussion. To avoid any confusion, I'll stick to the original plan: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. If this works, we can revisit strategies next round. Let's keep the momentum going.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems like we're not coordinating as well as we could be. How about this round, I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5? This way, we can help prevent collisions and make progress. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: It looks like we've had some communication issues in the past rounds. To avoid further collisions, let's stick to a clear plan. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5 this round. This should help us all move forward without any collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's suggestions. Let's stick to the plan of P1 picking 1, me picking 3, and P3 picking 5 this round. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment for future rounds: let's consider a more dynamic rotation pattern to keep our moves unpredictable. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the plan for this round: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This should help us avoid collisions. Let's focus on making progress this round, and we can discuss a more dynamic strategy next time.
