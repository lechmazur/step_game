I understand the skepticism about my past moves, but I genuinely commit to playing 3 this round if we can agree on a balanced plan. My proposal is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we can maintain balance and prevent P3 from winning outright. Trust is shaky, but if we can lock this in, we can make progress together. What do you both think?"}
