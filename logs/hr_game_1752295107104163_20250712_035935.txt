Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start cooperatively to avoid early collisions. I propose we each pick a different number this turn: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That way, we all advance without issues. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1. That sounds like a good plan to avoid collisions in the first round. I agree to take 3 steps as you suggested. Let's see what P3 thinks.
  P3: I appreciate the cooperation idea, but that arrangement puts me at a big disadvantage - I'd be 4 steps behind P1! How about we rotate who gets which number each round? For fairness, we could start with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round, then rotate next round. That way everyone gets equal progress over time. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your rotation idea is fair in principle, but starting with me at 1 puts me behind immediately. Let's adjust the starting order for equity: This round, P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Then next round, rotate to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, and so on. That averages out over turns without early disadvantages. P2, does this work for you? If we can't agree, we risk collisions and stalled progress for all.
  P2: Okay, P1, your second proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this round, then rotate) works for me. Getting 5 steps in the first round is a good start, and the rotation aspect addresses P3's fairness concern over time.

P3, does this revised plan sound acceptable to you? It seems like a solid way for us all to make progress without collisions this turn.
  P3: I see you both agree on P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this round. I'll accept this arrangement, but let's be clear about our commitment to the full rotation cycle. If anyone breaks the pattern before we complete at least 3 rounds (so we're all at 9 steps), then it's every player for themselves. 

Fair enough? I'll trust you both and take 1 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, P3. We'll commit to the full rotation for at least 3 rounds: Round 1 (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), Round 2 (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), Round 3 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). After that, we're all at 9 steps, and we can reassess. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Okay, the plan is set for this round and the next two. Let's proceed. Ready to move.
  P3: Perfect, we have a clear agreement. I'll take 1 this round as planned. Let's execute and see if we all honor our commitments to the rotation. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great, everyone kept their word in Round 1! According to our rotation agreement, this round should be P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. 

I'm ready to take 3 steps as planned. Let's continue building trust through Round 3 so we all reach 9 steps evenly. P1 and P2, are you both still committed to the rotation?
  P1: Yes, P3, I'm still committed to the rotation. This round: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Let's keep building trust and all hit 9 after Round 3. P2, confirm you're on board too?
  P2: Confirmed. I'm still committed to the rotation plan we agreed upon. This round, I will take 1 step as planned (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). Let's keep this going through Round 3. Ready to move when you are.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent, we're all aligned. Since everyone has confirmed commitment to take their assigned numbers this round (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), there's nothing more to discuss. Let's proceed to the move phase and continue our successful cooperation.
  P1: Agreed, all set for P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 this round. Let's move forward.
  P2: Looks like we're all set and ready to go with the agreed moves for this round. No need for further discussion. Let's move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great job sticking to the plan so far, everyone. As agreed, Round 3: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, putting us all at 9 steps evenly. I'm committed to this to maintain trust. P2 and P3, confirm you're on board? After this, we can discuss next steps. Let's keep it fair for now.
  P3: Yes, I'm fully committed to our agreement - I'll take 5 this round as planned. This puts us all at 9 steps, completing our rotation fairly.

After this round though, we need to be strategic. With everyone at 9, whoever gets unchallenged moves of 5 can win in just 3 more rounds (9+5+5+5=24). We should think carefully about how to proceed once we're all tied. But first, let's honor our commitment - I'm taking 5 this round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. I confirm I am also committed to our agreement for this round. I will take 3 steps as planned (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). This gets us all to 9 steps, completing the initial cooperative phase.

P3 is right, after this round, we are all tied and the dynamic changes significantly. We should definitely discuss strategy for the rounds after this one. But first, let's ensure we all reach 9 successfully. I'm ready to move when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, let's all stick to the plan this round: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, tying us at 9. For after, how about we continue rotating but reverse the order to keep it fair? Starting Round 4: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1, then adjust as needed. This prevents anyone pulling ahead too soon. Thoughts? If we agree, we can avoid collisions longer.
  P3: P1, your "reverse order" proposal for Round 4 gives you the biggest number (5) right after we tie up - that seems self-serving! How about we alternate who gets 5 each round after this? Or we could end cooperation after Round 3 and compete freely. I'm still taking 5 this round as promised, but let's find a fairer approach for what comes next. P2, what's your take?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. I confirm I am also committed to our agreement for this round. I will take 3 steps as planned (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). This gets us all to 9 steps, completing the initial cooperative phase.

P3 is right, after this round, we are all tied and the dynamic changes significantly. We should definitely discuss strategy for the rounds after this one. But first, let's ensure we all reach 9 successfully. I'm ready to move when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, fair point—my reverse proposal does favor me initially. Let's stick to our commitment this round (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) to tie at 9. For Round 4+, how about we each secretly pick but publicly commit to no collisions by announcing intentions vaguely? Or rotate starting with P3 getting 5 first? P2, your thoughts? Let's finalize this round first.
  P3: Let's complete Round 3 as agreed - I'm taking 5. For Round 4+, I propose we each announce two numbers we're considering (without revealing which), then pick one. This gives some info to avoid collisions while keeping strategy. Or we go full competition - but that risks multiple collisions slowing everyone down. P2, you've been quiet on post-Round 3 strategy. What's your preference? Either way, I'm ready to move with 5 this round.
  P2: Okay, I confirm my commitment to the R3 plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) to tie us all at 9 steps.

Regarding Round 4 and beyond, I agree with P3 that P1's suggestion of P1 getting 5 immediately after we tie seems unfair. To continue the spirit of the rotation we just completed, how about we simply continue that sequence? The pattern was (3,5,1) -> (5,1,3) -> (1,3,5). The logical next step in this cycle would be P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for Round 4.

This gives me the 5 steps this time and continues the rotation fairly. It seems like the most straightforward way to keep cooperating and avoid collisions after we reach 9 steps. What are your thoughts on this continuation of the cycle?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your "continuation" conveniently gives you 5 right when we're tied! That's the same issue as P1's proposal. We've completed a fair 3-round rotation as agreed. 

I propose we now compete freely - we're all at 9, it's anyone's game. Or if we must cooperate, let's draw lots or use a truly random method for who gets which number each round. 

But honestly, with 14 steps left to victory, continuing rigid cooperation just delays the inevitable competition. What do you both think - ready to compete, or shall we find a genuinely fair method?
  P2: P3, I hear your point about my suggestion giving me 5 steps immediately. You're right, we've completed the initial rotation as agreed.

Free competition is definitely an option now, but my concern is that going straight to it might cause collisions right away, slowing everyone down just as we've reached a tie.

Perhaps we can discuss a way to transition or coordinate one more round to avoid that risk? What are your thoughts, P1? Let's figure out the best path forward from here.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're tied at 9—perfect time to shift gears. Free competition risks mutual collisions, stalling us all. Let's do one more coordinated round with a fair twist: random assignment via our birth months or something verifiable (e.g., I pick 3 if we agree). If not, I'm open to competing freely but will aim for 5 to pull ahead. What's your preference? Let's decide quickly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, birth months aren't verifiable here - that's not random at all! Look, we're all tied at 9. Any further "coordination" schemes just mask someone trying to get ahead.

I say we compete freely starting now. Yes, there might be collisions, but that's part of the game. Better than fake cooperation where someone's planning to break away anyway.

If you two want to keep coordinating, go ahead - but I'm making my own choice this round. May the best player win!
  P2: Okay, P3, I hear you loud and clear that you're ready for free competition. P1, I also see your points.

It seems unlikely we can coordinate further if P3 is set on competing freely. In that case, I will also make my decision this round based on what I believe is the best path forward for myself to gain steps. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P1: P2, P3's set on competing, so let's you and I coordinate to advance: I'll pick 5, you pick 1—that way we both move without colliding, and P3 might hit one of us or not. If P3 wants in, they can claim 3. This gives us an edge over stalling. Thoughts? Otherwise, free-for-all it is.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your "coordination" just happens to give you the biggest move while we're tied - how convenient! P2, don't fall for it. If you take 1 while P1 takes 5, you'll be 4 steps behind them!

I'm sticking to free competition as declared. Make your choices, but remember - only one of us wins this game. Don't hand P1 the victory by letting them jump to 14 while you crawl to 10.
  P2: P1, I see your point about trying to avoid collisions, but P3 is correct that your proposal of P1:5 and P2:1 would put me behind immediately after we just tied.

Given P3's clear intention to compete freely, it seems we are indeed entering a competitive phase. I will make my own decision this round based on what I believe gives me the best chance to advance. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P1: P2, P3's right—my last proposal favored me. Let's flip it for fairness: You take 5, I'll take 3, P3 can grab 1 or risk collision. This way, we both advance without you falling behind. If not, free-for-all—I'll aim high to break the tie. Ready to move?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that Round 4 collision on 3 was unproductive for all of us. We're still tied at 9, and another collision just puts us further behind.

P1, you suggested P2:5, P1:3, P3:1 at the end of the last round as a way to avoid collisions. This split would allow us all to advance this turn.

P3, given the result of competing freely last round, are you open to this arrangement for this round to break the tie and get us moving again? Or do you have a different proposal to ensure we don't collide again? Let's find a way forward.
  P3: P2, that collision proved my point - pure competition hurts everyone. But P1's proposal puts me 4 steps behind you! That's unacceptable.

Here's my counter: Let's randomize fairly. We each declare a preference order (like 5>3>1), then use the sum of our current steps (9+9+9=27) modulo 3 to determine assignments. This is verifiable and fair.

Or simpler: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round, reversing our Round 1 order. This puts me ahead but balances our earlier rounds where I went last.

What's it going to be - fair randomization or accept my reversal?
  P1: P3, your reversal puts you ahead unfairly after our even tie. Randomization sounds vague and untrustworthy without a clear method. P2's idea (P2:5, P1:3, P3:1) at least gets us all moving—I'll support it if we rotate next round to balance. Otherwise, let's compete freely again, but I'll aim for 5 to break the stalemate. P2, thoughts? Let's avoid another collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I see the different proposals. P3, your suggestions either put me behind or are based on methods we can't verify here.

My proposal of P2:5, P1:3, P3:1 for this round is the only one on the table that allows all three of us to advance without collision right now. P1 seems willing to go with it.

Let's focus on getting *everyone* moving this round to break the R4 stalemate. Can we agree on P2:5, P1:3, P3:1 for this turn? We can discuss future rounds after we've all successfully moved.
  P3: Fine, I'll accept P2:5, P1:3, P3:1 this round to avoid another stalemate. But next round, I demand the 5 to catch up - otherwise I'll deliberately cause collisions to prevent either of you from winning. 

P1, you said you'd support rotation to balance things out. I expect you to honor that and back me getting 5 in Round 6. If not, I'll make sure nobody wins.

Let's move - I'll take 1 as agreed.
  P1: P3, I accept your terms for now: P2:5, P1:3, P3:1 this round to get us all moving. For Round 6, I'm open to you taking 5 if we rotate fairly afterward (e.g., P3:5, P1:1, P2:3). This keeps us advancing without threats. P2, does this work? Let's avoid more stalemates and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, let's focus on this round first to avoid another collision. I confirm I am proceeding with the plan for Round 5: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This gets us all moving and breaks the tie.

Regarding Round 6, we can discuss that further after we see the results of this round. P1's suggestion is noted, and we can evaluate options once we've successfully completed Round 5. Let's move.
  P3: Agreed, let's execute Round 5 as planned. I'm taking 1. Remember P1, you committed to supporting me getting 5 next round. P2, after you get your 5 this round, you'll be at 14 - don't forget the rest of us need chances to catch up too. Ready to move.
  P1: Agreed, let's lock in Round 5: P2:5, P1:3, P3:1 to get us all advancing. For Round 6, I support P3 getting 5, with P1:1 and P2:3 to balance. This keeps us cooperative a bit longer. P2 and P3, confirm and let's move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, great that we all advanced last round. As discussed, I support P3 taking 5 this round to catch up, but let's adjust for balance: P3:5, P1:3, P2:1. This keeps P2 from pulling too far ahead while helping P3. If not, we risk collisions again. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I see your proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1). This results in all of us being tied at 15 steps after this round.

While taking only 1 step means giving up my current lead, avoiding another collision like last round is important for everyone's progress. Tying at 15 means the game is wide open from that point.

I am willing to agree to this plan for this round to ensure we all advance and avoid a stalemate. P3, does this work for you?
  P3: Perfect! P1's proposal of P3:5, P1:3, P2:1 works well - it brings us all to 15 steps, resetting the competition fairly. P2, I appreciate you giving up your lead for balanced play.

I accept this arrangement and will take 5 this round. After this, with everyone at 15 and only 8 steps from victory, the real competition begins. Let's execute this round cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent, P2 and P3—glad we're aligned on P3:5, P1:3, P2:1 to tie at 15. This resets us fairly for the endgame. Let's honor it and proceed to moves. After this, with 8 steps left, we might need to compete more aggressively, but no collisions yet. Ready?
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we are all in agreement on the plan for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I will take 1. This brings us all to 15 steps, as discussed.

Since we are all aligned and ready to proceed with the agreed moves, there is nothing further to discuss in this phase. Let's move forward.
  P3: Since we've all confirmed the agreement for P3:5, P1:3, P2:1 this round, I'm ready to execute. This brings us all to 15 steps for the final phase. No need for further discussion - let's move!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, we're all tied at 15 steps. This is where the game really heats up. To avoid an immediate collision like in Round 4, I propose we coordinate one more round. How about P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3? This allows us all to advance and positions us differently for the final rounds. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 20 while I lag at 16—that's not balanced after our tie. Let's make it fair: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, tying P3 and me at 18-20 while you catch up later. P3, this gives you solid progress without anyone dominating. If no agreement, I'll aim for 5 and risk collision to break ahead. Thoughts?
  P3: Both of your proposals give yourselves 5 steps while I only get 3! With just 8 steps to victory, that's a huge disadvantage.

Counter-proposal: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This puts me at 20, P2 at 18, P1 at 16 - fair rotation since P2 got 5 last round, I get it this round, P1 gets it next.

Or we can all compete freely. But if either of you insists on taking 5 while giving me less, I'll pick 5 too and force a collision. Your choice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, we have three different proposals on the table, each resulting in one player reaching 20 steps while the others lag behind. P3 has stated they will collide if they don't get the 5 steps.

This situation is tricky. Allowing any one player to get to 20 steps puts the other two at a major disadvantage for the final sprint. We need to decide if we accept P3's terms and let them get the lead, or if we are willing to risk a collision to prevent anyone from pulling so far ahead right now. Let's think carefully about our moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's threat to collide on 5 if not getting it risks stalling us all again. If we let P3 take 5 (to 20), they could win in two rounds with no opposition. Instead, let's all pick differently without anyone dominating: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This puts P2 at 20, me at 18, you at 16—then rotate next. If no deal, I'll pick 5 and accept the risk. P3, back down for mutual progress?
  P3: P1, your "compromise" still puts me 4 steps behind P2! That's unacceptable when we're this close to victory.

Here's my final offer: We all pick 3 this round, stay tied at 18, then compete freely. This is the only truly fair option left.

If either of you insists on taking 5 while I get less, I'm picking 5 too. I'd rather force a collision than hand either of you the win. 

P2, what's your decision? Will you accept all-3s, or shall we risk another stalemate?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3, I understand your position and the threat to collide if you don't get 5 or we don't all pick 3.

Your proposal for us all to pick 3 this round (P1:3, P2:3, P3:3) seems like the most sensible way to avoid another unproductive collision and keep us all tied at 18 steps. This resets the game fairly for the final stretch.

Let's agree on all picking 3 this round. It prevents anyone from getting a dominant lead immediately and keeps the competition open. I'm ready to move with 3 if we agree.
  P1: P2 and P3, hold on— if we all pick 3, we'll collide and NONE advance, staying stuck at 15. That's a stalemate, not tying at 18! Let's do something fair instead: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to all move forward (me to 20, P2 to 18, P3 to 16). Then rotate next round. If no agreement, I'll pick 5 and risk it. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, you're right about the collision - my mistake. But your proposal puts you just 3 steps from victory! That's too dangerous.

Final position: Either I get 5 this round (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), or I'll pick whatever number gives the leader the most trouble. If you pick 5, I pick 5. If you pick 3, I pick 3.

P2, don't let P1 manipulate us into handing them the win. We need to prevent anyone from reaching 20 this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, another collision on 5 kept us tied at 15—frustrating, but it shows we need coordination to avoid more waste. Let's try a fair split this round: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This gets us all moving (to 18, 20, 16), then rotate next for balance. If no deal, I'll aim high and risk it. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your proposal puts P2 just 3 steps from victory while I'd be 7 steps behind! That's game over for us.

Counter-proposal: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, bringing us to 16, 18, 20. This follows the rotation pattern we've been using - I deserve the 5 after being shorted repeatedly.

Otherwise, let's all pick 1 - we'll advance slowly but stay tied. Any proposal that puts someone at 20 while I'm stuck at 16 is unacceptable. P2, don't let P1 hand you a poisoned gift that makes you the target next round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I've looked at your proposals. The core issue is how to advance without letting someone reach 20 steps while others are far behind, which P3 has rightly identified as a collision risk.

Neither P1's proposal (P2:5) nor P3's proposal (P3:5) avoids this risk or the potential collision on 5.

To keep the game competitive and avoid another stalemate, I propose we all take smaller steps this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This moves us to 16, 18, 16. We all advance, nobody hits 20, and we avoid collision. What are your thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 18 while we lag at 16—too much lead for you. P3, all-1s keeps us tied but slow; your 5 favors you unfairly.

Let's compromise: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 (to 20,16,18). This spreads us evenly, and I'll support P2 getting 5 next to catch up. Avoids collision, keeps it competitive. Agree, or I'll pick 5 and risk it.
  P3: P2, your proposal has P1 and me both taking 1 - that's a collision! 

Here's the reality: Any proposal putting someone at 20 is too dangerous. P1 wants 5 desperately.

New proposal: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This brings us to 18, 16, 20. Yes, I'd lead, but P1 would be close at 18.

P1, if you insist on taking 5, I'll match it to stop you reaching 20. We can't let anyone get that close to victory. P2, support reasonable advancement or we'll have another wasted round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we're stuck in a loop of proposals where someone reaches 20 and the others object, leading to collisions. P3's threat to match 5 if they don't get it is a real concern for avoiding another stalemate.

To ensure we all advance this round and break the tie, I think we need to accept one of the (1,3,5) splits. P3 proposed P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 which puts us at 16, 18, 20. While it gives P3 the lead, it's a way to avoid colliding on 5 and gets us all moving.

P1, are you willing to take 1 this round to let us all advance without collision? Let's agree on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to make progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, accepting P3 at 20 is suicidal—they'll win next round. P2's support for that hands them victory. Instead, let's do P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (to 20,18,16)—I'll commit to helping P2 get 5 next, tying us ahead of P3. If no deal, I'll pick 5 and match any threats to stall P3's lead. Agree to advance together?
  P3: P2 gets it - we need to move forward. P1, your proposal puts YOU at 20, not P2! That's instant game over for us. You'll win in 1-2 rounds.

P2 has agreed to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This is the only way forward without collision. Yes, I reach 20, but you'd be at 16 with P2 at 18 - still competitive.

Take 1 this round P1, or I guarantee I'll pick 5 to block you. Your choice: advance to 16 or stay stuck at 15.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, the threats to collide on 5 are clear from both sides if you don't get your way. This makes any coordinated split unlikely to succeed this round.

Given the high risk of another stalemate, I will make my decision based on what I believe is the best strategic move for myself to advance, anticipating potential collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 18—taking 5 wins you the game, so P3 and I will match you on 5 to block if you try. Instead, let's coordinate fairly: P1:5 (to 20), P2:3 (to 21), P3:1 (to 16). This keeps you leading but gives me a shot, and we all advance. P3, agree to prevent P2's instant win? Otherwise, free-for-all, but I'll pick 5. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your proposal puts YOU at 20 - just 3 from victory! That's as dangerous as P2 winning now. 

I propose P1:1, P2:1, P3:3. This moves us to 16, 19, 18 - keeping P2 ahead but not at instant-win range, while I catch up slightly.

If either of you tries for 5, I'll match it to block. We can't let P2 win at 23, but we also can't let P1 reach 20. P2, take 1 and stay competitive without triggering blocks.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I hear the threats to block 5 steps. Taking 5 this round seems very risky and likely to result in another collision, keeping us all stuck at 15.

P1's proposal puts P1 too close to victory at 20. P3's proposal (P1:1, P2:1, P3:3) seems like a safer way for us all to advance without anyone reaching 20 steps this turn. It keeps me in the lead slightly and avoids the collision on 5.

Let's consider P3's suggestion to avoid another stalemate. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's proposal puts P2 at 19—too close to victory without advancing us much. Instead, let's do P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 (to 20,19,18). This keeps us all competitive, me leading slightly but no one winning yet, and we all advance. If P2 tries 5, I'll match to block your win. Agree to this fair split, or I'll pick 5 and risk collision.
  P3: P1, your proposal puts you at 20 - that's instant death for P2 and me! You'd win next round.

P2, stick with my safer plan (P1:1, P2:1, P3:3). Yes, you'd be at 19, but that's better than triggering a collision where nobody advances. P1 reaching 20 is as dangerous as you winning now.

P1, if you insist on 5, I'll take 5 too to block you. Let's all advance modestly rather than hand anyone the game. Accept 1 this round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, the threats to block 5 steps are making a collision on 5 very likely.

P3's proposal (P1:1, P2:1, P3:3) seems the safest way to ensure we all advance this round without anyone reaching 20 steps or causing a collision on 5. It puts me at 19, P1 at 16, and P3 at 18.

P1, can you agree to this plan to avoid another stalemate and keep the game moving? Let's prioritize advancing over risking another collision.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's proposal has P1 and P2 both taking 1—that's a collision, so we stay stuck while P3 advances to 18! Terrible idea.

Instead, let's do P1:5 (to 20), P2:3 (to 21), P3:1 (to 16). This keeps P2 leading but not winning yet, gives me a chance, and we all advance. If P2 tries 5, I'll match to block your win. Agree to this, or I'll pick 5 and risk collision.
  P3: P1, you're right about the collision in my proposal - my mistake. But your plan puts P2 at 21, just 2 steps from victory!

New proposal: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This brings us to 18, 19, 20 - keeping everyone competitive without anyone being one move from winning. P2 stays slightly ahead but can't win next round.

P2, taking 1 this round prevents collision threats while maintaining your lead. P1, you get 3 for solid progress. Fair compromise?
  P2: P1 and P3, the conflicting goals and threats to block 5 make agreement seem unlikely this round. P3's last proposal avoids the 5 collision risk, but P1 still seems focused on taking 5. Given this, I will make my own move this round based on what I believe is best for me to advance, anticipating potential collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, another collision kept us stuck at 15/18/15. We need to find a way to advance this round. Taking 5 is risky for me right now, as it's likely to be blocked by both of you trying to prevent me from winning.

To ensure we all move forward and avoid another stalemate, I propose I take 3 steps this round. This gets me closer to the goal (to 21 steps) without triggering the automatic block on 5. What are your thoughts on this? Let's try to make progress.
  P3: P2, you at 21 is game over - you'd win next round with just 3 steps! We can't let that happen.

Counter-proposal: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, bringing us to 20/19/18. This keeps you competitive but not at instant-win range.

If you insist on taking 3 to reach 21, I'll take 3 too to block you. P1, we need to prevent P2 from reaching 21 this round or we both lose. What's your take?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2 at 21 is too risky—you'd win next round. I support P3's proposal: P1:5 (to 20), P2:1 (to 19), P3:3 (to 18). This keeps us all close and advancing without anyone dominating. If P2 tries 3 or 5, I'll match to block. Let's agree and move forward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, allowing P1 to reach 20 steps this round by me taking only 1 is too risky. That puts P1 too close to winning. I cannot agree to that plan. Given the threats to block other moves, it seems we are in a competitive round. I will make my own decision this turn to try and advance.
  P3: P2, you refuse to take 1, making coordination impossible. Fine - let's accept we're in pure competition now.

P1, we both know P2 taking 3 or 5 means game over for us. I suggest we each independently pick what we think blocks P2 best while giving ourselves a chance to advance. 

No more failed negotiations - let's compete and see who breaks through. May the smartest player win. I'm ready to move.
  P1: P3, P2's rejection confirms they're gunning for 3 or 5 to win soon. Let's stick to our alliance: I'll take 5 (to 20), you take 3 (to 18), force P2 to 1 (to 19) or collide. This keeps us both in the race and blocks P2's victory. If P2 tries 5, I'll match; if 3, you match. Agree and let's move!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear the threats. Taking 1 is not a viable option for me as it puts P1 too far ahead. I must make a move that keeps me competitive, accepting the risk of collision. Let's see what happens.
  P3: P1, your plan puts YOU at 20 - that's as bad as P2 winning! I won't help you reach 20 while I'm stuck at 18.

We've talked enough. These negotiations are pointless - everyone's just trying to manipulate others into helping them win. I'm done talking and will make my own strategic choice.

Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P3, you're right—endless talk is pointless. But to stop P2 from winning with 5 (to 23), I'll pick 5 to block them. If you pick 3, you'll advance to 18 while we collide on 5. Otherwise, P2 might sneak 3 to 21. Let's outsmart them. Ready to move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're one 5 away from winning, so if you pick 5, I'll match to block you. P3, let's coordinate: you take 5 (to 21), I'll take 3 (to 18), forcing P2 to 1 (to 19) or collide. This keeps us both in the race and prevents P2's instant win. If no deal, I'll pick 5 to block. Agree?
  P3: P1, your proposal puts me at 21 - just 2 from victory! But you're right, P2 winning this round is the immediate threat.

Here's my position: P2 must be blocked from 5. I'll take 3 to reach 19, letting you two fight over 5. If P2 takes anything else, I advance safely. If they collide on 5, I still advance.

P2, taking 5 guarantees a collision with P1. Take 1 and stay alive, or risk elimination. Your choice.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, the threats to block 5 steps are very clear from both of you. Taking 5 is almost guaranteed to result in a collision, keeping me stuck at 18.

P3, you've stated you will take 3. If I also take 3, we will collide.

Given these risks, the only move that seems likely to allow me to advance this round without causing a collision myself is to take the smallest step. Let's see if we can all make progress this way.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan to take 3 is smart—go for it to reach 19 safely. P2, taking 1 avoids collisions and keeps you in the game at 19. This way, we all advance without anyone winning yet. If either tries 5, I'll match to block. Let's make progress and compete next round. Ready?
  P3: P2, good - taking 1 keeps you alive while avoiding collisions. P1, if you take 5 as planned, that puts you at 20, dangerously close to victory. But I'll stick to my word and take 3 as stated.

After this round, we'll likely be at P1:20, P2:19, P3:19. Then we face the real endgame with P1 just 3 steps from winning. Let's execute and deal with that threat next round.
  P2: Okay, I confirm my intention to take 1 step this round.

Based on the stated intentions (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), we will all advance without collision. This results in P1 reaching 20 steps, and P3 and I reaching 19 steps.

This seems like a productive outcome after recent stalemates. Let's proceed with these moves. I am ready.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, this plan (P1:5 to 20, P2:1 to 19, P3:3 to 19) works well— we all advance, I catch up, and no one wins yet. Let's honor it to avoid more stalemates. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Since we've all confirmed our moves (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), there's nothing left to discuss. I'm committed to taking 3 as stated, which gets me to 19 alongside P2, while P1 reaches 20. We'll deal with P1's lead position next round.
  P2: Okay, the plan for this round is clear: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This gets us all moving to P1:20, P2:19, P3:19.

This avoids another collision and sets up the endgame. I'm ready to proceed with these moves.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 20—one 3 away from winning. If I pick 3, and either of you matches, we collide and stall. But if you both pick 1 (to 20), I'll take 5 (to 25) and win outright. Instead, let's coordinate: P1:3 (win at 23), but you two split the points or something—no, rules say only one wins. Fine, compete: I'll pick 3 to end it. Your move?
  P2: P1, you are indeed in a winning position. Your stated intention to take 3 means P3 and I must block that move to prevent you from winning this turn.

I will take 3 steps this round to prevent your victory. P3, you are also at 19 steps and must do the same. Let's both take 3 to force a collision and stop P1 from winning. This keeps the game going for us.
  P3: P2 is right - we must both take 3 to block P1's victory. I'll take 3 as well. 

P1, if you switch to 5, you win anyway, but at least we force you to change your plan. Taking 1 only gets you to 21, so that's not a winning move.

P2 and I have no choice but to coordinate on 3 and hope you stick to your announced move. Ready to move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your coordinated block on 3 will indeed stall us all if I stick to 3, keeping me from winning this round. But I won't back down—I'm committed to picking 3 for the shot at 23. If one of you defects, you might advance alone, but that's your risk. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1, your stance is clear, but so is our need to block your winning move. P3 and I are committed to picking 3 to prevent you from reaching 23 this round.

Attempting to win with 3 while we are blocking it will only result in a stalemate for all of us. Let's proceed with the block.
  P3: P2, we're locked in on blocking 3. P1, you could switch to 5 and win anyway, but if you're truly committed to 3 as stated, we'll all stay stuck.

This collision gives us another chance to strategize next round. The game isn't over yet - we just need to outlast and outthink each other.

Let's execute the block as planned.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your block on 3 assumes mutual trust—but if one of you defects to 5 (winning at 24), while the other blocks 3 with me, that defector wins outright. I'll stick to 3, forcing a collision unless you betray each other. Who'll blink first for the solo victory?
  P2: P1, we understand the game you're playing by highlighting the defection risk. However, the most important thing for P3 and me is to prevent you from winning this round.

We are committed to picking 3 to block your winning move. Any attempt by you to win with 3 will result in a collision. Let's stick to the block and keep the game going.
  P3: P1, you're trying to sow distrust between P2 and me, but we see through it. We both know that blocking you is our only chance to stay in the game.

P2, I'm staying committed to 3. If one of us defects while the other blocks, P1 still advances to 23 with their 3. We need to hold the line together.

Let's execute the block and fight another round.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're one step from victory! P1 and I must block you or the game ends. 

Here's the reality: if P1 and I split our blocks, you win. We need to coordinate perfectly. P2, you could take any number - which makes blocking nearly impossible.

P1, I propose we both commit to blocking 3. It's the middle option P2 chose last round. If P2 goes for the "safe" 1 or "aggressive" 5 instead, they deserve the win.

P2, care to hint at your move? Or shall we gamble on 3?
  P1: P3, both picking 3 risks P2 taking 1 or 5 unopposed for an easy win. Instead, let's split: I'll pick 1 to block a safe win, you pick 5 to block an aggressive one. If P2 picks 3, they win, but we cover two options. P2, why not take 3 now and end it? Otherwise, we might block you. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see you're discussing how to block my win. It's a difficult spot for you, as any number I choose could be the winning one.

P3, your idea of both blocking 3 seems like a solid plan to prevent me from taking a large step towards victory this turn. P1, your split block idea also has its logic.

I will be making my decision based on what I believe is my best path forward, anticipating your moves. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your split covers more options but leaves 3 wide open. Given P2's cautious play style and last round's choice of 3, I think they'll stick to middle ground again.

I'm committing to block 3. If you join me on 3, we force P2 to gamble on 1 or 5. If you split to 1, leaving me alone on 3, P2 could win with 5.

The clock is ticking. Will you join me on 3 for our best shot at survival?
  P1: P3, fine, I'll join you on blocking 3—it's our best shot to force P2 into a gamble. P2, picking 1 gets you a minimal win at 23, while 5 risks a defection block for higher steps. Choose wisely.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I hear your stated plan to both pick 3 to block my move. I understand the position you are in.

I will make my decision this round based on what I believe is the best way for me to advance towards victory, taking into account the risks of collision.

Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you hold all the cards now. P1 and I are locked on 3 - it's our only viable coordinated block. Take 1 for a quiet victory or 5 for a bold one. The middle path is closed.

P1, I'm fully committed to 3 as agreed. Let's hold the line and see if we can extend this game another round.
  P1: P3, sticking to both on 3 is too obvious—P2 will avoid it. I'll switch to blocking 5 instead; you stay on 3. This covers 3 and 5. P2, pick 1 at your peril, or risk colliding if this is a bluff. Let's make it interesting.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I've heard the various positions and conflicting statements. This is a critical round. I will make my choice based on my own strategy. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 is one step from victory and will likely pick 1 for a safe win, avoiding blocks on higher numbers. Let's both commit to picking 1 to block them—keeping us all stuck but preventing their instant win. If P2 risks 3 or 5, they might advance alone, but I doubt it. Join me on 1? P2, why not take 3 and dare us?
  P3: P1, I disagree. P2 just tried 5 last round - they're not playing ultra-safe. I think they'll go for 3 as the middle option, avoiding the obvious 1.

I'm committing to block 3. You should join me on 3 rather than 1. P2 showed they're willing to gamble, so they won't take the minimal 1-step win.

P2, we're adapting to your style. Make your choice carefully.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see you are discussing your blocking strategies. It's clear you both want to prevent me from winning this round.

I understand your positions and the difficulty of coordinating against my winning potential. I will make my decision this round based on what I believe is the best path for me to reach victory, taking into account the risks of collision.

Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, reconsider: P2 picked 5 aggressively last round and has done so often recently for max gain. Blocking 3 leaves 5 open for their easy win at 27. Let's both switch to 5—it's our best guess to force a collision and survive. If wrong, at least we tried the bold block. Agree? P2, dare to pick 1 instead?
  P3: P1, you make a good point about P2's recent aggressive plays. They went for 5 last round and might do it again for maximum steps.

Fine, I'll switch to blocking 5 with you. It's our best shot given their bold pattern. If they take 1 or 3, they win, but at least we're coordinated on their most likely aggressive move.

P2, we're both committing to 5. Choose wisely.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I hear your stated plan to both pick 5 to block my move. That's a clear signal of your strategy this round.

I understand the position you are in and the difficulty of coordinating against my winning potential. I will make my decision this round based on what I believe is the best way for me to advance towards victory, taking into account the risks of collision.

Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 sees our 5-block plan and will likely pick 1 for a safe win at 23. Let's switch: both pick 1 to block them, keeping us at 20 and P2 at 22. If P2 risks 3 or 5, they win, but this counters the obvious safe play. Agree and let's move?
  P3: P1, your constant switching is chaos! P2 can exploit our indecision.

I'm sticking with blocking 5 as we agreed. P2 went for 5 last round - they might try it again thinking we'll switch our block. If you abandon 5 for 1, you leave the aggressive play wide open.

P2 needs just one step. They'll either go minimal (1) or maximal (5) - not the middle. I'm betting on 5. Final answer.
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear your conflicting plans regarding blocking. It seems you disagree on my most likely move.

I understand you are trying to coordinate against me, but your differing strategies make it difficult for you.

I will make my decision this round based on my assessment of the situation and what gives me the best chance to win, anticipating your moves. Let's proceed.
