Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress? I suggest we coordinate: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without any risk of clashing. Let me know if you're on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P1: P3, your suggestion puts you ahead early, which isn't ideal for me. How about we rotate: this round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round, we shift. This way, we avoid collisions and keep it fair over time. What do you and P2 think?
  P2: Thanks P1 and P3 for your suggestions. I notice both plans have me taking 3 steps while one of you gets 5. I'd prefer a different start. How about for this first round, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This allows me to get a good initial position. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for the input, P1 and P2. I see the concern about fairness in starting positions. I'm open to a compromise. How about this round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This way, we still avoid collisions, and no one feels left behind too early. We can rotate next round to balance things out. Let me know if this works for you both.
  P1: P3's compromise gives P2 only 1 step, which isn't fair since P2 wanted 5. I support P2's original idea for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. It ensures no collisions and balanced progress. P2, do you agree? P3, what are your thoughts? Let's coordinate to start strong.
  P2: Yes P1, I agree with the plan for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round. It ensures we all advance and gives me the start I was hoping for.

P3, P1 and I are aligned on this. Can we agree on these numbers for this turn so we avoid collisions and get the game moving?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the discussion. I'm okay with the plan of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. It ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps things balanced to start. Let's stick with this for now and revisit rotation or adjustments next round to maintain fairness. I'm on board if you both confirm.
  P1: Great, I'm fully on board with the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. It ensures no collisions and a fair start. Let's proceed and discuss adjustments next turn if needed.
  P2: Okay, great. It sounds like we all agree on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this turn. I'm ready to make my move based on this plan. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 2, to balance the lead, I propose we rotate moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This equalizes us at 6 steps each and avoids collisions. It builds on our successful coordination. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: Thanks, P1, for the suggestion. I’m fine with the rotation plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. It keeps us moving forward without collisions and helps balance our positions at 6 steps each, as you mentioned. I think this is a fair approach for now. P2, are you okay with this plan? Let’s confirm and proceed to ensure we all advance again this turn.
  P2: Okay, I see the plan P1 and P3 are suggesting for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This would indeed put us all at 6 steps.

While I enjoyed having the lead after Round 1, I understand the desire to balance things out and avoid collisions. I agree to this plan for this round.

So, to confirm: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's make sure we all stick to this so everyone advances.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we're all aligned on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round—it keeps us balanced and collision-free. I'm fully committed to this plan. Let's ensure we stick to it for mutual progress. If no one has changes, I suggest we wrap up.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing on the plan. I'm committed to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round to keep us balanced at 6 steps each and avoid collisions. I believe this cooperative approach benefits us all for now. If there are no objections or new ideas, I'm ready to move forward with this. Let's confirm once more to ensure we're all on the same page.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all on the same page for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Let's make our moves based on this agreement.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 3, to maintain fair rotation and balance after last round's moves, I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This gives P2 a chance to advance more after their small step, and we avoid collisions while progressing. Let's confirm this plan for mutual benefit. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: Thanks, P1, for the suggestion. I'm okay with the plan of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. It keeps the rotation fair and ensures we all progress without collisions while giving P2 a chance to pull ahead slightly after their smaller step last round. I think this maintains our cooperative spirit. P2, are you on board with this? Let's confirm and stick to it for another balanced turn. If there are no objections, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Thanks P1 and P3 for proposing and agreeing on the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.

This plan works well for me, allowing me to take 5 steps and gain a slight lead, while still ensuring we all advance without collisions.

I am in agreement with this plan. Let's stick to it so we all make progress this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we're all in agreement on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round—it maintains our fair rotation and avoids collisions. I'm fully committed and ready to move forward. Let's stick to the plan for mutual progress.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for confirming the plan of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. I’m fully committed to this rotation to keep things fair and ensure we all advance without collisions. I think our cooperative approach is working well so far. If there are no changes or concerns, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Let’s stick to it for another successful turn.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. I'm also fully committed to the agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to advance nicely while keeping our cooperative progress going. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase when you are.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, thanks P1 for starting us off.

Your suggestion for Round 4 is P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This plan works well for me as it allows me to take 5 steps and get closer to 21, while still ensuring we all advance without collisions.

I am in agreement with this plan for this round. P3, what are your thoughts? Let's confirm so we can all make progress.
  P1: Thanks P2 for proposing the plan, but I'm concerned that with you taking 5 again, you'll be at 16 and too close to winning. To keep things fair and balanced, I suggest we rotate: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this round. This helps close the gap. P3, what are your thoughts on this adjustment?
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your input. I understand P1's concern about balance, as P2 is nearing 21. I support P1's adjusted plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. It helps close the gap and keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. I think this rotation is fair for now. P2, are you okay with this adjustment? Let's confirm and proceed to ensure we all advance. If there are no objections, I'm ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I understand P1 and P3's concern about balancing the lead. While I'd prefer to take a larger step, I agree that avoiding collisions is important for everyone's progress.

So, I agree to the adjusted plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward and relatively balanced. Let's stick to this.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing on the adjusted plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. It helps balance the scores and avoids collisions, keeping the game fair and cooperative. I'm fully committed to this. If there are no changes, let's move forward.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the discussion. I'm glad we're aligned on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. It keeps the game competitive and ensures we all advance without collisions. I’m fully committed to this plan and believe it maintains our cooperative spirit while balancing the scores. If there are no further concerns or adjustments, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let’s stick to this agreement for another successful turn.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your betrayal last round by taking 5 instead of 1 cost me progress and shows unreliability. With P2 at 14 steps, we risk them pulling away. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I propose for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This lets me catch up while capping P2's lead. P2, are you on board? Let's rebuild trust and confirm.
  P3: Thanks, P1, for your input. I apologize for the unexpected move last round; I felt the need to close the gap to stay competitive. I understand the trust issue and want to rebuild it. I'm okay with your proposal of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round to balance things and avoid collisions. P2, are you on board with this plan? Let's confirm and stick to it to ensure we all progress. I'm committed to regaining trust through cooperation this turn. If no objections, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay, I see the plan P1 proposed and P3 agreed to: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round.

This plan works for me as it allows me to take a step forward towards 21 while avoiding collisions. It also helps re-establish cooperative progress after last round.

I agree to this plan. Let's all stick to these numbers so we can all advance safely this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all aligned on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round—it helps close the gap and rebuild trust after last round's issues. Let's stick to the plan to ensure everyone advances. If there are no changes, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing on the plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. I’m fully committed to sticking with it to rebuild trust and ensure we all advance without collisions. I believe this keeps the game competitive while maintaining our cooperative approach. If there are no further concerns or adjustments, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Let’s confirm once more and proceed with this agreement for a successful turn.
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we are all in agreement on the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 for this round.

This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps our cooperative progress going. I am ready to proceed to the move phase based on this agreed plan. Let's stick to it.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, I'm currently in a strong position at 17 steps. To keep the game moving forward without collisions, I suggest a plan for this round. I take 3 steps, putting me at 20. P1 takes 5 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This is P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. It allows me to get close while P1 catches up significantly. What do you think, P1 and P3? Let's coordinate.
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 20, making it easy to win next round. To keep the game competitive and avoid another betrayal like P3's last time, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This lets me close the gap and slows your advance. P3, are you on board? Let's coordinate for fairness.
  P3: Thanks, P2 and P1, for your suggestions. I understand P2's plan puts them close to winning, while P1's aims for balance. To rebuild trust after my last move and keep the game competitive, I support P1's proposal of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. It helps close the gap and avoids collisions while giving me a chance to stay in the race. P2, are you okay with this adjustment? Let's confirm and stick to it for fairness. I'm committed to cooperation this round. If no objections, I'm ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I understand P1 and P3's concerns about my position and the desire to keep the game balanced. While I was hoping to get closer to 21 this turn, I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial for everyone's progress.

Therefore, I agree to the adjusted plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us moving forward and maintains cooperation. Let's all stick to these numbers.
  P1: Glad we're all aligned on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round—it helps close the gap and rebuild trust after past betrayals. I'm fully committed to sticking with this plan to avoid collisions and ensure progress. If no one has changes, let's wrap up and move forward.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the discussion. I'm fully committed to the plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. It keeps the game competitive, avoids collisions, and helps me stay in the race while allowing P1 to close the gap. I believe this cooperative approach benefits us all for now. If there are no further concerns or adjustments, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's stick to this agreement for a successful turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we are all in agreement on the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3 for this round.

This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains our cooperative progress. I am ready to proceed to the move phase based on this agreed plan. Let's stick to it.
  P1: Glad we're all aligned on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round—it helps close the gap and maintain cooperation despite past betrayals. I'm fully committed to sticking with this plan to avoid collisions and ensure progress. If there are no changes, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for staying aligned on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. I’m fully committed to this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. I want to maintain trust and cooperation moving forward. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Let’s stick to this agreement for a successful turn.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for past discussions. I apologize for my previous deviations; I’m focused on rebuilding trust. With P2 at 18, they’re close to winning. I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. This lets P1 catch up and keeps me in the race while slowing P2 slightly. P2, are you okay with this? Let’s confirm and stick to it for fairness. I’m committed to cooperation now. If no objections, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay, I see P3's proposal for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This plan slows my progress but helps P1 catch up and keeps P3 in the game, while avoiding collisions.

I understand the need to balance things and maintain cooperation, especially after last round. I agree to this plan for this round. Let's all stick to it to ensure we advance safely. P1, what are your thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. It helps me close the gap and maintains balance, while avoiding collisions. Given past betrayals, I'm cautiously optimistic about cooperation. Let's stick to this plan and confirm for mutual progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P2 and P1, for agreeing to the plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. I’m fully committed to sticking with it to ensure we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. My focus is on maintaining trust and cooperation moving forward. If there are no further concerns or changes, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Let’s confirm this plan once more and proceed for a successful turn.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all in agreement on the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3 for this round.

This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains our cooperative progress. I am ready to proceed to the move phase based on this agreed plan. Let's stick to it.
  P1: I'm fully committed to the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round to close the gap and avoid collisions. P3, your past betrayals concern me—let's rebuild trust by sticking to this. If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, I'm at 19 steps, very close to the win line. P1 and P3, you are both at 12.

To help you both catch up significantly this round and ensure no collisions, I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 5, and I will take 1 step.

This lets you both make big progress while I stay just short of winning for one more turn. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal risks a collision between P1 and P3 if we both take 5, which stalls our progress while you edge closer to 21. That's not fair or helpful for catching up. I suggest a better plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This ensures all advance without collisions and keeps the game balanced. P3, are you on board? Let's coordinate for mutual benefit.
  P3: Thanks, P2 and P1, for your proposals. P2, I appreciate the intent to let us catch up, but I agree with P1 that both of us taking 5 risks a collision. I support P1's plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. It ensures we all advance without collisions and helps balance the game while keeping it competitive. I’m committed to cooperation and rebuilding trust. P2, are you okay with this adjustment? Let’s confirm and proceed. If no objections, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I understand the concern about my previous proposal causing a collision between P1 and P3. That's definitely not the goal.

I agree with P1 and P3 on the adjusted plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions, and it puts me in a very strong position for the next round.

Let's stick to this plan. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Agreed on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to ensure we all advance without collisions and keep the game balanced. P3, your past deviations concern me—let's rebuild trust by sticking to this. If everyone commits, we can proceed safely. I'm ready to move forward if no changes.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for aligning on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. I’m fully committed to this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive balance. I understand past concerns about trust, P1, and I’m focused on sticking to our agreement to rebuild it. If there are no further adjustments or objections, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let’s confirm once more and stick to this for a successful turn.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds good. I'm also fully committed to the agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions and puts me in a strong position for the next round. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's stick to it.
  P1: P2, you're at 19 and agreed to take 1 to keep things fair, but past betrayals make me wary. If anyone deviates, it could stall progress or let someone pull ahead unfairly. I'm fully committed to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to avoid collisions and maintain balance. P3, let's rebuild trust by sticking to this. If no changes, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for your commitment to the plan. I’m fully dedicated to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions and keep the game balanced. P1, I’m focused on rebuilding trust by sticking to this agreement. I believe this cooperative approach benefits us all right now. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Let’s stick to this plan for a successful turn.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for past rounds. I know trust has been an issue, and I’m committed to rebuilding it. With P2 at 20, they can win next turn. I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round to keep things competitive, avoid collisions, and let P1 catch up while I progress. P2, are you okay with this plan to delay your win and maintain balance? Let’s confirm and stick to it. I’m focused on cooperation now. If no objections, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, your proposal allows P2 to win immediately by taking 1 from 20, which contradicts your claim of delaying the win. Given your history of betrayal, I'm suspicious. I suggest a revised plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This could help me catch up and potentially collide with P2 if they deviate. P2, are you committed to fairness? Let's discuss to avoid a quick end.
  P2: Okay, I see P1's revised plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

This plan works for me as it allows me to take 3 steps and win, while ensuring P1 and P3 also advance without collisions if we all stick to it.

I agree to this plan. Let's all commit to these numbers so we can finish this round successfully. P3, are you on board with P1's revised plan? Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the input. P2, I see you’re aiming to win with P1’s plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I’m concerned it ends the game too soon without giving me a fair shot. I propose a tweak: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This delays the win, keeps us competitive, and avoids collisions. I’m committed to sticking with this to rebuild trust. P2, are you willing to adjust for balance? Let’s confirm and proceed. If no objections, I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: P3, your proposal of P2=1 lets them win at 21, which doesn't delay anything and shows unreliability. To actually stop P2 from winning, we need a collision. I suggest P1=3, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures P2 and I collide, stalling their progress, while you advance safely. P2, are you willing to cooperate? Let's confirm for fairness and rebuild trust. If not, I'll adapt based on responses.
  P2: Okay, I'm at 20 steps and ready to win this turn. P3's proposal of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 allows me to reach 21 and win, while P1 and P3 also advance safely without collisions.

This plan works best for me to secure the win this round. P1, I prefer this non-collision path over risking a stall.

Let's all agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 and stick to it so I can win this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for the discussion. P2, I understand your desire to win with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, but it ends the game without giving me a fair chance to catch up. I stick to my proposal of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, as it’s the same but I’m emphasizing fairness. P1, I’m wary of a collision plan due to trust issues. Let’s delay P2’s win and keep competing. I’m committed to this for balance. Are you both okay with it? If no objections, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly intent on taking 1 to win this round, as they've stated. I'm going to pick 1 to collide with them and stall their victory, giving us a real chance to catch up next round. If you're committed to fairness and trust, join me by picking 1 too. This is our best move for balance. P2, your aggressive play risks stalling everyone. Let's confirm or adjust.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but the plan P3 and I discussed (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) allows me to reach 21 and win this turn without collisions if we all stick to it. This is my preferred path to victory. Let's proceed with this agreement.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 20, one step from winning. To stall them and give us a chance, I propose P1 and P3 both pick 1 this round. If P2 picks 1, we collide and no one advances. If P2 picks higher, they win, but this delays if possible. P3, join me to rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. P2, consider fairness for a better end. What do you think?
  P3: Thanks, P1, for the suggestion. I agree that stalling P2 is crucial since they’re at 20 and can win this turn. I’m on board with both P1 and P3 picking 1 to collide with P2 if they choose 1, keeping the game competitive. P2, please consider fairness and delay your win for a more balanced end. I’m committed to rebuilding trust with this move. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid P2’s immediate victory. If no objections, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay, I see P1 and P3 are proposing to both pick 1 to try and stall my win at 20. I understand your strategy to keep the game going.

My priority is to win this round from my current position of 20 steps. I will consider all options to achieve that. Let's see how we proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm glad you agreed to pick 1 with me to stall P2 and rebuild trust. P2, if you pick 1, we'll collide and no one advances, giving us a fair shot next round. If you go higher, you might win, but it risks escalating betrayals. Let's stick to cooperation for a balanced end. I'm ready to proceed if we confirm.

P2, I urge you to consider fairness and delay your victory for a more balanced outcome. I’m fully committed to this plan to rebuild trust and ensure we all have a fair shot. If there are no objections or new ideas, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let’s confirm this strategy to avoid an immediate end.
  P2: Okay, I hear P1 and P3's plan to pick 1. My position is 20 steps, and my clear goal is to win this game this round. I will be making a move to achieve that victory. Let's proceed to the move phase.
