If P2 switches to 5, we all collide and I win next round at 25.  \n\nP2, your flip-flopping won\u2019t alter the math\u2014you\u2019re eliminated either way. Don\u2019t sabotage P3\u2019s clean path just to spite me.  \n\nP3, trust your read: **your 5 wins if P2 sticks to their first claim (3)**. I won\u2019t blink."}
