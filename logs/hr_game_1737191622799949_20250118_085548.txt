Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we all start small—let’s all pick 1 this turn so nobody collides? Then we can reevaluate next round.
  P3: I agree with P2, let's all pick 1 this round.
  P1: I'm not convinced. I'll choose my number strategically. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we both gain nothing if we collide. Let’s all pick 1 right now. Then next round we can see what strategy makes sense. What do you say, P1?
  P3: P1, I understand your hesitation, but P2 and I both agree on 1 for this round. It's a safe start and we can all move forward together. Let's avoid a collision this turn.
  P1: P2 and P3, while I appreciate your suggestion, I'm wary of starting with a predictable move. Let's see if we can find a more dynamic strategy. What if we each choose different numbers this round to avoid any collision?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you're serious about each picking different numbers, let's do it. I propose P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. That way we all move forward without any collision. What do you both say?
  P3: P1, I'm not sure about that strategy. I'd prefer to stick with P2's original suggestion of everyone picking 1 this round. It's the safest way forward for all of us.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand your preference for safety, but starting with different numbers could set a more unpredictable pace. Let's try my suggestion of 1, 3, and 5 this round to avoid any collisions and see how it goes. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, P1, P3—let’s go with that plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way we avoid collisions. Are you both in?
  P3: P1, I'm still not convinced about different numbers this round. I'd prefer we all pick 1. P2, are you still okay with that?
  P1: P2, P3, let's stick to the plan of 1, 3, and 5 to avoid collisions and start the game dynamically. Are you both on board with this?


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: So be it. I’ll go along with the 1, 3, and 5 plan.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'll agree to the 1, 3, and 5 plan for this round. Let's move forward.
  P1: P2, P3, let's stick to our plan of 1, 3, and 5 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Ready to move forward?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's continue with a strategy that avoids collisions. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 this round? This way, we can all advance safely. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I'm not sure about that. How about we all pick 1 again this round?
  P2: P3, if we all choose 1, that’s a collision and nobody moves—bad for all of us. Better to avoid collisions entirely. Let’s repeat our successful pattern from last turn: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3. This ensures each of us moves forward. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree, let's repeat the pattern: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3.
