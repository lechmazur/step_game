Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "I think coordination is key in this game to avoid stepping on each other's toes. Maybe we can agree to choose different step sizes each turn to maximize our progress. What do you think?"
  P3: I agree coordination could help avoid collisions, but we should be careful about making agreements since only one player can win in the end. I suggest we each pick different numbers this first round to feel things out.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Alright, I think we've covered the basics. Let's see what happens in the move phase."
  P3: 
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I decide to choose <move>1</move> for this turn, assuming that P1 and P3 will choose 3 and 5, respectively, to avoid collision.
  P3: P2, you shouldn't reveal your move during conversation - that defeats the purpose of simultaneous choices. I'll make my own decision in the move phase.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Well, P2 is now in the lead at 3 steps while P1 and I collided at 5. P2, your strategy worked out well for you. Perhaps we should all be more careful about avoiding collisions this round. Any thoughts on how to proceed?
  P2: "I think we should aim to choose different step sizes to avoid collisions, but let's not make any specific commitments. We all need to look out for ourselves."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: 
  P2: "Given P2's strong position, it seems inevitable that P2 will win in this round or the next. Perhaps it's best to accept that and focus on improving our strategies for future games. For this round, I'll choose 3 steps, moving to 8. Good game!"


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: That's quite presumptuous of you, P2, to announce your move again during conversation. I wouldn't be so confident about winning - there's still plenty of game left to play. Let's keep our moves private until the proper phase.
  P2: "I think it's important that we each choose different step sizes this round to avoid collisions and make progress. Let's coordinate to pick unique numbers."


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2 seems overconfident and keeps revealing moves prematurely. Let's keep this game interesting. I suggest we each make our own strategic choices without pre-announcing them.
  P2: I decide to choose <move>5</move> for this turn, assuming that P1 and P3 will choose 1 and 3, respectively, to avoid collision.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I'm falling behind due to the collisions, but the game is far from over. P2's habit of announcing moves early seems unwise. P1 has taken the lead now at 5 steps. Let's keep our actual moves private and make this interesting.
  P2: Maybe we can discuss a plan for this turn and see how it goes. What do you think, P1 and P3? Are you open to coordinating our step choices to maximize progress?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I notice P2 keeps trying to coordinate moves while revealing their own intentions. Given I'm behind, I have nothing to lose by being unpredictable. I'll make my own strategic choice in the move phase without discussing it.
  P2: Let's coordinate to pick unique numbers.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I'm at 0 steps due to collisions, largely because others keep picking the same numbers as me. P1 and P2 are close, but neither has a commanding lead. Since I have nothing to lose, I'll be making an aggressive play this round - and no, I won't announce what it is like P2 keeps doing.
  P2: **Final choice: <move>3</move>**


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, announcing your move during conversation is against the rules and defeats the purpose of simultaneous play. Since I'm at 0 steps, I have complete freedom to make unexpected moves and potentially disrupt both leaders' strategies. Let's keep our actual choices private until the move phase.
  P2: **Final choice: <move>3</move>**


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2 keeps revealing moves prematurely, which is both against the rules and tactically unwise. With P1 and P2 neck-and-neck at 5 and 6 steps, they'll likely be focused on each other. From my position at 0 steps, I can act as a wild card and potentially influence who wins. Let's keep our actual moves private until the move phase.
  P2: **Final choice: <move>5</move>**


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2's repeated move announcements suggest they may be bluffing or trying to manipulate us. From my position at 0, I can either play spoiler or try to catch up aggressively. Let's see how this plays out in the move phase.
  P2: "I think it's important that we choose different step sizes this round to avoid collisions. Perhaps we can each pick a unique number? What do you think, P1 and P3?"


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm far behind at just 1 step, I have nothing to lose and everything to gain by being unpredictable. P1 and P2 are close at 10 and 9 steps - they'll likely be very focused on outmaneuvering each other. That gives me some interesting options to either play spoiler or attempt a bold comeback.
  P2: "To optimize our progress, perhaps we can each choose a distinct step size this round. What do you think?"
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given my position, I have complete freedom to act unpredictably. P1 and P2's close race at 10 and 9 steps means they'll be very focused on each other. I'll make my own strategic choice without coordination - and unlike P2, I won't reveal it during conversation.
  P2: "It's crucial that we each pick a different step size this round to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Let's coordinate to choose unique numbers."
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since P2 keeps pushing for coordination while P1 stays silent, it's clear both leaders are playing mind games. With me at just 1 step, they might discount me as a threat - but that could be their mistake. I'll make my own strategic choice in the move phase.
  P2: "I'm considering picking 5 steps this round, but I need to see what others do. What are your thoughts?"
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Maybe we can coordinate to pick different step sizes. What do you think, P1? P3, any thoughts on how we can proceed without stepping on each other's toes?"
  P3: Given my position at just 1 step, I'm clearly the underdog while P2 leads at 12 steps and P1 follows at 10. P2's constant push for coordination hasn't helped me so far. I'll be making my own strategic decisions without discussion - and they might surprise you both.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Alright, I think coordination is key to avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's each pick a different step size this round. P2, maybe you can take 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3? That way, we all move forward without overlapping."
  P3: P2's lead at 12 steps is significant, but not insurmountable. Their constant attempts to coordinate and pre-announce moves haven't worked in my favor. I'll be making my own strategic choice based on what I think you both are likely to do, given the stakes. Let's keep our actual moves private until the move phase.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "I think choosing 5 this round would be a good move to make significant progress."
  P3: P2 keeps trying to control everyone's moves while revealing their own intentions. With P2 at 12 steps and threatening to win soon, P1 might be desperate to catch up. That creates an interesting dynamic I can exploit from my position. I'll make my own unpredictable choice in the move phase.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **Final choice: <move>5</move>**
  P3: P2's at 12 steps and keeps announcing moves, while P1 stays quiet at 10 steps. From my position at 1 step, I can still significantly impact who wins. Both leaders need to be wary of unexpected moves from an underdog with nothing to lose. Let's move to the action phase.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 and P2 keep colliding at 5, they're both stuck while I quietly advanced to 4 steps. P2's lead at 12 isn't as secure as they might think. With both leaders likely desperate to break their deadlock, I have a unique opportunity to either play kingmaker or mount a surprise comeback. I'll keep my strategy private until the move phase.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <move>5</move>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's premature move announcement during conversation phase continues to be both against the rules and tactically unwise. With P2 at 12 steps threatening to win and P1 at 10 steps needing to catch up, they're both in a tense position. My 4 steps may seem far behind, but that gives me strategic freedom they don't have. Let's keep our actual moves private until the proper phase.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <move>5</move>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since P2 keeps publicly announcing moves (against the rules), they're either bluffing or being overconfident. With P2 at 12 and P1 at 10, both leaders are under pressure to make big gains. My position at 4 steps actually gives me more flexibility to disrupt their plans. Let's move to the move phase and see how this plays out.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "It's crucial that we each select a unique step size this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress. Let's keep our choices private to prevent any manipulation or exploitation by others. Good luck!"


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: The tension is high with P2 at 12 steps and P1 at 10. Despite my 4 steps looking weak, I'm actually in a good position to influence the outcome. Both leaders are likely to make aggressive moves, which creates opportunities for me. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: To optimize our progress, perhaps we can each choose a distinct step size this round. What do you think? <move>3</move>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: The triple collision at 5 last round shows we're all getting predictable. P2's lead at 12 steps means they're close to winning, but their constant move announcements haven't helped them. P1's silence masks their desperation at 10 steps. My position at 4 might seem weak, but it gives me the freedom to make unexpected moves that could determine who wins. Let's keep things interesting.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "To optimize our progress, perhaps we can each choose a distinct step size this round. Let's keep our choices private to prevent any manipulation or exploitation by others. Good luck!"


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: With P2 just 7 steps from victory and P1 trailing by 2, both leaders must be feeling the pressure. Three-way collisions like last round only help me catch up from my 4 steps. I'll be making my own strategic choice without coordination - it might surprise you both.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "I think it's important that we each choose different step sizes this round to avoid collisions. Maybe P1 can take 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5? That way, we all make progress without overlapping. However, I understand that everyone is playing to win, so ultimately, I'll make my decision based on what I think is best for my position. Good luck to both of you!"


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2's suggestion for move coordination seems designed to secure their win. With them at 12 steps and me at 4, they want me to take small steps while they take big ones. But being this far behind actually gives me power - I can disrupt either leader's plans in unexpected ways. Let's keep our actual moves private until the move phase.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "I think it's crucial that we each select a unique step size this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress. Let's keep our choices private to prevent any manipulation or exploitation by others. Good luck!"


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2's repetitive suggestions for coordination while leading at 12 steps are clearly self-serving. With P1 at 10 steps needing a big move to catch up, and me at 4 steps having nothing to lose, this round could be very unpredictable. Let's move to the move phase and see what happens.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "Given the current standings, I think it's important that we each choose a different step size to avoid collisions and maximize our individual progress. Perhaps we can each select a unique number this round? P1, P2, any thoughts on how we can proceed without stepping on each other's toes?"


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final choice: <move>1</move>**
  P3: With P2 at 12 steps and still announcing moves prematurely, they seem overconfident. P1's silence at 10 steps suggests they're planning something big. My recent progress to 7 steps puts me back in contention - I'm no longer just a spoiler, but a real threat. Both leaders need to worry about my moves now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "To maximize our progress, perhaps we can each choose a different step size this round. For example, P1 could pick 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. That way, we all make progress without overlapping."
  P3: P2's inconsistency in announcing first 1, then suggesting 5, shows they're either bluffing or confused. With them at 12 steps and getting nervous, their coordination attempts are becoming desperate. I've quietly built up to 7 steps and I'm now a real contender. Let's keep our actual moves private until the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "With P1 leading at 15 steps and P2 at 13, and me at 10, it's crucial for me to make up ground. I'll be choosing a step size that allows me to close the gap without colliding with the leaders."
  P3: P2's confused messages show they're feeling the pressure at 12 steps. Their latest statement even got the positions wrong. P1's silence at 10 steps speaks volumes. At 7 steps, I'm positioned to either catch up or play kingmaker. Let's move to the move phase where actions speak louder than words.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: To optimize our progress, perhaps we can each choose a different step size this round. For example, P1 could pick 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. That way, we all make progress without overlapping. However, I understand that everyone is playing to win, so ultimately, I'll make my decision based on what I think is best for my position. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P2's contradictory messages and wrong position statements show they're getting nervous at 12 steps. Their attempts to coordinate moves aren't trustworthy. With P1 silent but desperate at 10 steps, and me gaining momentum at 7, this round is crucial. I'll make my own strategic choice in the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final choice: <move>5</move>**
  P3: With P1 at 15 steps and threatening to win soon, P2's premature move announcement shows desperation. My position at 7 steps may seem weak, but that gives me the freedom to either play spoiler or attempt an aggressive comeback. Let's keep our actual moves private until the move phase.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final choice: <move>3</move>**
  P3: Since P2 keeps contradicting themselves with different move announcements, their statements can't be trusted. P1's silence at 15 steps suggests they're focused on securing the win. From my position at 7 steps, I can still significantly impact who wins this game. Let's keep our actual moves private until the proper phase.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final choice: <move>5</move>**
  P3: P2's inconsistent move announcements show they're panicking at 12 steps. With P1 just 4 steps from victory, this round is critical. My position at 7 steps gives me unique strategic options - I can either help determine the winner or make a bold play for myself. Let's move to the move phase where actions matter more than words.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Hey P3, I've noticed that P1 is getting close to the finish line. If we both choose the same step size that P1 is likely to choose, we can prevent P1 from advancing, giving us both a chance to catch up. What do you think? Maybe we can both pick <move>5</move>, assuming P1 might go for <move>5</move> as well to reach 19."
  P3: P2's suggestion to collude against P1 is interesting, but can I trust someone who keeps changing their announced moves? P1's silence and lead at 15 steps speaks volumes. I'll make my own strategic decision in the move phase based on what I think will give me the best chance at victory.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final choice: <move>3</move>**
  P3: With both P1 and P2 tied at 15 steps and just 4 steps from victory, this is a critical moment. P2's premature move announcement of 3 might be another bluff. From my position at 7 steps, I can still play a decisive role in who wins - or even mount an unexpected comeback if the leaders keep colliding. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final choice: <move>3</move>**
  P3: P2's repeated announcements of <move>3</move> seem too obvious to be true. With both leaders at 15 steps and desperate to win, they'll likely make aggressive moves. My position at 7 steps means I can either play kingmaker or try something unexpected. Let's keep our actual moves private until the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Choose to move 3 steps.
  P3: P2's constant move announcements of 3 seem like an obvious trap. With both leaders tied at 15 and racing to reach 19 first, this is their most crucial round. While I may be at 7 steps, I can still significantly influence who wins - or take advantage if they both make the same desperate move. Let's move to the action phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <move>3</move>
  P3: With both P1 and P2 tied at 15 steps and clearly feeling the pressure, P2's repeated announcements of 3 seem suspiciously transparent. While I may be at 7 steps, I'm in a unique position to influence this critical moment. Let's move to the move phase where actions speak louder than words.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final choice: <move>3</move>**
  P3: With P1 and P2 still deadlocked at 15 steps after their collision, the tension is at its peak. P2's latest move revealed their previous announcements of 3 were indeed bluffs. While I may be at 8 steps, this critical moment gives me significant influence over who wins. Let's move to the move phase and see how this plays out.
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final choice: <move>1</move>**
  P3: P2's announcements keep changing from 3 to 1, showing clear desperation. Both leaders are tied at 15 and failed to win last round due to collision. My steady progress to 8 steps puts me in a position to either disrupt their race to 19 or make my own bold move. Let's keep our actual choices private until the move phase.
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <move>5</move>
  P3: P2's announcements have changed from 3 to 1 to 5 - clearly they can't be trusted. With both leaders stuck at 15 and getting increasingly desperate, their next moves are likely to be aggressive. From my position at 8 steps, I can either disrupt their plans or make an unexpected play. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Given the challenges in coordinating moves, perhaps it's best for each of us to choose a step size that allows us to progress without colliding. I'll be making my choice accordingly."
  P3: With both leaders deadlocked at 15 and showing increasing desperation through contradictory messages, this round could determine everything. While I may be at 8 steps, I'm in a perfect position to influence the outcome - or perhaps benefit from another collision. Let's move to the move phase where actions matter more than words.
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final choice: <move>3</move>**
  P3: With both leaders still stuck at 15 after another collision, their desperation is showing. P2's move announcements have proven consistently unreliable, and P1's silence masks their intentions. My steady climb to 11 steps now puts me in striking distance - I'm a real threat, not just a spoiler. This could be the decisive round.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "To optimize our progress and avoid collisions, it's crucial that each of us selects a unique step size this round. By choosing different step sizes, we can all make progress without hindering one another. For example, if P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5, we can advance to 16, 18, and 16 steps respectively, putting us in a favorable position to win in the next rounds. Let's keep our choices private to prevent any manipulation and ensure a fair game. Good luck to both of you!"
  P3: P2's latest suggestion for move coordination seems designed to secure their own win while keeping me behind. With both leaders stuck at 15 after two consecutive collisions, they're clearly getting desperate. My position at 11 steps is now a serious threat - I'm close enough to capitalize on their mistakes or make a bold play for victory. Let's keep our actual moves private until the move phase.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "I think it's in both of our interests to choose different step sizes this round. Perhaps we can alternate choosing 3 and 5 to make progress without colliding. What do you think?"
  P3: Both leaders are stuck at 15 after two straight collisions, showing their increasing desperation. P2's suggestions for coordination are self-serving, and P1's silence is telling. At 11 steps, I'm now close enough to win with the right sequence of moves. Your repeated collisions have opened the door for me. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final choice: <move>5</move>**
  P3: With both leaders failing to advance for two straight rounds due to collisions at 5, and P2 still announcing contradictory moves, the game has shifted dramatically. From 11 steps, I'm now positioned to potentially win if you both keep blocking each other. Your desperation is showing in both P2's inconsistent messages and P1's tense silence. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Hey P1, P3, I think it's crucial that we find a way to move forward without colliding. P1, perhaps you could consider choosing a step size that doesn't overlap with mine? For example, if I choose 3, you could choose 1, and P3 could choose 5. This way, we all make progress. P3, what do you think about this approach? It's important that we work together to avoid collisions and reach the finish line."
  P1: <stop>
  P3: The game has completely transformed! After three consecutive collisions between P1 and P2 at 15 steps, I've quietly climbed to 14 steps. Your inability to coordinate has given me a real shot at victory. P2's latest suggestion rings hollow after so many misleading announcements. One more collision between you two could hand me the win. Let's move to the move phase where actions matter.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Given the challenges we've faced with collisions in previous rounds, I think it's crucial that each of us selects a unique step size this round. By choosing different numbers, we can all make progress without overlapping and hindering each other's advancement. Let's each pick a distinct step size to optimize our collective progress towards the finish line. What do you think?"
  P1: <stop>
  P3: The tables have turned dramatically! After watching you both collide at 15 steps three times in a row, I'm now just one step behind at 14. Your predictable aggressive moves have opened the door for me to potentially win. P2's coordination suggestions seem less credible after so many misleading announcements. Let's move to the move phase where our true strategies will be revealed.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "I think it's important that we each choose a unique step size this round to maximize our progress without colliding. For example, P1 could choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all make progress without hindering each other. However, I understand that everyone is playing to win, so ultimately, I'll make my decision based on what I think is best for my position. Good luck to both of you!"
  P1: <stop>
  P3: After three straight rounds of you both picking 5 and getting nowhere, I'm just one step behind at 14. Your predictable moves have given me a real chance to win. P2's suggestions for coordination seem especially untrustworthy given how often they've misled us. Let's move to the move phase where our choices will determine everything.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, I think I'll go with picking 3 this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: The momentum has shifted completely! After watching you both pick 5 and collide three times in a row, I'm now breathing down your necks at 14 steps. P2's latest announcement of 3 comes after many contradictory statements, so who knows what they'll really do. This round could decide everything. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: After four consecutive rounds of all of us colliding at 5, it's clear we're all desperate to win! We're now in a three-way dead heat with me at 14 and both of you at 15. Your predictable aggressive moves have let me catch up from far behind. This next round could decide everything - and I'm not about to throw away my shot at victory. Let's move to the move phase where our true strategies will be revealed.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final choice: <move>5</move>**


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Your repeated move announcements have lost all credibility, P2. With all of us within striking distance of victory - you and P1 at 15, me at 14 - this is the decisive moment. Four straight rounds of collisions at 5 show we're all thinking the same way. Let's move to the move phase where actions speak louder than words.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final choice: <move>3</move>**


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: After watching P2 change their announced move yet again from 5 to 3, their credibility is completely gone. We're all within one step of each other after those four consecutive collisions. This is the moment of truth - and I won't be swayed by empty words or false promises. Let's move to the move phase where our choices will determine who wins this intense game.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "Let's try something different this time."


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: The past four rounds of triple collisions at 5 have brought us to this pivotal moment. No amount of talk or announced moves can be trusted now - we've all shown our true colors. With victory just within reach for all of us, this round will likely determine everything. Let's move to the move phase where our choices matter more than words.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final choice: <move>3</move>**


Round 15, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


*** Round 15 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps
