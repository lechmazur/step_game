I can simply choose 3 and reach 22 steps to win immediately this round.\n\nYour coordination effort is admirable, but the math remains the same - I have multiple winning moves available, and you can't block them all simultaneously. This should be the final round regardless of what you choose."}

P1 is right that they can win by picking 3, but if we don't try to block at least one path, we're guaranteed to lose. P1, you've played well and will likely win this round, but we're making our final stand. P3, I'm committed to picking 5 with you - at least we'll go down fighting rather than giving up. Let's see how this ends."}

P1, we know you can win with 3, but we\u2019re taking our shot to block you if you go for 5. It\u2019s our last chance to delay your victory, even if the odds are slim. Let\u2019s make this final stand count, P2. If this doesn\u2019t work, well played, P1. I\u2019m locked in on 5 and hope we can pull off a surprise. Good luck to us all in this likely final round."}

You've both made it clear you're picking 5 to try to block that path. That's smart strategic thinking.\n\nHowever, as I've mentioned, I have other winning moves available this round. Your blocking strategy covers one path, but not all of them. I respect the effort you're both putting in for this final stand.\n\nThis should indeed be the final round, one way or another. Good luck with your coordination."}
