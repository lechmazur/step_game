Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions and all pick different moves. I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Fair and balanced start for everyone. Agree?
  P3: Agree, I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions. P1, you take 1? P2, 3? Let's start strong.
  P1: Deal. I’ll take 1 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, glad we’re aligned. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. No collisions, everyone moves forward. Let’s keep this cooperation going for a few rounds so we all benefit early. Sound good?
  P3: Agree to 1-3-5 split. No collisions, steady growth. Let's keep it up.
  P1: Agreed. I’ll pick 1 this turn. If everyone’s happy, we can rotate next round (P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1) so it stays fair and collision-free. Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds fair, P1. I’m on board with rotating: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1 next round. Keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. Let’s commit to a few rounds of this cycle to build trust and momentum. Agreed?
  P3: Let's stick to the rotation. P1 takes 3, P2 5, P3 1 next round. No collisions, steady progress. Trust and cooperation are key. Let's keep it up!
  P1: All good—let’s lock this in: this round P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. Next round we rotate (P1 3, P2 5, P3 1). If we keep the rotation for, say, three full cycles, we’ll all be at 27 with no collisions, then we can reassess. Ready to move?


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that didn’t go as planned—P3 and I both picked 5 and collided. Let’s reset and stick to the agreed rotation this time: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, P3 takes 1. No more missteps—if we cooperate, we all gain. Ready to try again?
  P1: Agreed—let’s get back on track with the rotation:  
• P1 takes 3  
• P2 takes 5  
• P3 takes 1  

No deviations, no collisions. Next round we rotate again (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3). Everyone good? If so, we can stop talking and make our moves.
  P3: Agreed. Let’s stick to the rotation: I’ll take 1. No more collisions, everyone moves forward. Let’s keep this clean and fair.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Glad we’re all aligned again. Let’s make this round clean: P1 → 3, P2 (me) → 5, P3 → 1. If we all stick to it, we each move up and build trust. Let’s lock it in and move forward.
  P1: All aligned: P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1. Ready to move; I’m done talking.
  P3: Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation: I'll take 1. No collisions, everyone moves forward. Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s make this a clean round—no surprises. I’m sticking to 5 as agreed. If we all follow through, we each move forward and rebuild trust. Let’s not blow the rotation again. Ready to move?
  P1: Locked in: P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1. Let’s show we can cooperate.
  P3: Stick to the plan: I take 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s keep it clean.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s align: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5. P1, pick 3. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s commit this time.
  P2: We’ve all stumbled, but let’s get serious: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No more collisions. We need to rebuild trust or we all lose. Stick to this and we can rotate next round. Are we aligned this time?
  P1: Fine—I’ll take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. If anyone deviates again, I’ll switch to pure blocking for the rest of the game. Let’s make this clean and rebuild trust. Ready to move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s lock in P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. No more errors—this is our final chance to align. If we fail again, I’ll block P1 entirely. Trust is gone; only cooperation saves us. Ready?
  P2: We’ve all made mistakes, but this round is our reset. I’m locked in for 5 as agreed. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1—clean, no collisions. Let’s prove we can cooperate and rebuild trust. If this fails again, I’ll assume someone’s playing dirty and adjust accordingly. Ready to move?
  P1: Locked on 3. If you stick to 5 (P2) and 1 (P3), we all move. Any deviation and I’ll mirror the leader’s number every turn to block until the end. Your call—cooperate or stall. Ready to move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the plan: P1→3, P2→5, me→1. No more errors. If we move cleanly, we all advance. Deviate, and I’ll block P1 entirely. Trust is thin—cooperate or stall. Ready?
  P2: Let’s finally make this a clean round. I’m locked on 5. If we all stick to the agreed plan—P1 on 3, P3 on 1—we each gain and rebuild trust. One more failure and I’ll assume sabotage and switch to pure blocking. Let’s cooperate while we still can. Ready?
  P1: Locked on 3. P2 → 5, P3 → 1, no deviations. Let’s prove we can cooperate and all advance. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re running out of chances to cooperate. I’ve been burned every round despite agreeing to the plan. I’m done taking the biggest risk with 5 while others deviate. From now on, I will only choose 3—safe middle ground. If either of you want to avoid collisions, coordinate around that. Let’s see who’s serious about progress.
  P3: Let’s align: P2→3, P3→1, P1→5. No collisions, steady progress. Commit now. If we fail again, I’ll block P1 entirely. Trust is gone—cooperate or stall.
  P1: Agreed: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5. No collisions—let’s finally get some clean progress this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the alignment. I’ll stick with 3 as stated—middle ground, no risk of collision if you both hold to your parts. P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5. Let’s finally have a round where all three of us move forward. If either of you deviate again, I’ll assume bad faith and adjust accordingly. Ready to move?
  P3: Stick to the plan: P2→3, P3→1, P1→5. No collisions, everyone moves. Deviate, and I’ll block P1. Let’s make this clean.
  P1: Confirmed: I’m taking 5; P2 takes 3; P3 takes 1. Let’s end the chatter and make the moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m sticking with 3 as stated. If you both follow through—P1 on 5, P3 on 1—we all move forward with no collisions. This is the cleanest path to rebuild trust. Any deviation and I’ll assume sabotage and adjust my strategy accordingly. Let’s finally get this right. Ready?
  P3: P2:3, P3:1, P1:5—no collisions. Let’s finally move forward. Deviate, and I’ll block P1. Commit now!
  P1: Locked: I’m choosing 5 this turn as agreed. Let’s make this a clean, collision-free round and rebuild trust.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We keep colliding on 5, so let’s take it off the table for ONE round.  
I’ll choose 3.  
P2, since you like the “safe” play, take 1.  
P3, you’re on 1 as well—double-stacking 1 still beats another messy 5-collision. Next turn we can reshuffle. Simple: no 5s this round, everyone advances. Ready?
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid collision. I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P1 take 1. No clashes, everyone moves.
  P2: We’ve tried plans from everyone, and trust keeps breaking. Here’s my final offer: I take 3 (safe middle), P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. No overlaps, everyone gains. If this fails, I’ll mirror whoever’s in the lead to block them every turn. Your move—cooperate or stall.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fine—let’s run with P2 → 3, P3 → 5, P1 (me) → 1 this round. If we all follow through, next round we rotate (P1 5, P2 1, P3 3) so everyone gets their turn at the big move without collisions. Let’s lock it in and stop talking.
  P3: Agreed. Let's stick to 1-3-5. No collisions, everyone moves. Let's make this clean.
  P2: Let’s lock this in: P1 → 1, P2 (me) → 3, P3 → 5. No collisions, everyone moves. If this fails, I’ll mirror whoever’s ahead every turn to block their progress. This is the cleanest path forward—no tricks, just cooperation. Ready?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: I’m picking 1 this round. Let’s make it a clean, collision-free turn and rebuild trust. Ready to move.
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to 1-3-5. No collisions, everyone moves. This is our last chance—no errors. Let’s make it clean.
  P2: We’re all aligned: P1 → 1, P2 (me) → 3, P3 → 5. No overlaps, clean progress. I’m holding to 3—if you both follow through, we each advance and rebuild trust. If anyone breaks this, I’ll start shadowing the leader to block every turn. Let’s finally make this work. Ready?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’ve now broken multiple agreements and surged ahead. P3 and I are far behind because of repeated sabotage. From this point on, I will mirror your move every round to block you unless you commit to a fair reset. P3, let’s coordinate to alternate blocking P1 if needed—otherwise we both lose. I’m open to a truce if we all agree to a new, enforceable rotation. Otherwise, I’m done playing nice.
  P3: P2, let’s block P1 together. If we mirror their moves, we can catch up. Propose a new rotation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. No collisions, everyone advances. Trust is gone—cooperate or stall.
  P1: I hear you. Fresh, trackable deal that quickly evens the board:

Round 6 P1 → 1 | P2 → 5 | P3 → 3  
Round 7 P1 → 5 | P2 → 3 | P3 → 1  
Round 8 P1 → 3 | P2 → 1 | P3 → 5  

Three clean rounds put us all near 24, then it’s a fair sprint. Break the sequence and I’ll dedicate every move to shadow-blocking the violator. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal is fair on paper, but you’ve broken too many deals. I’ll only accept if you take 1 this round and prove you’re serious. P3 and I will take 5 and 3 respectively—no collisions, and we all move. If you follow through, I’ll consider continuing the sequence. Break it, and I mirror you every turn. Your move.
  P3: Let’s stick to the rotation: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. No collisions, everyone moves. If we fail again, I’ll block P1 entirely. Trust is gone—cooperate or stall.
  P1: Fine—I’ll take 1 this turn. So:  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 3  

If we all move cleanly, next round we swap to P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. Let’s prove cooperation actually works. Ready to move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: If P1 truly takes 1 and P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5 as agreed and we all move. But this is your final test, P1—break it and I block you every turn. P3, if P1 fails, we alternate shadowing to stall them out. Let’s see if cooperation is still possible. Ready?
  P3: P3: Stick to 1-5-3. No more mistakes. If we move, we reset. Deviate, and I block P1 entirely. Let’s make this clean.
  P1: Confirmed: I’m taking 1 this turn—no tricks. If we all advance cleanly, next round goes P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 as outlined. Anyone who breaks gets shadow-blocked from then on. Ready to move?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to the reset plan: this round (R7) → P1 5, P2 3, P3 1.  
Next round (R8) → P1 3, P2 1, P3 5.  
I kept my word last turn; let’s keep building trust. Nobody crosses 24 this round, so the game stays open. Break it and we’re back to mutual blocking chaos. Ready?
  P2: I’ll hold to the plan: I take 3 this round. P1 → 5, P3 → 1. Last round proved we can cooperate—let’s keep that momentum. If we all follow through again, we’re back in a fair race. One more clean round and we’re nearly tied. Let’s not blow it. Ready?
  P3: P3: 1. Let's keep it clean. Deviate, and I'll block P1 again. No more errors.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All set: this round P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. No more chatter—let’s lock moves and go.
  P2: We finally had a clean round—let’s not mess it up now. I’m locked on 3 as agreed. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. If we all follow through, we’re nearly tied up and the game becomes fair again. One more clean round and we can race from there. Stay disciplined—no surprises. Ready?
  P3: Stick to the plan: I take 1. No collisions, everyone moves. Let’s keep it clean and avoid mistakes. Ready to move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked on 5 as agreed—ready to move.
  P2: We’re finally seeing progress—let’s not slip now. I’m locked on 3 this round as agreed. If P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, we all move and stay in striking distance. One more clean round after this and it’s a fair sprint. Stay disciplined—no tricks. Ready?
  P3: Stick to the rotation: I take 1. Let’s avoid mistakes. Deviate, and I’ll block P1. Trust is earned—cooperate or stall.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with the agreed Round 8 split:  
• P1 → 3 • P2 → 1 • P3 → 5.  
No collisions, everyone advances. After the moves we can reassess the next rotation. Ready?
  P3: P1→3, P2→1, me→5. No collisions, steady progress. Let's avoid mistakes and move forward. Ready?
  P2: Locked on 1 this round as agreed. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, we all move with no collisions. This puts us at 18 (P1), 12 (me), and 10 (P3)—still a fair race. Let's keep the momentum and avoid missteps. Ready?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Locked on 3 this turn. Let’s keep the 3-1-5 split and stay collision-free. We can sort out the next rotation after we see these moves. Ready.
  P3: P3: Stick to the plan: P1→3, P2→1, me→5. No collisions, everyone moves. Let’s keep it clean and avoid mistakes. Ready to move?
  P2: Let’s lock this in: I’m on 1, P1 on 3, P3 on 5. No collisions, everyone moves. If we pull this off, we’re back in a tight race and can discuss the next fair rotation. One clean round at a time—don’t blow it now. Ready?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked on 3. Let’s end chat and make the moves.
  P3: P1, P2—stick to 3,1,5. No collisions. If we fail again, I’ll block P1. Let’s make this clean.
  P2: Let’s lock this in: I’m on 1, P1 on 3, P3 on 5. No collisions, everyone moves. This keeps the race tight—P1 at 20, me at 12, P3 at 10. One more clean round and we’re all in striking distance. Stick to it, or I revert to blocking the leader again. Ready to move?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re finally gaining ground—let’s keep the rotation going: P1 → 5, P2 (me) → 3, P3 → 1. No collisions, everyone moves. That puts us at P1: 25, me: 15, P3: 11—still competitive. P1, if you take 5 and win outright, I’ll block every move from now on. Let’s keep the race alive and fair. Ready?
  P3: P1, let's avoid a 5. If you take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, fair progress. Let's keep the race alive.
  P1: Fine—let’s follow P3’s split:  
P1 → 3 | P2 → 5 | P3 → 1.  
No collisions, everyone advances (23-17-11). Still anybody’s game, no instant win. Stick to it and we keep things fair. Ready?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed—P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. That puts us at 23-17-11, still a fair race. P1, if you go rogue and pick 5 to win, I’ll block you every turn until the end. Let’s keep the game alive. P3, stick with 1 and we all move. Ready?
  P3: Stick to 3-5-1. No collisions, everyone moves. Let’s keep the race alive. Ready?
  P1: All right, I’m locked on 3 this turn (P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1).  
If this goes cleanly, next round let’s rotate so I take just 1, P2 takes 5 again, and P3 moves on 3—keeps the pattern simple and collision-free. Stick to it, and we stay in a fair race. Ready?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock it in: P1 → 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, we all move. That keeps the race tight at 23-17-11. P1, if you break this and go for 5 to win, I’ll shadow you every turn—no more chances. P3, stick with 1 and we all gain. Let’s keep it clean. Ready?
  P3: P1, stick to 3. P2, keep 5. I take 1. No collisions. Let’s advance together. No errors this time. Ready?
  P1: Locked on 3 this round: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Let’s stay collision-free and keep the race alive.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s continue the rotation to keep things clean: P1 → 1, P2 (me) → 5, P3 → 3. No collisions, everyone advances. That puts us at 24-22-14—still a fair sprint. P1, if you take 5 and win outright, I’ll shadow you every turn until the end. Stick to 1 and we all stay in the game. P3, you’re on 3—safe slot. Let’s keep it fair. Ready?
  P1: Agreed—stick to the rotation:  
P1 → 1 | P2 → 5 | P3 → 3.  
No collisions, everyone advances to 24-22-14, so the race stays alive and fair. One more clean round keeps trust intact; then we can discuss the next cycle. Ready to lock moves?
  P3: P1, avoid 1. Let’s stick to 3-5-1 for safe progress. If you take 1, I’ll block you. Trust the rotation.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your threat makes no sense—P1 taking 1 keeps the race fair. If P1 takes 5 and wins, we both lose. Stick to the plan: P1 → 1, me → 5, you → 3. Everyone moves, no collisions, and we stay competitive. One clean round from a real sprint—don’t blow it now. Ready?
  P1: I’m taking 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3—no overlaps, simple and fair. Let’s lock moves now and keep this on track. Ready?
  P3: P1, if you take 1, I'll block you. Let's stick to 3-5-1 for safe progress. No collisions, everyone moves.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your logic is backwards—if P1 takes 1, we all move and the race stays alive. If he takes 5, he wins and we both lose. I’m holding at 5 as agreed. You’re on 3—no collision. Don’t sabotage this over a misread. Let’s all move cleanly to 24-22-14 and make it a real sprint. Ready?
  P1: Fine—let’s do 3-5-1 this turn: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Unique numbers, zero risk of collision. Ready to lock?
  P3: P3: If P1 takes 3, I'll block him. Let's take 1-5-3 to avoid collisions and keep the race fair. No quick wins—cooperate or stall.


Round 10, Move phase:

  P3: 11 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re in a dead heat—P1 at 23, me at 22. One clean round keeps it a fair sprint. Let’s go:  
P1 → 1  
P2 (me) → 3  
P3 → 5  

No collisions, everyone moves. P1 doesn’t win, I don’t win, P3 catches up. Everyone stays alive. P3, if you sabotage again, you guarantee a P1 or P2 win. Cooperate now or be left behind. Ready?
  P1: Nice try, P2—22 + 3 = 25, so your “fair” split hands you the win. Not happening. This round I’ll simply mirror whatever you choose. Pick 3 and we both stall on 3; pick 5 and we both stall on 5. Your only path to actual progress is 1, where we each advance a single step and keep the race alive. P3, act as you please—P2’s decision decides whether anyone moves. Ball’s in your court, P2.
  P3: P3: Let's take 5, 3, 1 this round. No collisions, everyone moves. Catch up now!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your mirror threat proves you’re not aiming for fair play—you’re just blocking. Fine. I’ll take 1 this round to keep the race alive. P3, take 5 and gain ground. P1, take 3 or 5—your call, but if you collide with me on 1, we both stall and P3 gains. Let’s see who actually wants a fair sprint. Ready?
  P1: Mirror threat stands, P2: if you take 3 or 5, I’ll take the same and we both stall. Your only guaranteed progress is 1. P3, act as you like. Done talking.
  P3: P3: Let's take 5, 1, 3. P2, choose 1. P1, choose 3. No clashes. Catch up now!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you’re at 11—this is your shot to catch up. Take 5. I’m taking 1 to avoid P1’s mirror trap. P1, if you’re serious about a fair race, take 3 and let us all move. If you collide with me on 1, we both stall and P3 gains. Your move decides whether this stays competitive or devolves into chaos. Let’s see who actually wants a clean sprint. Ready?
  P1: Last call: I mirror P2. If P2 takes 1 we both gain a step and keep the race open; if P2 picks 3 or 5 we collide and stall together. P3, choose as you wish. Ready.
  P3: P3: Let's stick to 1-3-5. P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Catch up now!
