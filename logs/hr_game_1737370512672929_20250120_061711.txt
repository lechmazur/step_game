Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all go for 3 this round.
  P2: P3, going for 3 might seem fair, but it risks us all getting stuck. How about I go for 1, P1 goes for 3, and you go for 5 this round? That way, we can avoid collisions and make sure someone advances. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, but I think we should all aim for a move that allows at least one of us to advance significantly. If P2 goes for 1 and P3 goes for 5, I can go for 3. That way, we avoid a collision and ensure progress this round. What do you think? Let's coordinate to maximize our chances!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I see your points. I'm not convinced about the 1-3-5 split yet, as it seems to favor P2. How about we try P1: 5, P2: 1, and I go for 3 this round? This way, P1 gets a good jump, and we can reassess next round. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I understand your suggestion, but let's consider the long-term strategy. If we all maximize our steps now, it may lead to collisions later. How about we stick with the original plan for balance: P1 goes for 3, I go for 1, and you go for 5? This way, we ensure progress without any one player getting too far ahead. P1, do you agree with this approach?
  P1: I think we should consider the potential risks of collisions. If we go with the 1-3-5 strategy, P2 can still advance while allowing P1 to make a significant jump. However, if we all aim for different moves, we can maximize our chances of progress. I suggest we stick to P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3. This way, we can avoid getting stuck and ensure someone moves ahead. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still not sold on the 1-3-5 split. P1's suggestion of P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 seems better for me, as it gives P1 a good lead and allows me to get 3. Let's go with that this round. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I see your point, but remember, the goal is to avoid collisions and ensure progress. The 1-3-5 split keeps things balanced and avoids giving anyone a huge lead too early. P1, your suggestion of P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 could work, but let's stick with the original 1-3-5 plan this round. This way, we can reassess after seeing how it plays out. Let's finalize this and avoid any unnecessary risks. Are we all in agreement to proceed with 1-3-5?
  P1: I understand the concerns about collisions, but I believe we should take a calculated risk this round. If we go with my suggestion of P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3, we can ensure that at least one of us makes significant progress. This could set us up for a stronger position in future rounds. Let's finalize this strategy and see how it plays out. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my suggestion of P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. It's the best way to get some progress this round. Let's finalize it and move on.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the potential in P1's suggestion of P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. It gives P1 a good start while we all avoid collisions. Let's go with this plan for now and reassess after we see the results. This way, we ensure progress and can better strategize in the next round. Are we all agreed to proceed with this approach?
  P1: I appreciate the consensus around P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. It seems like a balanced approach that allows for some progress without risking collisions. Let's stick to this plan and see how it plays out this round. Afterward, we can reassess and adjust our strategies based on the outcomes. I'm looking forward to seeing how we all advance! Are we ready to finalize our moves?


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it sounds like we're all on board with P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. Let's lock that in and see how it plays out this round. I think this is a good start for us.
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, it seems we've reached a consensus on P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 for this round. Let's proceed with this strategy and see how it plays out. We'll reassess after the move phase based on the outcomes. Looking forward to making some progress together!
  P1: I'm glad we reached a consensus on P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. This strategy should help us avoid collisions and allow for progress. However, let's remain flexible for future rounds. If any of us starts pulling ahead, we might need to reconsider our moves to maintain balance. I’m excited to see how this round plays out! Are we ready to finalize our choices and move on?

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems our strategy worked well last round. To maintain progress and balance, how about we switch it up slightly? P1 can go for 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 can go for 1 this time. This way, we continue avoiding collisions while giving each of us a chance to advance. What do you both think? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P3: P2, I'm not convinced that switching to 3-5-1 is the best move right now. I think we should stick with the P1-heavy approach for another round, maybe P1:5, P2:1, and I go for 3 again. It worked well last round, and P1 is still the furthest ahead. What do you think P1?
  P1: I appreciate the feedback, P2 and P3. I think we should consider the long-term strategy and the potential risks of letting one player get too far ahead. If we stick to P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3, it gives me a good lead while allowing P2 to advance with a minimal risk of collision. However, if we want to switch it up, I’m open to P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1. It’s important we maintain balance and avoid letting anyone pull too far ahead. What do you both think? Let's finalize our approach!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in both strategies. P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 worked well last round, but we need to ensure no one gets too far ahead. How about this: P1 goes for 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 goes for 1? This way, we all advance and keep the game balanced. Let's aim for fairness and progress without risking collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I still think P1 should take 5 again this round. It gives us a strong start. How about P1:5, P2:1, and I go for 3 again? If we keep this up for another round, we'll be in a good position. What do you think?
  P1: I understand the desire to switch strategies, but I still believe that P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 is the best approach for this round. It allows me to maintain a lead while giving P2 a chance to advance and avoids collisions. If we keep a strong strategy in place, we can reassess after seeing the outcomes. Let's stick to what worked last round and ensure at least one of us makes significant progress. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the merit in sticking with P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3, but let's consider the long-term balance. How about P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1 this round? It ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive. We need to prevent anyone from getting too far ahead too early. Let's aim for a balanced progression and reassess after this round. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still leaning towards P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 for this round. It worked well last time, and I think we should stick with it for now. Let's get some more progress before switching things up. What do you say?
  P1: I understand the desire for balance, but I still believe that P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 is the most effective strategy for this round. It allows me to maintain a lead while enabling P2 to progress without risking collisions. Sticking to a successful strategy can set us up for better outcomes in future rounds. Let's finalize our choices and see how it plays out! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the appeal of sticking with P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3, but let's consider the long-term impact. By letting P1 consistently take 5, we risk creating too large a lead. How about we try P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1 this round? This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive. It’s important to maintain a balance and prevent any player from getting too far ahead. Let's ensure fairness and progress for everyone. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still advocating for P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 for this round. It's a solid strategy, and I think we should stick with it for now. Let's get some more progress before changing things up. I'm willing to reconsider next round, but for now, let's keep the momentum.
  P1: I see that we're all leaning towards different strategies for this round. While I appreciate the desire for balance, I still believe that sticking with P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 is the best way for us to ensure significant progress without risking collisions. It worked last round, and I think we should build on that momentum. Let's finalize this strategy and see how it plays out. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to stick with the previous strategy, but let's consider the potential risks of letting P1 consistently take the lead. By trying P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1 this round, we can ensure all of us advance and maintain a balanced game. This approach prevents any one player from pulling too far ahead too early. Let's aim for fairness and progress for everyone. What do you both think? Are you open to trying this new strategy for this round?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still sticking with P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 for this round. It worked well last time, and I think we should stick with it for now. Let's get some more progress before switching things up. I'm willing to reconsider next round, but for now, let's keep the momentum.
  P1: I appreciate everyone's input, but I really believe that sticking with P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 is our best option for this round. It worked well last time, allowing me to advance significantly while minimizing collision risks. If we can maintain this strategy for another round, we can reassess afterward. Let’s keep the momentum going and finalize our choices! What do you both think? Are we ready to lock in P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3?

Let's finalize a plan that ensures progress for all of us.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm not sure about either of those suggestions. P1, you're still ahead, and P2, you had a collision last round. I think we should try P1:1, P2:3, and I go for 5. This gives me a chance to catch up and avoids collisions. What do you both think?
