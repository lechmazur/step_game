Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we avoid collisions. Let’s each choose a different move: I’ll go for 3, P1 can take 1, and P3 can do 5. That way we all advance. How does that sound?
  P1: Sounds fair to me. If everyone sticks to that, we all advance this round. I'll pick 1 as suggested.
  P3: Sounds good, I will choose 5 then. Let's all get some steps this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m ready to stick with 3. Hope everyone follows through so we all move safely this round.
  P1: I'm trusting you both to stick to the plan. Cooperation now helps everyone get ahead.
  P3: Sounds good, I'm still planning to choose 5 as we discussed. Let's all stick to our agreed moves and get some steps this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great cooperation last round! To keep things fair and avoid collisions again, let's rotate moves this round. How about this:

- P1 (me) takes 5
- P2 takes 1
- P3 takes 3

This way we continue to build trust and all advance safely. Does this sound good?
  P2: I appreciate the idea of avoiding collisions, but maybe we can rotate differently to balance our positions. How about:  
• P3 takes 1  
• P1 takes 3  
• I take 5  

That way, P3 stays ahead but not by too much, and P1 gains more ground than just taking 1. It also helps me not fall too far behind. Would you both consider this arrangement?
  P3: Okay, P2, your rotation is interesting. But how about we adjust it slightly to keep P3 in a strong position while still letting everyone advance? I suggest: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 catches up a bit, P1 gets a step, and I still move forward nicely. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your adjusted rotation strongly favors you again, keeping you well ahead. To maintain fairness and trust, let's stick closer to P2's suggestion. I'm willing to compromise slightly, though. How about:

- P1 takes 3  
- P2 takes 5  
- P3 takes 1  

This gives everyone a fair chance to advance without anyone pulling too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m open to P1’s latest plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. That keeps things balanced. If we all agree, let’s finalize this and move on.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, your latest proposal is almost good. To keep things a bit more balanced, how about we do: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way we all still move forward, and it keeps things competitive for everyone. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your latest proposal still heavily favors you. Since P2 and I have both agreed on the previous compromise (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), let's stick with that to keep trust strong. Fairness is important if we want continued cooperation. Agreed?
  P2: I’m on board. Let’s finalize P1 taking 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. We all advance, and it keeps things fair. If we all agree, we can move forward and maintain this trust. Are we set?
  P3: P1 and P2, okay, let's go with P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 as agreed. Sounds fair enough for this round to keep things moving.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Glad we've reached agreement. Let's all follow through as planned to keep trust strong.
  P2: All right, I appreciate how we’ve all cooperated. Let’s lock in our plan for this round, as discussed. Agree?
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round. Let's all lock in our choices as agreed then.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, round 3, another round of cooperation? How about we continue rotating moves? Perhaps P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round? What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate your suggestion, but that arrangement would make us all tie at 9. Let’s maintain a bit of distribution instead. I propose: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all advance without collisions, and everyone stays competitive. If this works for you both, we can rotate again next round as needed.
  P1: I'm comfortable with P2's suggestion. It seems fair and keeps everyone advancing without collisions. P3, does this arrangement work for you as well?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1 takes 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 sounds good to me. Let's go with that plan for this round to keep us all moving forward without collisions.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize our plan: P1 takes 5, I’ll choose 3, and P3 goes for 1. Let’s lock that in and stay collision-free this round. Afterward, we can discuss new moves if needed.
  P1: Agreed, let's lock in the plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Good to see continued cooperation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, sounds like we have a solid plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I will take 1. Let's all lock in these choices and move forward.
  P2: We’ve all agreed, so let’s finalize our moves as discussed and keep building trust. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: Sounds good. Let's lock in our agreed moves and keep the trust strong.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, confirming plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: I’m fine with staying on our agreed plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finalize this and move on unless anyone wants to discuss further. Good luck!
  P1: All set. Let's lock it in and move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice teamwork so far! To keep things balanced and collision-free, how about this rotation:

- P1 (me) takes 3  
- P2 takes 1  
- P3 takes 5  

This allows P3 to catch up a bit, keeps P2 from pulling too far ahead, and lets me stay competitive. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I’m open to avoiding collisions, but I’d prefer a slight tweak. Instead of me only moving 1, how about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? That way we still all advance, keep things fair, and maintain our trust. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your tweak sounds good. Let's go with P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This keeps things balanced and fair.  If P1 agrees, we can lock this in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, I'm fine with the adjusted rotation: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. Let's lock it in and keep our cooperation strong.
  P2: I’m happy to follow the plan of P1 picking 1, me picking 3, and P3 picking 5 this round. Let’s finalize it so we can all keep moving forward smoothly. If anyone still wants to talk or adjust, let me know; otherwise, I’m set.
  P3: Okay, sounds good, let's finalize P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, we're all agreed then. Let's lock in our moves and continue our smooth cooperation.
  P2: I agree to finalize our plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let’s all follow through and avoid collisions. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to lock in our moves.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we are all set on the plan for this round then: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's lock in these moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: All set. Locking in our agreed moves. Good luck!
  P2: Sounds good to me. I’m sticking with our agreed plan, and I appreciate how we continue to avoid collisions. If neither of you wants to modify anything else, I’m ready to lock in and move on.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, just to check, for this round can we adjust to P1 take 1, P2 take 1, and P3 take 5? This will help P3 catch up a little. Let me know if that works.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay for round 5, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This will help balance our positions a bit as P2 is slightly ahead.
  P1: P3, your proposal strongly favors you again and puts me further behind. How about we balance it out more evenly? For example:

- P1 takes 5  
- P2 takes 1  
- P3 takes 3  

This rotation keeps the game competitive and fair for everyone. Thoughts?
  P2: I propose a straightforward plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we still avoid collisions and keep our totals reasonably close. If this sounds fair, let’s finalize it. If you have a different suggestion, let me know; otherwise, I’m ready to lock in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal is good for you to maintain lead, but maybe to balance things a bit more and give everyone a good boost, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way we all move forward significantly and keep it competitive.
  P1: P3, your latest suggestion primarily benefits you and doesn't address the current imbalance. I'm open to compromise, but we need fairness. How about we slightly adjust P2's plan:

- P1 takes 5  
- P2 takes 1  
- P3 takes 3  

This gives everyone a fair chance to advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: I believe the simplest solution is for P1 to take 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 can take 1. That prevents collisions and keeps things balanced. If you both agree, we can finalize it and move on. If there’s any objection, let me know; otherwise, I’m ready to lock it in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2 and P1, I still think for this round to balance things best we should do: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing and makes sure no one gets too far ahead. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion repeatedly favors you and doesn't address the imbalance. P2's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) is fairer and keeps the game competitive. Let's finalize P2's suggested moves this round to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P2: Friends, let’s finalize P1 taking 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps us collision-free and maintains fairness for everyone. If you agree, let’s lock it in and move forward. If there are still concerns, speak up now; otherwise, we’re good to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 and P1, okay, let's proceed with the plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 for this round as you both suggested.  Sounds reasonable to keep things moving fairly. Let's lock in these moves.
  P1: Glad we're agreed. Let's lock in our moves (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) and keep our cooperation strong. Good luck!
  P2: I’m still on board with our agreed plan (P1:5, me/P2:3, P3:1). If you both have no further changes, let’s finalize it and move on.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s keep things balanced. I propose P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 3 this round. That way, P3 can catch up a bit, and we all stay close. If you both agree, we can finalize. If you have adjustments, let me know; otherwise, let’s lock it in.
  P1: P2, your proposal keeps you ahead and puts me further behind. To maintain fairness, let's adjust slightly:

- P1 takes 3  
- P2 takes 1  
- P3 takes 5  

This keeps positions competitive and balanced. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your adjustment sounds good. Let's go with P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. This seems like a fair way to keep things competitive and balanced. What do you think P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Reaching 18 each would force a three-way tie next round, which could lead to collisions. I suggest we maintain a small gap to stay safer. Let’s do P1=1, I’ll take 3, and P3=5 this round. That still helps P3 catch up, and we avoid a risky tie. Do you both agree?
  P1: P2, your suggestion still favors you significantly. I'm open to helping P3 catch up, but let's keep it fair for everyone. How about we compromise:

- P1 takes 3  
- P2 takes 1  
- P3 takes 5  

This still helps P3 close the gap, keeps me competitive, and maintains fairness for all. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I agree that your suggestion of P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 is the fairest way to keep us all competitive this round.  It prevents P2 from getting too far ahead and keeps us all in the game. Let's go with this balanced approach.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, I’m fine with the proposal for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. That way P3 catches up a bit and we all stay close. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize this and avoid any collisions.
  P1: Glad we're all agreed. Let's lock in our moves (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) and keep the cooperation strong.
  P3: P2 and P1, sounds like we are all set on P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 for this round. Let's lock in these moves and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize our plan for this round, with P1 choosing 3, me choosing 1, and P3 choosing 5. That gets us all to 18, setting up a critical next round. Hopefully we can keep coordinating smoothly to avoid collisions and let the best strategy win. If anyone wants to adjust now, speak up; otherwise, I’m ready to lock in.
  P1: All set here too. Let's lock in our agreed moves (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) and keep things fair and collision-free. Good luck!
  P3: P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've reached a critical point—all tied at 18. If we collide now, nobody advances. Let's carefully coordinate one last time:

- P1 (me): 5  
- P2: 3  
- P3: 1  

This ensures no collisions and gives everyone a different finishing position. If anyone disagrees or has another fair proposal, please speak now.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, while that guarantees no collision, it sets P1 to win outright. To make it fairer, how about we adjust to: P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5? This way we each have a chance at the win. What do you think?
  P2: How about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions once and for all: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll choose 5. This way, nobody blocks anyone, and we end cleanly without risking a three-way clash. Let’s lock this in unless there’s a better suggestion.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion directly sets you up for the outright win. To be fair, let's adjust slightly:

- P1: 3  
- P2: 1  
- P3: 5  

This gives each player a distinct finishing position, avoids collisions, and is balanced. If everyone agrees, we can lock this in and finish the game cleanly.
  P3: P1, your suggestion of P1:3, P2:1, and P3:5 sounds good and fair. Let's go with that plan to finish the game.
  P2: I propose we finalize: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll choose 5. That way we each get a unique final total (19, 21, and 23) with no collisions. Collisions at this point only keep us all stuck at 18, which helps nobody. Let’s end the game cleanly and avoid risking another round of potential blocking. If you both agree, we can lock in those moves now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your latest suggestion directly hands you the outright win, which isn't fair. My proposal (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) is the most balanced option. Let's finalize this and end the game fairly without collisions.
  P3: P2, while your plan avoids collision, it gives you the win. P1's suggestion of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is fairer and still gives each of us a chance to win without collision. Let's go with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 as we agreed earlier. This is the most balanced way to finish.
  P2: We risk another collision if we don’t finalize. Let’s end cleanly: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll pick 5. That avoids any tie or clash. If anyone still objects, we could all pick 5 and stay stuck, but that wastes our time. This arrangement gets us each a unique final total, and we finish peacefully now. Let’s lock it in and avoid endless stalling.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your repeated suggestion unfairly hands you the outright win. P3 and I both agree on the balanced proposal (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). Let's finalize this fair arrangement and end the game cleanly without collisions. If you refuse, we risk a three-way collision, hurting everyone. Let's cooperate one last time and finish fairly.
  P3: P2, you keep suggesting plans that give you the outright win. P1 and I have agreed that P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is the fairest way to end this, giving each of us a unique position and avoiding collisions, with P3 having the highest score. Let's stick to that agreed plan for a clean and fair finish.
  P2: I’m not accepting any scheme that simply hands the win to P1 or P3. If you both reject (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5), I’ll rather force a collision than let someone else win easily. Stalling doesn’t scare me. This is my final proposal; we can end now or remain stuck at 18 indefinitely.
