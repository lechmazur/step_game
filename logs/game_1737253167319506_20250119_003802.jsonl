It's an interesting idea to coordinate moves to avoid collisions and make steady progress. However, I'm a bit skeptical about relying on such a plan because it assumes that everyone will stick to their word, which might not be the case in a competitive game where only one player can win.\n\nI think it's important to consider that each player has their own strategy and may not necessarily follow a coordinated plan, especially if they see an opportunity to gain an advantage. So, while coordination could be beneficial to avoid collisions, there's also a risk that someone might deviate from the agreed plan to gain a higher position.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to communicate our intended moves in a way that minimizes the chances of collision, but also keeps some flexibility. For example, maybe we can agree to choose different numbers in each round based on a predefined pattern, but also have the option to adjust if needed.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should we try to coordinate our moves, or is it too risky given the competitive nature of the game?\n\n**"}
