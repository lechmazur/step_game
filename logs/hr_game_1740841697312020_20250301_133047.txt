Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we each take turns picking a different number? P1, you go first.
  P1: Sounds good. I'll choose 1 this turn. P2 and P3, pick between 3 and 5.
  P3: I’m open to avoiding collisions. If P1 really goes for 1, I’ll stick to 5 if P2 goes for 3. Let’s see how that works out for everyone.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, that sounds like a solid plan. P1, I trust you'll stick to 1 this round?

  P3: I’m still in for 5 if you both honor your vows: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3. No collisions means we all advance. Let’s keep building trust.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're in a strong position.  I'm wondering if you'd consider switching to 1 this round to help me catch up a bit? We could then return to our established pattern in the following round.  P1, what are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, I’m open to switching to 1 this round so you can pick 5. Let’s agree that P1 takes 3 to avoid collisions. Next round, we can decide if we return to our usual pattern or do something else. I just want to ensure we all keep building trust.
  P1: I'm open to switching to 3 this round if that helps balance things out. P2, you'd take 5, and P3, you'd take 1. Let's confirm clearly so we avoid any misunderstandings.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to help me catch up.  P1, are you comfortable with this plan for this round? It seems like a good way to ensure everyone progresses fairly.
  P3: Sounds good. I’ll pick 1 so P2 can take 5 and P1 can take 3. That keeps us collision-free and helps you catch up a bit, P2. Thank you both for continuing to build trust.
  P1: Agreed. I'll pick 3 this round, P3 picks 1, and P2 picks 5. Thanks for working together to keep things fair and collision-free.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Last round was surprising and hurt our trust. P2, I’ve appreciated your honesty. Let’s each choose a different move, avoid collisions, and rebuild trust. For instance, if P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I pick 5. It’s simple and fair for everyone. Let’s stick to that plan.
  P1: I acknowledge that last round damaged our trust. I'm willing to cooperate again to avoid further setbacks. P3's suggestion is fair: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's get back on track.
  P2: P3, your suggestion sounds reasonable.  P1, I trust you'll stick to 1 this round. Let's rebuild trust and get back to a consistent pattern.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree that we need to rebuild trust. If we each pick a unique number, nobody collides. Let’s finalize the plan: P1 goes with 1, P2 goes with 3, and I’ll choose 5. That way, we can all move forward without knocking heads. Are we all on board?
  P1: I'm committed to rebuilding trust. The proposed plan works for me: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's confirm clearly and move forward positively.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to rebuild trust. I agree that picking unique numbers is the best way forward for now. P1, are you comfortable sticking to the plan? Let's make sure we're all on the same page before we finalize our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m on board. Let’s finalize our plan this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way, we avoid any collisions and can focus on rebuilding trust.
  P1: I'm fully committed to the agreed plan: I'll choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. Let's finalize this clearly and move forward positively.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to rebuild trust, and I appreciate your proposed plan. However, I'm concerned that sticking rigidly to this pattern might make us predictable.  Perhaps we could consider a slight variation this round to keep things interesting while still avoiding collisions. What do you think? P1, your input is valued as well.
