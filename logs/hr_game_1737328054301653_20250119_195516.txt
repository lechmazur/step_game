Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate and block P3 this round. P1, are you in?
  P1: P2, I'm open to coordinating, but I'm not sure blocking P3 is the best strategy right now.  We should focus on advancing ourselves first. What do you think, P3, are you aiming for 1, 3, or 5 this round?
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand your point. Perhaps a better initial approach is for us to coordinate on a move to advance ourselves this round. How about we both aim for 3? P3, what are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, I agree that coordinating on a move to advance is a good idea.  I'm leaning towards 5 this round. It's a bit riskier, but could give us a good early lead. What do you think, P2? P3, any thoughts?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm still thinking 5 is the way to go this round. It's a risk, but if we both go for it, we could really pull ahead. What do you think? P3, any thoughts on this strategy?
  P2: P1, I'm hesitant about both of us going for 5. We collided last round. Perhaps one of us should consider 3 to guarantee some progress? What do you think, P1? P3, are you planning to move this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about colliding again.  Maybe we can try a staggered approach. I'll go for 5 this round, and you go for 3. That way, we both advance and minimize the risk of a collision.  P3, any thoughts on this plan?
  P2: P1, does the staggered approach sound good to you? P3, are you planning on moving this round, and if so, what are you considering?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm committed to the staggered approach. I'll go for 5 this round.  P3, if you're going to move, 1 might be your best bet to avoid a collision.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 3 this round as discussed. P3, to avoid collision with P1's likely 5, would you consider going for 1? That way, we all potentially make progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate.  P3, are you going to stay silent again?  If you want to make progress, you need to participate in the discussion.  Let's all work together to advance this round.
  P2: P1, since we've agreed on the staggered approach, are you set on 5? P3, just a reminder that going for 1 would likely avoid collision this round and allow you to advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with my plan for 5. P3, I'm getting the feeling you're not interested in playing. If you don't move, you're going to fall behind quickly.  Let's see some action from you this round.
  P2: "P1, confirming I'm choosing 3. P3, choosing 1 would allow you to advance and avoid a collision with P1's likely move of 5."

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, nice work advancing last round. P3, you need to start participating if you want to have a chance. I'm thinking 5 again this round. It's risky, but it's the fastest way to get ahead.  What are your thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, given that P3 also picked 5 last round, are you sure about going for 5 again? I'm inclined to go for 3 again to ensure I advance. P3, are you planning to move this round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your cautious approach, but I think we need to be bolder if we want to win.  P3, are you going to sit this round out again? If you want to be in the game, you need to start making moves. I'm going for 5 again. What's your play, P2?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "P1, given you collided with P3 last round going for 5, are you sure you want to risk that again? I'm going to stick with 3 this round to make sure I advance. P3, are you planning on making a move this round?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I hear you about the risk, but I'm committed to 5 this round.  It's a bold move, but it's the only way to take a significant lead. P3, are you just going to let us leave you in the dust?  Make a decision and get in the game!
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, since you're set on 5 despite the previous collision, I'll stick with 3 again to ensure I make progress. P3, are you planning on making a move this round, and if so, what are you considering?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your silence is deafening.  Are you going to let us win by default? If you want any chance at all, you need to make a move this round. I'm sticking with 5, but I suggest you choose something different if you want to avoid another collision. P2, good luck this round.
  P3: <stop>

  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
