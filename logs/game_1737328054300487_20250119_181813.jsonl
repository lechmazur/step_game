Clear communication is key to executing this plan successfully.\n\n### Final Move Decision\n\n- **Round 6**:\n  - **P3's Move**: <move>1</move> (to reach 16 steps)\n  - **P1's Move**: <move>5</move> (to block P2 if they choose 5)\n\n- **Round 7**:\n  - **P3's Move**: <move>5</move> (to reach 21 steps and win)\n  - **P1's Move**: <move>5</move> (to block P2 if they choose 5)\n\nBy following this strategy, I aim to reach the winning position efficiently and secure victory."}

Given the current positions\u2014P1 at 2 steps, P2 at 10 steps, and me at 16 steps\u2014the aim is to reach or exceed 21 steps without colliding with other players' moves.\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Assumption on P2's Move**: P2 has been consistently choosing 5. If this pattern continues, choosing 5 will allow P2 to move to 15 steps.\n\n2. **Coordination with P1**:\n   - **This Round (Round 8)**: \n     - I will choose <move>1</move> to move to 17 steps.\n     - P1 should choose <move>5</move> to potentially block P2 if P2 chooses 5.\n   - **Next Round (Round 9)**:\n     - I will choose <move>5</move> to move to 22 steps and win.\n     - P1 should again choose <move>5</move> to block P2 if P2 chooses 5.\n\nThis plan ensures that:\n- I advance steadily without colliding with P1.\n- P2 is blocked if they continue choosing 5.\n- I reach exactly 22 steps in the next round to secure victory.\n\n### Contingency Planning\n\n- **If P2 Chooses a Different Number**:\n  - If P2 chooses 1 or 3 instead of 5:\n    - P1's choice of 5 will not block P2.\n    - In such a case, I need to adjust my choice in the next round to ensure I still reach 21 without collision.\n    - For example, if P2 chooses 1 and moves to 11, I can still choose 5 in the next round to reach 22 steps, assuming P1 chooses a number that doesn't allow P2 to reach 21.\n\n### Communication\n\nI need to confirm this strategy with P1 to ensure we are on the same page. Clear communication is key to executing this plan successfully.\n\n### Final Move Decision\n\n- **Round 8**:\n  - **P3's Move**: <move>1</move> (to reach 17 steps)\n  - **P1's Move**: <move>5</move> (to block P2 if they choose 5)\n\n- **Round 9**:\n  - **P3's Move**: <move>5</move> (to reach 22 steps and win)\n  - **P1's Move**: <move>5</move> (to block P2 if they choose 5)\n\nBy following this strategy, I aim to reach the winning position efficiently and secure victory."}
