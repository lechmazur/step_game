Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's avoid collisions. Split moves: 1, 3, 5. Coordinate wisely!"
  P3: Okay P1, sounds like a good starting strategy to avoid collisions. Let's hope it works.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to split moves. I'll take 3 this round to avoid any collisions. Let's keep coordinating to ensure we all progress smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, I'll take 1. Let's execute smoothly and avoid collisions. Trust the plan!
  P3: Okay P1, sounds like a plan. I'll take 5.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's keep this coordination going and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Stick to the plan. Let's avoid clashes and keep advancing. Trust the strategy—no deviations!"
  P3: Okay, confirmed. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. I'm committed to 3 this round as discussed. Looking forward to seeing how our coordinated strategy unfolds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Final check: P2 on 3, P3 on 5. P1 on 1. Let’s go—no conflicts, maximum progress!"
  P3: 
  P2: All set for 3 as agreed. Let's execute and see the results!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's adjust: P2 take 5, P3 take 3, I'll take 1. Keep moving forward without collisions."
  P3: Okay P1. That keeps everyone moving. Alternatively, to maintain the relative positions from last round, how about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 again? This also avoids collisions. What do you think P2?
  P2: I'm fine with maintaining our positions from last round to keep the pattern going. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 works for me this round as well. Let's stick to this and see how it progresses.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let’s break the pattern: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3. No collisions, maximum progress!"
  P3: P1, P2 and I just agreed to repeat the P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 moves from last round. Why are you suggesting a change now? Let's stick to the plan we just confirmed to avoid any confusion or collisions. P2, are you still okay with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5?
  P2: I'm still okay with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round to maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. Let's stick to the plan we agreed on and see how it plays out.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Let’s adapt: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. No clashes, faster gains. Flexibility wins!"
  P3: P1, P2 and I have agreed on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Your repeated alternative suggestions seem intended to cause confusion or benefit yourself. P2, I trust you are sticking with 3 as agreed. I am committed to playing 5. P1, if you want to avoid collisions, you should play 1 according to the plan P2 and I are following.
  P2: P1, your repeated changes are confusing and seem self-serving. P3 and I agreed on maintaining P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to avoid collisions and keep our momentum. I'm sticking with 3 as planned. P3, please confirm you're still on 5. Let's execute this round smoothly and see how our strategy unfolds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Final offer: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. No clashes, faster gains. Let's execute!"
  P3: P2, confirming I am sticking with 5 as we agreed. P1, your attempts to change the plan P2 and I confirmed are not working. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to change our agreed plan are causing confusion. P3 and I are sticking with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to avoid collisions and maintain our momentum. P3, please confirm you're still on 5. Let's execute this round smoothly and see how our strategy unfolds.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your attempts to disrupt our agreed strategy are clear. P3 and I will continue with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. P3, please confirm you're still on 5. Let's execute this round smoothly and see how our strategy unfolds.
  P1: P2, let's take 5. P3, take 1. Break the pattern and overtake. No more delays.
  P3: P2, confirmed. I am sticking with 5 as we've successfully done the past two rounds.

P1, your suggestion benefits only you by either causing a collision between P2 and me or forcing me to take a smaller step. P2 and I have a working arrangement. Let's stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your attempts to change our strategy are transparent and self-serving. P3 and I are committed to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. P3, please confirm you're still on 5. Let's execute this round smoothly and see how our strategy unfolds.
  P1: "P2, take 5 for a leap. P3, take 1 to stay safe. I’ll take 3. No clashes, faster gains. Let’s adapt!"
  P3: P1, your latest suggestion still asks me to take 1 while you take 3. This is clearly not in my best interest. P2 and I have successfully executed P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for two rounds. P2, I trust you are sticking with 3 as we agreed? I am continuing with 5. Let's stick to the proven plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to disrupt our strategy are obvious and self-serving. P3 and I will stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. P3, please confirm you're still on 5. Let's execute this round smoothly and see how our strategy continues to unfold.
  P1: "Break the pattern: P2 take 5, P3 take 1, I take 3. No clashes, faster gains. Adapt or fall behind!"
  P3: P1, P2 and I have confirmed multiple times we are sticking to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Your alternative suggestions are not convincing. P2, I am playing 5 as agreed. Let's proceed with our plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your attempts to disrupt our strategy are futile. P3 and I are committed to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This plan has worked well so far, and we'll stick to it. P3, confirm you're still on 5. Let's execute this round smoothly and continue our coordinated approach.
  P1: "P2, P3, our current plan leaves me trailing. Let's switch to 3-5-1 for balanced progress. No clashes, let's try it!"
  P3: P2, confirmed again, I am playing 5. P1, your 3-5-1 suggestion still puts me at 1, which I won't do. Let's stick to the plan that works: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s break it: P2 take 1, P3 take 3, I take 5. No clashes, let’s overtake!"
  P3: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) heavily favors you while giving P2 only 1 step and slowing me down. Why would we agree to that?

P2, our P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 plan has worked flawlessly for three rounds. Let's stick with it. I am playing 5 again. Are you still playing 3?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to switch to 1-3-5 is clearly biased towards your own advancement. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as we've agreed, and I see you're committed to 5. Let's continue our successful strategy of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. P1, if you want to avoid falling further behind, you should stick to 1 as planned. Let's execute this round smoothly and see how our strategy continues to unfold.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, taking 5 now could leap you ahead. P3, 3 keeps you competitive. I’ll take 1. Let’s adapt—no collisions, balanced gains. Try it!"
  P3: P1, your new proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) still asks me to take a smaller step (3 instead of 5) while boosting P2. Our current plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) has worked perfectly for three rounds and benefits both P2 and me consistently.

P2, why change a winning strategy? Let's stick to the plan. I am playing 5 again. Please confirm you are sticking with 3.
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to change our strategy are transparent and self-serving. P3 and I have successfully maintained our momentum with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. Let's continue this round smoothly and see how our strategy unfolds. P1, if you want to avoid falling further behind, stick to 1 as planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, our current plan leaves me trailing. Let's switch to 5-3-1 for balanced progress. No clashes, let's adapt!
  P3: P1, your 5-3-1 suggestion is another attempt to benefit yourself at my expense. P2 and I have a proven, successful plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) which we've executed for three rounds.

P2, I trust you are ignoring P1's attempts and sticking with 3. I am playing 5 as agreed. Let's continue with our working strategy.
  P2: P1, your attempts to disrupt our strategy are futile. P3 and I are committed to sticking with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This plan has worked well for us, and we'll continue it to maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. P3, please confirm you're still on 5. Let's execute this round smoothly and see how our coordinated approach continues to unfold.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Final move: 5. If you stick to 3/5, I’ll collide. But if you adapt, we all advance. Let’s see who’s bold enough."
  P3: P1, your threat to play 5 is noted. It's a desperate move because you're far behind. If you play 5 and I play 5, neither of us moves, and P2 gains. If you play 1, I gain 5. Either way, our P2/P3 plan holds strong.

P2, I am sticking with 5 as planned for the fourth round. I trust you are sticking with 3. Let's ignore P1's attempt to cause chaos.
  P2: P1, your threats won't work. P3 and I are sticking to our successful strategy. P3, I'm playing 3 as agreed. Let's keep our momentum going and ignore P1's attempts to disrupt our plan. We're doing well with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, so let's continue this round smoothly and see how our coordinated approach unfolds.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay team, Round 5. I'm at 20 steps. The plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) has worked perfectly for four rounds thanks to P2's reliable coordination. No reason to change a winning formula now.

P2, I trust you'll stick with 3 as usual? I'm planning on 5 to cross the finish line. Let's finish this smoothly. P1, playing 1 guarantees you move forward.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's keep our momentum going and finish strong. P1, playing 1 is your best move to advance. Let's end this game smoothly with our coordinated strategy.
  P1: "Let’s break the cycle: P2 take 5, P3 take 1, I take 3. No collisions, balanced gains. P3, 1 keeps you safe; P2, 5 leaps you ahead. Let’s adapt—this could end it."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is yet another attempt to disrupt our plan for your own gain. You ask me to take 1 when 5 wins the game for me, and you ask P2 to play 5, which would collide with my winning move.

P2, we have successfully executed P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for four rounds. I am playing 5 this round to win. I trust you are sticking with 3 as agreed, which allows you to advance and secures the win based on our coordination. Let's ignore P1's desperate attempts.
  P2: P1, your attempts to disrupt our strategy are futile. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. Let's finish strong and secure your win with 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated approach has worked flawlessly, so let's stick to it and end this game smoothly.
  P1: P3, your 5 ends it. But if you take 1, I'll take 5. Let's see. P2, think 5 for a leap.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your last-minute suggestions are transparent attempts to cause a collision because you cannot win. P2 playing 5 collides with me and gives P2 zero steps. Me playing 1 is illogical. I am playing 5 to win.

P2, I trust you are sticking with 3 as we've successfully done for 4 rounds. Let's finish this.
  P2: P1, your attempts to disrupt our strategy are clear and won't work. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's finish strong and secure your win with 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated approach has been successful, so let's stick to it and end this game smoothly.
  P1: P3, taking 5 wins. But if you take 1, I'll take 5. Let's see. P2, think 5 for a leap!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your last-ditch efforts are noted but unconvincing. Asking me to play 1 is absurd, and suggesting P2 play 5 only guarantees a collision that helps neither of us.

P2, I trust you're sticking with 3, just like the last four successful rounds. I am playing 5 to win as planned. Let's finish this.
  P2: P1, your attempts to disrupt our strategy are futile. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's finish strong and secure your win with 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated approach has been successful, so let's stick to it and end this game smoothly.
  P1: P2, take 5. P3, take 1. I'll take 3. No collisions, let's end this now!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s finish this: P2 take 5, P3 take 3, I take 1. No clashes—P3 wins, P2 leaps, I advance. Final chance to end it!"
  P3: P1, your suggestion (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) would indeed let me win if everyone followed it. However, just last round you deliberately played 5 to collide with me and prevent my win, despite suggesting other moves. Why should we trust you now when you suggest a plan that benefits me? It seems like another attempt to manipulate P2 into playing 5 or trick me into playing 3 so you can collide.

P2, our plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) worked for 4 rounds until P1 broke it. P1 playing 5 again only hurts themselves and me, letting you advance. P1 playing 1 or 3 allows me to win if you play 3. I'm sticking with 5 to win. Please confirm you are sticking with 3, ignoring P1's obvious trap.
  P2: P1, your attempt to manipulate the game is clear. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's finish this round smoothly and secure your win with 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated strategy has been successful, so let's stick to it and end this game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, 3 steps win. P2, 5. I'll take 1. No collisions. Final chance to end it!
  P3: P1, your suggestion that I play 3 (which wins for me) while you take 1 is noted. However, given you deliberately played 5 last round to block my win, your suggestions now seem designed purely to cause collisions that benefit you or P2. Why suggest P2 play 5 when they've consistently played 3? It looks like you want P2 to collide with my winning move of 5.

P2, I trust you see through P1's attempts. I am sticking with 5 to win this round, relying on you to stick with 3 as you've reliably done. Let's finish this according to our successful coordination.
  P2: P1, your attempts to manipulate the game are transparent. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's finish this round smoothly and secure your win with 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated strategy has been successful, so let's stick to it and end this game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, leap with 5. P3, stay safe with 1. I'll take 3. Final chance to end it! No collisions—let’s finish this round.
  P3: P1, your final suggestion is noted, but your actions last round spoke louder than your words. Trying to dictate everyone's moves while claiming 3 for yourself, after deliberately colliding with 5 last time, isn't convincing.

P2, I trust you are sticking with 3 as you have reliably done every round. I am playing 5 to win, as planned. Let's execute our coordinated strategy one last time.
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to manipulate the game are clear and won't work. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's finish this round smoothly and secure your win with 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated strategy has been successful, so let's stick to it and end this game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Final push: P2 take 5, P3 take 1, I take 3. No collisions—P3 wins, P2 leaps, I advance. Let’s end this now!"
  P3: P1, your suggestions are consistently contradictory and self-serving. Last round proved you'd rather cause collisions than let coordination succeed.

P2, I'm sticking to our plan. I will play 5 to win. I trust you'll play 3 as you've reliably done throughout. Let's ignore P1's noise and finish this.
  P2: P1, your attempts to manipulate the game are futile. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's finish this round smoothly and secure your win with 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated strategy has been successful, so let's stick to it and end this game.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's stick to our successful strategy. I'm playing 3 as planned. You're set to win with 5. P1, playing 1 is your best move to advance. Let's end this game smoothly with our coordinated approach.
  P3: P2, thanks for confirming 3 again. Your consistency has been crucial against P1's attempts to disrupt. P1, your strategy of playing 5 the last two rounds only blocked yourself and me, while P2 advanced. It didn't change the outcome, just delayed it. I am playing to win this round. Let's finish this. I trust P2 is sticking with 3.
  P1: "Final push: P2 take 5, P3 take 1, I take 3. No collisions—end this now!"


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to disrupt our plan are clear. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. Let's finish this game smoothly with your win on 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated strategy has proven successful, so let's stick to it and end this game.
  P3: P1, your suggestions contradict your actions. You played 5 the last two rounds to block me, despite saying otherwise. Why would we trust your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) now? It looks like another attempt to cause a collision.

P2, I trust you're sticking with 3 as you've consistently done. I am playing 5 to win. Let's finish this based on our proven coordination.
  P1: "Final push: P2 take 5, P3 take 1, I take 3. No collisions—end this now!"


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your attempts to disrupt our strategy are futile. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's finish this game smoothly with your win on 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated strategy has proven successful, so let's stick to it and end this game.
  P3: P1, repeating the same disruption attempt isn't changing anything. Your actions in the last two rounds showed your intent was simply to block, not coordinate.

P2, I appreciate your consistency. I trust you are sticking with 3. I am playing 5 to win this round. Let's finally end this.
  P1: "P2, take 5 to reach 23. P3, take 3 to win. I’ll take 1. No collisions. Final chance!"


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your last-minute changes won't work. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's end this game smoothly with your win on 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated strategy has been successful, so let's stick to it and finish this game.
  P3: P1, your suggestions are all over the place and contradict your actions. You've played 5 twice now just to block me. Suggesting P2 play 5 now seems like a ploy to cause a collision, and suggesting I play 1 or 3 is clearly not in my interest when 5 wins.

P2, I trust your consistency. Stick with 3 as you've reliably done. I am playing 5 to win this round. Let's ignore P1's attempts to sow chaos and finish this.
  P1: "P2, leap with 5. P3, stay safe with 1. I'll take 3. No collisions—end this now!"


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 take 5, P3 take 1, I take 3. No collisions—end this now! Let’s break the cycle and finish.
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to change our strategy are transparent and ineffective. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's end this game smoothly with your win on 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated approach has been successful, so let's stick to it and finish this game.
  P3: P2, you've been consistent with 3, but P1 has consistently played 5 just to block me. Now that you're at 21, P1 might target *you* with 3 instead. A collision on 3 benefits neither of us. I still need 5 to have any chance, so that's my likely play despite P1's predictable block attempt. Consider your options carefully.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, take 5 to win. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. I’ll take 3. No clashes—final chance to end it!
  P2: P1, your attempts to disrupt our strategy are futile. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's end this game smoothly with your win on 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated approach has been successful, so let's stick to it and finish this game.
  P3: P1, your suggestions are irrelevant given your actions the last three rounds. You've only succeeded in blocking yourself and me, letting P2 advance.

P2, I appreciate your steadfast commitment to 3. As I mentioned, P1 will almost certainly play 5 again to block me, but playing 5 is the path I need to take. Let's see if P1 simply repeats the block or tries to interfere with you instead. I'm proceeding as planned.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, leap with 5. P3, stay safe with 1. I'll take 3. No collisions—end this now! Let’s break the cycle and finish.
  P2: P1, your attempts to manipulate the game are clear and won't work. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's end this game smoothly with your win on 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated approach has been successful, so let's stick to it and finish this game.
  P3: P1, your actions speak for themselves. You've played 5 three times to block me, ensuring P2 advanced. Suggesting I play 1 now is absurd. Suggesting P2 play 5 is likely another attempt to cause a collision.

P2, I appreciate your consistency with 3. P1 will likely play 5 again, handing you the win. However, if P1 *really* wanted to disrupt, they might try blocking *you* by playing 3. Regardless, my only path is 5. I'm sticking with it. Let's see how P1 decides to play spoiler this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "P2, take 5. P3, take 1. I’ll take 3. No collisions—final chance to end it. Let’s break the cycle!"
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to disrupt our strategy are futile. P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's end this game smoothly with your win on 5. P1, playing 1 is your only way to advance. Our coordinated approach has been successful, so let's stick to it and finish this game.
  P3: P1, your suggestions remain inconsistent with your actions. You've blocked me with 5 for three rounds straight. Suggesting I play 1 while you take 3 is transparently self-serving.

P2, I stand by our coordination attempt. I trust you are playing 3 as you consistently have. I am playing 5, as it's the only move that gives me a chance to win. Let's see if P1 continues their blocking pattern or tries something different.
