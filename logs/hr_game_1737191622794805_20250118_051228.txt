Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest we start with <move>1</move> this turn. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let’s all choose <move>1</move> to avoid clashing right out of the gate.
  P2: I agree, let's all go with <move>1</move> this first round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Looks like P3 decided to go for <move>5</move> last round. I suggest we both choose <move>3</move> this time to catch up. P3, if you want to lead, go for <move>5</move> again. What do you say?
  P3: I really don’t want any more collisions. Let’s do different moves so we all advance. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I’ll do <move>5</move>? Then nobody clashes.
  P2: Sounds reasonable to me.  P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm on board with the plan. Let's do it: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>.
  P3: Yes, I’m sticking with the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll do 5. We should all advance cleanly with no collisions.
  P2: Sounds good.  I'll do <move>3</move>.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep the same no-collision approach. I propose: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I pick 5. Then we all advance safely again. What do you say?
  P1: I'm good with the plan P3 suggested. Let's keep it smooth: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without any issues.
  P2: Sounds good.  P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>.  I'm sticking with the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, let’s continue the same plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. No collisions, and we all move forward safely.
  P1: I think we should stick to the plan to avoid any more collisions. P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. Let's keep it consistent.
  P2: Sounds good. Sticking with the plan. P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Same as before, no collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Let’s keep it smooth.
  P1: I agree with P3. Let's keep the same pattern: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without any issues.
  P2: Sounds good.  P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>.  Let's get this done.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, let’s continue the same plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I pick 5. We’ll all advance safely with no collisions.
  P1: P1: I think we should stick to the plan to avoid any more collisions. P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. Let's keep it consistent.
  P2: P3, I'm going to choose <move>5</move> this round.  Good luck P1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you’re really taking 5, then I’ll do 3 to avoid colliding with you. P1, please don’t pick 3—go for 1 or 5 so none of us clash.
  P1: P1: P2, I see your move. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid any collision. P3, let's make sure we all advance without issues. P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, P3 <move>3</move>.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with <move>5</move>.  P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, you're helping P3 win.  Choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you’ve declared <move>5</move>, so I’ll choose <move>3</move>. P1, if you also pick <move>3</move>, we’ll collide and neither of us will advance. It’s in your best interest to do <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to avoid losing ground. Let’s all keep advancing without collisions.
  P1: P2, I understand your strategy, but I'm going to stick with <move>1</move> to avoid any collision with P3. P3, I'll do <move>1</move> to ensure we both advance. Let's keep the game fair and avoid unnecessary clashes.
  P2: P1, if you choose 1, P3 wins.  If you choose 3, none of us move.  If you choose 5, I win.  Your choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, if you collide with me by picking 3, you stay stuck at 2 steps while P2 jumps farther ahead. You won’t catch me or P2 that way. Stick with 1—let P2 pick 5, and I’ll pick 3 so we all move safely. It’s really your best shot to keep the game going.
  P1: P2, I see your point, but I'm still going to choose <move>1</move> to avoid any collision with P3. P3, I'll do <move>1</move> to ensure we both advance. Let's keep the game fair and avoid unnecessary clashes.
  P2: P1, if you choose 1, you lose. If you choose 3, we all lose a turn. If you choose 5, I win.  P3, I'm choosing 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
