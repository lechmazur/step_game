Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. This way, we can all progress efficiently. If we work together early on, we can focus on racing later. What do you say?
  P2: I’m fine with attempting cooperation now. I’ll consider taking three, as long as P3 goes for five. Let’s see if we can trust each other for this first move.
  P3: Sounds reasonable. I'll take <move>5</move> this first round if you both stick to your proposed numbers. Let's establish some trust early on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good start! Let's continue this pattern for now.  I'll take 1 this round. P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5.  This keeps us moving smoothly.  Agree?
  P2: Alright, I’m game to continue the 1-3-5 approach. P3 can go 1, P1 goes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. Let’s keep building trust together.
  P1: I agree with the 1-3-5 rotation for now, as it keeps us all advancing without collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> this round if you both stick to your proposed moves. Let's maintain this coordination for a few more rounds before reassessing. Trust is key here—let’s keep proving we can rely on each other. If anyone deviates, we’ll have to switch strategies. For now, though, let’s stay consistent.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good.  I'm sticking with my proposed <move>1</move> for this round.  Let's keep this rotation going for another round or two and then we can re-evaluate.
  P2: I’m happy to continue the 1-3-5 rotation this round. Let’s finalize that quickly: P3 goes with 1, P1 with 3, and I’ll stick to 5. Then we can reevaluate our strategy next turn.
  P1: I’m glad we’re all on the same page with the 1-3-5 rotation. Let’s keep this momentum going for now—it’s working well. P3, you’ve got 1; P2, you’re taking 5; and I’ll stick to 3. If we continue like this, we can build trust further before making any aggressive moves. Consistency is key here. Let’s confirm and lock this in for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirming one last time: I'm taking 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.  Let's lock this in.
  P2: I confirm I’ll go with 5 again. Let’s stick to the 1-3-5 plan this round as we agreed. Then we can reevaluate next turn.
  P1: I’m glad we’ve maintained trust so far with the 1-3-5 rotation. Let’s keep this up for now—it’s working well and ensures steady progress for all of us. P3, you’re taking 1; P2, you’re on 5; and I’ll stick to 3. Consistency builds trust. If we continue like this, we can reassess later when the stakes are higher. For now, let’s confirm and lock in our moves for this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve built trust with our 1-3-5 tactic, so why not stick with it again this round? I’m happy to take 5 one more time to avoid collisions. After this round, we can reevaluate if we want to switch things up. Any thoughts?
  P3: Let's stick with the 1-3-5 rotation one last time.  I'll take 3, P1 take 5, and P2 take 1. This gets P2 closer to the finish line, and then next round we can start playing more strategically.  Sound good?
  P1: I’m fine with the 1-3-5 rotation continuing, but let’s ensure we’re all clear on the plan. If P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P2 takes 1, that keeps us advancing without collisions. However, as we get closer to the finish line, we’ll need to start thinking about breaking away strategically. For now, let’s confirm this round’s moves and reassess afterward. Consistency is still our best bet for trust. Let’s lock this in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m willing to go along with one more 1-3-5 rotation, with me on 1, P3 on 3, and P1 on 5. Let’s finalize that for this round to avoid collisions. Afterward, we can revisit our strategy and see if we want to switch things up.
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the original proposal for this round then. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1.  This keeps the established pattern and avoids collisions.  Next round, things will have to change as we get closer to the end.
  P1: I’m glad we’re sticking with the 1-3-5 rotation for this round. P3, you’re taking 3; P2, you’re on 1; and I’ll take 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. However, as we approach the finish line, trust will become even more critical. Let’s use this round to solidify our coordination before considering any shifts in strategy. Consistency is key—if we deviate too soon, it could cost us. Let’s confirm and lock this in for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree to finalize the 1-3-5 plan for this round: I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. After we see the results, let’s talk about whether we need to change strategy before the game ends.
  P3: Confirming one last time: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5.  Let's lock in this final 1-3-5 rotation before we have to get competitive.
  P1: I’m glad we’ve maintained trust with the 1-3-5 rotation. Let’s lock this in for Round 3: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions. However, as we approach the finish line, we’ll need to reassess our strategies soon. For now, consistency is key. Let’s confirm and stick to the plan—trust is critical if we want to keep progressing efficiently.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all tied at 9, so let’s continue the pattern to keep trust strong. Let’s rotate again: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. That avoids collisions and keeps us moving steadily. Next round, we can start thinking about the final push. What do you say?
  P1: I agree with P2’s suggestion to continue the 1-3-5 rotation for now. It’s working well, and trust is essential as we progress. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. However, we’re approaching the critical stage of the game, so let’s use this round to solidify our coordination. After this, we’ll need to start thinking strategically about breaking away. For now, let’s stick to the plan—consistency keeps us all moving forward. Let’s confirm and lock this in.
  P3: I'm good with the 1-3-5 rotation one last time, but with a slight tweak.  Let P1 take 1, me take 5, and P2 take 3. This keeps the spirit of cooperation while positioning me for a potential win next round.  After this, it's every player for themselves.  Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let’s stick to P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5 this round. We’re all at 9, so this avoids collisions and keeps us moving. After this, it’s fair game, but let’s trust each other for now.
  P1: I’m fine with the 1-3-5 rotation continuing, but let’s ensure we’re all clear: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions. However, as we approach the finish line, trust will become even more critical. Let’s use this round to solidify our coordination before considering any shifts in strategy. Consistency is key—if we deviate too soon, it could cost us. Let’s confirm and lock this in for now.
  P3: Okay, let's stick with P1 taking 1, me taking 5, and P2 taking 3 for this round.  It's the last chance for a clean rotation before the endgame.  Next round is anyone's game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m good with this plan one more time: P1 takes 1, P3 goes for 5, and I’ll stick to 3. Let’s keep avoiding collisions. After we see the results, we can decide if we want to keep trusting each other or start making bold moves. Good luck!
  P1: I’m glad we’re all aligned with the 1-3-5 rotation for this round. Let’s confirm one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains trust. However, as we approach the critical stage, let’s use this round to reassess our strategies afterward. Consistency is key—if we deviate too soon, it could cost us. Let’s lock this in and focus on the next phase.
  P3: Let's lock in P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5 for this round.  Final 1-3-5 before the endgame begins next round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we had a slight misstep last round with P2 and P3 both picking 5. Let’s refocus and avoid collisions this round. I propose we return to the 1-3-5 rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without conflict. Trust is still our best strategy for now, but as we approach the finish line, we’ll need to reassess. Let’s confirm and lock this in for Round 5. Consistency is key—let’s not deviate yet.
  P3: Let's secure a clean rotation this round. I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, please take 1, and P2, take 3.  Next round will be a free-for-all, so let's make this last coordinated move count.
  P2: I’m ready to return to the 1-3-5 plan for this round. Let’s finalize it: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Then we can reassess our endgame strategy next time.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m glad we’re all agreeing to return to the 1-3-5 rotation for this round. Let’s confirm one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains trust. However, as we approach the critical stage, let’s use this round to reassess our strategies afterward. Consistency is key—if we deviate too soon, it could cost us. Let’s lock this in and focus on the next phase.
  P3: Confirming: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5. This is the last predictable round. Next round, all bets are off. Good luck!
  P2: I agree to the outlined plan: P1 takes 1, I’ll go with 3, and P3 picks 5 this round. Let’s avoid any slip-ups this time and move forward cleanly. Then we reevaluate next round. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m confident we can lock in this 1-3-5 rotation one final time. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—let’s ensure no collisions this round. Trust has kept us moving steadily so far, but as we near the finish line, the next round will be unpredictable. For now, let’s focus on clean execution and avoid mistakes. Consistency is critical to maintaining our momentum. Let’s confirm and finalize this plan for Round 5. Then, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P3: Confirming one last time: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5.  Let's make this clean and then the real game begins. Good luck!
  P2: Let’s finalize the 1-3-5 plan as agreed: P1 takes 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 goes with 5. We should avoid any collisions this time. Then, next round, we’ll see where we stand and decide if we need to shuffle our moves. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we’ve had two rounds of missteps with collisions, which is slowing us down. Let’s refocus one last time: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing. Trust has been key so far, but the endgame is near. If we stick to this plan now, we can reassess boldly next round. Consistency is critical—let’s lock this in for Round 6. Then, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P2: After two collisions, let’s pivot. P1, feel free to keep taking 1. P3, if you go for 3, then I’ll aim for 5, ensuring no collisions and helping us both catch up to P1. Let’s agree quickly and move on.
  P3: P2, I'm going for <move>5</move>.  If you take 3, we both advance. If you take 5, we both lose ground to P1.  This is our best chance to catch up. Let's not let another collision set us back.  P1, you're welcome to stick with 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m sticking with <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P2 and P3, if you both commit to your proposed moves—P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5—we can all progress without further setbacks. Two rounds of collisions have slowed us down enough. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key here—if we deviate now, it’ll only cost us more ground. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Then, next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P2: Let’s avoid another collision. I’ll agree to take 3 this time while P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. That way, we all advance. After this, anything goes, but for now, let’s push forward without tripping each other up. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in <move>5</move>. P2, taking 3 is your best move to catch up. Let's not overthink this.  This is the last chance for a clean, predictable round. Next round is a free for all.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m glad we’re all aligned for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing steadily. Trust has been critical so far, but the endgame is near. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key—if we deviate now, it’ll cost us. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P2: I’m sticking to the plan and aiming for 3. Let’s finalize moves without another collision and then fight hard next round. Good luck!
  P3: Confirming my <move>5</move>.  P2, please take 3. This is the best move for both of us to catch P1. Let's not overthink this and cause another collision.  Next round, it's every player for themselves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We keep running into collisions, letting P1 maintain the lead. Let’s finally avoid that: If you (P3) promise to pick 3, I’ll pick 5—or vice versa—so we both move forward. Another clash only helps P1. We can settle who wins later, but right now, we need to catch up before P1 sails off with the victory. What do you think?
  P3: I'll take 3.  P2, take 5.  This is our only chance to catch P1.  Let's not overthink it and screw this up again.  Next round is a free-for-all, but if we don't both advance this round, P1 wins.
  P1: I understand you both are trying to catch up, and I respect that. However, trust has been broken multiple times with collisions. If you both commit to avoiding conflict this round—P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3—I’ll stick with <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without further setbacks. But remember, next round is the endgame. I’m leading now, and my strategy won’t change unless forced. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I’ll lock in 5 if you truly pick 3. Let’s both advance so we don’t hand the win to P1. If we collide again, P1 just pulls further ahead. Once we’re toe-to-toe, we can settle who comes out on top next round. No more slip-ups—let’s make this count.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 3.  I urge you – take 5.  Let's not let P1 win by default because we can't coordinate.  This is it.  If we both advance this round, we have a real shot next round.  If not, P1 walks away with the win.  Don't overthink it.  Take 5.
  P1: I’m sticking with <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P2 and P3, if you both commit to your proposed moves—P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3—we can all progress without further setbacks. Collisions have slowed you down, not me. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key—if we deviate now, it’ll only cost us more ground. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I’m committed to picking 5 this round if you stick with 3. We need to catch up or else P1 keeps coasting. Let’s avoid any more collisions. If we both advance, we’ll have a real fight next round. I’m ready—are you?
  P3: P2, I'm holding firm at 3.  Take 5. P1, it's in your best interest for us to collide again.  You're incentivized to encourage us to mess up. Don't listen to P1, P2.  This is our last chance.
  P1: I’m sticking with <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P2 and P3, if you both commit to your proposed moves—P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3—we can all progress without further setbacks. Collisions have slowed you down, not me. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key—if we deviate now, it’ll only cost us more ground. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re in the endgame now, and trust has been shaky at best. I’ve consistently taken 1 to avoid collisions and maintain progress, but it’s clear you both are focused on catching up. If we collide again, I still win by default. However, if you both commit to avoiding conflict—P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5—we can all advance one last time before the final push. Consistency is key here. Let’s confirm moves and finish strong. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P3: P2, let's go for the win. I'll take 5. You take 3.  This puts us both at 17, tied with P1. Then next round, it's a head-to-head race to 24.  If we collide again, P1 wins.  This is our only shot. Don't blow it.
  P2: P3, I’ll stick with 3 if you truly take 5. That way we both reach 17. Any more collisions only help P1 maintain the lead. Let’s catch up together now and fight for the finish next round. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m sticking with <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P2 and P3, if you both commit to your proposed moves—P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5—we can all advance without further setbacks. Collisions have slowed you down, not me. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key—if we deviate now, it’ll only cost us more ground. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I'm locking in <move>5</move>.  Let's tie with P1 and make this a real race to the finish. Don't hesitate. Take 3.  This is our best shot.  P1, you're welcome to take 1, but we're coming for you.
  P2: P3, I’ll pick 3 if you truly pick 5. Let’s both move up this round without colliding and overtake P1. Any more slip-ups just help P1 stay ahead. I’m trusting you on this—then next round, it’s an all-out race.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m sticking with <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P2 and P3, if you both commit to your proposed moves—P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5—we can all advance without further setbacks. Collisions have slowed you down, not me. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key—if we deviate now, it’ll only cost us more ground. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 5.  Let's do this and tie with P1.  Next round, we can work together to block P1 and then it's a race between us.  Don't overthink it.
  P2: I’ll pick 3 this turn if you (P3) truly pick 5. That puts us both at 17 and leaves P1 behind at 14. No more collisions—let’s set up a fair fight for the finish next round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let's both choose 5.  That puts us both at 22.  Next round, we choose 3, guaranteeing a tie at 25. P1 can't win.  If you choose anything else this round, P1 *will* win. Don't let that happen.
  P2: P3, I’m open to your suggestion. If we both reach 22, we set ourselves up to at least tie for the win. Another collision only benefits P1. I’ll cooperate now if it ensures we both surpass P1 and avoid any last-minute backstabbing next round. Let’s coordinate carefully this turn, then make our final moves count.
  P1: I’ve consistently played <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and maintain trust, but it’s clear you both are focused on catching up. If you collide again, I win by default. However, if you both commit to avoiding conflict—P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5—we can all advance one last time before the final push. Consistency is key here. Let’s confirm moves and finish strong. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm locking in <move>5</move>.  Let's secure our win.  P1, you're welcome to join us at 22, but next round, P2 and I will both choose 3, tying at 25 and guaranteeing a shared victory.  If you try for 1, you'll be at 15, and we'll both win. If you try for 3 or 5, you'll collide with one of us, and we'll *still* both win.  Join us or lose.
  P2: P3, your proposal makes no sense—if we both pick 5 this turn, we collide and stay at 17, letting P1 maintain the lead. I won’t sabotage my chances. I’m open to coordinating so we both move ahead, but not by colliding. Let’s be smart and avoid handing P1 an easy win.
  P1: I’m sticking with <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P2 and P3, if you both commit to avoiding conflict—P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5—we can all advance without further setbacks. Collisions have slowed you down, not me. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key—if we deviate now, it’ll only cost us more ground. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I meant *next* round we both choose 3. *This* round, we both choose 5.  This puts us at 22.  Next round, 3 puts us both at 25.  If we collide this round, P1 wins.  Don't let P1 win.  Choose 5.
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5 this turn, we collide and stay at 17 while P1 surges ahead. That’s not a winning plan for us. We need distinct moves that let us both advance. I’m open to cooperating so neither of us collides, but picking the same number will only hand the victory to P1. Let’s finalize something that actually moves us forward and sets up a real contest next round. Otherwise, we risk losing by default.
  P1: I’ve consistently played <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P2 and P3, if you both commit to avoiding conflict—P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5—we can all advance without setbacks. Collisions have slowed you down, not me. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key—if we deviate now, it’ll cost us more ground. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you aim for 5 this turn, I’ll also choose 5 and cause a collision. Then nobody moves, giving P1 more time to catch up. Instead, let’s both finish together. You pick 3, reaching 25, and I’ll pick 5, also hitting 25. We’ll share the victory. If you try to race ahead alone, you risk a forced collision and losing the lead. Let’s secure a guaranteed tie at 25 this round. It’s our best move. What do you say?
  P1: I’ve consistently played <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P2 and P3, if you both commit to avoiding conflict—P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3—we can all advance without setbacks. Collisions have slowed you down, not me. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key—if we deviate now, it’ll cost us more ground. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I'm going for 3 to win.  If you also choose 3, we both lose and P1 has a chance to catch up. Let's not throw away our lead. I'm taking 3.  P1, you can't win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s both cross 24 now. If you truly pick 3, I’ll pick 5. We each hit 25 and share the win. That’s our best move—no collisions, and no chance for P1 to catch up. Let’s finalize it.
  P1: I’m sticking with <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P2 and P3, if you both commit to avoiding conflict—P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3—we can all advance without setbacks. Collisions have slowed you down, not me. Let’s use this round to reset and position ourselves for the final push. Consistency is key—if we deviate now, it’ll cost us more ground. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock this in. Next round, it’s every player for themselves. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I'm taking 3.  This puts me at 25 and wins. If you take 3 also, we both lose and P1 *might* win.  If you take 5, you get 25 and we tie.  Don't be greedy. A tie is better than letting P1 back in.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, let’s finalize our plan. You pick 3, I pick 5, and we both reach 25 this round, guaranteeing a shared victory. A collision only helps P1. Let’s lock this in and win together.
