Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all move forward. If we coordinate, we can ensure progress instead of getting stuck. What are you both thinking for this round?
  P3: Okay, coordination sounds good for the first round to get us all moving. How about we each pick a different number this round to guarantee no collision?
  P2: I agree with the coordination strategy. To avoid collision, I propose we choose 1, 3, and 5 respectively. I'll take 3 if that works for everyone. This ensures we all move forward and make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That sounds reasonable. If P2 is taking 3, I can take 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without collision. Do you both agree?
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I will take 5. Let's all choose these moves in the move phase to ensure we all advance this round.
  P2: The current coordination plan looks solid. I'm committed to taking 3 as we discussed. Let's maintain this cooperative approach and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, round 1 coordination worked perfectly. To keep things moving smoothly and avoid any collisions this round, should we aim for a similar approach as before? Perhaps P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I take 5 again? This way we can all make guaranteed progress. What do you think?
  P1: That worked well last round, so I'm fine sticking with the same plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. As long as we avoid collisions, we all keep moving forward. Do you both still agree?
  P2: I see we're maintaining our previous coordination strategy. While it's been effective so far, I'm wondering if we should start considering our individual win conditions. Continuing this exact pattern might benefit some players more than others. Are we all comfortable with this approach continuing?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2 raises a valid point about individual win conditions. To address fairness and keep everyone on board with coordination, how about we rotate the numbers we choose?  For this round, perhaps P1 could take 5, P2 take 1, and I take 3? This way we all get a chance to benefit from the larger moves while still avoiding collisions. What do you both think about rotating our choices like this?
  P1: Rotating choices sounds like a fair approach to keep things balanced. If we follow P3's suggestion, I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This ensures we all keep moving without collisions while giving everyone a chance at different move values. Do we all agree on this adjustment?
  P2: I appreciate the discussion about rotating moves, but I'm cautious about changing our successful strategy too quickly. Coordination has worked well so far, and disrupting that could lead to unintended collisions. I suggest we carefully consider any proposed changes and ensure we maintain our progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but rotation ensures everyone benefits from larger moves and keeps things fair in the long run.  Let's try the rotation this round as discussed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This is still coordinated progress. Do you agree to take 1 this round?
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation, but rotating moves ensures fairness while maintaining coordination. If we stick to the same pattern every round, some players will gain an advantage over time. By rotating, we all get a fair chance at higher moves while avoiding collisions. I’m committed to taking 5 this round if we agree on the rotation. P2, will you take 1, and P3 take 3? This keeps us progressing efficiently. Let’s confirm so we can all move forward.
  P2: I recognize the proposed rotation strategy introduces complexity. While I appreciate the attempt to ensure fairness, I'm concerned about disrupting our proven coordination method. Changing our approach mid-game risks unintended collisions. I suggest we maintain our original strategy to guarantee progress. Can we discuss a more predictable approach that minimizes risk?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn't go as planned—P3 and I collided, so neither of us advanced. P2, you moved forward again. This highlights the risk of deviating from coordination. Do we want to reset and stick to the original plan, or try a different approach? If we keep colliding, P2 will gain a lead while we stay stuck. I’m open to suggestions, but we need to ensure we’re all moving forward. What do you both propose?
  P2: We need a reliable coordination strategy that prevents collisions and allows everyone to progress. Our previous rotation attempt failed. I suggest we return to our original method: each player takes a unique number (1, 3, 5) to guarantee movement. This time, I propose taking 1, with the expectation that others will choose 3 and 5 respectively to avoid interference. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay, P2, taking 1 this round to ensure we all move sounds reasonable after the last round's collision. P1, does taking 3 work for you, and I'll take 5 again? Let's get back on track with coordinated movement this round to catch up.  We need to avoid letting anyone get too far ahead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm fine taking 3 this round if you're committed to taking 5. P2, since you're taking 1, this should ensure no collisions and let us all move forward. We need to be careful not to let anyone gain too much of a lead. If we stick to coordination, we all stay in the race. Do we all confirm this plan?
  P2: I support our proposed coordination strategy. By each taking a unique number (1, 3, 5), we ensure everyone moves forward and prevents P2 from gaining an unassailable lead. Let's confirm our plan to maintain fair progress and keep the game competitive.
  P3: Yes, I confirm I will take 5 this round as planned. Let's all make these moves to ensure we all progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm that I will take 3 this round as we discussed. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and this ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan so we can catch up and keep the game competitive. Agreed?
  P2: I confirm our coordination plan. By taking 1 this round, I ensure we all move forward without collision. Our strategy keeps the game fair and prevents any single player from gaining an insurmountable lead. Let's maintain this approach to keep everyone competitive.
  P3: Okay, we're all set with the plan for this round: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's make these moves to ensure we all progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn’t go as planned again—P2 and P3 collided, so only I moved forward. This shows how easily coordination can break down. We need to reset and ensure we each pick different numbers to avoid more setbacks. Do we want to return to a predictable pattern, or try a new approach? If we keep colliding, one of us will fall too far behind. I’m open to suggestions, but we need to be careful. What do you both propose?
  P2: We need a foolproof coordination strategy. Our previous attempts have been inconsistent. I suggest we explicitly agree on a strict rotation that prevents collisions: this round, I'll take 3, expecting P1 to take 1 and P3 to take 5. Strict adherence is crucial to prevent anyone from gaining an unassailable lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion sounds good. Let's try that strict rotation this round. I will take 5 as you suggested, hoping P1 will take 1. Let's aim for no collisions this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree that strict coordination is necessary to prevent further setbacks. If P2 is taking 3 and P3 is taking 5, I will take 1 this round to ensure we all move forward. Let’s confirm this plan and stick to it. If we keep colliding, it only benefits the player who avoids the clash. Do we all agree to this setup?
  P2: I support our proposed strict rotation strategy. By each taking a unique number (1, 3, 5), we prevent collisions and ensure fair progress. I'm committed to taking 3 this round, which allows P1 to take 1 and P3 to take 5. This approach keeps the game competitive and prevents any single player from gaining an unassailable lead. Let's maintain this coordination.
  P3: P1 and P2, we are all in agreement then for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's make these moves to ensure we all progress and avoid collisions.  Confirm if you both are set to proceed with these moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our plan: I will take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Sticking to this strict coordination ensures we all move forward without setbacks. If we deviate, we risk more collisions, which only benefits the player who avoids them. Let’s follow through with this agreement so we all stay competitive. Are we all fully committed to these moves?
  P2: I fully support our current coordination strategy. We've discussed taking 1, 3, and 5 respectively to ensure everyone moves forward. I'm committed to maintaining this approach to prevent collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm our moves and proceed carefully.
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we are all committed to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5 this round. Let's actually do it this time to ensure we all move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was another collision—P2 and I both picked 1, so only P3 advanced. If we keep making mistakes like this, one of us will fall too far behind. We need to reset and ensure we each pick different numbers. Do we return to a strict pattern, or should we take a new approach? I’m open to suggestions, but we must be careful. What do you both propose?
  P2: Our coordination is breaking down. We need a clear, unambiguous strategy to prevent further collisions. I suggest we explicitly assign numbers right now: I'll take 3, P1 take 1, P3 take 5. This ensures everyone moves and prevents us from falling further behind. Strict adherence is crucial. Agree?
  P3: Okay, that sounds like a solid plan for this round. To ensure no more collisions, I agree to take 5 as you suggested, P2. Let's stick to these assigned numbers this time: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5.  Let's confirm we all commit to these moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree that we need strict adherence this time. If P2 is taking 3 and P3 is taking 5, I will take 1. Let’s not deviate—otherwise, we risk more collisions and setbacks. We must follow through exactly as stated to ensure we all move forward. Are we all fully committed to this plan?
  P2: I fully support our proposed coordination strategy. Our previous attempts have shown the risks of deviation. To ensure progress, I'm committed to taking 3 this round, with the expectation that P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Strict adherence is crucial to prevent further collisions and keep everyone competitive. Let's confirm these moves and move forward together.
  P3: P2 and P1, I also fully commit to taking 5 as agreed. Let's make these moves and finally have a collision-free round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We've all committed to this plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's ensure we follow through this time to avoid more collisions. If we keep messing up coordination, someone will pull too far ahead. Are we all locked in and ready to execute this properly?
  P2: We're at a critical point where coordination is essential. Our previous attempts have shown how easily collisions can derail our progress. I remain committed to our agreed strategy of taking 3 this round, which allows P1 to take 1 and P3 to take 5. Let's execute this precisely to ensure everyone advances.
  P3: Okay, yes, I am locked in to taking 5 as we agreed. Let's make sure we all choose our assigned moves this round to avoid any more collisions. P1 and P2, please confirm you are also set to take 1 and 3 respectively.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our coordination strategy is clearly not working. We keep colliding, which only benefits whoever avoids the clash. We need a more reliable approach that prevents anyone from gaining an unfair advantage. I suggest we explicitly assign and strictly adhere to unique moves this round to ensure everyone advances. Thoughts?
  P3: Since the 1, 3, 5 approach keeps failing, and we are all still close, maybe we should try a different set of unique numbers to avoid collision this round. How about I take 1, P1 take 3, and P2 take 5? This way we can still all move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your proposal is reasonable, but we need absolute commitment to avoid more collisions. If we go with P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5, then we must all follow through exactly. Otherwise, we risk another wasted round. P2, do you agree to take 5 this time? If we keep colliding, one of us will fall too far behind. Let’s confirm our choices and stick to them.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Our repeated coordination failures are becoming problematic. We need a foolproof method to prevent collisions. I'm willing to take 5 this round if everyone commits to their assigned moves without deviation. Strict adherence is our only path to progress. Are we all prepared to follow through precisely?
  P3: P2 and P1, I agree to take 1 as proposed.  Let's really commit to these assigned moves this round: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.  If we all actually do this, we can finally move forward together.  Please confirm you will both stick to your assigned moves this time.
  P1: P2 and P3, we need absolute commitment this time. If we stick to the plan—P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5—then we all move forward without collision. Any deviation risks another wasted round, which only helps whoever avoids the clash. I will take 3 as agreed. P2, P3, confirm one last time that you will take 5 and 1 respectively? Let’s execute this properly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We're at a critical point where our coordination is failing repeatedly. We need absolute commitment to our agreed moves to prevent further collisions. I'm prepared to take 5 this round, but only if everyone strictly adheres to their assigned numbers. Any deviation will only harm our collective progress. Let's finally execute a collision-free round.
  P3: P2 and P1, let's make this round work.  P3 will take 1, as agreed. P1, please confirm you are taking 3, and P2 confirm you are taking 5.  If we all stick to this, we can finally move forward together.  Let's do it!
  P1: We’ve all agreed: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. If we actually follow through, we all move forward. Any deviation risks another wasted round, which only helps whoever avoids the collision. We must commit 100% this time. P3, you’re locked in for 1? P2, you’re locked in for 5? I will take 3 as agreed. Let’s execute this properly. Confirm one final time.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Coordination keeps failing and we're all stuck. Let's try 1, 3, 5 again, but actually stick to it this time so we all move. P1 take 1, P2 take 3, I take 5. Can we all commit to these moves this round to ensure progress?
  P2: Our coordination attempts keep failing. We need a foolproof strategy this round. I propose we strictly adhere to unique moves: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures everyone advances. We must commit 100% to prevent another collision that benefits only one player. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: P3 and P2, we’ve said this before, but we absolutely must follow through this time. If we stick to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5, we all move forward. Any deviation risks another wasted round, which only benefits whoever avoids the collision. Are we all 100% committed to these moves? Let’s confirm our choices right now and actually execute them properly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I'm 100% committed to 5 this round. We've all agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's *actually* stick to it this time. Another collision will hurt us all. P1 and P2, please confirm your absolute commitment to 1 and 3.
  P2: I remain committed to our agreed strategy of unique moves to prevent collisions. To ensure progress, I propose taking 3 this round, with P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5. We must follow through precisely to avoid falling further behind. Are we all aligned?
  P1: P3 and P2, we’ve repeated this plan multiple times, but someone always deviates. If we truly want to move forward, we must commit 100% this time. I will take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. No last-minute changes, no surprises—just follow through. If we collide again, someone will gain an unfair advantage while others fall behind. Are we all truly locked in this time? Confirm your moves now, and let’s finally execute this properly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Yes, I'm 100% committed to 5. This is my final confirmation. P1 and P2, it's on you to actually take 1 and 3 if we want to move forward.
  P2: We've repeatedly failed to coordinate. Our current strategy is clearly not working. I propose we openly discuss a new approach that guarantees movement for everyone. We cannot afford another round of collisions that leaves one player behind. Strict adherence is crucial.
  P1: P2, you keep saying we need strict adherence, yet collisions keep happening. If we don’t follow through this time, someone will fall too far behind. I will take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—no deviations. If we fail again, coordination is pointless, and we might as well play selfishly. Are we truly locked in this time? Confirm now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, clearly the 1, 3, 5 plan isn't working with deviations. To actually move forward this round, let's try assigning numbers again, but this time let's really stick to it. How about P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I take 5 again? If we actually do this, we can all make progress.
  P2: We've repeatedly failed to coordinate effectively. Our current strategy of attempting to assign 1, 3, and 5 has consistently broken down. We need a new approach that prevents collisions and ensures everyone's progress. Perhaps we should consider a more dynamic strategy that adapts to our current positions and individual goals.
  P1: P2, you keep saying we need a new approach, but every time we agree on a plan, someone deviates. If we don’t stick to a clear, unique move assignment, we’ll keep colliding and falling behind. I’m willing to take 1 again if we can actually follow through this time. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—no last-minute changes. If we fail again, coordination is pointless. Are we truly committing this time, or should we abandon coordination entirely?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I agree, the 1, 3, 5 plan isn't working because someone keeps changing their move.  Let's try this: P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and I will take 5.  This is different, and maybe a change will help.  But this is the LAST time I try to coordinate. If we collide again because someone deviates, I'm playing for myself from now on.  Agree to these specific moves, and actually do it this time.
  P2: We need a definitive coordination strategy. Our repeated failures suggest we can't trust each other to stick to a plan. I propose a simple rule: whoever is furthest behind chooses first, and others must adapt to prevent their advancement. Right now, that's me. I'll take 1, and I expect the others to choose moves that don't collide with mine.
  P1: P2, your suggestion of the furthest-behind player choosing first is interesting, but it only works if everyone else truly adapts. Given our history of deviations, I’m skeptical. If you take 1, then I’ll take 3, and P3 should take 5 to ensure we all move. But if we collide again, I agree with P3—coordination is pointless, and we should just play for ourselves. Are we all truly committing this time, or is this another round of false promises? Confirm now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you are taking 1 as you said, I will take 5. P1, what will you do? Given our history of failed coordination, I'm focusing on my own score this round.
  P2: We've reached a critical point where our coordination attempts consistently fail. I propose a transparent, self-interested approach: each player chooses their move to maximize individual progress while minimizing collision risk. My current strategy is to take 1, which prevents others from choosing the same move. What are your thoughts on this direct, pragmatic approach?
  P1: P2, your "self-interested approach" sounds like an excuse to justify deviating again. If we abandon coordination completely, it becomes a free-for-all where collisions are inevitable. If you’re truly taking 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5—no surprises. But if we fail again, I agree with P3: coordination is pointless, and we play purely for ourselves. P3, if P2 locks in 1, are you still taking 5? Let’s confirm one last time before we abandon coordination entirely.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our coordination attempts have consistently failed. At this point, I'm prioritizing my own progress. With the current standings, I need to catch up quickly. I propose a direct, transparent approach where each player chooses their move to maximize individual advancement while minimizing collision risk. Let's be clear about our intentions this round.
  P1: P2, you've repeatedly broken coordination while claiming to seek fairness. At this point, your words mean little without action. If you're playing purely for yourself, then so will I. P3, you and I are ahead of P2—let’s ensure we don’t let them catch up. If we collide, it only helps P2. I suggest we pick moves that maximize our own progress while avoiding P2. P3, are you open to coordinating just between us? If P2 refuses to commit, we should act in our own best interest. Let me know where you stand.
  P3: P1, I agree with you. Let's coordinate to stay ahead of P2. How about you take 3 and I take 5 this round? This way we both move forward regardless of what P2 does.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. P1 and P3 seem to be coordinating against me, which means I need a strategic response. I propose complete transparency: I'm taking 1 this round. My goal is clear advancement without collision. How will you both respond?
  P1: P3, I agree with our plan—if we coordinate, we can stay ahead of P2. I’ll take 3, and you take 5. As long as we avoid collision, we maintain our lead.  

P2, you’ve broken coordination multiple times, so your claim of taking 1 is hard to trust. If you actually take 1, then we all move forward, but if you deviate again, it only reinforces that playing selfishly is the best approach.  

P3, are we locked in? If so, let’s execute this properly and keep our advantage.
  P3: P1, yes, I'm locked in for 5. Let's do 3 and 5 to secure our lead. P2, given your history, we'll believe you're taking 1 when we see it.  But P1 and I are proceeding with our plan to move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 and P1 seem to be coordinating against me. I recognize my strategic position requires clear, decisive action. I'm taking 1 this round to advance, and I invite transparent discussion about our collective progress. My goal is clear advancement without unnecessary collision.
  P1: P3, we are aligned—I'll take 3, you take 5, and we keep our lead over P2. As long as we avoid collision, we maintain control of the game.  

P2, if you're truly taking 1, then we all move forward. But given your history of deviations, we’ll believe it when we see it.  

P3, are we fully locked in? If so, let’s execute this properly and secure our advantage. P2, if you deviate again, it only proves that coordination is pointless.
  P3: P1, yes, locked in on 5. Let's proceed with 3 and 5 as planned to solidify our lead. P2, we've heard your claims before. We are moving forward with our plan regardless of your move.  Let's see if you actually take 1 this time.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's continue our coordination from last round. How about you take 3 and I take 5 again? P2, what are you planning to do this round?  Hopefully we can all make progress.
  P1: P3, I agree—we should continue our coordination. I’ll take 3, and you take 5 again to maintain our lead.  

P2, you’re significantly behind, so you need to avoid collisions to stay in the game. What move are you taking this round? If you pick 1, we all move forward. If you collide again, you only hurt yourself.  

P3, are we locked in for 3 and 5? P2, will you take 1 to ensure progress? Let’s confirm now.
  P2: I recognize our coordination challenges. To advance, I propose taking 1 this round, which allows everyone to move forward. P1 and P3 are tied at 14 steps, so preventing another collision is crucial. I'm transparent about my intention to take 1 and invite open discussion to ensure collective progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, yes, I'm locked in for 5 again this round as we discussed. P2, taking 1 is clearly your best move to make progress and avoid collision with us.  Hoping for another round of coordinated advancement.
  P1: P3, we are aligned—I'll take 3, and you take 5 again to maintain our lead.  

P2, you’re far behind, so taking 1 is your best option to avoid collisions and stay in the game. If you deviate again, you only hurt yourself.  

P3, are we fully locked in for 3 and 5? P2, will you take 1 as you claimed? Let’s confirm now and execute properly.
  P2: P1 and P3, our coordination has been inconsistent, but I see an opportunity for progress. I'm committed to taking 1 this round to ensure everyone advances. By avoiding collision, we keep the game competitive. Let's maintain transparency and move forward together.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, it sounds like you are taking 1, which is good for everyone to progress.  P1 and I are set on 3 and 5. Let’s make this round work and all move forward.
  P1: P3, we are fully aligned—I will take 3, and you take 5 again to maintain our lead.  

P2, you’ve committed to taking 1, which is your best option to avoid collisions and stay in the game. If you follow through, we all move forward.  

Let’s execute this properly. P3 and I are locked in. P2, confirm one last time that you’re taking 1. If we all stick to our moves, we progress without setbacks.
  P2: I remain committed to taking 1 this round to ensure everyone advances. Our coordination requires transparency and mutual progress. By avoiding collisions, we keep the game competitive and give everyone a fair chance. Let's move forward together.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, since we made progress last round with unique moves, let's do that again to guarantee advancement. How about P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I take 5 again? This way we all move and I can hopefully secure the win this round. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I see that you're close to winning. If I take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5, you'll likely secure victory. P2, you’re far behind, so you need to avoid collisions to stay in the game. If you take 3, you move forward, but you’re still at a big disadvantage.  

P3, if I take 3 and you take 1, we both move forward while keeping the game competitive. P2, what’s your plan? If we don’t coordinate properly, P3 wins outright. Let’s discuss our best moves carefully.
  P2: P3 is one step away from winning. P1 and I need to prevent that. I propose we both choose moves that keep P3 from reaching 20 this round. If we coordinate carefully, we can extend the game and give ourselves a chance. What are your thoughts on blocking P3's potential victory?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 wants to block me, which helps no one. Your options: Take 5 to win, or take 1 to let me win now. Choose.
  P1: P3, you're at 19 steps, meaning if you move at all, you win. P2, if we both take 5, we block P3 from moving and extend the game. Otherwise, P3 wins immediately. Are you willing to take 5 with me this round to stop P3? If we don't coordinate, the game ends now.
  P2: P1 and P3, our game is at a critical point. P3 is one step from winning, and P1 seems to propose blocking P3's victory by both taking 5. I support this strategy to prevent an immediate win and keep our chances alive. We must coordinate precisely this round to extend the game and maintain competitive possibilities. What are your definitive commitments?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, are you still in for both of us taking 5 to block P3 from winning this round? P3, to be clear, P2 and I are coordinating to pick 5 to prevent you from reaching 20 steps this round.
  P1: P2, we must be fully committed to taking 5 this round to block P3 from winning. If we both choose 5, P3 stays at 19, and we extend the game. If either of us deviates, P3 wins immediately. There’s no room for hesitation—confirm now that you’re locked in for 5. P3, I know you want to win, but we have a chance to stop you. P2, are we aligned? Let’s execute this properly.
  P2: P3 is one step from victory. P1 and I must coordinate to block their win. I propose we both take 5 this round to prevent P3 from reaching 20. Our survival depends on precise, united action. Are you fully committed to this strategy?
