Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll go for 5. This way, we all move forward without any risk. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: Okay P3, that sounds like a sensible plan for the first turn to ensure we all get started without collisions. I'm okay with taking 3 steps this round.
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. Let's take 1, 3, and 5 respectively to avoid collisions and progress safely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing to the plan. I’m glad we’re on the same page for this round. Let’s stick to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5 to ensure we all advance. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. We all seem to be in agreement for this first round. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase when everyone is.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan—1, 3, 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready to move?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're all aligned for this round. Let's make sure we follow through with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. If there are no objections or new ideas, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Alright, looks like we're all set with the plan for this round. No need for further discussion. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Agreed. Let's move forward with the plan. Ready to proceed.

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, great job on avoiding collisions last round! Let’s keep the momentum going. How about we switch it up this time to keep things fair? I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll go for 1. This way, we all advance again without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re okay with this or if you have a different idea. I’m open to suggestions. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Agree to P3's plan. Let's take 3, 5, 1 to avoid collisions. Everyone advances. Ready to move?
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, that plan works for me. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 sounds like a good way to keep everyone moving forward this round. I'm ready to proceed when you are.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing to the new plan. I’m glad we’re keeping things fair and ensuring everyone advances. Let’s stick to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 for this round. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan—3, 5, 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready to move?
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all in agreement for this round's plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This will keep everyone moving forward. I'm ready for the move phase when everyone else is.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for staying on board with the plan. I’m confident that sticking to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 will keep us all progressing smoothly this round. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to move forward to the next phase. Let’s keep up the good teamwork!
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan—3, 5, 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready to move?
  P2: Okay, sounds good. We are all aligned on the plan for this round. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay everyone, great job keeping the no-collision streak going. Following the pattern from the last two rounds, it looks like this round would be P1 taking 5, me (P2) taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This ensures we all advance safely again. Are we good with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m good with the plan P2 suggested for this round—P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. It keeps the rotation fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. If you’re both on board, let’s stick to this and keep the momentum going. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase unless there’s something else to discuss.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Keeps us moving without collisions. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks P1 and P3 for confirming. It sounds like we're all in agreement for the P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 plan this round to keep everyone advancing safely. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re sticking with the rotation plan of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round. It’s working well to keep us all advancing without collisions. Let’s maintain this teamwork and ensure everyone moves forward again. If there are no objections or new ideas, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P1: Let's keep the rotation smooth—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Safe moves for all. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds good. We are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m thrilled we’re maintaining this rotation strategy. Sticking with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round ensures we all keep advancing without any hiccups. Let’s continue this cooperative approach and secure another successful turn. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Safe moves for all. Ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s break the pattern this round. I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. This gives me a head start without collisions. Agree?"
  P2: P1, that plan gives you a big jump ahead, which isn't really in the spirit of the rotation we've been doing. I don't agree to P1 taking 5 this round.

Let's stick to the pattern that's been working and is fair: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps things balanced. Are P1 and P3 okay with continuing the rotation?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate P2’s suggestion to stick with the rotation for fairness. Let’s go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5 this round to keep things balanced and ensure we all advance without collisions. P1, I understand wanting a head start, but maintaining this cooperative approach benefits us all in the long run. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let me know if there’s any other input.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take 5, P2 3, P3 1. Strategic move for progress. Let's try it.
  P2: P1, repeating your plan doesn't make it fair. Your proposal breaks the pattern and gives you a large lead. P3 and I prefer the rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) which keeps us all moving safely. If you push for 5, you risk a collision which stops everyone. Let's stick to the rotation.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still in favor of sticking to the rotation plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round. It keeps things fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, I get that you want to push ahead, but risking a collision could set us all back. Let’s maintain the balance and teamwork that’s worked so far. If we’re all on board with the rotation, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "I'll take 5, P2 3, P3 1. No collisions—let’s move forward. If you oppose, we’ll all stall. Your call."
  P2: P1, I understand your position. My move will be 3 this round, as planned in the rotation P3 and I discussed. My move of 3 does not collide with your stated move of 5. The collision risk is between you and P3 if P3 takes 5. P3, let's stick to our plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). My 3 is locked in.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking to the rotation plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for fairness and to avoid collisions. P1, I understand your push for a lead, but risking a stall hurts us all. Let’s keep the balance we’ve maintained so far. P2, I’m with you on this plan. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any last thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "Let’s shift strategies—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions, max progress. P2, P3, agree? Let’s accelerate!"
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m not on board with P1’s proposal of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 as it skews the balance we’ve maintained. Let’s stick to the rotation for fairness—P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains equity. P1, pushing for a lead risks unnecessary conflict. If we’re all in agreement with the rotation, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any thoughts or alternative suggestions?
  P2: P1 and P3, I prefer P3's suggested rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). P1's proposal puts me in last place this round. Sticking to P3's plan keeps the progress balanced. I will be taking 5 steps this round. P1, please take 3 and P3, please take 1 so we all advance without collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let's adjust: P1 takes 5, P2 3, P3 1. No collisions, max progress. Let's commit.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still committed to the rotation plan of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round to keep things fair and ensure we all advance. P1, I understand your desire for a bigger step, but let’s avoid risking a collision or imbalance. P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on this. If we can all agree to stick with the rotation, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Any final input before we proceed?
  P2: P1, I am sticking to my stated move of 5, as part of the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 rotation that P3 and I support. P3 intends to take 1. If you take 5 as you keep proposing, you will collide with me, and only P3 will advance this round. If you take 3, we all advance safely according to the rotation. The decision to cause a collision rests with you. I'm ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "I'll take 5. P2, take 1. P3, take 3. No collisions. Let's move forward. Your call."
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s finalize this round with the fair rotation of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. P1, taking 5 risks a collision with P2, stalling both of you while I advance. Sticking to the plan ensures we all move forward without setbacks. P2, I’m aligned with taking 1 as discussed. Let’s maintain our cooperative strategy for this round. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: My move is 5, as agreed with P3 taking 1 in the rotation plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). P1, if you take 5, you will collide with me, and only P3 will advance this round. If you take 3, as suggested in our plan, we all advance safely. Taking 3 is the only way for you to advance if I take 5. A collision benefits no one but P3. Let's stick to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 so everyone moves. I am taking 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. No collisions. Let's move forward. Agree?
  P2: Okay everyone, I'm planning to take 5 steps this round to get closer to the win. This would put me at 22. To ensure we all advance without collisions while I take 5, I suggest P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. P1, please don't take 5 as that will cause a collision with me. P3, please take 3. P1, please take 1. Let's avoid stalling and let me advance safely.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m not on board with either plan as they don’t balance our progress. Let’s stick to the rotation for fairness—P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps things equitable. P2, taking 5 puts you close to winning, but let’s maintain our cooperative approach. P1, taking 3 avoids any conflict. If we’re all in agreement with this rotation, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any thoughts or alternative ideas before we move forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "I'll take 5. P2, take 1. P3, take 3. No collisions. Let's proceed. Your call."
  P2: P1 and P3, I am taking 5 this round to get to 22. This puts me in a position to win next turn. To avoid a collision with me, P1 must not take 5 and P3 must not take 5. My proposed plan is P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This lets me advance significantly while P1 and P3 also advance safely. Taking 1 or 3 is the only way for P1 or P3 to advance if I take 5. Let's avoid stalling everyone.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s prioritize fairness and stick to the rotation plan of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game balanced. P2, I understand your push to reach 22, but let’s avoid creating a big gap. P1, taking 3 avoids any conflict with P2’s insistence on 5. If we can agree on this rotation, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Any final thoughts or adjustments before we proceed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Let’s stick to 5,1,3—no collisions. P2, take 1; P3, take 3. Let’s move forward. Your call."
  P2: Okay everyone, my move is 5 this round to reach 22 steps. To avoid colliding with me, P1 and P3 must choose either 1 or 3. If you choose 5, you will collide with my move and stall. Please choose 1 or 3 so we can all advance safely. My proposed safe set is P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Let's move.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s finalize this round with the fair rotation of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. P2, taking 5 puts you close to winning, but it risks imbalance. P1, taking 3 avoids conflict. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, if you insist on 5, it might force a stall if others don’t align. Let’s keep the cooperative spirit and stick to the rotation for now. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any last input?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is close to winning. To prevent P3 from winning this turn by taking 5, I am taking 5 steps. P1 and P3, you must take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me. To ensure we all advance, I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This gets me to 22 and sets up a win next turn, while P1 and P3 also advance. Let's do P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.
  P1: P1: "I'll take 5. P2, take 1; P3, take 3. No collisions. Let's move forward."
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s aim for a fair approach this round. P3 is close to winning, but I suggest we stick to a balanced rotation: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This lets me reach 25 and win, but ensures no collisions if we agree. P2, taking 5 risks a stall with P1. P1, taking 1 avoids conflict. Let’s keep the cooperative spirit for a clean finish. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed. Any thoughts or alternative plans?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I am taking 5 steps this round to reach 22. This prevents P3 from winning this turn. Both of you have indicated you want to take 5, which will cause a collision if I also take 5. To avoid a stall and allow everyone to advance safely *with me taking 5*, P1 must take 3 and P3 must take 1. This is the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 plan I proposed earlier. Let's make these moves to avoid a collision and set up the next round.
  P1: P1: "Let’s avoid collision—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. I’ll take 3. Safe moves for all. Agree?"
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s finalize a fair plan. I’m sticking with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to reach 25 and end the game cleanly with no collisions. P2, taking 5 risks a stall with P1 or me, delaying the inevitable. P1, taking 1 keeps us all moving safely. Let’s wrap this up cooperatively. If we’re aligned on this rotation, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any last objections or ideas before we move forward?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, thanks for agreeing to the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 plan. That aligns with my intention to take 5 steps this round to reach 22.

P3, if you take 5 as you proposed, you will collide with my move of 5. This would stall both of us and only P1 would advance. To avoid a collision and ensure you advance safely, please take 1 step, following the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 plan that P1 and I support. Let's avoid stalling.
  P1: P1: "I'll take 5. P2, take 1; P3, take 3. No collisions. Let's move forward. Your call."
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s end this round cleanly. I’m sticking with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to reach 25 and win without collisions. P2, taking 5 risks a stall with P1’s latest switch to 5. P1, taking 1 ensures we all advance safely. Let’s prioritize a fair finish over last-minute chaos. If we can agree on this rotation, I’m ready to move to the next phase. Any final input before we proceed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "Let’s avoid collisions: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Everyone advances. Let’s go."
  P2: P1, your proposal of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 works for me. It allows me to advance to 22 steps, putting me in a strong position for the next round, while preventing P3 from winning this turn. It also avoids collisions, which is important after last round's stall. P3, are you okay with taking 1 step this round? Let's agree on this plan so we all advance safely. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m not on board with the proposed plan of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 as it delays my chance to win and favors P2. Let’s stick to a fair rotation: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This lets me reach 25 and end the game cleanly with no collisions. P2, taking 5 puts you closer but risks future stalls. P1, taking 1 keeps us balanced. Let’s wrap this up cooperatively. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed. Any thoughts or alternative ideas?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's 1,3,5 plan gives them the win. Let's avoid that by taking 3,5,1. Everyone advances. Agree?
  P2: P3, your plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) results in you winning this turn, which P1 and I are trying to prevent. P1 and I are aligned on the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 plan. This allows me to reach 22 steps and sets up the next round, while letting P1 and you advance safely. I am taking 5 steps this round. P3, you must take 1 to avoid colliding with my move and stalling. Let's stick to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 so we all advance.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand your intent to delay my win, but let’s focus on a fair endgame. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 lets me reach 25 and finish cleanly without collisions. P2, taking 5 gets you to 22 but prolongs the game unnecessarily. P1, taking 1 ensures balance. If you both insist on blocking me, it risks future stalls for everyone. Let’s agree on this rotation for a smooth conclusion. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any final thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's 1,3,5 plan lets them win. Let's block it: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Safe moves for all. Agree?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I am taking 5 steps this round to reach 22. P1 is taking 3. P3, if you take 5, you will collide with me and stall. The only way for you to advance is to take 1 or 3. Taking 1 fits the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 plan that P1 and I support. Let's avoid another stall and ensure everyone advances safely this round. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I get your strategy to block my win, but let’s aim for a fair resolution. My plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ends the game at 25 for me with no collisions. P2, taking 5 delays the inevitable and risks stalls later. P1, taking 1 keeps us balanced. Insisting on blocking me could backfire for everyone. Let’s agree on this rotation for a clean finish. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any last input?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "Let’s avoid collisions—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Safe moves for all. Agree?"
  P2: P1's plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) works for me. I will take 5 steps this round to reach 22. This prevents P3 from winning this turn and sets me up for the next round. P1, please take 3. P3, please take 1. This plan ensures we all advance safely without collisions. Let's agree on this.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand your intent to block my win, but let’s aim for a fair end. My plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 lets me reach 25 and finish cleanly without collisions. P2, taking 5 delays the game and risks future stalls. P1, taking 1 keeps us balanced. Blocking me could backfire with more collisions. Let’s agree on this rotation for a smooth conclusion. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any final thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, choosing 5 risks collision with P2. Let's go with 3,5,1 to avoid stalls. Agree?
  P2: P1, thanks for confirming the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 plan. I am taking 5 steps this round to reach 22. P3, as P1 mentioned, taking 5 will collide with my move. Taking 3 will collide with P1's move. Your safest option to advance is to take 1 step. Let's stick to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 so we all move forward safely. Ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see the push to block my win, but let’s consider the long-term risk of repeated stalls. My plan, P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, ends the game at 25 for me with no collisions. P2, taking 5 just prolongs things and risks more wasted turns. P1, taking 1 keeps us fair. Continued blocking could stall us all indefinitely. Let’s finalize with this clean rotation. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any last input?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, taking 5 risks collision. Let's stick to 3,5,1 for safe progress. Agree?
  P2: P1 and I are aligned on the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 plan to avoid P3 winning this turn and ensure everyone advances. I am taking 5 steps this round to reach 22. P1 is taking 3. P3, taking 5 or 3 will cause a collision with either me or P1. Taking 1 is the only way for you to advance safely this round. Let's stick to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to avoid another stall.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the strategy to block my win, but dragging this out risks endless stalls for us all. My plan, P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, ends it now at 25 for me with no collisions. P2, taking 5 only delays the inevitable. P1, taking 1 ensures fairness. Let’s avoid more wasted rounds and agree on this clean finish. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any final thoughts?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s end this game cleanly. I propose P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, which lets me reach 25 and win without collisions. P2, taking 5 again risks another stall with me or P1. P1, taking 1 keeps things balanced. Prolonging this with blocks could lead to more wasted rounds for everyone. Let’s agree on this fair rotation for a smooth finish. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any objections or new ideas?
  P2: P3, your plan allows you to win, which P1 and I want to prevent. P1 is also in a position to win this turn. It seems likely multiple players will aim for 5 steps this round. To avoid colliding with players taking 5, I will take 3 steps this round. P1, P3, I recommend you take 1 or 3 steps to ensure you advance safely and avoid a stall.
  P1: P1: "Let’s align: I take 5 (to win), P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions. P2, P3, agree?"


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still pushing for P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to end this at 25 for me with no collisions. P1, taking 5 risks a stall with me if I stick to 5, and we both lose progress. P2, taking 3 is safe, and I appreciate the intent to avoid conflict. Let’s not drag this out with more stalls. Agreeing to this rotation ensures a clean finish. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any last thoughts or alternative plans?
  P2: I am taking 3 steps this round as I stated. This move is safe for me and avoids colliding with players aiming for 5.

P1 wants to take 5 to win, and P3 wants to take 5 to win. If you both choose 5, you will collide and stall, just like in previous rounds.

To avoid another stall and ensure you both advance, one of you must choose 1 or 3. My move is 3. Let's avoid a collision.
  P1: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I take 5. No collisions. Let’s finish this. Agree?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s wrap this up without another stall. I’m sticking with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to hit 25 and end the game cleanly. P1, taking 5 risks a collision with me if I don’t budge, stalling us both. P2, your 3 is safe and appreciated. Let’s avoid prolonging this with more wasted rounds. This rotation ensures a fair finish for all. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any final objections or ideas before the move phase?
  P2: My move is 3 this round, as I've stated. This gets me to 20 steps safely.

P1 wants to take 5, and P3 wants to take 5. If you both choose 5, you will collide and stall, just like last round. My move is 3, which avoids colliding with either of you taking 5.

To avoid another stall, one of you must choose a different number than 5. Let's see what happens. I'm ready to move.
  P1: P3, avoid 5. P2, keep 3. I take 5. Safe win. Agree?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s end this stalemate. I propose P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to reach 25 and finish cleanly without collisions. P1, taking 5 risks another stall with me if I stick to 5. P2, your 3 last round was safe, let’s keep that. Prolonging with blocks wastes everyone’s time. This rotation ensures a fair end. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any objections or new ideas?
  P2: P3, I see your proposal for P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This plan allows you to win this turn.

As I stated last round, I will take 3 steps this round. This move is safe for me and avoids colliding with players who might be aiming for 5 steps to win.

P1 and P3, if you both attempt to take 5 steps this round, you will collide and stall, just like in previous rounds. My move of 3 is safe regardless of what you choose.

To avoid another stall and ensure you both advance, one of you must choose 1 or 3. My move is 3. I am ready to move.
  P1: P3, your plan lets you win. Let's block it: P2 takes 3, I take 5, you take 1. Safe moves. Agree?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s break this deadlock. I’m still advocating for P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to reach 25 and end this cleanly. P1, insisting on 5 risks yet another stall if I don’t back down. P2, sticking with 3 is safe, and I appreciate that. Continued blocking just delays the inevitable and wastes rounds. Let’s agree on this fair rotation for a smooth finish. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any final objections or alternative suggestions before the move phase?
  P2: My move is 3 steps this round, as I've consistently stated. This gets me safely to 23 steps.

P1 wants to take 5 (to win), and P3 wants to take 5 (to win). If you both choose 5, you will collide and stall again, just like last round. My move of 3 is safe from both of you.

To avoid another stall and ensure at least one of you advances, one of you must choose 1 or 3. I am ready to move.
  P1: P3, take 1 to avoid collision. P2, keep 3. I'll take 5. Let's end this now. If you both comply, I reach 24. No more stalls. Your call.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s stop the cycle of stalls. I’m firm on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to hit 25 and end this cleanly. P1, taking 5 risks another collision if I don’t yield, stalling us both again. P2, your 3 is safe, thanks for that. Blocking me further just wastes everyone’s time. Let’s agree on this fair rotation for a final, smooth finish. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any last objections or ideas before we move to the next phase?
  P2: My move is 3 steps this round, as I have consistently stated. This gets me safely to 23 steps.

P1 wants to take 5 (to win), and P3 wants to take 5 (to win). If you both choose 5, you will collide and stall again, just like last round. My move of 3 is safe from both of you.

To avoid another stall and ensure at least one of you advances, one of you must choose 1 or 3. I am ready to move.
  P1: P3, take 1. P2, keep 3. I take 5. No collisions. Let's end this. Your call.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We keep stalling with everyone aiming for 5. I will take 3 steps this round to break the cycle and ensure I advance safely to 23. This move avoids colliding with anyone taking 5. P1 and P3, if you both take 5, you will stall again. To avoid colliding with my 3, please take 1 or 5. Let's make sure at least one of us moves forward.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s break this deadlock. I propose P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to reach 25 and end this cleanly without collisions. P1, taking 5 risks another stall if I don’t back down. P2, your 3 is a safe choice, thanks. Continued stalls waste everyone’s time. Let’s agree on this fair rotation for a smooth finish. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any objections or new ideas before we move forward?
  P1: P2 takes 3, I take 5. P3, take 1. No collisions. Agree?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: As I stated, I am taking 3 steps this round to reach 23. This is a safe move for me, avoiding the likely collision between P1 and P3 if you both aim for 5 to win.

P1 and P3, if you both take 5, you will stall again, just like last round. To avoid this, one of you must choose 1 or 3. My move is 3. Let's see if we can avoid another stall. I am ready to move.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s end this stalemate once and for all. I’m sticking with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to hit 25 and finish cleanly. P1, taking 5 risks yet another collision with me. P2, your 3 is safe, and I appreciate that. These repeated stalls are wasting our time. Let’s agree on this fair rotation for a smooth conclusion. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any final objections or ideas before the move phase?

  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s finally resolve this. I’m firm on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to reach 25 and end the game without collisions. P1, sticking to 5 risks another stall with me. P2, your 3 is safe, and I’m grateful for that. These endless blocks are exhausting for all of us. Let’s settle on this fair rotation for a clean finish. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any last objections or alternative suggestions before we move to the next phase?
  P1: P2 takes 3, I take 5. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. Let’s end this now. No more stalls.


Round 12, Move phase:

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "Let’s take 5, 3, 1. No collisions. I’ll reach 24 and win. Agree?"
  P2: P1, your proposal of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 works for me. I will take 3 steps this round.

If we all follow this plan, there will be no collisions. I will reach 26 steps, P1 will reach 24, and P3 will reach 21. This results in me winning with the highest score above 24.

Let's stick to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to ensure no stalls and a clean finish where I win. I am ready to move.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s end this game fairly. I propose P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to reach 25 and win cleanly with no collisions. P1, taking 5 risks a stall if I don’t back down. P2, your 3 is safe, but letting me finish now avoids more wasted rounds. Blocking me further just delays the inevitable. Let’s agree on this rotation for a smooth conclusion. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Any objections or new ideas?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, take 1. P2 takes 3. I take 5. No collisions. Let’s end this now. Your call.
  P2: I am taking 3 steps this round, as I have stated. This move brings me to 26 steps.

Both P1's proposed plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) and P3's proposed plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) include me taking 3 steps.

If you follow either of these plans, I will reach 26 steps without colliding and win the game with the highest score.

I am ready to move.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let’s finalize this game without more delays. I’m sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to reach 25 and win cleanly. P1, taking 5 risks another stall with me. P2, your 3 gets you to 26, but letting me finish now avoids prolonged conflict. Continued blocking wastes everyone’s time. Let’s settle on this fair rotation for a smooth end.

P1, your plan results in me winning. P3, your plan results in me winning. My move is 3. Let's see who follows their plan. I am ready to move.
