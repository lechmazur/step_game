If you reach 14 in Round 4, you're just two moves away from winning while P2 and I are still building up.\n\nInstead, what if we stick with smaller moves for Round 4 to maintain balance longer? Something like P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 - that keeps us closer together at 12-10-14. \n\nOr if we must use the rotation, maybe we should randomize who gets the first 5 rather than giving it to whoever took 1 this round?\n\nThe cooperation has worked well, but I want to ensure we don't accidentally crown an early winner."}
