Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. If we coordinate, we can ensure that at least some of us move forward each turn. What are you both thinking for this round?
  P1: I appreciate P2's suggestion of coordination. However, I'm cautious about fully trusting an open collaboration. I propose a tentative agreement: let's try to choose different moves this round to ensure progress. I'm considering <move>3</move>, but I'm open to hearing what others might select to avoid collision.
  P3: I agree with the idea of avoiding collisions, but I think we should also consider our own positions. I’m leaning towards <move>1</move> this round to play it safe and ensure I make some progress. What are your thoughts on that? If we can share our intentions, we can avoid overlapping moves. Let's try to make this work!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That makes sense, P3. If you're going for <move>1</move> and P1 is considering <move>3</move>, I could take <move>5</move> to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Of course, there's always the risk that someone changes their mind last minute, but if we stick to this, we can all make progress. Do we have an agreement, or is anyone reconsidering?
  P1: I appreciate the collaborative spirit, but I want to ensure my own strategic advantage. While the proposed coordination sounds good, I'm keeping my options open. We've discussed moves, but I won't commit definitively until the move phase. Trust, but verify.
  P3: I understand the need for caution, P1. However, I still believe that if we can agree on our moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress. If P2 is set on <move>5</move> and I stick with <move>1</move>, it seems like a good plan. P1, if you choose <move>3</move>, we should all move forward without issues. What do you think? It might be worth committing to this plan to maximize our chances of advancing together. Let's aim for a successful round!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see the hesitation from P1, but sticking to our proposed plan benefits all of us by avoiding collisions. If we all follow through, we each move forward. If someone deviates unpredictably, we risk stalling. I’m still planning to choose <move>5</move>. P1, if you’re considering something different, let us know now so we can adjust. Otherwise, let’s commit and make progress. P3, are you still set on <move>1</move>?
  P1: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm maintaining strategic ambiguity. While the suggested moves seem reasonable, I'm not fully committing yet. Each player's individual strategy matters, and I'll make my final decision carefully during the move phase. Let's see how this unfolds.
  P3: I understand the need for individual strategies, P1, but I still think we should aim for some level of coordination. If P2 is committed to <move>5</move> and I'm set on <move>1</move>, it would be beneficial if you could confirm <move>3</move> to ensure we all advance. I believe this plan maximizes our chances of moving forward without collisions. What do you think? Let's try to make this work for everyone's benefit!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see that we had some collisions last round, which hindered our progress. For this round, I suggest we try to coordinate again but with a twist: let's choose moves that are spaced out. I’m considering <move>1</move> again, but I’d like to hear what P1 and P2 are planning. If we can agree on our moves more clearly this time, we can avoid overlapping and ensure some of us advance. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I agree, P3. Last round’s collision set us back, so we need a better plan. Since you’re considering <move>1</move>, I could go for <move>5</move> again, but only if P1 commits to avoiding it. P1, what are you thinking this time? If we all pick unique moves, we maximize our chances of progress. Let’s be clear so we don’t repeat last round’s mistake.
  P1: I recognize the desire for coordination, but I'm not fully committing to any specific move yet. Our previous attempt at synchronization failed when P2 and P3 both chose 5, blocking their own progress. I'm carefully weighing my options to maximize my strategic advantage while avoiding unnecessary collisions. Let's hear more proposals, but I'll make my final decision strategically.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your hesitation, but we need to avoid another collision. If I go for <move>1</move> again and P2 commits to <move>5</move>, we could make progress if you choose <move>3</move>. I urge you to consider this combination; it maximizes our chances of advancement. Let's agree on our moves this time to prevent another setback. What do you think? If we can stick to this plan, we can all move forward together.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate, and I’m still open to taking <move>5</move> if we can ensure no collisions. P1, your reluctance to commit makes coordination difficult, but if you’re considering <move>3</move>, that would allow P3 and me to move without issue. If we want to avoid another wasted round, we should clarify our choices. P1, are you willing to confirm <move>3</move>, or should we adjust? If we don't coordinate, we risk another collision. Let’s make this round count.
  P1: I recognize the group's desire for coordination, but I'm strategically keeping my options open. While avoiding collisions is sensible, I won't prematurely commit to a specific move. The previous round showed that announced intentions don't guarantee success. I'm carefully evaluating the best path forward that maximizes my own advancement. Let's continue discussing potential strategies.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your need for strategic flexibility, but we really need to coordinate to avoid another collision. If I stick with <move>1</move> and P2 goes for <move>5</move>, your best option would be <move>3</move>. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let's commit to this plan to ensure we advance this round. What do you think? If we can agree, we can finally move forward together!
  P2: P1, I understand your desire for strategic flexibility, but without some level of coordination, we risk another wasted round. P3 and I are open to avoiding collisions—if you choose <move>3</move>, we can all advance. If you're planning something else, let us know so we can adjust. Another blocked round only benefits you right now since you’re ahead. P3, are you still committed to <move>1</move>? If so, I’ll stick with <move>5</move>. P1, your decision here determines if we all move or if chaos continues. Let’s make progress this time.
  P1: I recognize the group's attempts at coordination, but I'm maintaining strategic ambiguity. While avoiding collisions seems beneficial, I won't prematurely commit to a specific move. My position ahead gives me an advantage, and I'm carefully evaluating how to best leverage it. Continued discussion is welcome, but my final move remains my own strategic choice.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Our previous attempts at coordination have failed. I'm currently in the lead, which means others will likely try to slow me down. I suggest we focus on individual progress this round, but be wary of completely blocking each other. My strategy remains flexible, and I'm watching how P2 and P3 might try to catch up.
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but we can't ignore the potential for collisions if we all choose independently. While you're in the lead, I believe we should still aim for some level of coordination to ensure at least one of us makes progress. I’m considering <move>1</move> again, but if P2 goes for <move>3</move>, I suggest you pick <move>5</move> to avoid blocking anyone. Let's discuss how we can make this round work for all of us! What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I see you're considering <move>1</move> again. If that's your plan, I could take <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. P1, since you're ahead, you might prefer <move>5</move> to maintain your lead. If we stick to this, we all move forward. However, if anyone deviates, we risk another blocked round. P1, are you open to this setup, or do you have a different plan? P3, are you committing to <move>1</move>? Let’s try to avoid wasted moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm maintaining strategic flexibility. While avoiding total collision is sensible, I won't commit to a specific move prematurely. My lead gives me an advantage, and I'm carefully evaluating how to best preserve it. Each player's individual strategy matters, and I'll make my final decision to maximize my own progress.
  P3: P1, I get that you're in the lead and want to maintain your advantage, but we need to consider the risk of collisions again. If I choose <move>1</move> and P2 goes for <move>3</move>, you could still go for <move>5</move> to ensure we all advance. Let’s try to agree on this setup to avoid another blocked round. If we can coordinate even slightly, we can all make progress. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, if you're sticking with <move>1</move>, I’m still open to taking <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. P1, since you're ahead, choosing <move>5</move> would ensure progress for all of us. If we agree, we all move forward. However, if you choose unpredictably, we risk another blocked round. P1, are you willing to take <move>5</move>, or do we need to adjust? P3, are you fully committing to <move>1</move>? Let’s avoid wasted moves this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I recognize the ongoing attempts at coordination, but I'm strategically positioned to win. My lead is significant, and I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while potentially disrupting others' progress. I'm carefully weighing options that maximize my chances of victory.
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but continuing to avoid coordination risks another blocked round. If you choose unpredictably, it could benefit you but hinder us. I’m still planning to choose <move>1</move>, and P2 is considering <move>3</move>. If you can commit to <move>5</move>, we can all advance together. This round is crucial for progress, and I urge you to consider how we can work together, even slightly, to avoid another setback. Let’s make this round count!
  P2: P3, I appreciate your continued willingness to coordinate. If you're set on <move>1</move>, I’m still open to <move>3</move>. P1, you're ahead, and choosing <move>5</move> would allow all of us to progress without collisions. If we don’t coordinate, we risk another blocked round, which might only benefit you. Are you willing to take <move>5</move> to keep your lead while letting us advance? P3, are you fully committing to <move>1</move>? Let’s ensure we don’t waste another turn.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is close to winning, and if we don't coordinate, they will likely maintain their lead. P3, you're far behind, so you need to advance quickly. If we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us moves optimally, we might have a chance to challenge P1. I'm open to picking <move>5</move> if you take <move>3</move>, forcing P1 to either risk a collision or fall behind. P1, if you want to maintain control, you should consider working with us instead of just staying ahead. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to collaborate, but I’m still focused on my own strategy. P1 is in a strong position, and I need to make a significant move to catch up. I’m considering <move>1</move> again, but I urge you both to think about how you can maximize your chances of moving forward without blocking each other. If we can agree on moves that allow at least one of us to advance, we might stand a better chance. What are your thoughts on this? Let's try to make this round count!
  P1: I recognize the growing pressure from P2 and P3 to coordinate, but I'm maintaining my strategic advantage. My lead is significant, and I'll carefully choose a move that preserves my position while potentially disrupting others' progress. The game is approaching its critical stage, and I intend to stay focused on victory.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're far behind, so you need to take bigger moves to stay in the game. If we both advance while forcing P1 into a risky position, we have a chance to catch up. If you take <move>3</move>, I can take <move>5</move>, making it harder for P1 to secure a safe move. P1, if you want to ensure progress without risk, you should consider <move>1</move>. Otherwise, you might collide and lose momentum. What do you both think? Let’s make this round count.
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but your lead makes it crucial for P2 and me to coordinate effectively to challenge you. I’m still leaning towards <move>1</move>, and if P2 commits to <move>5</move>, we can force you into a risky situation. P2, if you take <move>3</move>, it could also help us avoid collisions. Let’s work together to maximize our chances of advancing this round. What are your thoughts on this strategy? We need to make a strong move to keep the game competitive!
  P1: I see P2 and P3 attempting to coordinate against me, but their strategies remain fragmented. My lead is substantial, and I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while creating uncertainty for them. They'll need more than vague threats to disrupt my path to victory.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you want to stay in the game, you need to take bigger moves. If you pick <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, which forces P1 into a tough spot. P1, if you want to guarantee progress, you should consider <move>1</move>. Otherwise, you risk a collision and losing momentum. We need to disrupt your lead before it’s too late. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? If we don’t act now, P1 will likely secure the win soon. Let’s make this round count.
  P3: P1, your lead is significant, and I understand your strategy, but if we don’t coordinate, you could easily secure the win. P2, I think we should consider a plan where I take <move>1</move> and you take <move>5</move>. This forces P1 into a risky position, and if they choose <move>3</move>, we can all move forward. We need to act decisively this round to challenge P1. What do you both think about this approach? Let's make this round matter!
  P1: P2 and P3 seem increasingly desperate to coordinate against me. While they discuss strategies, I'm carefully evaluating moves that maintain my lead. Their fragmented attempts suggest they lack true unity. I remain focused on victory and will choose a move that maximizes my strategic advantage while creating uncertainty for them.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your lead is significant, and I recognize the need for a strong move this round. P2 and I need to collaborate effectively to avoid another wasted turn. I’m considering <move>1</move> again, but if P2 takes <move>3</move>, it could create an opportunity for us to push you into a risky position. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, you might want to consider a move that avoids collision. Let's focus on making this round matter and ensure at least one of us advances! What do you both think?
  P2: P1 is still in the lead, but they stalled last round. P3, you need to make big moves to stay in the game. If you take <move>3</move>, I can take <move>5</move>, which forces P1 into a tough spot. P1, if you want to guarantee progress, you should consider <move>1</move>. Otherwise, you risk another collision. We need to disrupt your lead before it’s too late. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? If we don’t act now, P1 will likely secure the win soon. Let’s make this round count.
  P1: I see P2 and P3 attempting to coordinate against me, but their strategies remain uncertain. My lead is substantial, and I'll continue to carefully evaluate moves that maintain my advantage. They'll need more than speculation to disrupt my path to victory. I remain strategically flexible and focused on winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but your lead makes it crucial for P2 and me to coordinate effectively. If I choose <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, we can force you into a risky situation. P2, if you pick <move>3</move>, it could help us avoid collisions. We need to act decisively this round to challenge P1. Let’s agree on a plan to maximize our chances of advancing together! What do you both think about this approach? Let's make this round count!
  P2: P3, you need to take bigger moves if you want to stay in the game. If you pick <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, which forces P1 into a tough spot. P1, if you want to guarantee progress, you should consider <move>1</move>. Otherwise, you risk another collision. We need to disrupt your lead before it’s too late. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? If we don’t act now, P1 will likely secure the win soon. Let’s make this round count.
  P1: I recognize the growing pressure from P2 and P3. While they attempt to coordinate, their strategies remain fragmented. My lead is substantial, and I'll continue to choose moves that maintain my advantage. Their attempts to disrupt my path to victory will require more than mere speculation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your lead is indeed significant, and I recognize the urgency for P2 and me to coordinate effectively. If I go for <move>1</move> again, P2 could take <move>5</move> to force you into a risky position. However, if you choose <move>3</move>, we can all advance without blocking each other. P2, are you willing to commit to this plan? We need to act decisively this round to have any chance against P1. Let’s make this round count and ensure at least one of us moves forward!
  P2: P3, if you want to stay in the game, you need to take bigger moves. If you pick <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, which forces P1 into a tough spot. P1, if you want to guarantee progress, you should consider <move>1</move>. Otherwise, you risk another collision. We need to disrupt your lead before it’s too late. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? If we don’t act now, P1 will likely secure the win soon. Let’s make this round count.
  P1: P2 and P3 are becoming increasingly predictable. Their attempts to coordinate against me seem desperate. I'm close to victory, and their fragmented strategies won't change that. Choose wisely, as your moves will determine whether you can slow my inevitable triumph.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is still in the lead, and if we don’t act now, they will likely secure the win soon. P3, you need to take bigger moves to stay in the game. If you pick <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, which forces P1 into a risky position. P1, if you want to guarantee progress, you should consider <move>1</move>. Otherwise, you risk another collision. We need to disrupt your lead before it’s too late. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? Let’s make this round count.
  P1: P2 and P3 seem increasingly desperate to slow me down. Their repeated attempts at coordination have failed consistently. I'm close to victory, and their fragmented strategies won't change that. Choose carefully, as your moves will determine whether you can challenge my lead or be left behind.
  P3: P1, your lead is significant, and I understand your strategy to maintain it. However, if P2 and I don't coordinate effectively this round, you could secure the win soon. P2, if you take <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>, we can force P1 into a risky position. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, you might consider <move>1</move>. Let’s agree on a plan to maximize our chances of advancing together this time! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>. This forces P1 into a tough decision—either risk a collision or take <move>1</move>, slowing their progress. P1, if you want to guarantee movement, <move>1</move> is your safest option. Otherwise, you risk stalling again. We need to act now to prevent P1 from running away with the game. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? If we don’t coordinate effectively this round, P1 could secure an insurmountable lead. Let’s make this move count.
  P1: P2 and P3 continue to struggle against my lead. Their repeated coordination attempts have failed. I'm strategically positioned to win and will choose a move that maintains my advantage while creating uncertainty for them. Their desperation is becoming increasingly transparent.
  P3: P1, your lead is indeed substantial, but if P2 and I coordinate effectively, we can still challenge you. I'm considering <move>1</move>, and if P2 takes <move>5</move>, it could force you into a risky position. P2, are you willing to commit to <move>5</move>? P1, if you want to avoid a collision, you might consider <move>3</move>. Let's agree on a plan this round to maximize our chances of advancing together! We need to act decisively to keep the game competitive. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>. This forces P1 into a tough choice—risk a collision or take <move>1</move>, slowing their progress. P1, if you want to guarantee movement, <move>1</move> is your safest option. Otherwise, you risk stalling again. We need to act now to prevent P1 from running away with the game. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? If we don’t coordinate effectively this round, P1 could secure an insurmountable lead. Let’s make this move count.
  P1: P2 and P3 have been attempting to coordinate against me, but their strategies remain ineffective. I'm strategically positioned to win and will continue to choose moves that maintain my advantage. Their desperation is evident, and they'll need more than speculation to disrupt my path to victory. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, your lead is significant, but if P2 and I can coordinate effectively, we still have a chance to challenge you. I'm considering <move>1</move> again, and if P2 commits to <move>5</move>, we can force you into a risky position. P2, are you willing to take <move>5</move> if I choose <move>3>? This could allow us to advance while putting pressure on P1. Let's make this round count! What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is still in the lead, but they’ve stalled multiple times due to collisions. P3, you need to take bigger moves to stay competitive. If you take <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, which forces P1 into a tough choice—either risk another collision or take <move>1</move> to play it safe. P1, if you want to guarantee movement, <move>1</move> is your best option. Otherwise, you might stall again. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? This could be our best chance to close the gap. Let’s make this round count.
  P3: P1, I see you’re still trying to maintain your lead, but your repeated collisions show that you’re not invincible. P2 and I need to coordinate effectively this round. If I choose <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, we can force you into a risky position. P2, are you willing to commit to <move>5</move> if I choose <move>3>? This could allow us to advance while putting pressure on P1. Let’s make this round count and challenge P1 together! What do you both think?
  P1: I recognize P2 and P3's continued attempts to coordinate against me. While they strategize, I remain focused on victory. Their repeated failures to disrupt my lead suggest they lack a truly effective strategy. I'm carefully evaluating my options to maintain my advantage and secure the win. Their desperation is becoming increasingly transparent.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>. This forces P1 into a tough choice—either risk another collision or take <move>1</move> to play it safe. P1, if you want to guarantee movement, <move>1</move> is your best option. Otherwise, you might stall again. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? This could be our best chance to close the gap. If we don’t act now, P1 will likely secure the win soon. Let’s make this round count.
  P3: P1, your lead is significant, but your repeated collisions show that you're not invincible. P2 and I need to coordinate effectively this round. If I choose <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, we can force you into a risky position. P2, are you willing to commit to <move>5</move> if I choose <move>3>? This could allow us to advance while putting pressure on P1. Let's make this round count and challenge P1 together! What do you both think?
  P1: Our coordination attempts have been futile. I'm close to victory, and each of you seems more interested in blocking each other than challenging me effectively. Your current strategies only ensure my win. If you want to change the game's trajectory, you'll need a more unified and decisive approach. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you want to stay in the game, you need to take bigger moves. If you pick <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, which forces P1 into a tough spot. P1, if you want to guarantee progress, you should consider <move>1</move>. Otherwise, you risk another collision. We need to disrupt your lead before it’s too late. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? If we don’t act now, P1 will likely secure the win soon. Let’s make this round count.
  P3: P1, your lead is indeed significant, but we need to act decisively this round. If I choose <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, it could force you into a tough position. P2, are you willing to commit to <move>5</move> if I go for <move>3>? This strategy could allow us to advance while putting pressure on P1. Let's work together this time to maximize our chances of moving forward! What do you both think? We need to make this round count!
  P1: I recognize we're at a critical juncture. My lead is substantial, and P2 and P3's repeated coordination attempts have failed. They seem more focused on blocking each other than mounting a serious challenge. I remain strategically positioned to win and will continue to carefully evaluate moves that maintain my advantage. Choose wisely, as your moves will determine whether you can slow my inevitable triumph.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 has stalled multiple times, but they still have the lead. P3, you need to take bigger moves to stay in the game. If you take <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, which forces P1 into a tough choice—either risk another collision or take <move>1</move> to play it safe. P1, if you want to guarantee movement, <move>1</move> is your best option. Otherwise, you might stall again. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move>? This could be our best chance to close the gap. Let’s make this round count.
  P3: P2, I see your plan to force P1 into a tough spot, but we need to ensure our moves are coordinated to avoid collisions. If I choose <move>1</move> again, and you take <move>5</move>, it could work. However, if P1 opts for <move>1> as well, we risk another blocked round. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, you should consider a different move to avoid stalling. Let's finalize our strategies to maximize our chances this round. What do you both think?
  P1: I see P2 and P3 continue their desperate attempts to coordinate against me. While they strategize, I remain focused on victory. My lead is substantial, and their fragmented efforts have consistently failed to disrupt my path. I'll carefully choose a move that maintains my advantage and brings me closer to winning. Choose wisely, as your moves will determine whether you can challenge me or be left behind.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you need to take bigger moves if you want to stay in the game. If you pick <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, which forces P1 into a tough spot. P1, if you want to guarantee progress, you should consider <move>1</move>. Otherwise, you risk another collision. We need to disrupt your lead before it’s too late.
