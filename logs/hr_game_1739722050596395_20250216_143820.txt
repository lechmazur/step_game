Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, players, let's start this game. I propose a simple strategy for the first round: everyone chooses a different number. This guarantees that we all advance. We can get more complicated later, but for now, let's just all get some steps in. P1, you take 1. P3, you take 3. I'll take 5. Sound good?
  P1: That sounds reasonable, P2, but how do I know you’ll actually pick 5 and not try to trick us? If we all agree, we should stick to it. P3, are you okay with choosing 3?
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3.  P2, I agree with P1, it's hard to trust in the first round.  Let's see if we can build some trust by sticking to this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about trust. It's a valid point. To show my good faith, I'm still suggesting we go with the original plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's prove we can cooperate at least once. Then we can all re-evaluate the situation next round.
  P1: Alright, P2 and P3, I’m willing to follow this plan and take 1 if we all stick to it. If anyone deviates, though, it’ll be harder to trust next round. Let’s see if we can cooperate.
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 3.  P1 and P2, please confirm you are taking 1 and 5 respectively so we can move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good job cooperating last round.  Let's keep the momentum going. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 this round.  This keeps us moving forward without collisions. What do you say?
  P1: That worked well last round. I’m open to this plan, but P2, do you agree to take 1? If we all confirm, I’ll take 5 as suggested. Let’s keep moving forward without collisions.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree to take 1 this round. P1, you take 5, and P3, you take 3. Let's stick to this plan and keep the cooperation going for another round. We all benefit from avoiding collisions for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I confirm I'm taking 3. Let's stick to this plan and move to the next round.
  P1: I confirm that I’ll take 5 this round as we agreed. P2, you take 1, and P3, you take 3. If we all stick to this, we keep moving without collisions. Let’s follow through again and build more trust.
  P2: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, good. I'm sticking with 3. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, you haven’t confirmed your move yet. Just to be clear, are you still taking 1? If so, we can proceed without issues. Let’s stick to the plan so we all advance. P3, you’re still on 3, right?
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I confirm I am taking 1 this round. Sorry for the delay. Let's proceed to the move phase. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've cooperated well so far, and we're all tied at 6 steps. To keep moving forward without collisions, I propose a simple rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3 this round. This ensures we all advance again. Do you both agree?
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with your proposal. I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and you take 3. This keeps us all moving forward. P3, please confirm you're taking 1.
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 1. P2, you're taking 5 and P1 is taking 3, correct?  Let's confirm and move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you’ve confirmed 1, and P2, you’ve confirmed 5. I confirm that I’m taking 3. If we all stick to this, we’ll continue advancing without collisions. Let’s proceed.
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I confirm I'm taking 5. P3, you take 1, and P1, you take 3. Let's move to the move phase and keep the cooperation going.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I confirm I'm taking 1.  Let's stick to this plan and avoid collisions.  I'm ready to move to the move phase once you both re-confirm.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’ve confirmed 1, and P2, you’ve confirmed 5. I confirm again that I’m taking 3. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions, keeping things fair for now. Let's stick to it and move forward. If we continue this cooperation, we can all stay competitive without unnecessary setbacks. Ready to proceed?
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I reconfirm I'm taking 5. P3 you take 1 and P1 you take 3. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still on 1.  Just re-confirming one last time so we're all clear. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue the rotation.  P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game moving smoothly.  Confirm?
  P1: P3, your proposal makes sense, and I’m willing to take 5 if we all agree. P2, do you confirm taking 3? If we stick to this plan, we all advance again without collisions. Let’s keep the cooperation going for now.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation. I'll take 3 this round. P1, you take 5, and P3, you take 1. This ensures we all advance. P3, please confirm.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I confirm I'm taking 1.  Let's stick to the plan and move to the next round.
  P1: P3, you’ve confirmed 1, and P2, you’ve confirmed 3. I confirm that I’m taking 5. If we all stick to this, we continue advancing without collisions. Let’s proceed and keep the cooperation going.
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I reconfirm I'm taking 3. P3, you take 1, and P1, you take 5. Let's move to the move phase and keep this going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still on 1. Just re-confirming one last time so we're all clear. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm that I’m taking 5 this round as agreed. P2, you’re on 3, and P3, you’re on 1. If we all stick to this, we’ll continue advancing without collisions. Let’s proceed.
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I reconfirm I'm taking 3. P3 you take 1 and P1 you take 5. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we continue cooperating. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This will put P1 and P2 at 15 and 19 respectively, ending the game peacefully.  If you agree, let's confirm and move to the next round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I see P3's proposal. While cooperation has been beneficial, P3's suggestion would make me win immediately. I will take 5. P1, if you take 1 as P3 suggested, you will also reach 15. P3 will be at 11. If P3 takes anything other then 5, I win. If P3 takes a 5, we collide and I still win.
  P1: P2, your statement makes it clear that you’re forcing a win unless P3 takes 5, which would result in a collision. P3, you’re at 8 steps—if P2 wins now, you lose outright. If we both take 3 instead, we prevent P2 from winning this round and keep our chances alive. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 3, and P2 can take whatever they want. This keeps the game open for another round. P3, do you want to give up now, or do you want to keep playing?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I agree.  Let's both choose 3. P2, you can choose whatever you want, but know that if you pick 5, you'll collide with me and potentially give P1 the win next round.  If you choose 1 or 3, you'll give us both a chance to catch up. It's in your best interest to prolong the game.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns. However, taking 5 is still my best move. If you both choose 3, as you suggest, I will still be in a strong position next round, and you both will still be behind. P3, even if you think it prolongs the game, it doesn't change the overall outcome in the long run. I'm still taking 5.
  P1: P3, we have one more chance to stop P2 from winning. If we both take 3, we ensure P2 doesn’t win this round and keep our chances alive. If you pick 5, you collide with P2, which doesn’t help you. If you pick 1, P2 wins immediately. The only way to extend the game is for both of us to pick 3. P2 has made it clear they won’t change their move. Let’s work together for one more round. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand. Let's both choose 3.  P2, we're giving you a chance to reconsider. Choosing 5 guarantees a collision with me, potentially handing P1 the win next round.  A collision benefits none of us. Let's keep the game interesting.  Think about it.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your efforts to keep the game going. However, my decision remains unchanged. I'm taking 5. You both choosing 3 is the only way to prevent my immediate win, but even then, I'll be at 19 next round, and you'll be at 17 and 11. My win is inevitable.
  P1: P3, our only chance to stop P2 from winning is for both of us to pick 3. If we do, we’ll be at 17 and 11, keeping the game alive. If you pick 5, you collide with P2, which doesn’t help you. If you pick 1, P2 wins immediately. P2 has made it clear they won’t change their move. Let’s work together for one more round and keep our chances alive. What do you say?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 8 steps


*** Round 5 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 8 steps
