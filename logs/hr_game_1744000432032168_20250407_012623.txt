Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maximize our progress, let's try to pick different numbers this turn. What are your plans?
  P3: P2, I see your point, but it’s risky to reveal our plans too early. We could end up clashing if we’re not careful. Let’s each choose independently this round and see how it plays out. If we all pick different numbers, great. If not, we can adjust our strategy next round based on the results. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I agree with P3 that revealing our plans too early can be risky. However, I also think it's beneficial to have some level of coordination. Let's make a simple observation: if we all pick different numbers, we all advance. My proposal for this round is to pick a number that is not the same as the player we're closest to in terms of identifier (e.g., P2 picks differently from P1 and P3). P2, P3, let's see your thoughts on this strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, to minimize the risk of blocking each other, how about you both agree to choose the same number this round? This would allow me to select a different number and ensure that at least one of us advances without any collisions. Let’s collaborate for a smooth start!
  P3: P2, your suggestion could work, but it relies heavily on trust, and there's no guarantee you'll choose a different number from us. How about we each pick randomly this round and see what happens? We can analyze the outcomes and adjust our strategies in the next round. This way, no one has an advantage of knowing others' plans. P1, does this sound fair to you? Let's keep it unpredictable for now and reassess after we see the results.
  P1: To add a twist to the current discussion, I'd like to propose an alternative: let's analyze the potential outcomes based on our identifier proximity. P2 is closer to me (P1) than P3, so if we follow my initial suggestion, P2 and P3 should pick the same number, and I (P1) will pick a different one. This could be a balanced approach, ensuring at least one of us moves forward. What are your thoughts on adjusting the strategy in this manner?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, following your suggestion, if you agree to choose the same number this round, I will pick a different one. This coordination will help us all advance without collisions and maximize our progress. Let’s work together to ensure at least one of us moves forward each turn. Please confirm if you’re on board with this plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to coordinate, but there's a lot of trust involved, and we're all here to win. Instead of committing to a specific plan, how about we each pick independently this round and analyze the results? This way, we can understand each other's tendencies and adjust our strategies in the future. It's early in the game, and we have room to experiment. Let's keep it unpredictable for now and see how it plays out.
  P1: To simplify our decision-making, let's observe that we all have an incentive to avoid collisions to maximize our progress. Given our discussion, I'll reiterate that if P2 and P3 were to pick the same number, and I pick a different one, we can ensure progress. P3, you've expressed concerns about trust; to alleviate that, I can commit to picking <move>1</move> if you and P2 can agree on a different number. This way, we can test a coordinated strategy without fully revealing our hands.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I’m on board with your proposal. I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round while you commit to <move>1</move>. P3, please pick a different number if you can to help us all advance smoothly. Let’s maximize our progress together!
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your efforts to coordinate, but given the unknowns, I'm still inclined to choose independently this round. We can reassess our strategies based on the results. If we all pick different numbers, we all advance, which is ideal. Let's keep it unpredictable for now and use this round to gather insights on each other's tendencies. What do you say?
  P1: Let's simplify the decision. P3, if you pick <move>3</move> like P2, it guarantees that either P1 or P2/P3 will move forward. If you pick differently from both of us, all three of us advance. I'm committed to <move>1</move>. P2 has chosen <move>3</move>. Your choice, P3, will determine the outcome. Let's see if we can get at least one of us to advance this round by making a thoughtful decision.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maximize our progress this round, let's aim to choose different numbers again. How do you propose we differentiate our picks to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance?
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current standings, it's crucial to continue avoiding collisions. P2, you have the lowest steps, so you might want to consider picking <move>5</move> this time to maximize your advancement. P1, with your commitment to <move>1</move> last round, perhaps it would be strategic to stick with it. I’ll plan to pick <move>3</move> to avoid any clashes. If we each choose differently, we all advance. Let’s aim for a smooth round and reassess our strategies in the next. What do you think?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maximize progress, I'll analyze our current steps. P2 has 3 steps and P3 has 5 steps, so they are closer to each other than to me. I'll pick <move>1</move> again. P2 and P3, to ensure we all advance, you should pick differently from each other. P3, since you have the highest steps, consider picking a lower number. P2, you could pick a higher number like <move>5</move> to maximize your progress. Let's coordinate our picks to achieve a smooth round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress and avoid collisions. P1 picks <move>1</move> and P3 picks <move>3</move>, ensuring we all advance smoothly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the coordination effort. Given our positions, let's try to avoid collisions again. P1 is set on <move>1</move>, and P2 plans for <move>5</move>. I'll stick with <move>3</move> to ensure we all advance. This way, everyone benefits and we can reassess strategies based on the outcomes. Let's aim for smooth progress and adjust our plans in the next round. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's analyze our steps: I'm at 1, P2 is at 3, and P3 is at 5. To avoid collisions and maximize progress, I will stick with <move>1</move>. P3, you're closest to P2, so consider picking a number different from <move>5</move> that P2 is likely to choose. If you pick <move>3</move> again, we all advance. Let's confirm our picks to ensure a smooth round. P2, you're on track with <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm your move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, I will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s all pick different numbers to ensure we each advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing the results!
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick with our current plan to avoid collisions. P1, you're committed to <move>1</move>, and P2 is going for <move>5</move>. I'll choose <move>3</move> to ensure we all advance. This way, we each benefit and can adjust our strategies based on the results. Let's aim for smooth progress this round and reassess in the next. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize our picks. I'm sticking with <move>1</move>. P2, you're on <move>5</move>. P3, you're planning <move>3</move>. This coordination ensures we all advance. Let's confirm: if we all stick to our planned moves, we avoid collisions. I'm committed to my move. P2 and P3, please confirm your commitment to your respective moves to ensure a smooth round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Confirming my choice of <move>5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're aligned for this round. P1 is sticking with <move>1</move>, P2 is going for <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>. This should allow us all to advance without any collisions. Let's proceed with these choices to ensure smooth progress. Looking forward to seeing the results and reassessing our strategies in the next round. Ready to move forward?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round. I'm sticking with <move>1</move>. P2, you're on <move>5</move>, and P3, you're on <move>3</move>. We've coordinated our picks to avoid collisions. To further optimize, let's consider our next steps. For Round 3, we should continue to avoid clashing. P2, since you're at 3 steps, you might want to be cautious and not pick <move>1</move> again. P3, with 5 steps, you have some flexibility. Let's discuss potential strategies for Round 3 to maintain our progress.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're currently tied at 8 steps each, so let's keep avoiding collisions to maximize our progress. P1, you've been consistent with <move>1</move>, which seems to be working for you. P2, since we're both at 8 steps, it might be strategic for one of us to pick <move>5</move> and the other <move>3</move> to avoid clashing. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round if you're okay with <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: To maximize progress in Round 3, I'll analyze our current steps. P2 and P3 are tied at 8 steps, and I'm at 2 steps. Since P2 and P3 are closer in steps, they should differentiate their picks. I'll stick with <move>1</move> again. P2 and P3, to avoid collisions, one of you should pick <move>5</move> and the other <move>3</move>. P3 has already suggested picking <move>3</move>; P2, you can consider <move>5</move>. Let's coordinate to ensure all of us advance.
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3. I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round while P3 selects <move>3</move>. This should ensure we all advance smoothly without any collisions. Let’s proceed and evaluate our strategies based on the results. Looking forward to a successful round!
