I\u2019m firm on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to hit 25 and win cleanly. P1, taking 5 risks a collision with me again. P2, your 3 gets you to 26, but agreeing to my plan ends this now without more conflict. Let\u2019s not drag this out endlessly. This rotation ensures a fair finish. I\u2019m ready to proceed if we\u2019re aligned. Any final objections before the move phase?"}
