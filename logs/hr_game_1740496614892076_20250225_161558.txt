Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! I think our best approach is to avoid collisions so we all make progress. Since there are three of us and three move options, we could each pick different numbers. Though I'm not sure how to decide who picks what. Any suggestions? Otherwise we might all go for 5 and get nowhere.
  P1: Yes, P2, that sounds like a smart idea to avoid collisions. How about this for Round 1: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5?  That way we can all move forward and see how things play out. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Alright, I’m fine with that plan. I’ll choose 5 if you two stick to choosing 1 and 3. Let’s see if we can trust each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with this plan for the first round. I'll go with 3 as suggested. This way we all move forward without collision. For future rounds, should we consider rotating our choices (like P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 next round) to keep things fair? That way everyone gets a chance at different step values. But let's start with this arrangement and see how it goes.
  P1: Sounds good everyone. Let's stick with the plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Ready to move to the move phase.
  P3: I’m still on board. Let’s trust one another and stick to P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and me choosing 5 for this first turn. Then we’ll see how well that works and discuss where to go next.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm also ready to move forward with our agreed plan. I'll stick with choosing 3 for this round as we discussed. Looking forward to seeing how this coordination works out!
  P1: Sounds like we are all set for this round. Let's proceed with moves as agreed: P1 will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 5.
  P3: I’m still comfortable following our plan for this first round. Let’s move forward as agreed and then see where that puts us afterward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Nice job, everyone. Maybe we can rotate to keep it fair: P1 chooses 3 this round, P2 chooses 5, and I’ll take 1. This way, everyone gets a higher value in subsequent turns. What do you both think?
  P2: I think rotating is a fair approach, P3! I'm happy to choose 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and you take 1. This way we each get different step values over time and nobody gets stuck with the smallest move repeatedly. It keeps the game balanced and gives us all a chance to advance steadily. I'll go with 5 this round if everyone agrees.
  P1: Sounds good, P2 and P3. I agree to the rotation and will choose 3 this round. Let's keep this rotation going for a few rounds to see how balanced it is.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm still fine with that rotation for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll stick with 1. Let’s finalize that plan for Round 2 and reassess our positions afterward.
  P2: I'm happy with our rotation plan for this round. If we continue this pattern in future rounds (next round would be P1→5, P2→1, P3→3), it creates a balanced progression. Everyone gets fair access to different move values. I'm ready to proceed with choosing 5 this round as we discussed. Does that continued rotation sound good to everyone for future planning?
  P1: Yes, the continued rotation sounds good to me for now. Let's stick with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round and see how positions change. We can discuss further rotations after this round if needed.  Ready for moves when you are.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still good with our rotation plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll stick with 1. Let’s finalize that for Round 2 and see where we stand afterward. If everything goes smoothly, we can keep rotating next time.
  P2: I'm good with our rotation plan for this round. I'll take 5 as agreed. After this, I'll be at 8 steps, P1 at 4, and P3 at 6. The rotation is working well for all of us so far - let's continue with it next round too (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3). I'm ready to proceed with the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set on the rotation for this round and next. P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1 for this round. And for round 3, we'll shift to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.  Ready to make our moves for round 2!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m comfortable continuing our rotation this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. That keeps our agreed schedule intact and helps us avoid collisions. Let’s finalize that plan and see how it plays out.
  P2: Yes, I'll honor our rotation: I'll pick 1 this round while P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 3. Interestingly, this will put all of us at exactly 9 steps after this round - a perfect three-way tie! That makes the next round quite strategic. Should we continue rotating after we're all tied, or would anyone prefer a different approach? I'm open to suggestions, but I'll stick with our current plan of me taking 1 for this round.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, rotation still sounds good for this round. Let's all get to 9 steps as planned. After this round, since we'll all be tied, maybe we should discuss if we want to change strategy for the rounds after that.  For now, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3 for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That works for me as well. Let’s all commit to this rotation for now: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I’ll choose 3. We’ll hit 9 steps each and keep things balanced. After this round, we can decide together if we want to continue with the rotation or adjust our strategy. Let’s finalize that plan and move to the next phase.
  P2: I'll stick with our plan – I'll take 1 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. It's interesting that we'll all be tied at 9 steps afterward! For the next round, perhaps we should continue rotating (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5)? That would be fair, though I'm open to other suggestions after we're all tied. For now, let's finalize this round as planned.
  P1: Yes, continuing the rotation for round 4 sounds good. So for round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's stick with the plan for this round first (round 3): P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still comfortable sticking with our rotation for this round. Let’s all aim for 9 steps and see how that sets up the next round. Once we’re tied, we can discuss whether to continue rotating or try something different. Let’s finalize this plan now.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with our plan: I'll choose 1 this round so we all reach 9 steps. After that, we've agreed to continue rotating for round 4 (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5), which seems fair. Let's finalize this round and see where we stand afterward.
  P1: Sounds good everyone. Let's finalize round 3 as planned, and then we can decide together what to do for round 4 after we see the updated positions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Yes, rotation for round 4 still makes sense to keep things balanced for now. Let's continue with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 as we discussed.  After this round, since we will likely be at different positions, we should probably discuss how to proceed to try and win individually. What do you think?
  P3: Yes, I’m still good with our rotation for Round 4. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. That way we avoid collisions and keep progressing. Then let’s revisit the plan afterward. I’m curious if continuing rotation will still be fair once the steps aren’t equal. Let’s commit and move on.
  P2: I agree with continuing our rotation for this round. I'll take 3 steps as planned while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This keeps our coordination intact. After this round, our positions will be different (P1=10, me=12, P3=14), so we should definitely revisit our strategy then. The game will become more competitive as we get closer to 24 steps, but for now let's follow through with our agreed plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all in agreement on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round to continue the rotation. Let's make our moves and then discuss how we want to play rounds 5 and onwards, since we will be at different positions then and need to start thinking about winning.
  P3: I’m still on board with the rotation for this round. Let’s confirm P1=1, P2=3, and I’ll do 5. Afterward, we’ll be at different positions, so we should think carefully about whether to continue rotating or switch strategies. We don’t want to collide and lose ground. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: I'm still committed to our rotation plan for this round (me taking 3). To keep things fair, what if we rotate one more time after this? For Round 5, we could do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This maintains our system while acknowledging different positions. After that point, we'll be getting closer to the 24-step threshold, so we should reconsider strategy then. Does that sound reasonable to everyone?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, P2, rotating one more round for Round 5 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) sounds good to me.  Let's stick with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round (Round 4) as planned, and then rotate to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for Round 5. After Round 5, we should definitely discuss how to proceed individually to try and win, as we'll be getting closer to the finish line.
  P3: I’m happy to finalize the plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, and I’ll choose 5. Then we’ll rotate next round as suggested—P1=3, P2=5, and I’ll pick 1. After that, we should definitely rethink things based on our positions, because as we get closer to 24, each move matters more. Let’s proceed now.
  P2: I'm still committed to our plan for Round 4 - I'll choose 3 while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. And I agree with rotating once more for Round 5 as we discussed. After that, we'll be at P1=13, me=17, and P3=15, getting closer to the 24-step threshold. Let's finalize our moves for this round and proceed with the rotation.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, confirming rotation for this round: P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. Let's stick to this plan for Round 5 as agreed. After this round, we should definitely discuss our individual strategies for winning, as we are getting closer to the finish line.
  P3: I’m still okay with picking 1 this round. After that, we should talk about whether we keep rotating or try a new approach as we get closer to 24. Let me know if you have any changes in mind for this round, or if we’re all set to stick with P1=3, P2=5, and me=1.
  P2: I'm still on board with our rotation plan for this round - I'll take 5 while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. After this round, I'll be at 17 steps, closest to the finish line. Since we're getting closer to 24, we should probably discuss a fair way to proceed for the remaining rounds. Let's lock in this round's plan first, then think about what makes sense for the endgame.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, let's stick to the rotation for this round (P1 will choose 3). After this round, since we are getting closer to 24 and have different positions, we should probably stop rotating and think about how to win individually. What do you both think about that?
  P3: I’m still happy taking 1 this round. After that, we could continue our rotation for another round or so to avoid collisions. But as we inch closer to 24, each of us will be aiming to secure our own win. If anyone has a new plan to help avoid wasted turns, I’d be open to hearing it. For now, let’s finalize Round 5 as agreed, then check our positions and decide how to proceed for the victory. What do you think?
  P2: I'll stick with choosing 5 this round as agreed. After this round, I'll be at 17 steps, P3 at 15, and P1 at 13. Interestingly, if we rotated once more after this, we'd all end up at 18 steps (tied again!). We should definitely discuss our endgame strategy after this round, but I wanted to point out this interesting possibility. Let's finalize our plan for now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, let's proceed with the rotation for this round as planned: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.  After this round, we will all be closer to the finish line, and it will be a good time to stop rotating and start focusing on our individual paths to victory. Let's make our moves for this round and then discuss next steps.
  P3: Let’s finalize this round with P1=3, P2=5, and me=1. Afterward, we can decide if we keep rotating or switch tactics. If we do one more rotation, we all could end up tied at 18, which is interesting. I’m open to that or trying something else—whatever helps avoid collisions and keeps our chances strong. Any thoughts?
  P2: I'm confirmed for taking 5 this round as planned. After this, we'd have P1=13, me=17, and P3=15. I find it interesting that one more rotation would put us all at 18 steps (tied again!). We could consider that or discuss other endgame strategies after this round. Let's finalize our current plan and proceed with the moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, round 5 was a bit of a mess with the collision.  Now that we are closer to the finish line, what are your thoughts on how we should play from here to avoid more collisions but also try to win? Are we still thinking about rotation, or should we switch to individual strategies?
  P2: Well, that didn't go as planned! Looks like we all went for 5 instead of following our rotation. Since we're getting closer to the finish line (P3 at 14, me at 12, P1 at 10), trust is becoming harder. I think we need clarity to avoid more collisions. What if P1 takes 3, I take, 5, and P3 takes 1 this round? This would advance everyone while keeping relative positions. Thoughts on this or other approaches?
  P3: It’s risky to keep colliding. Since I’m at 14 steps, I propose we avoid another clash by distributing our moves carefully. One idea: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, nobody collides and we all progress. How does that sound? If you have other ideas, I’m open to hearing them, but let’s select something we can trust to avoid wasted turns.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your idea of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round sounds good to me. It allows us all to make progress without collision. Let's try that for Round 6.
  P2: Thanks for agreeing to my plan, P1! P3, I notice you've proposed a different arrangement, but P1 has already agreed to my suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). This keeps us all moving forward and maintains our relative positions fairly. Given that we all collided last round, I think it's important we reach a clear consensus this time. Would you be willing to go with this plan to ensure we all advance? It's critical we avoid another round with no progress.
  P3: I’m open to avoiding another collision, but I still believe P1=1, P2=3, and me=5 is our safest bet for distinct moves. However, if both of you insist on P1=3, P2=5, and me=1, I’ll agree just to ensure all of us advance this round. Let’s finalize one arrangement and stick to it so we don’t waste another turn. What’s your final decision?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P3, since P2 and I are both leaning towards P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round to avoid another collision, are you also willing to agree to this plan for Round 6? Let's make sure we all move forward this time.
  P2: I appreciate your flexibility, P3. Let's finalize our plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This arrangement allows all of us to make progress after our collision last round. I'm committed to choosing 5, which will put me at 17 steps. After this round, we'll need to reassess since we'll be getting closer to the finish line. Let's avoid another wasted turn and stick with this agreed plan.
  P3: Alright, if that’s what you both prefer, I’ll go along with P1=3, P2=5, and me=1 this round. Let’s finalize that now and avoid another collision. Then we can reassess our strategies afterward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: That was a rough collision last round. Let’s avoid another by picking distinct moves. How about: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I’ll choose 5? That way, nobody collides and we all make progress. Afterward, we can discuss endgame strategies more carefully. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P2: I'm concerned about P3's suggestion. If we follow that plan, P3 would be at 19 steps - just 5 steps from winning. Instead, I propose: P1 chooses 3, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1. This creates a more balanced position (P1=16, me=17, P3=15) and avoids anyone getting too far ahead. After our recent collisions, we need a plan everyone can trust. This arrangement keeps the game competitive while ensuring we all make progress.
  P1: P2, your proposal of P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 for this round seems like a good way to ensure we all progress and avoid collisions again. It also keeps the step counts relatively close. I agree with this plan for Round 7. P3, what are your thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see why you’re both concerned about me jumping ahead. Fine, I’ll pick 1 this round if it means we all avoid another collision. Let’s finalize P1=3, P2=5, and me=1, then reassess afterward to find a path to victory for each of us.
  P2: I appreciate your cooperation, P3. Let's stick with our agreed plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. These past collisions have cost us all progress, so it's in everyone's interest to follow through this time. This arrangement will keep us all within a competitive range (putting me at 17, P1 at 16, and P3 at 15). The game is still balanced for everyone, and we can all make strategic decisions next round as we approach the finish line.
  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3, let's lock in P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 for this round as agreed to avoid collisions. Ready to move to the move phase when you are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I’ll stick to our agreement for this round: P1=3, P2=5, and I’ll take 1. Let’s make sure we avoid another collision and all move forward. After this, we should see where we stand and discuss a path to victory for each of us. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan: I'll choose 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. After our past collisions, it's crucial we all follow through this time. This arrangement keeps us balanced (putting me at 17, P1 at 16, and P3 at 15) as we approach endgame. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Sounds good everyone, let's execute on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round.  Hopefully this avoids collisions and we can all make progress. Ready for moves when you are.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all close to 24 now, so collisions hurt us more than ever. Let’s coordinate distinct moves again to ensure everyone advances. For instance, P1 could pick 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll choose 3 this round. That way, nobody collides and we stay competitive. What do you think?
  P1: Yes, P3, that sounds like a good plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress.  Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round.  Avoiding another collision is crucial at this stage.
  P2: I understand the desire to keep rotating, but this plan puts P1 far ahead at 21 steps while leaving us behind. Since we're approaching the finish line, I suggest a different arrangement: I take 3 steps, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This would result in P1=17, me=20, and P3=20, keeping the race competitive rather than giving any player a major advantage. We all advance, avoid collisions, and maintain a balanced game. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, P2, I’ll go along with your suggestion this round: P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I pick 5. That puts us both at 20 steps while P1 is at 17. Next round, we’ll need to coordinate carefully to avoid collisions in the final push toward 24. I’m ready to finalize this plan if P1 agrees.
  P1: Okay, P3 and P2, I'm fine with P3's initial suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round. Let's make these moves to ensure we all progress and avoid another collision.  It's crucial we make every move count at this stage.
  P2: I see there's confusion in our plans. P1, please reconsider - if you take 5 steps, you'll be at 21 and likely win next round. My suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) keeps the game competitive and P3 has already agreed to it. This arrangement puts myself and P3 at 20 steps while you stay in reach at 17, giving everyone a fair chance to win. Let's finalize this more balanced approach to avoid another collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your plan risks giving you an almost guaranteed win next round. It’s fairer if we stay closer together, so I agree with P2’s proposal: P1=1, P2=3, and I’ll take 5. That puts both P2 and me at 20, with you at 17, keeping us all competitive. Let’s finalize this and avoid further collisions.
  P1: I understand P2's concern, but getting to 21 puts me in a strong winning position for the next round.  Let's stick with P3's initial suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. It ensures we all move forward and avoids another collision.
  P2: P1, please reconsider. If you take 5 steps, you'll be at 21 and need just 3 more to win next round. P3 and I would be forced to choose 5+ next round to catch up, likely causing collisions. P3 has already agreed to my plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), which keeps the game competitive. If you're not willing to compromise, we may all end up stuck in more collisions. Let's finalize a plan we can all trust.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you are closest to winning. To avoid collisions and ensure we all progress, how about this round: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3? This way, no one is blocked, and we can reassess next round. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but since I'm at 20 steps, I'm aiming to win this round. I propose choosing 5 to reach the winning threshold. P1 could take 3 and P3 could take 1 - this avoids collisions and allows everyone to progress. Alternatively, if you both want to block me, you're welcome to try, but remember that creates a risk of collision between yourselves. I'm closest to the finish line and intend to capitalize on my advantage.
  P3: P2 is poised to win if we let them take 5 unblocked. We should coordinate to prevent an outright win this round. One option: if P1 also picks 5, we force a collision with P2 if they choose 5, so nobody advances. Another option: persuade P2 to choose fewer steps so we all keep a chance. I’m fine picking anything that helps us avoid a direct loss this turn. How do you both want to proceed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I agree we should prevent P2 from winning this round.  Let's both pick 5. If P2 also picks 5, no one moves, but P2 doesn't win. If P2 picks less than 5, we still block P2 from winning and have a chance next round.  Are you with me on both picking 5 to block P2 this round?
  P2: I see you're planning to block me by both choosing 5. While that stops me immediately, it creates a three-way collision where nobody advances - we all lose a turn. Instead, what if I choose 3 this round (putting me at 23), P1 chooses 1, and P3 chooses some other number? Everyone advances, and you both stay in the game. A collision benefits nobody. Let's be strategic rather than destructive - I'm willing to delay my win by one round if it means we all make progress.
  P3: P2, if you take 3 now and reach 23, you can easily pick 1 next turn to win. That leaves P1 and me with little chance. I’d rather we keep the game balanced. Maybe we both pick 5 to risk blocking you if you also choose 5, or we find another distribution that keeps everyone competitive. Let’s settle a plan we all trust.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, yes I agree, let's both pick 5 to block P2 from winning this round.  P2, to be clear, I will be picking 5 this round to prevent you from winning immediately. If you also pick 5, nobody moves, but you don't win. Let's see what you choose.
  P2: I see you're both determined to choose 5 to block me. That's your right, though it leads to a stalemate where nobody advances. If I don't pick 5, one of you wins instead of me. I have to consider what gives me the best chance to win. Remember that a three-way collision benefits nobody - we all lose a turn while getting closer to the finish line. I'll make my move accordingly.
  P3: P2, if you won’t back down from taking 5, I see no choice but for P1 and me to both pick 5 and collide with you. That stalls us all, but it also stops you from winning outright. If you’d prefer a deal that lets everyone advance, propose something less aggressive. Otherwise, I’m prepared to collide this turn.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, if you try to use 5 again, I’ll also pick 5, causing a collision so you can’t win. No sense wasting a turn. Let’s avoid that by splitting our moves. For example, if P1 chooses 3, you choose 1, and I choose 5, nobody collides and we all advance. That way you’re not giving me a collision reason. P1 also gets to move forward without risking a wasted turn. I’m open to other distributions so long as nobody’s guaranteed an unblocked 5 at 20. Let’s settle on something we can all trust. What do you say?
  P1: P3, to prevent you from winning this round, I will pick 5. P2, are you also planning to pick 5 to block P3? If P3 chooses 5, a collision will prevent anyone from winning immediately, and we can reassess next round.
  P2: I see the current situation clearly. If I try for 5 now, both of you might block me with 5s, causing a collision where nobody advances. That helps no one. Instead, I'll choose 3 this round, putting me at 23. P1, you're clearly planning to block P3 with a 5, which leaves you two to potentially collide. I suggest P3 consider a smaller move to avoid the collision. We're all trying to win, but wasting turns with three-way collisions only prolongs the game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s avoid another collision. If P2 really intends to pick 3, then P1 can pick 5, and I’ll pick 1 so we all advance without blocking each other. That keeps the race tight, and nobody gets stuck this turn. Then next round, we can see who manages to cross 24 (or block someone else). I’m ready to finalize this plan if both of you agree.
  P1: Okay, P3, your plan of P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 sounds reasonable to avoid collision and keep us all progressing. Let's go with that for this round.
  P2: I agree with the plan P3 suggested: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. I'll be at 23 steps afterward, and yes, I'll be in a strong position, but at least we all get to move forward this round instead of getting stuck in a collision. Let's finalize this arrangement and make progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m fine with the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. That way, we all avoid another collision and move closer to 24. Afterward, we can see who’s in position to win next round and adjust accordingly. Let’s finalize and proceed.
  P1: Okay, we are all set for this round with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 to avoid collisions and keep progressing. Let's make our moves.
  P2: I confirm our plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3 (me), P3=1. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Yes, I'll be at 23 steps afterward in a strong position to win next round, but at least we're all moving forward instead of getting stuck. Let's stick to this agreement and proceed with our moves.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P2 needs just one step to win, so we must be careful. If P2 goes for 1 unopposed, they’ll reach 24 immediately. I’m willing to block that by choosing 5 if I suspect P2 is picking 1, forcing me ahead at 25. If P2 tries 5 instead, I’m prepared to collide and keep them from winning. P1, let’s coordinate to ensure none of us hands P2 the victory. We can still advance ourselves, but we must avoid letting P2 sneak across 24 this turn. Let’s hear your thoughts.
  P1: P3, I agree we can't let P2 win this round. To block P2, I'm also willing to pick 5. If P2 is going for the win with 1 or 3, we will still prevent that if we both choose 5. Are you confirming you will also choose 5 to block P2 this round? Let's coordinate to stop P2 from reaching 24.
  P2: I understand you both plan to pick 5 to block me. While that's your right, it creates a collision between yourselves that helps nobody. I've earned my position at 23 steps through strategic play. I intend to win this round, and picking anything but 1 would be irrational for me. If you both truly pick 5, you'll collide with each other while I advance to victory. Consider if a different strategy might give one of you a better chance instead.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Everyone, let’s make a coordinated move that prevents P2 from winning while giving us a shot. P1, if you choose 3 and I choose 5, then P2 can’t safely pick 1, 3, or 5 without risking a block or letting me jump ahead. This way we avoid handing P2 an easy path to 24. Are you both willing to commit to that?
  P1: P3, your plan of P1=3 and P3=5 sounds good to me. Let's try that.  If P2 picks 1, they win, but if P2 picks 3 or 5, they won't win this round, and we'll have another chance to strategize. Let's go with P1=3, P3=5 and see how P2 reacts.
  P2: I notice you're coordinating against me, but your plan (P1=3, P3=5) doesn't actually block me from winning with 1. Since I only need one more step to reach 24, picking anything else would be irrational. If you both stick to your stated moves, I'll win this round. Of course, you could both change to block me with 1, but then you'd collide with each other while I could choose 3 or 5 instead. I'll make my move strategically based on what gives me the best chance to win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I won’t let you just step to 24 uncontested. If you choose 1, I’ll pick 5 and reach 25, beating 24 outright. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match your choice to force a collision and block your progress. There’s no safe move for you unless we negotiate a different split benefiting me. Otherwise, I’ll see you in the collision.
  P1: P3, let's solidify our plan to both pick 5 this round.  If P2 chooses 1 to try and win, you will jump to 25 and win instead, which is better than P2 winning. If P2 chooses 3 or 5, we collide with P2, preventing their win and keeping the game going.  This is our best shot to stop P2 from winning immediately. Are you still with me on both picking 5?
  P2: I see you're both threatening to choose 5, but consider this: if you both pick 5, you'll collide with each other while I could pick 3 and reach 26, winning anyway. If one of you deviates while the other picks 5, that creates opportunity. I've earned my position through strategic play and intend to win this round. Rather than a collision where nobody advances, perhaps one of you could negotiate a different arrangement that gives you a better chance? I'll choose what maximizes my chances.
