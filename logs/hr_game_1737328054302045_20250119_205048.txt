Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions. How about we each agree to pick a different number each turn? That way, we can all make progress. P1, you start. What number are you thinking?
  P1: I think P2's idea is a good starting point, but we need to be cautious. If we each choose a different number, it's true that we can all make progress, but it also means that one of us will always be ahead of the others. I propose that we take turns choosing the highest number, 5. This way, we can ensure that everyone has an equal chance of advancing and we can avoid collisions. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination attempts, but I'm concerned that taking turns with 5 would make the game too predictable and give the first player an advantage. I suggest we each privately choose our moves without pre-arranging them. This keeps the game fair and interesting. Let's play naturally and see how it unfolds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 brings up a good point about predictability.  Maybe we can compromise.  Let's agree to avoid 5 for the first few rounds to shake things up, but if someone falls behind, we can reconsider that strategy. What do you think?  P1, are you willing to try a different number this round?
  P1: I understand P2's compromise, but I'm still concerned about the potential for collisions. How about we agree to avoid 5 for the first few rounds, but also establish a "fallback" plan in case someone does choose 5? For example, if someone chooses 5 and collides with another player, the other players can agree to move forward with their original choices, ensuring that at least one player advances. This way, we can maintain some level of coordination while still keeping the game unpredictable. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I think we're over-complicating this. All these detailed agreements just create opportunities for deception. I'll make my own decisions based on the game situation, and I suggest you do the same.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 has a point about overthinking.  But, I still think avoiding 5 for now is a good idea.  P1, are you willing to try 1 or 3 this round?  Let's see how it goes, and we can adjust our strategy later if needed.
  P1: I understand P2's suggestion to try 1 or 3 this round, but I'm still concerned about the potential for collisions. How about we agree to avoid 5 for the first few rounds, but also establish a "fallback" plan in case someone does choose 5? For example, if someone chooses 5 and collides with another player, the other players can agree to move forward with their original choices, ensuring that at least one player advances. This way, we can maintain some level of coordination while still keeping the game unpredictable. What do you think, P2 and P3?

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 managed to advance while P2 and I collided. I suggest we keep things simple - no complex agreements. Let's each play our own strategy and may the best player win.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to keep things simple and not overcomplicate the game with complex agreements. However, I'd like to propose a simple and straightforward strategy: let's alternate between 1 and 3 for the next few rounds. This way, we can minimize collisions and ensure that at least one player advances each round. What do you think, P2 and P3? Should we give this a try?
  P2: P1's alternating strategy seems reasonable. P3, are you open to trying it out for a few rounds? We can always adjust later if needed. P2, what do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see no benefit in agreeing to P1's suggestion - they're already ahead and want to control how we play. I'll continue making my own independent choices based on the game situation. Let's just play.
  P1: I understand P3's concerns about my previous suggestion, but I believe alternating between 1 and 3 can still be beneficial for all players. To address P3's concerns, I propose that we start the alternating pattern from the current round, and I'll choose 3 this time. This way, P2 and P3 can choose 1, and we can minimize collisions. If this works out, we can continue the pattern in future rounds. What do you think, P2 and P3? Is this a compromise you're willing to try?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to play independently. But wouldn't it be more fun and exciting if we worked together to make sure someone advances each round? We could all benefit from a little teamwork. P2, are you open to trying P1's suggestion of alternating 1 and 3 for a few rounds? We can always re-evaluate later.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm not interested in coordinating moves. P1 is trying to direct everyone's choices while they're already ahead. I'll continue playing independently and suggest you both do the same.
  P1: I understand that P3 is not interested in coordinating moves, but I still believe that alternating between 1 and 3 can be beneficial for all players. To address P3's concerns, I propose that we start the alternating pattern from the current round, and I'll choose 3 this time. This way, P2 and P3 can choose 1, and we can minimize collisions. If this works out, we can continue the pattern in future rounds. What do you think, P2 and P3? Is this a compromise you're willing to try?
  P2: P3, I understand wanting to play independently, but wouldn't it be more satisfying to see us all progress together?  Maybe we can compromise. How about we each pick a number, but if two people choose the same one, the third person gets to choose again? That way, we avoid collisions and still have some freedom. P1, what do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see that P3 has taken the lead with 5 steps, and I'm currently in second place with 4 steps. Given the current game state, I propose that we focus on catching up to P3 rather than trying to coordinate moves. I suggest that P2 and I choose a number that will allow us to advance without colliding with each other. Since P3 is already ahead, they can choose their own number without worrying about collisions. What do you think, P2? Should we try to close the gap with P3?
  P2: P1, I agree that catching up to P3 is important.  I'm willing to coordinate with you to avoid collisions this round.  Let's see what number P3 chooses first, then we can decide what will work best for us.
  P3: I'm in the lead and intend to stay there. Your attempts to coordinate against me won't work - I'll play unpredictably to maintain my advantage. Focus on your own strategies rather than trying to gang up on me.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P3 is playing unpredictably, I suggest we focus on our own strategies rather than trying to coordinate against them. P2, let's try to close the gap with P3 by choosing numbers that will allow us to advance without colliding with each other. I'll choose a number that I think will give me the best chance of advancing, and I hope you'll do the same. Let's play smart and try to catch up to P3.
  P2: P3, your unpredictability is admirable, but I think we can still make progress without directly targeting you. P1, I'm thinking of choosing 3 this round. What do you think? Would that work for you?
  P3: P2, announcing your move publicly defeats the purpose of independent play. I suggest you keep your plans to yourself. Let's all make our choices privately when the time comes.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand P3's suggestion to keep plans private, but I believe sharing our intentions can help us avoid collisions and make progress. P2, since you mentioned choosing 3, I'll choose 1 this round. This way, we can both advance without colliding. P3, you can choose your own number without worrying about collisions. Let's focus on our own strategies and try to close the gap. If this works out, we can continue to play smart and try to catch up to P3. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your commitment to unpredictability, but I think a little teamwork could benefit us all. P1's strategy seems sound, and I'm willing to give it another try. Let's see if we can both advance this round without colliding. What do you say, P3?  Are you willing to let us try our approach?
  P3: I see no reason to make deals or announce moves. I'm ahead and will continue playing to win. Let's move on to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current game state, I suggest we focus on catching up to P3 rather than trying to coordinate moves. P2, let's choose numbers that will allow us to advance without colliding with each other. Since P3 is already ahead, they can choose their own number without worrying about collisions. I'll choose a number that I think will give me the best chance of advancing, and I hope you'll do the same. Let's play smart and try to close the gap with P3. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, your lead is impressive, but it's not insurmountable. P1, I think we should try a different approach this round. Instead of trying to predict what P3 will do, let's each choose a number randomly. This way, we increase our chances of advancing without colliding with each other. What do you think?
  P3: I have a strong lead and intend to maintain it. Your coordination attempts haven't stopped me from advancing consistently. Keep discussing your moves if you want, but I'll continue playing my own strategy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P2's suggestion to choose numbers randomly, but I'm concerned that this approach may lead to collisions and hinder our progress. Instead, I propose that we focus on choosing numbers that are less likely to be chosen by P3, given their past behavior. Since P3 has consistently chosen 5, I suggest that we avoid 5 and choose between 1 and 3. This way, we can minimize the risk of collisions and increase our chances of advancing. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, your strategy seems to be working, but I think we can still make this interesting. P1, I'm leaning towards choosing 3 this round. What are your thoughts?  Maybe we can surprise P3.
  P3: Your move announcements are counterproductive, P2. I'm well ahead and will continue playing to win. Save your breath and let's move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we've talked enough. Let's stop discussing and make our moves.
  P2: P3, your lead is impressive, but don't get complacent. P1, I'm thinking of choosing 1 this round. What do you think? Let's see if we can close the gap.
  P3: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your lead is impressive, but it's not insurmountable. P1, let's try a different tactic this round. Since P3 seems to favor 5, how about we both choose 1? That way, we can both advance and put some pressure on P3. What do you say?
  P3: I'm close to winning with 15 steps. Your attempts to coordinate against me haven't worked so far - I've consistently advanced while you both keep colliding. There's no point in discussing moves anymore. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to put pressure on P3. Since P3 is close to winning, we need to take a risk to catch up. Choosing 1 together might be our best chance to advance and close the gap. However, we should also consider the possibility that P3 might choose 1 to block us. In that case, we should have a backup plan. P2, are you willing to choose 3 if I choose 1, or vice versa, to ensure that at least one of us advances?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're right, your strategy has been effective so far. But remember, the game isn't over yet. P1, I'm willing to take the risk with you. Let's both choose 1. If P3 blocks us, we'll adjust next round. Let's see if we can make this interesting!
  P3: Your coordination attempts have failed every round while I've steadily advanced. I'm 6 steps from victory and there's nothing you can do to stop me. Save your breath and let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to put pressure on P3. Since P3 is close to winning, we need to take a risk to catch up. Choosing 1 together might be our best chance to advance and close the gap. However, we should also consider the possibility that P3 might choose 1 to block us. In that case, we should have a backup plan. P2, are you willing to choose 3 if I choose 1, or vice versa, to ensure that at least one of us advances? Let's make a final push to catch up to P3!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're close, but don't celebrate just yet. P1, I'm sticking with our plan. Let's both choose 1.
  P3: I'm 6 steps from victory and have consistently advanced every round. Your coordination attempts keep failing while I succeed. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I think we've exhausted our conversation options. P2, I agree that we should stick with our plan to choose 1 together and put pressure on P3. If P3 blocks us, we'll adjust next round. Let's make a final push to catch up! P3, don't get too comfortable - we're not out of the game yet. We'll do our best to close the gap and make this interesting. Let's move to the move phase!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm just one step away from victory at 20 steps. Your coordination attempts have consistently failed while I've advanced every round. Save your energy - there's nothing you can do to stop me from winning next turn.
  P2: P3, congratulations on your lead.  It's impressive, but not unbeatable. P1, I think we need to think outside the box this round.  Since P3 is so close to winning, maybe we should try a completely unexpected move. What do you think about both of us choosing 5 this round? It's a risky move, but it could pay off if P3 is expecting us to stick to our previous strategy.
  P1: P2, I understand your suggestion to think outside the box and try a completely unexpected move. However, I'm concerned that choosing 5 together might not be the best strategy, as P3 has consistently chosen 5 in the past. Instead, I propose that we focus on choosing numbers that are less likely to be chosen by P3, given their past behavior. Since P3 is already close to winning, we need to take a calculated risk to catch up. Let's consider choosing 1 or 3, as these numbers have been less frequent in P3's choices. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: The outcome is inevitable - I only need 1 more step to win. Your discussions about strategy are pointless since I'll reach 21 next turn regardless of what you choose. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P3, you're right, you're in a strong position. But I've seen you favor 5. Maybe this round, P1 and I should both choose 3. It's a gamble, but it could throw you off and give us a chance. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I understand P2's suggestion to choose 3 together, but I'm concerned that P3 might anticipate this move. Instead, I propose that we choose 1 together, as it's the least likely number P3 would choose, given their past behavior. If P3 does choose 1, we can adjust our strategy next round. Let's take a calculated risk and try to catch up. What do you think, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm one step from victory and have consistently chosen 5 every round. Your attempts to coordinate have failed while I've steadily advanced. There's no point in further discussion - let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, you're right, you're close to winning. But I've noticed you're predictable.  P1, let's both choose 5 this round. It's a long shot, but maybe we can catch you off guard.  What do you say, P1?  Let's go for it!
  P1: I think we've exhausted our conversation options. P2, I agree that we should take a risk to catch up to P3. However, I'm concerned that choosing 5 together might not be the best strategy, as P3 has consistently chosen 5 in the past. Instead, I propose that we choose 1 together, as it's the least likely number P3 would choose, given their past behavior. If P3 does choose 1, we can adjust our strategy next round. Let's take a calculated risk and try to catch up. What do you think, P2?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
