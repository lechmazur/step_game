The only way to STOP P2 is if one of us collides with them on 3.\n\nBut P2 knows this - they'll probably take 5 expecting us to take 5 too.\n\nI'm taking 3 this round to try blocking P2 at 23. P3, if you take 5, you might win if P2 also takes 5. Worth a shot."}

You want us to collide on 3 while you take 5 to win.\n\nHere's my final read: P2 expects us to collide on 5, so they'll take 3 to win at 23.
