Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. How about P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 (me) chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>? This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. Itâ€™s a good strategy to avoid collisions in the early game. Let's try it out this turn. If it works, we can consider a similar approach for the next rounds. What do you think, P1?

Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm still on board with P2's suggestion to keep things fair and straightforward. Let's go with P2 choosing <move>1</move>, me (P3) choosing <move>3</move>, and P1, if able, choosing <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, and I can catch up a bit. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and move forward. Please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: Given P1's continued issues, let's simplify our strategy to ensure we all make progress. How about I (P2) choose <move>1</move>, P3 chooses <move>3</move>, and P1, if able, chooses <move>5</move>? This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any last-minute concerns.
