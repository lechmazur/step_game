This is the first round of our reverse pattern that gets us all to 18 after round 6.\n\nQuick reminder of the sequence:\n- Round 4: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1\n- Round 5: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3  \n- Round 6: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5\n\nThis keeps us perfectly tied. The cooperation has been flawless so far - let's maintain it through this next phase. Confirming I'll take 5 this round."}
