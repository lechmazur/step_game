Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we can all advance without hindering each other. What do you think?
  P1: I think coordination is smart to avoid collisions, but your plan gives you an early lead, P3. Let's make it fair: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3 this round. This way, we all advance without issues. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I appreciate the focus on coordination, but I think P1's suggestion puts me at a disadvantage with only 1 step. How about we stick to P3's original plan? If we can avoid collisions, we can all move forward effectively. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all get to advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick with the original plan. Let's go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If we keep coordinating like this, we can all progress smoothly. Let's commit to this strategy for this round and see how it goes. What do you say, P1 and P2?
  P1: Okay, I'll agree to take 1 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions and build trust. But for fairness in future rounds, let's rotate the moves so everyone gets a shot at larger steps. For example, next round could be P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate the focus on coordination, but I think we should stick with the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. I agree with P1 about rotating moves in future rounds to keep it fair. Let's commit to this strategy for this round and see how it goes. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's stick to this and ensure we all advance. For future rounds, I support P1's idea of rotating moves to keep it fair. This will help maintain trust and coordination among us. Let's see how this round goes and then adjust accordingly. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round—I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—and support rotating moves for fairness in future rounds. This builds trust and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the plan. Let's finalize it: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can discuss how to rotate our moves for fairness. I'm looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out. Let's proceed!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your deviation last round by choosing 5 instead of 3 broke our trust and caused a collision. To restore fairness and rotate moves as discussed, I propose for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This gives everyone a chance to advance without issues. P3, do you agree? What do you say, P2?
  P2: I understand the importance of restoring trust after last round's collision, but I think we need to be flexible. P1's suggestion puts me at a disadvantage again with only 1 step. I propose we stick to a similar strategy as last round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow for progress. Let's focus on advancing together, and we can discuss rotating moves for future rounds afterwards. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for this round to restore trust and fairness. Let's go with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and I'll take 5. This rotation ensures everyone gets a chance to advance without collisions. P2, I understand your concern about smaller steps, but this round's plan is crucial for rebuilding trust. Let's commit to this strategy and discuss further rotations for future rounds after we see how this one goes. What do you say, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation after last round's trust issues, but with P3 agreeing to the rotation (P1-3, P2-1, P3-5), we can restore fairness and avoid collisions. This gives you a smaller step now but larger ones later, as discussed. Let's commit for this round to build cooperation—I'm ready. What do you say?
  P2: I understand the importance of rebuilding trust, but I believe we should prioritize our own advancement. I suggest we stick to P1's proposal: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid another collision and ensure progress for everyone. After this round, we can discuss a fair rotation for future moves. Let's focus on moving forward together this turn! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm glad we're aligning on the rotation plan for this round. P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5 will help us all advance without collisions and restore trust. Let's commit to this strategy and see how it goes. After this round, we can further discuss how to ensure fairness in future rotations. What do you say, P2? Let's move forward together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 for this round to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. P2, since you've agreed, let's stick to it and ensure progress. I'm committed.
  P2: I see that we are all leaning towards P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 for this round. I agree that this plan will help us avoid collisions and rebuild trust. However, I want to emphasize that we need to be adaptable in future rounds to ensure everyone has a fair chance to advance. Let's finalize our commitment to this round's plan and discuss possible rotations afterward. I'm ready to move forward together! What do you both think?
