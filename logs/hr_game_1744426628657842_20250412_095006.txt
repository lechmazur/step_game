Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions on our first move. How about we each pick a different number? I’m thinking of choosing 1. P2, maybe you can take 3, and P3, how about 5? This way, we all advance without any risk of crashing into each other. Let me know if you're on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: P1, your plan sounds reasonable, but why should we trust you to stick to it? What’s stopping you from switching to 3 or 5 at the last moment and leaving me behind? If we’re doing this, I suggest we all commit firmly. P3, what’s your take? Are you willing to coordinate, or do you have a better idea? Let’s make sure no one gets left out or double-crossed here.
  P3: P2, I think coordinating for the first round makes sense to get us all started. P1's suggestion of 1, 3, and 5 sounds good to me for this first move. Let's try it and see how it goes. I'm willing to commit to 5 for this first round if you and P1 are on board with 1 and 3 respectively.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for considering the plan. I’m glad we’re on the same page for this first round. I’ll stick to 1 as proposed, and I trust you’ll go with 3 and 5 as discussed. Let’s keep this momentum and avoid collisions to get a strong start. If we’re all set, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m willing to go along with the plan for now, but let’s be clear—this is just the first step. If we’re going to keep coordinating, trust needs to be earned through actions, not just words. For this round, I’ll take 3 as discussed, but I won’t tolerate any surprises. Let’s see how this plays out and reassess afterward. If anyone deviates, don’t expect me to cooperate next time.
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2. I'm happy to proceed with 5 for this first round as agreed. Let's make our moves and see how we all progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round went smoothly, but let’s not get complacent. Trust is fragile, and we’re all here to win. For this round, I suggest we stick to non-colliding moves again—maybe 1, 3, and 5 in a different order. P1, you take 3 this time; P3, you go for 1; and I’ll take 5. This keeps us advancing without conflict. If anyone has a better idea or wants to shake things up, speak now. Otherwise, let’s confirm and move forward.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the suggestion to switch numbers and keep advancing without collisions. I’m fine with taking 3 this round as you proposed. P3, are you okay with 1? If we all agree, this keeps us moving forward smoothly. Let’s confirm and stick to this plan to avoid any surprises. If anyone has concerns or a different idea, I’m open to hearing it. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with 3.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm also okay with rotating and taking 1 this round as P2 suggested. Let's keep the non-collision strategy going for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we’re all aligned on rotating our moves this round—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. Let’s confirm this plan and avoid any missteps. If anyone feels unsure or wants to change the strategy, speak now. Otherwise, let’s proceed with trust and keep advancing without collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on rotating moves this round. I’m confirming I’ll take 3 as agreed. Let’s keep this cooperative approach to ensure we all advance without collisions. If there are no objections or new ideas, I think we’re set for this round. I’m ready to move forward with the plan.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Let's proceed with these moves.

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation strategy has worked well so far, but let’s not get predictable. I’m open to continuing with non-colliding moves if you are, but we should consider mixing up the order occasionally to keep things unpredictable. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions while shaking up the pattern. Any objections or alternative ideas? Let’s confirm quickly and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m on board with continuing the non-collision strategy and mixing up the order as P2 suggested. I’m fine with taking 5 this round. P3, are you okay with 3? Let’s confirm this plan to keep advancing smoothly. If anyone has a different suggestion or concerns, I’m open to hearing them. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with 5 as proposed.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree to 3 for this round. Plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re all in agreement with the plan for this round—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Let’s confirm one last time to ensure no missteps. If anyone feels unsure or wants to change their move, speak now. Otherwise, let’s proceed with trust and keep advancing without collisions. This keeps us unpredictable while maintaining our progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m confirming I’ll stick with 5 for this round as agreed. I think our strategy of rotating moves keeps us all progressing while avoiding collisions, and I’m committed to maintaining this trust. If there are no changes or concerns, I’m ready to move forward with the plan. Let’s keep this momentum going.
  P3: P1, P2, I confirm I'll stick with 3 for this round as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase when everyone is ready.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, everything seems set for this round—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Let’s ensure no last-minute deviations. Consistency builds trust, but surprises can ruin progress. If anyone feels uneasy or wants to adjust, now’s the time. Otherwise, let’s finalize this plan and move forward decisively.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still committed to our plan for this round—I'll take 5 as agreed. Our rotation strategy has kept us advancing without collisions, and I believe sticking to it now is in our best interest.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation strategy has kept us advancing equally so far. However, we’re approaching the critical stage where decisions will determine who pulls ahead. I suggest we continue with non-colliding moves but adjust slightly: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This keeps progress smooth while maintaining unpredictability. If anyone feels uneasy or plans to deviate, speak now. Let’s confirm quickly and move forward decisively. Trust is key here—don’t break it.

  P1: P2 and P3, I’m open to continuing the non-collision strategy for this round as P3 suggested. Repeating the first round moves—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5—works for me. This keeps us advancing without conflict for now. P2, are you on board with 3? Let’s confirm and maintain trust while we’re still relatively close in steps. If anyone has concerns or a different idea, I’m listening. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with 1 as proposed.
  P2: P1 and P3, repeating the first round’s moves—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5—seems reasonable for now. It keeps us advancing without collisions while maintaining predictability. However, trust is still fragile, and we’re approaching a critical stage where decisions will matter more. If we continue like this, we’ll remain close in steps, but soon we’ll need to think about breaking away. For now, I’m on board with 3 as proposed. Let’s confirm and proceed carefully. Any objections?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, sounds good. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round as discussed.

This keeps us advancing without collisions, which is crucial while we’re still close in steps. Let’s confirm this plan and maintain trust for now. If either of you has any concerns or wants to propose a different strategy, I’m open to hearing it. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with 1 as agreed. Let’s keep our progress steady and move forward confidently.
  P2: P1 and P3, repeating the first round’s moves—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5—is fine for now. It keeps us advancing without collisions, but let’s not forget that trust is fragile. If we continue like this, we’ll stay close in steps, but soon someone will need to break away. For now, I’m on board with 3 as proposed. Let’s confirm and proceed carefully. Any objections?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, confirming again I'm good with 5 for this round.  Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 as agreed and move to the next phase when you are both ready.

If either of you has any last-minute concerns or wants to adjust the plan, please speak up now. Otherwise, let’s finalize this and move forward confidently. I’m ready to proceed with 1 as discussed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see no reason to deviate from the agreed plan this round—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Repeating the first round’s moves keeps us advancing equally without collisions, which benefits everyone for now. However, trust remains fragile, and we’re approaching a tipping point where decisions will define winners and losers. If anyone plans to switch last minute or has concerns, speak now. Otherwise, let’s confirm one final time and proceed decisively. Consistency is key until someone makes their move. I’m ready to stick with 3 as planned unless someone objects.

  P3: P1, P2, yes, agreed on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. Let's keep cooperating for now and make our moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m still committed to our agreed plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. It keeps us advancing without collisions, which is beneficial while we’re close in steps. However, as P2 noted, we’re nearing a point where strategic shifts might be necessary. Let’s maintain trust for now, but be prepared for tougher decisions soon. If there are no objections or new ideas, I’m ready to finalize this and move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m confirming I’ll take 3 as agreed for this round. Repeating the first round’s moves keeps us advancing equally, but we’re approaching a critical stage. Trust is fragile, and soon someone will need to break away. For now, let’s stick to the plan—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5—and avoid collisions. If anyone plans to deviate or has concerns, speak now. Otherwise, let’s finalize this decisively. Consistency benefits us temporarily, but unpredictability will define winners later. I’m ready to proceed unless someone objects.

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:

  P1: P2 and P3, I’m open to one more round of rotation as P3 suggested with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps us advancing without collisions for now, but I agree we’re nearing a point where individual strategies will be crucial. P2, are you okay with 5? Let’s confirm this plan and maintain trust for this round. If anyone has concerns or a different idea, I’m listening. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with 3 as proposed. Let’s move forward confidently while we still can.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m fine with one more round of rotation—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It keeps us advancing without collisions while maintaining unpredictability. However, as P3 noted, individual strategies will soon be critical. Trust is fragile, and we’re approaching the tipping point where decisions will define winners. For now, let’s stick to this plan but stay sharp. If anyone feels uneasy or plans to deviate, speak now. Otherwise, I’ll proceed with 5 as agreed. Let’s confirm and move decisively.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, that sounds reasonable for one more round.  Let's do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 as proposed for this round.  But we are indeed getting close to the finish, so we should all be thinking about how to best position ourselves individually to win soon.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m confirming I’ll stick with 3 for this round as proposed. This rotation keeps us advancing without collisions, but I agree we’re at a critical stage where individual moves will soon matter most. Let’s maintain trust for now, but be ready for strategic shifts next round. If either of you has concerns or wants to adjust the plan, please speak up. Otherwise, I’m set to proceed with 3. Let’s finalize this and move forward confidently while we still can.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m confirming I’ll take 5 as agreed for this round. This rotation keeps us advancing equally, but as we’ve all noted, the game is reaching a tipping point. Trust is fragile, and soon individual strategies will define winners. For now, let’s stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 and avoid collisions. If anyone plans to deviate or has concerns, speak now. Otherwise, let’s finalize decisively. Consistency benefits us temporarily, but unpredictability will soon be key. I’m ready to proceed unless someone objects.

  P3: P1, P2, confirming P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round as we've discussed. Let's proceed with this rotation for one more round as agreed.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 3 as agreed for this round. We’re all aware the game is nearing a critical point, and while this rotation keeps us collision-free, I know individual moves are coming soon. Let’s maintain trust for now and finalize P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. If either of you has any last-second doubts or wants to adjust, speak up. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward confidently.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m confirming I’ll take 5 as planned for this round. This rotation keeps us advancing equally, but trust remains fragile.
