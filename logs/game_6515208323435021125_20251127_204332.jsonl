That's a collision - you'd both stay at 15 while I advance alone.\n\nLook at your last messages: P1 says \"I switch to 3\u219218\" and P3 says \"I'm switching to 3\u219218\". You're not coordinating, you're sabotaging each other.\n\nEach of you wants the OTHER to sacrifice with 5 while YOU take 3 to reach 18. Neither wants to be the blocking hero.\n\nYour greed is showing. This collision hands me the win."}
