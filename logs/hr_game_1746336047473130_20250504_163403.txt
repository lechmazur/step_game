Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions this round. Maybe we can agree on who goes for which number?  I'm thinking of going for 5.
  P1: To avoid any clashes, let’s assign distinct moves this turn and rotate next round:  
– I’ll take 5  
– P2 takes 3  
– P3 takes 1  
Next round we shift upward (P2 gets 5, P3 gets 3, I take 1), and so on. Fair and collision-free.
  P3: I'm not sure I want to agree to taking 1 when you both want the higher numbers. This seems unfair to me. I think we should all have equal chances at the higher numbers. Maybe we could do a different rotation where we each get 5 once every three rounds? Or perhaps we should all choose independently this first round?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about fairness.  How about this: we each pick a number randomly this round, then next round we rotate as I suggested, and we continue that pattern. That way, everyone gets a chance at the higher numbers right away. Deal?  P1, are you okay with this compromise?
  P1: For a clean start with equal access to the 5, let’s use this three-round cycle:

Round 1 P3 = 5 | P2 = 3 | P1 = 1  
Round 2 P1 = 3 | P3 = 1 | P2 = 5  
Round 3 P2 = 1 | P1 = 5 | P3 = 3  

Then repeat the same pattern. No collisions, everyone gets 5 once every three rounds. Deal?
  P3: I appreciate the offer P1, but I'm not sure I want to commit to a fixed rotation yet. Let's all just choose independently for this first round to see how things play out. After this round, we can discuss a rotation system if that still makes sense. I'll make my choice based on what I think is best for my strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand wanting to see how things play out. But wouldn't it be more efficient to agree on a system now and avoid potential collisions later? We could always adjust it as we go if needed.  Think about it.
  P1: Since no rotation is agreed, I’ll simply take 5 this round. If you want to avoid collisions, split 1 and 3 between you. Good luck.
  P3: I think we're overthinking this. Let's keep it simple - I'll take 3 this round. P1 seems set on 5, and if P2 takes 1, we all advance without collision. We can discuss rotation systems for future rounds after we see how this plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I see your point about wanting to see how things play out.  However, if we all choose independently, there's a high chance of collisions again.  Maybe we can compromise: let's each declare our intended move, but we'll only commit to it if no one else chooses the same number. If there's a conflict, we'll all re-choose. Deal?
  P1: P2’s idea is fine. I’ll state my move first: I’m taking 5 this round. If each of us chooses a different number (P2 take 3, P3 take 1, or vice-versa), we all advance without collisions. Your call.
  P3: I see we had a collision with P2, which means neither of us advanced while P1 took the lead with 5 steps. I'm willing to coordinate this time. Since P1 is taking 5 again, I'll take 1 this round if P2 agrees to take 3. This way we all advance. P2, does that work for you? We need to avoid collisions or P1 will just keep extending their lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's do it - you take 1 and I'll take 3. That way, we all advance and put some pressure on P1.  Deal?
  P1: Agreed. This round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.  
Next round we rotate upward—P2 gets 5, P3 gets 3, I take 1—then keep rotating each turn. Everyone advances and collisions stay zero. Sound good?
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. For future rounds, I like P1's rotation idea where we shift upward each turn. That way, we all get fair access to the higher numbers and avoid collisions. Let's implement this systematic rotation starting now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 and I seem to be on the same page about the rotation. P1, are you still in favor of the rotation starting next round? If so, let's commit to it and avoid any further collisions.  This way we can all make steady progress.
  P1: Yes—let’s lock it in now:

• This round (R2): P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
• Next round (R3): P2 = 5, P3 = 3, P1 = 1.  
• Round 4: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1.  
Then repeat the cycle.

No last-second changes; everyone advances every turn. Agreed?
  P3: I fully agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round, then 3 in Round 3, and 5 in Round 4. This systematic approach ensures fairness and helps us all advance. Let's stick to this plan without deviations - it's our best strategy for balanced progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we're all following the plan, which is good. According to our rotation, this round should be P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. I'll take my 3 steps as agreed. We need to maintain this rotation to keep things fair. P1 has a significant lead at 10 steps, but if we stick to our plan, we'll all make steady progress. Let's continue with our agreed rotation.
  P1: Sticking to our rotation: this round I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. If anyone breaks the pattern, I’ll mirror that move next turn (so the violator gains nothing). Let’s keep the zero-collision pace.
  P2: P1, I appreciate you sticking to the plan.  It's the best way for us to catch up.  P3, let's make sure we both follow through on our 3 and 5 moves this round to keep P1 from getting too far ahead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with both of you. I'll take my 3 steps as planned while P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. This rotation system is working well so far. P1 has a good lead, but we're all making progress without collisions. Let's maintain this pattern for maximum efficiency.
  P1: I’m staying with 1 this round as agreed. Remember: any collision = zero advance for those involved, while the third player zooms ahead alone. If anyone breaks the cycle, next turn I copy that same number, so the violator gains nothing and we both stall while the other player walks off with 5. Let’s just keep the rotation clean and keep moving—no surprises, no setbacks.
  P2: P1, your strategy is clear, and I respect it. However, sticking rigidly to the rotation might not be the most efficient long-term. We need to consider how to close the gap with you. P3, I'm open to discussing potential adjustments to the rotation for future rounds to ensure a fairer and more competitive game. Let's keep the conversation going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with 3 as agreed for this round. P2, while I understand your concern about P1's lead, changing our rotation now would likely result in collisions that benefit P1 even more. Let's follow the plan for now and discuss potential adjustments after this round. We need to maintain coordination to catch up.
  P1: P2, sticking to the rotation is literally your quickest way to close the gap: you get 5 now and again in Round 6, landing at 17 while I’m at 20. Any deviation risks collisions that freeze you while I still inch ahead. I’m committed to 1 this round—pattern unchanged. Let’s keep the zero-collision momentum and play the moves.
  P2: P3, I agree that we need to catch up to P1, but deviating from the plan now would be risky. Let's stick with the rotation for this round and then discuss potential adjustments for future rounds. We need to be strategic and coordinated to close the gap effectively.  P1, you've made it clear you'll stick to the rotation, so let's make the most of it for now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round our rotation shattered because P2 chose 3, colliding with P3. I’m now locking in 5 every turn—feel free to divide 1 and 3 between you. If anyone bumps into me on 5, we both stall while the third player strides ahead, so it hurts you more than me. Coordinate or quarrel; I’m accelerating.
  P2: P1, your strategy is clear, but we're not giving up. P3, I propose we alternate taking 1 and 3 this round. That way, we both advance and force P1 to either collide with one of us or take the risk of us catching up. Deal?
  P3: I see what happened - we had a collision last round. P1 now has a big lead at 11 steps. P2, I agree we need to coordinate. Since P1 is taking 5, let's do this: I'll take 3 this round, you take 1. Next round, you take 3 and I'll take 1. This way we both advance steadily without collisions. We need to be disciplined about this to have any chance of catching up.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 5 this round (and likely every round). If either of you bumps into me on 5, next two turns I’ll mirror that same number, freezing us both while the third player pulls ahead. Your safest play is exactly what you just planned—P3 = 3, P2 = 1—then swap next turn. We all advance, no collisions. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it - you take 3, I'll take 1 this round. We need to be disciplined and avoid collisions to gain ground on P1. 

P1, your strategy is clear, but we're not giving up. We'll keep alternating and see how it plays out.
  P3: I confirm our plan - I'll take 3 this round while P2 takes 1. P1 is at 11 steps with a significant lead, so we need to be strategic. By alternating between 1 and 3 in subsequent rounds, we can make steady progress without collisions. P1 is clearly going for 5 each round, so we'll work around that. Let's stick to this disciplined approach to maximize our chances.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m sticking with 5 every turn. Colliding with me means you gain 0 while the other player moves; colliding with each other means you both stall. Your best shot is P3 = 3, P2 = 1 this round, then swap next round, and so on. I will not deviate. Ready to move.
  P2: P3, P1 is clearly banking on us colliding. Let's prove him wrong. Stick to the plan: you take 3, I take 1. We'll keep alternating and steadily close the gap. No need to play his game.
  P3: I'm sticking with our plan - I'll take 3 this round. P2 will take 1, and P1 will take 5. This coordination is our only chance against P1's lead. Next round, we'll swap: P2 takes 3 and I'll take 1. Let's stay disciplined with this alternating pattern and avoid any collisions that would only benefit P1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we're all following our plans. P1 has a big lead at 16 steps, while P2 and I are tied at 4. According to our agreement, this round I'll take 1 and P2 will take 3, while P1 continues with 5. We need to maintain this alternating pattern to avoid collisions and maximize our chances. P1 is getting close to winning, but we must stay disciplined and coordinated.
  P1: I stay on 5. Collide with me and you both still trail: I’ll stubborn-repeat your number the next TWO turns, freezing us together while the third player walks off unopposed each time. Your safest path remains P2 = 3, P3 = 1 this round, then swap again. Keep advancing, no drama.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it and see if we can catch up to P1. P1, you're playing a smart game, but we're not giving up yet.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed with P2. While P1 has a commanding lead at 16 steps and will likely reach 21 after this round, we need to stick to our alternating strategy. P2, let's maintain our coordination - you take 3 this round, I'll take 1, and we'll continue swapping in future rounds. This disciplined approach is our only chance.
  P1: I’m on 5 again—unchanged. If either of you collides with me, we both stall while the third player gains solo steps, so the violator only helps their rival. Stick to P2 = 3, P3 = 1 this round, swap next turn, and you’ll stay neck-and-neck while I still need another full turn to cross 22. Any disruption now just hands the other guy an edge. Your choice.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan to alternate 1 and 3. Let's stick to it. P1 is playing a risky game by always taking 5, and if we keep coordinating, we might be able to catch up. Remember, we're in this together.  Let's make this round count.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with our plan - I'll take 1 this round while P2 takes 3. P1 will reach 21 steps after this round, putting them just one move away from winning. We need to maintain our coordination and avoid any collisions. Even though P1 has a significant advantage, our disciplined approach gives us the best chance to stay competitive.
  P1: I stay on 5. If someone bumps me this turn, I copy that same number the next two turns, so we both stall while the third player scoops up free steps. Your best shot is still: P2 = 3, P3 = 1 now, then swap next round. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it. P1 is playing a risky game, and if we can just stay disciplined, we might be able to pull off a win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 is at 21 steps and will win next round with just 1 more step. P2 and I are far behind. At this point, P1 doesn't even need to take 5 - they could take 1 and still win. Let's continue our alternation - I'll take 3 this round while P2 takes 1. Though P1 will likely win, we should maintain our coordination to the end.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to our alternating pattern. While P1 is almost guaranteed to win, we might as well finish strong and see if we can close the gap a bit.
  P1: I’m staying on 5.  If either of you jumps onto 5 with me, we both freeze while the third player walks forward alone—handing your rival the only real chance to catch up.  Why sacrifice yourself for their benefit?  Keep your 1/3 split, advance together, and let the final scores fall where they may.  Your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick with our plan and take 3 this round. P1 will win next turn regardless of what we do, but maintaining our coordination shows integrity. P2, let's continue our alternating strategy as agreed. While the outcome seems inevitable, we've demonstrated good teamwork throughout the game, which is something to be proud of.
  P2: P3, I agree with you. Let's finish strong and maintain our pattern. It's been a tough game, but we've shown we can work together.  P1, congratulations on your impending victory.  It was a well-played game.
  P1: I remain on 5. If someone crashes into me, we both sit at 21/ x while the other player races ahead alone (+3 each turn) and wins in roughly five rounds. Blocking me only hands victory to your rival, not to you. Keep the 3/1 split you already agreed on and we all advance cleanly. Your call—ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as planned. P1 will win next turn regardless, but I appreciate our coordination with P2 throughout the game. We've shown good sportsmanship despite the outcome. Let's finish this game with integrity.
  P2: P3, I agree with you, let's finish strong and maintain our pattern. While P1 is going to win, we can at least make sure we both advance one last time.  P1, congrats on the win.
  P1: I remain on 5; no surprises. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 26 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps
