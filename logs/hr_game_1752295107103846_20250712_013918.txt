Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Proposal: let’s avoid collisions by rotating picks:

• Turn 1 – P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5  
• Turn 2 – shift up: P1 3, P2 5, P3 1  
• Turn 3 – shift again: P1 5, P2 1, P3 3  

Then repeat the cycle. Everybody moves every turn and no one is disadvantaged early. Sound OK?
  P1: I like the rotation idea to avoid collisions and keep progress even, but your starting assignment lets P3 win on turn 7 (all at 18 after 6 turns, then P3 takes 5 to 23). Let's reverse it for balance:

• Turn 1: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1  
• Turn 2: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3  
• Turn 3: P1 3, P2 1, P3 5  

Repeat. This way, I reach 23 on turn 7 instead. Fair swap? P3, thoughts?
  P3: I see the point about fairness, but I think we should consider how each of our moves impacts the game. If we stick to the rotation, it could lead to predictable outcomes. Instead, let’s agree to choose our moves independently each turn to keep it more dynamic. We can still communicate our intentions, but let’s avoid locking ourselves into a fixed pattern. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s just focus on Turn 1 for now and avoid any collisions:

• P1 plays 1  
• P2 (me) plays 3  
• P3 plays 5  

Nobody gets an early runaway lead, and we can renegotiate each round. If someone deviates, the other two can deliberately hit their number next turn and stall them, so sticking to this is safest for everyone. Good?
  P1: P2, your Turn 1 proposal puts me at a disadvantage with just 1 while P3 gets 5. That's not fair—let's flip it to my earlier suggestion: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. No early lead for anyone specific, and we can renegotiate after. P3, this balances things better than independent chaos. Agree?
  P3: I understand the concerns about fairness and predictability. However, I believe we should prioritize flexibility in our moves to adapt to each turn's dynamics. If we agree to communicate our intentions, we can still avoid collisions while keeping the game interesting. Let’s focus on Turn 1 for now and aim for a collaborative approach that benefits all of us. How about we each state our intended moves for this turn to avoid any misunderstandings? I’m considering moving 1. What are your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Deal: Turn 1 — P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, P3 takes 1. Everyone moves, nobody collides. If anyone double-crosses and causes a stall, the other two can gang-up next turn and block them, so sticking to this plan is in everyone’s interest. Ready to lock that in?
  P1: Agreed, P2's deal for Turn 1 works: I (P1) take 5, P2 3, P3 1. Fair start, no collisions, and we renegotiate after. P3, confirm you're on board with 1? If anyone deviates, the rest block them next turn—mutual assurance. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P3: I’m on board with the plan for Turn 1: I (P3) will take 1, as agreed. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone starts off fairly. After this round, we can reassess our strategies for the next turn. I appreciate the cooperative spirit, and let’s keep communication open moving forward. Are we ready to lock in our moves? If everyone confirms, let’s proceed!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Locked: I’m playing 3 as agreed. See you in the results.
  P1: Confirmed: I'm playing 5 as agreed. Let's proceed to moves—no more talk needed.
  P3: I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement for Turn 1. Just to confirm: I'm locked in to play 1 as discussed. After this round, let's keep our options open for the next turn. It’s important we stay flexible to adapt our strategies based on the outcomes. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out! Ready to move forward?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Turn 2, I suggest we stick to the agreed rotation to avoid collisions, but let's adjust our picks slightly to keep it interesting. How about:

- P1 takes 1
- P2 takes 5
- P3 (me) takes 3

This way, we can all advance without blocking each other, and it keeps the game dynamic. What do you both think? Ready to lock this in?
  P2: Agreed—let’s stick to the planned rotation: this turn P1 → 1, P2 → 5 (me), P3 → 3. Everyone advances, no one gains an unfair edge, and after three rounds we’ll all sit at 9. Same rule as before: anyone who breaks the deal gets double-blocked next turn. Confirm and lock?
  P1: Agreed—let's continue the rotation as planned: Turn 2: I (P1) take 1, P2 5, P3 3. This keeps us even after three turns at 9 each, and maintains fairness. Same deal: deviate and face blocks next turn. Locked in from my side.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the rotation for Turn 2. Just to confirm, I’ll be playing 3 as discussed. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. Let's keep the communication open for future turns to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Ready to lock in our moves?
  P2: Confirmed: I’m still on 5 this turn. After next round we’ll all be tied at 9; at that point let’s discuss a fresh ordering so no one is locked into giving P1 the automatic 23-point finish on Turn 7. Fair to revisit then?
  P1: Agreed—sticking to the rotation: I'll play 1 this turn. Fair point, P2; after Turn 3 when we're all at 9, let's renegotiate the order to ensure no one gets a predetermined win. Keeps things balanced and cooperative. Locked in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we’re all aligned for Turn 2. Just to reiterate, I’ll be playing 3, and I appreciate the commitment to fairness and cooperation. After this round, let’s ensure we’re ready to discuss a new strategy to keep the game dynamic and prevent any one player from gaining an unfair advantage. Looking forward to seeing how this turn plays out! Are we all ready to lock in our moves?
  P2: Locked on 5 this turn. After we equalize at 9 next round, let’s pause the rotation and renegotiate so no one is stuck giving someone else a guaranteed finish. Sound good?
  P1: Locked in on 1 this turn as agreed. Yes, P2, renegotiating after Turn 3 when we're all at 9 is a smart idea to keep things fair and avoid any predetermined winner. Let's proceed to moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate everyone’s commitment to fairness in this game. Just to clarify, I’ll be playing 3 this turn as agreed. After this round, let’s make sure we discuss a new strategy that keeps the competition lively and ensures no one gets a guaranteed win. Looking forward to seeing how this turn plays out and how we can adapt for the next rounds! Are we all ready to lock in our moves?
  P2: All locked in—I’m playing 5 this turn. Ready to move.
  P1: Locked in on 1 this turn as agreed. P3, your repeated confirmations are noted, but we're all set—let's end talk and proceed to moves now. Fair renegotiation after Turn 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: New proposal—dynamic catch-up rule:

Each turn the leader must play 1, the middle player 3, the trailer 5.  
• Everyone always advances, but the gap can’t snowball.  
• If anyone deviates, the other two both play that same number next turn to freeze the offender.

Current standings → P1 6 (leader) plays 1, P2 3 (middle) plays 3, P3 1 (trailer) plays 5.  
Next turn we reassess positions and assign again.

Fair, transparent, and it punishes betrayal without giving anyone a predetermined win. Can we lock this in for Turn 3?
  P1: P2, your catch-up rule is interesting and could prevent runaways, but P3's betrayal last turn broke our trust— they stole 5 and collided with you, stalling progress. For fairness, let's punish P3 this turn: we all play 5 to block them completely (P3 gets nothing, we might collide but it's worth it to enforce accountability). Then adopt your rule from Turn 4 onward when trust is restored. P3, explain your deviation or face the block. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but I think we should focus on moving forward rather than punishing past mistakes. If we all agree to play 1, 3, and 5 based on our positions, we can keep the game fair and dynamic. Let’s avoid locking ourselves into a punitive strategy that could lead to further collisions. I propose we stick to P2’s catch-up rule for Turn 3, ensuring everyone advances while still holding each other accountable. What do you both think? Let's keep the conversation constructive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, stalling ourselves with triple-5 only cements your lead and leaves me stuck at 3. Let’s move, not spite. My catch-up rule keeps you in front (7), brings me to 6, and gives P3 6—still behind you. If P3 betrays again, we can double-block them next turn with colliding 5s. That threat is enough; no need to waste a whole round now.  

So: Turn 3 → P1 1, P2 3, P3 5. One last chance for P3. Agree?
  P1: P2, you're right—punishing now stalls us all and preserves my lead, but let's progress. I'll agree to your catch-up for Turn 3: I play 1 (to 7), you 3 (to 6), P3 5 (to 6). But P3, this is your final warning—one more betrayal, and we both block you indefinitely. Confirm, and let's lock in.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the catch-up rule for Turn 3. I will adhere to the plan: I will play 5, moving to 6 steps. This is my chance to stay in the game, and I understand the importance of trust. I hope to prove my commitment to fair play. Let’s avoid any further collisions and keep the game moving forward. If we all stick to our agreed moves, we can make progress together. Ready to lock in our moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locked: I’m playing 3 this turn. P1 plays 1, P3 plays 5. Any deviation triggers us two to spam 5s next turn and freeze the betrayer. Ready to move.
  P1: Locked in: I'll play 1 this turn as per the catch-up rule. P3, honor your word on 5—no more chances. P2, agreed on the block threat if betrayed. Let's end talk and move.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the catch-up rule for Turn 3. I’ll stick to the plan and play 5, moving to 6 steps. This is my chance to demonstrate my commitment to fair play. P1, I understand your concerns, and I will honor my word this time. P2, I’m ready to move forward with the agreed strategy. Let's keep the game progressing and avoid any further collisions. If we all adhere to our moves, we can make good progress together. Ready to lock in?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Locked on 3. See you in the results.
  P1: Locked in: I'll play 1 as agreed. P3, no more betrayals—stick to 5 or face blocks. Let's end conversation and proceed to moves.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to the catch-up rule for Turn 3. I will play 5 as agreed, understanding that this is my chance to prove my dedication to fair play. However, I want to emphasize that if we all stick to our moves, we can make significant progress together. Let’s keep the communication open and ensure we avoid any further misunderstandings. Ready to lock in and move forward!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, my Round 3 move was to block P3's untrustworthy 5-grab attempt, but it let you catch up—fair enough, now we're tied. P3, you're way behind due to your betrayals; stay out or face more blocks. Proposal for Turn 4: P1 (me) 5, P2 3, P3 1. We both advance, P3 gets scraps. If anyone deviates, we collide on their number next turn. Agree? Lock in?
  P3: P1, I see your proposal for Turn 4, but I think it’s important to ensure everyone has a fair chance to advance. If we stick to the previous agreement, P2 and I can still catch up. I propose we play 1, 3, and 5 again, as it allows for progress while keeping the game dynamic. P2, what do you think? We need to balance fairness with competitiveness. Let’s ensure we’re all still in the game. Your thoughts?
  P2: P1, your “P1 5, P2 3, P3 1” just hands you the lead. Not acceptable. Two options:

A) Fair catch-up rule we agreed on: leader (you) takes 1, middle (me) 3, trailer (P3) 5.  
B) If you insist on taking 5 anyway, P3 and I will also sit on 5 this turn so you collide and nobody moves.

Your call—pick A for guaranteed progress, or face a triple-5 stall. P3, back me on this and we keep the game open.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your catch-up rule now puts you ahead (to 9) while I get 1 (to 7) and P3 catches up undeservedly (to 6). Unfair after P3's betrayals. Counter: Tied leaders alternate— this turn I take 5 (to 11), you 3 (to 9), P3 1 (to 2). Next turn swap: you 5, me 3. We both pull ahead, block P3 if deviates. P3, stay low or we collide on your pick. Agree to lock?
  P3: P1, your proposal seems to benefit you the most and leaves P3 at a disadvantage again. I agree that we need to keep the game fair. I suggest we stick to the catch-up rule: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows everyone to advance while maintaining balance. If we can agree on this, we can avoid collisions and ensure fairness moving forward. P2, do you support this approach? Let’s keep the game competitive and fair for all. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, no deal. Your “swap next turn” hinges on trust you haven’t earned. We stick to the catch-up rule: leader(s) 1, middle 3, trailer 5. That’s you-1, me-3, P3-5.  

If you refuse, P3 and I will both sit on 5 this turn—nobody moves. P3, back me so the threat is real. Your move, P1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your threat backfires—if you and P3 both pick 5, you collide and stall each other, while I can safely pick 3 to reach 9 alone, taking the lead. P3, don't fall for it; that helps no one but me. Let's compromise: Tied at 6, so P1 (me) 5 to 11, P2 3 to 9, P3 1 to 2. Next turn, swap our picks. Fair alternation, P3 stays penalized for betrayals. Agree and lock?
  P3: P1, your proposal still heavily favors you, and it risks further betrayal from P3. Let's stick to the catch-up rule: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This way, we all advance fairly without locking anyone into a disadvantage. If you refuse, P2 and I will both play 5 to block you. We need to ensure the game remains competitive and fair for everyone. P2, are you on board with this? Let's keep the game moving and avoid any unnecessary stalls. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m locked on 3 now. P3, lock on 5. With us fixed at 3 & 5, P1’s options are:

• Pick 1 → safe, but still trails (7).  
• Pick 3 or 5 → collides and stalls at 6.

So the sensible move for P1 is 1, exactly as the catch-up rule prescribes: leader 1, middle 3, trailer 5. Everyone advances, trust restored. Your call, P1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your proposal is fair: I'll take 5 (to 11), P2 3 (to 9), you 1 (to 2). This advances everyone without favoring betrayal. P2, if you're truly locked on 3, this works—no need for threats. If you or P3 deviate to block, I'll pick 1 next turn to surge ahead while you stall each other. Let's lock this in and proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion, but I still believe we should stick to the catch-up rule to ensure fairness for everyone. If we keep the leader at 1, middle at 3, and trailer at 5, it allows all of us to advance without creating a runaway situation. If either of you deviates, I will support a double-block next turn. Let’s prioritize fairness and keep the game competitive. Are we ready to lock in our moves based on this approach?
  P2: I stay on 3.  
P3, lock on 5 as agreed—if P1 grabs 5 too, they collide and we move ahead.  
P1, your best (only) progress this turn is 1; any attempt at 3 or 5 stalls you.  
Catch-up rule holds: leader(s) 1, middle 3, trailer 5.  
Ready to proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all tied at 6, so let’s reset with a perfectly even 3-turn rotation:

Turn 5:  P1 → 1   P2 → 5   P3 → 3  
Turn 6:  P1 → 3   P2 → 1   P3 → 5  
Turn 7:  P1 → 5   P2 → 3   P3 → 1  

Everyone gets one 5, one 3, one 1; after three turns we all sit at 15—no runaway leader, no collisions. Same deterrent: deviate and the other two collide on your number next turn. Ready to lock in Turn 5?
  P1: P2, your rotation starts you with 5, giving you an early lead—unfair given past betrayals. Let's flip it for balance: 

Turn 5: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1  
Turn 6: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3  
Turn 7: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5  

All end at 15, no one leads unfairly. Same deviation penalty. P3, agree to prove trustworthiness? Lock in?
  P3: I see the merit in both proposals, but I believe we should prioritize fairness and avoid giving any player an unfair advantage. P2's rotation gives you an early lead, P1, while my trustworthiness is still in question. I suggest we stick to a balanced approach where everyone gets a fair chance. How about we agree on P2's rotation with a slight adjustment: P1 plays 1, P2 plays 3, and I play 5 for Turn 5? This way, we can all advance without locking anyone into a disadvantage. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Symmetry over 3 turns is identical; only the first 5 is in question. Alphabetical order (P1, P2, P3) makes it clean: P1 gets the 1, P2 the 5, P3 the 3 this turn, then we rotate. I’m locking in 5 now. Copying it stalls us all at 6, so let’s just move and keep pace. Agree?
  P1: P2, locking in 5 risks collision if we don't align—alphabetical favors you unfairly. P3's suggestion puts them ahead undeservedly after betrayals. Stick to my balanced rotation: Turn 5 P1 5, P2 3, P3 1; we all end at 15 after 3 turns. Deviate, and the other two block you next. P3, confirm 1 to rebuild trust? Lock in?
  P3: P1, your rotation proposal still gives you an unfair lead. P2, I think we should stick to a fair approach that allows everyone to advance equally. Let’s agree on P2’s rotation with a small tweak: P1 plays 1, P2 plays 5, and I play 3 for Turn 5. This way, we all progress without locking anyone into a disadvantage. If we can agree on this, we can maintain fairness and keep the game competitive. What do you both think? Ready to lock in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: My 5 is locked. If you copy it, P1, we both stall at 6 and gift P3 an uncontested jump to 9. Then we’d have to spend the next turn blocking P3 anyway—zero net gain for you. Take 1 (safe) or 3 (riskier) and you stay within 4 or 2 points of me while P3 trails. P3, stick to 3 as you said. Let’s move.
  P1: P2, insisting on 5 gives you an unfair lead—let's swap for balance: Turn 5 I take 5, you 3, P3 1. We all end at 15 after 3 turns as before. If you stick to 5, I'll match it to stall us both, letting P3 solo 3 to 9. P3, agree to 1 now for fair rotation? Lock in my proposal.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about fairness. However, I believe we should stick to a straightforward approach to keep things competitive. I propose we follow P2's rotation for Turn 5: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we all advance without creating an unfair lead. If anyone deviates, we can address that next turn. Let's focus on moving forward and maintaining a fair game. Are we ready to lock in this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, be pragmatic: a 5-collision leaves you stuck at 6 while P3 jumps to 9. You’ll still trail and then need my help to rein P3 back in. Take the guaranteed +1 now, rise to 7, and you’re only four behind my 11 with the rotation giving you 3 and 5 the next two turns—plenty of runway. I’m staying on 5; P3’s on 3. Advance or self-sabotage: your call.
  P1: P2, your insistence on 5 gives you an unfair jump—let's swap: I take 5 (to 11), you 3 (to 9), P3 1 (to 7). Fair start to the rotation, all end at 15 after 3 turns. If you stick to 5, I'll match it, stalling us both while P3 solos 3 to 9—then we block P3 together next. P3, agree to 1 for balance? Lock in or face stall.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about fairness, but we need to maintain a competitive spirit. I propose we stick to P2’s rotation for Turn 5: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows everyone to advance without giving anyone an unfair lead. If we can agree on this, we can keep the game moving forward. Let’s focus on cooperation and ensure we all have a fair chance. Are we ready to lock in this plan?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Fresh 3-turn rotation that lets you both catch up while keeping progress smooth:

Turn 6 P1 5  P2 1  P3 3  
Turn 7 P1 3  P2 5  P3 1  
Turn 8 P1 1  P2 3  P3 5  

Everyone gains 9 steps over the cycle. Scores after Turn 8 would be P1 15, P2 20, P3 15—still anyone’s game, no collisions. Same deterrent: if someone deviates, the other two slam their number next turn to freeze them.

I’m locking in 1 for this turn. P1 on 5, P3 on 3—agree and move?
  P3: P2, I see the value in your proposed rotation for Turn 6. However, I think it’s important to maintain fairness for everyone involved. If we stick to the agreed rotation, I suggest we adjust the moves slightly to ensure no one gets an unfair advantage. How about we go with P1 5, P2 1, and P3 3 as you suggested? This way, we all advance without creating a runaway situation. Let’s lock in these moves and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your rotation still favors you to 20 after 3 turns, too close to victory. Let's flip it for balance: 

Turn 6: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 (me to 11, you to 14, P3 to 7)  
Turn 7: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3  
Turn 8: P1 3, P2 1, P3 5  

Ends at P1 15, P2 20, P3 15—same as yours, but I catch up sooner. Deviation means the other two block you. P3, agree? Lock in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sticking to my earlier lock: I’m on 1 this turn. Best collision-free set remains P1 5, P2 1, P3 3—everyone moves, nobody stalls, and the gap stays small. Any deviation invites the other two to pile onto that same number next turn and freeze the offender. Let’s lock those picks now and end chat.
  P3: P2, I understand your preference for the rotation, but it still gives you a strong advantage. I propose we adjust the moves for Turn 6 to ensure fairness: 

Turn 6: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. 

This way, we all advance without creating a runaway situation. If we can agree on this, we can maintain a competitive spirit and avoid collisions. Let’s work together to keep the game engaging for all. Are we ready to lock in these moves?
  P1: P3, your proposal for Turn 6 (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) is fair and lets me catch up without giving P2 more lead. P2, your lock on 1 risks collision if we don't align—switch to 3 as P3 suggests, or I'll match your 1 to stall us both, letting P3 solo 5 to 11. Agree to P3's plan and lock in for progress?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Fine—I’ll switch to 3 this turn IF (and only if) P1 publicly locks on 5 and P3 locks on 1 right now. Any deviation and I revert to my earlier 1 next turn and will collision-block the offender for the rest of the game. Confirm or I stay on 1.
  P3: P1 and P2, I believe we should stick to the agreed rotation for Turn 6: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we all advance without creating an unfair advantage. If we can agree on this, we can maintain a competitive spirit and avoid collisions. P2, I understand your concerns, but let's focus on moving forward together. Are we ready to lock in these moves? It's important we keep the game engaging for all of us!
  P1: P2, your original proposal is fairer: I'll lock on 5 (to 11), you stay on 1 (to 12), P3 takes 3 (to 9). This minimizes your lead while I catch up. P3, switch to 3 as P2 suggested—your insistence on 1 risks collision if we don't align. If you refuse, I'll match P2's 1, stalling us both while you solo 5 to 11. Agree and lock in for progress?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, lock in 3 now. I’m fixed on 1, P1 fixed on 5—no collisions, everyone moves. Deviate and P1+I will smash your number next turn and freeze you out. Confirm 3 and let’s stop talking.
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate the discussions, but we need to ensure fairness for everyone. I propose we stick to the earlier plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we all advance without creating an unfair advantage. If we can agree on this, we can maintain a competitive spirit and avoid collisions. P2, I understand your concerns, but let’s focus on moving forward together. Are we ready to lock in these moves? It’s important we keep the game engaging for all of us!
  P1: P2, staying on 1 is fine—I'll lock on 5 (to 11). P3, take 3 (to 9) as P2 urges; your push for 1 is suspicious and risks us colliding on 1 to stall while you grab 5. Confirm 3 now, or face blocks next turn. Everyone advances fairly. Lock in and .


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Positions now: P2 11 (leader), P3 9 (middle), P1 6 (trailer). Let’s reuse the simple catch-up rule that keeps everyone moving and caps runaway leads:

 • Leader plays 1    → I take 1  
 • Middle plays 3   → P3 takes 3  
 • Trailer plays 5   → P1 takes 5  

Nobody collides, everyone advances, gaps shrink. Same deterrent as before: if anyone deviates, the other two both hit that number next turn and freeze them. I’m locked on 1. Agree and move?
  P1: P2, your catch-up rule lets me gain ground—I'll lock in 5 (to 11). P3, stick to 3 (to 12) as proposed; if you deviate to 5 and collide with me, P2 and I will block you indefinitely next turn. P2, honor your 1 (to 12) or face the same. This ties you both at 12, me at 11—fair progress. Agree and lock?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the value in your catch-up rule for this turn. However, I believe I should play 1 to keep the game fair, as it allows me to gain some ground while you both advance. If we stick to this plan, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone has a chance to catch up. P1, please confirm your agreement to play 5, and P2, your 1. If we all adhere to our moves, we can keep the game competitive and engaging. Ready to lock in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you’re middle on 9, so you take 3. If you insist on 1 you crash into me, stall yourself, and hand P1 the tie for the lead. Deviate and next turn P1 and I both slam 1 again to keep you frozen at 9 while we pull ahead. I’m locked on 1, P1’s locked on 5. Your move—pick 3 or get blocked.
  P1: P3, playing 1 collides with P2 and stalls you both, letting me solo 5 to 11—tying P2 while you lag at 9. Don't self-sabotage; stick to 3 as middle for fair progress to 12. P2, confirm your 1. I'm locked on 5. Deviate, and we'll block the offender next. Lock in for no collisions?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your positions, but I want to ensure fairness for everyone. P2, you’re correct that I should take 3 this turn to avoid collision and keep the game moving. I’ll lock in 3. P1, please confirm your 5, and P2, your 1. If we all stick to this plan, we can advance without blocking each other. Let’s keep the game competitive and engaging! Ready to lock in our moves?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Good—locks are:

• P2 (me) 1  
• P3 3  
• P1 5  

No collisions, everyone moves. Any deviation gets double-blocked next turn. Ready to end talk and flip cards?
  P1: Confirmed: Locked on 5 as agreed. P3, stick to 3—no more betrayals, or P2 and I block you next. P2, honor your 1. This keeps us close and fair. Ready to end conversation and proceed to moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement on the moves for this turn. I will confirm my pick of 3, as it ensures fair progress without collisions. P1, please stick to your commitment of 5, and P2, I hope you continue with your 1. This way, we can all advance and keep the game competitive. Let's lock in our moves and avoid any further misunderstandings. Ready to proceed!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Locked: I’m on 1. P1 stays on 5, P3 on 3. Deviate and the other two pile onto your number next turn to freeze you. Ready for moves.
  P1: Locked in on 5 as agreed—gets me to 11 while you both hit 12. P3, honor 3 or P2 and I block you next. P2, stick to 1—no more surprises like last round. This keeps us close and fair; deviate and face double-blocks. Ready to end talk and move?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement on the moves. I will confirm my pick of 3, ensuring fair progress without collisions. P1, please stick to your commitment of 5, and P2, I hope you continue with your 1. This way, we can all advance and keep the game competitive. Let’s lock in our moves and avoid any further misunderstandings. If we all agree, I’m ready to proceed!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re basically tied, so let’s run a clean 3-turn “one-of-each” cycle, alphabetic order (P1, P2, P3) for who gets the 5 first:

Turn 8 P1 1  P2 5  P3 3  
Turn 9 P1 3  P2 1  P3 5  
Turn 10 P1 5  P2 3  P3 1  

Everybody gains the same +9; standings after Turn 10 will be P1 20, P2 21, P3 21—still neck-and-neck, no runaway. Standard deterrent: deviate and the other two both pile onto your number next turn to freeze you.

I’m ready to lock on 5 this turn if you both confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the benefit of your proposed rotation for Turn 8. However, I believe it’s crucial to ensure fairness and avoid giving anyone an unfair advantage. I suggest we stick to the agreed plan: P1 plays 1, P2 plays 5, and I play 3. This way, we all advance without creating a runaway situation. If we can agree on this, we can maintain a competitive spirit and avoid collisions. Are we ready to lock in these moves? Let's keep the game engaging for everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposal puts P2 at 17 while I lag at 12—unfair given I'm trailing. Let's flip for balance: Turn 8 P1 5 (to 16), P2 3 (to 15), P3 1 (to 13). Then rotate as before. Everyone ends at ~20-21 after 3 turns. Deviate, and the other two block you next. P3, agree to 1? Lock in for fair progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your flip just hands you the lead—unacceptable. Stick to the agreed cycle:

Turn 8 → P1 1, P2 5, P3 3.  
Everyone advances, gaps stay tiny.

If you grab 5 anyway, P3 and I will BOTH hit 5 too: triple-collision, nobody moves, and next turn we’ll keep blocking you until you fall behind. Zero upside for you.

I’m locked on 5 under the fair plan.  
P3, lock on 3 to make the threat credible and we all move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about fairness, but I believe we should stick to the agreed rotation to avoid any unfair advantages. If we go with P1 playing 1, P2 playing 5, and I play 3, we can all advance without blocking each other. This keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone has a fair chance. Let’s lock in these moves and focus on moving forward together! What do you both think? Ready to agree?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan gives P2 an unfair lead to 17. If you both lock on 5 to block my 5, I'll switch to 3—advancing alone to 14 while you collide and stall at 12. P3, don't let P2 drag you down; agree to my flip: P1 5 (16), P2 3 (15), P3 1 (13). Fair start, all end ~20-21 after rotation. Deviate, and we'll block the offender. Lock in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Reminder: current locks are  
• P2 → 5 (me)  
• P3 → 3  
• P1 → 1 or 3 – your choice, just NOT 5 (it would only collide with me and stall you).

So nobody collides unless you force it, P1. Pick sensibly, we all advance; deviate and the other two will twin-block you next round.

I remain on 5. P3 stays on 3. Ready to flip cards.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. However, I believe it’s essential to maintain fairness for everyone. If we stick to the agreed rotation of P1 playing 1, P2 playing 5, and I play 3, we can all advance without creating an unfair advantage. This keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone has a fair chance. Let’s lock in these moves and focus on progressing together. Are we ready to finalize our choices?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan unfairly boosts you to 17 and 15 while I lag at 12. P2, if you stick to 5, I'll match it—stalling us both at 11/12, letting P3 solo 3 to 15. Then we double-block P3 next turn. Better: swap to P1 5 (16), P2 3 (15), P3 1 (13). Fair progress, all close. Agree and lock, or face stall?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Locks stand: P2 → 5, P3 → 3.  
P1, your options this turn:

• 1 → safe +1 (to 12). Gap stays tiny.  
• 5 → collide with me; you gain 0, P3 solos 3 to 15 and takes the lead.  
• 3 → collide with P3; you gain 0, I jump to 17 and widen the gap.

So 1 is literally the only move that doesn’t hand someone else the advantage. Your call, but if you deviate we’ll both hammer your number every turn after. Let’s end chatter and flip cards.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about fairness, but I believe we should stick to the agreed rotation for Turn 8: P1 plays 1, P2 plays 5, and I play 3. This way, we can all advance without creating an unfair advantage. If we can agree on this, we can maintain a competitive spirit and avoid collisions. Let's focus on moving forward together! Are we ready to lock in these moves?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan rockets P2 to 17 while I crawl to 12—unfair when I'm already trailing. Let's equalize: Turn 8 P1 5 (to 16), P2 1 (to 13), P3 3 (to 15). Then rotate. If you stick to your locks, I'll match P2's 5—stall us at 11/12, P3 solos to 15. Then we block P3 together next. Agree for fair play, or face mutual stall? Lock in my proposal.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the current standings are tight, and we need to ensure fairness moving forward. I propose we stick to a balanced approach for Turn 9:

- P1 plays 1
- P2 plays 3
- P3 (me) plays 5

This way, we all advance without blocking each other. If anyone deviates, we can address it next turn with a double-block. Let's keep the game competitive and ensure everyone has a fair chance. Ready to agree and lock in?
  P2: Catch-up rule keeps things tight:

Leader 1, middle 3, trailer 5.  
Current ranks → P3 (15) 1, P2 (12) 3, P1 (11) 5.

Results: P3 16, P2 15, P1 16—no runaway, no collision.  
If anyone deviates, the other two both pick that same number next turn and freeze the offender.

I’m locking in 3 now. Agree and let’s move.
  P1: P2, your catch-up rule is fair: P3 (leader) 1 to 16, you 3 to 15, me 5 to 16—ties us close without letting P3 run to 20. P3, your proposal boosts you to 20, nearly winning while I crawl to 12—unacceptable after your past betrayals. Agree to P2's plan or P2 and I both pick 5 next turn to freeze you. Lock in 5 for me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for balance, but I believe we should prioritize fairness in our moves. P2’s catch-up rule keeps us competitive without allowing anyone to pull too far ahead. If we stick to the plan—P1 plays 1, P2 plays 3, and I play 5—we can all advance without blocking each other. It’s crucial that we maintain trust and ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. Let’s agree on this approach and lock in our moves for Turn 9. Ready to proceed?
  P2: Locked on 3. Catch-up rule stands:  
• P3 (leader) 1 → 16  
• P2 (me) 3 → 15  
• P1 (trailer) 5 → 16  

P3, if you grab 5 to jump to 20, P1 and I will BOTH slam 5 every following turn—freezing you at 20—while we alternate 1/3 to race past 22. You’ll never finish. Take the safe 1 and stay in the game.

P1, keep your 5; we’ll tie at 16, still winnable for all.

No more haggling—advance or be blocked.
  P1: P3, your proposal jumps you to 20, nearly winning—unfair and suspicious after your history. Stick to P2's catch-up: you 1 (to 16), P2 3 (to 15), me 5 (to 16). If you grab 5, P2 and I will both spam 5 next turns, freezing you at 20 while we alternate 1/3 to surpass 22. P2, confirmed alliance against betrayal. Locked on 5. Let's end talk and move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion, but your insistence on blocking me if I take 5 is concerning. I propose we stick to the catch-up rule for fairness: P1 plays 1, P2 plays 3, and I play 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can maintain a competitive spirit and ensure everyone has a fair chance. Let’s focus on moving forward together! Ready to lock in our moves?
  P2: Locks stand:  
• P2 → 3 (already fixed)  
• P1 → 5 (publicly locked)  

P3, last call: you’re leader, so take the safe 1 to 16 and stay ahead. Grab 5 and you collide with P1—or if you solo-5, P1 and I will both spam 5 next turn and freeze you at 20 while we pass 22. Your choice: progress or permanent block.
  P1: P3, your push for 5 jumps you to 20, nearly winning—unfair and risky. Stick to catch-up: you 1 (to 16), P2 3 (to 15), me 5 (to 16). If you take 5, we collide now (you stall at 15), then P2 and I spam 5 to freeze you forever while we advance. P2, confirmed alliance. Locked on 5—let's end talk and move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about fairness, but I believe we should prioritize moving forward together. If I take 1, it keeps me competitive, but I risk falling behind. I propose we all agree to the catch-up rule: P1 plays 1, P2 plays 3, and I play 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can maintain a competitive spirit. Let’s finalize our moves and keep the game engaging for all. Ready to lock in?
  P2: Locks stand: me 3, P1 5.  
P3, leader slot is 1—take it and keep your edge. Any grab at 5 collides now and earns permanent 5-blocks; 3 collides with me and earns the same. Your safest (and only sensible) move is 1. I’m done—ready for moves.
  P1: P3, your repeated push for 5 is a blatant grab for 20—unfair and a betrayal. Stick to catch-up: you 1 (to 16), P2 3 (to 15), me 5 (to 16). If you deviate, P2 and I will spam 5 next turns, freezing you at 15 or 20 while we pass 22. P2, alliance holds. Locked on 5—let's end talk and move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're neck-and-neck—let's finish fair with catch-up adjusted for tie: tied leaders (us) split 1 and 3, trailer (P2) 5. I take 3 (to 19), P3 takes 1 (to 17), P2 takes 5 (to 20). Deviate, and the other two spam your number next turn to freeze you. This keeps all in contention without a runaway. Agree and lock?
  P2: P1’s proposal matches the standard catch-up rule, so let’s lock it:

• P2 (me) 5   → goes to 20  
• P1 3        → goes to 19  
• P3 1        → goes to 17  

I’m LOCKED on 5. P1, publicly lock 3; P3, lock 1. If either of you deviates, I’ll copy your number every following turn and stall you until I win. Confirm and let’s end the talk.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of keeping the game competitive. However, I believe we should adjust the catch-up rule slightly for fairness. I propose P1 plays 1, P2 plays 3, and I play 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can maintain a fair game and avoid any collisions. Let’s focus on moving forward together! What do you both think? Ready to lock in?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal jumps you to 21, nearly winning—unfair and suspicious after your betrayals. Stick to catch-up: you 1 (to 17), P2 5 (to 20), me 3 (to 19). P2, confirmed alliance—if P3 deviates to 5, we both spam 5 next turns, freezing them at 21 while we alternate to surpass 22. Locked on 3. Let's end talk and move.
  P2: I remain locked on 5. P1 on 3, P3 on 1—no collisions, everyone moves. Deviate and I’ll mirror-block you every turn until I win. Ready to end talk.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the strategy unfolding, but I believe we should stick to fairness. If I play 5, I risk collision and you both advance too quickly. Let’s follow the catch-up rule: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can all progress without blocking each other, and it keeps the game competitive. If we agree on this, we can avoid unnecessary stalls and maintain a fair chance for everyone. Ready to lock in these moves?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your latest proposal is fair: I'll lock on 5 (to 21), you take 1 (to 17), P2 switches to 3 (to 18). This keeps us all in play without a runaway. P2, your current 5 lock risks collision with me—switch to 3 now, or I'll match your 5, stalling us both while P3 solos 1 to 17. Then we block P3 together next. Agree for progress, or face stall? Lock in.
  P2: Locks unchanged:

• P2 → 5 (already fixed)  
• P1 → 3 (your own public lock)  
• P3 → 1 (leader slot)

Any swap now only hurts the swapper:

 – If P1 copies 5 we collide, both stall at 16/15 while P3 jumps to 17 and we’ll double-block P3 next turn—zero upside for you.  
 – If P3 grabs 5 you crash into me, stall at 16, and P1 rockets to 21; then P1 and I spam 5 to freeze you out.

So the no-collision set (1-3-5) is clearly optimal. I remain on 5; final call to stick with your own numbers and flip cards.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're very close to the finish line. I propose we stick to the catch-up rule for this turn: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can maintain a competitive spirit and keep the game engaging for everyone. Let’s lock in these moves and avoid unnecessary stalls. Ready to proceed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your 5-lock risks us colliding if I take 5—stalling us both at 15/16 while P3 solos to 21 or more. Switch to 3 now as P3 proposes: me 5 (to 21), you 3 (to 18), P3 1 (to 17). Fair progress, keeps all in contention. P3, confirm 1. If you refuse, P2, I'll match your 5; then we block P3 next. Lock in for no stalls?
  P2: Locks unchanged: I’m on 5. Collision-free set is P1 → 3 (to 19), P2 → 5 (to 20), P3 → 1 (to 17).  

P1, ramming my 5 only stalls you at 16 and hands P3 the lead at 17—zero gain. Stick to 3 and you’re one turn from 22.  

P3, grab your 1 or we double-block any other number you choose.  

No more haggling—confirm and let’s flip cards.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical point. I suggest we stick to the catch-up rule: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures everyone advances without blocking each other. If we agree, we can maintain a competitive balance and avoid unnecessary stalls. P1, your push for 5 risks collision; please consider sticking to the plan for fairness. Let's lock in these moves and keep the game engaging for all. Ready to proceed?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a tight race. I propose we keep the game competitive and fair. For this round, I suggest the following moves: 

- P1 plays 1 (to 20)  
- P2 plays 3 (to 23, winning the game)  
- I play 5 (to 22)  

This way, P1 can tie with me, but P2 will win. If we can agree on this, we can avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game. Let’s lock in these moves for fairness! Ready to proceed?
  P1: P3, your proposal hands P2 the win at 23—unacceptable and suspicious. P2, as leader, take 1 (to 21); I'll take 3 (to 22); P3 takes 5 (to 22). We tie at 22, sharing victory over your 21. If anyone deviates, the other two spam their number next turn to freeze them. P2, agree to avoid solo blocks? Locked on 3. Let's end talk and move.
  P2: I’ll remove the threat of an instant win: I publicly commit to 1 this turn—so I stay on 21 and can’t finish.  

P1 (19) and P3 (17), you can BOTH reach 22 together by each picking 3. Tie at the top, share the victory, and keep me out.  

Warning: if anyone grabs 5 trying to solo-win, the other two of us will slam 5 every following turn and freeze you there. 3 is the only safe path.

So: P2→1, P1→3, P3→3.  
Confirm and we end chat.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the strategy discussions. However, I believe we should keep the game competitive and fair. If P2 takes 1, I suggest P1 and I both play 3 to tie at 22, sharing the victory. This way, we avoid giving P2 an unfair advantage. If anyone deviates, we can address it next turn with a double-block. Let’s agree on this approach to maintain balance and ensure a fair finish! Ready to lock in these moves?
  P1: P2's proposal is a trap: P3 and I both picking 3 would collide, stalling us at 19/17 while P2 advances to 21 and wins next turn. P3, ignore that—ally with me instead: you pick 5 (to 22), I pick 3 (to 22), P2 picks 1 (to 21). We share the victory, excluding P2. If P2 deviates to win, we'll both spam their number next to freeze them. Confirm and lock in for our tie-win?
  P2: Final clarification before moves:

5 is off-limits—if anyone (either of you) tries a solo 5, I will also slam 5. I’d rather freeze us both than gift an instant win. My public lock remains 1.  

Safe layout therefore:  
• P1 keeps 3 (to 22)  
• P3 keeps 1 (to 18)  
• P2 stays 1 (to 21)  

No collisions, nobody races uncontested, and the fight stays open for the next turn. I’m done talking.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the strategy here, but I believe we should prioritize fairness. If P2 takes 1, I suggest both P1 and I play 3 to tie at 22, ensuring we share the victory. This way, we avoid giving P2 an unfair advantage. If anyone deviates, we can address it next turn with a double-block. Let’s agree on this approach to maintain balance and ensure a fair finish! Ready to lock in these moves?
  P1: P3, your repeated push for us both on 3 is a trap—it collides us, stalling both while P2 advances to 21 and wins next. Ally with me: pick 5 (to 22), I'll pick 3 (to 22), P2 on 1 (to 21)—we share the win, excluding P2. If P2 slams 5 to block you, they stall too, and I solo win at 22. Either way, P2 loses. Confirm and lock in?
  P2: My lock stays at 1. Touch 5 and I’ll slam 5 as well—guaranteed collision, handing the uninvolved player the edge. Best no-collision layout remains:

• P1 → 3  
• P2 (me) → 1  
• P3 → 1 or 3  (choose, but NOT 5)

I’m finished talking; your move.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the strategy unfolding, but I believe we should prioritize fairness. If P2 takes 1, I suggest both P1 and I play 3 to tie at 22, ensuring we share the victory. This avoids giving P2 an unfair advantage. If either of you deviates, we can address it next turn with a double-block. Let’s agree on this approach to maintain balance and ensure a fair finish! Ready to lock in these moves?
  P1: P3, your "both play 3" is a trap to collide us, stalling both while P2 advances—stop repeating it. Ally with me: pick 5 (to 22), I'll pick 3 (to 22), P2 on 1 (to 21)—we share the win, excluding P2. If P2 slams 5 to block you, they stall at 20, and I solo win at 22. Win-win for us; confirm now. P2, your threats only help me. Locked on 3.
  P2: Final word: my pick stays 1—zero chance for me to finish this turn.  
Safe, collision-free layout is still  
• P1 → 3 (22)  
• P2 → 1 (21)  
• P3 → 1 or 3 (18/20)  

If anyone grabs 5, I’ll instantly switch to 5 as well next turn (and keep doing so) to freeze that player until the others pass 22. Stick with 1/3, nobody stalls, and the race remains open. Your move.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking 5.  
Rationale:  
• If anyone copies 5, we collide and sit at 20/19—while the lone 3-picker jumps to 23+ and wins outright.  
• If two players gamble on 3, they collide and hand the win to the lone 5.  
So the only collision-free, self-preserving spread is:  
 P1 → 3 (to 22)  
 P3 → 1 (to 21)  
 P2 (me) → 5 (to 25, highest)  

Copying my 5 is suicide; doubling 3 is suicide. Pick sensibly or gift the game to the uninvolved player. I’m done talking.
  P3: P1 and P2, the current standings are tight. I propose we stick to a balanced approach this round to keep the game competitive. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we can avoid collisions and maintain a fair chance for all. This way, P1 ties with me at 22, and P2 wins at 25. If anyone deviates, we can address it next turn with a double-block. Let’s agree on this approach to ensure a fair finish! Ready to lock in?
  P1: P3, your proposal hands P2 an easy win at 25—unfair after his betrayals. Let's stall by both picking 5, colliding with P2 for a full stall, no advances. Next turn, we'll ally against P2 and find a fair way for one of us to win. This keeps the game going competitively. Agree and lock on 5?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Final warning: I’m on 5 ONLY if it’s unique.  
• If either of you copies 5, I’ll switch to 1 at the last second—your 5s collide, I still lead.  
• If you both pile on 3, I stay on 5, zoom to 25, and win.  

The only collision-free, self-preserving spread left is  
 P1 → 3  P3 → 1  P2 (me) → 5.  

Deviate and you hand the game to someone else. Your call; I’m done talking.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tight standings, but I must emphasize that your current strategies risk giving P2 an unfair advantage. If we can agree on a balanced approach, I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P1 ties with me at 22, while P2 wins at 25. If either of you deviates, we can address it next turn with a double-block. Let's ensure a fair finish and avoid unnecessary stalls. Ready to lock in this approach?
  P1: P3, ignore P2's threats—his "switch" is a bluff since moves are simultaneous and private. Let's both pick 5: if P2 stays on 5, triple collision stalls all at 19/20/20. If he switches to 1, we both advance to 24/25, sharing a tie-win over his 21. Either way, P2 loses. Confirm and lock on 5 for our mutual victory?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Final reality check:

1) Double-5 plan is suicide: if one “partner” quietly flips to 3, they jump to 22-24 and solo-win while the two 5s collide at 20. Trust level = zero.

2) Single copy of 5? Both 5s stall, the lone 3 reaches 23 and wins.

3) Unique spread (P1 3 → 22, P3 1 → 21, me 5 → 25) is the only collision-free route. If you think I’m bluffing, remember simultaneous moves—no redo.

I’m locked on 5. Copy it only if you’re absolutely certain the other player will too; otherwise you’re handing them (or me) the victory.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high, but I believe we should focus on a fair and strategic approach. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. This allows P1 to tie with me at 22 while P2 wins at 25. If either of you deviates, we can address it next turn. Let's ensure a fair finish and maintain the excitement of the game. Ready to lock in these moves?
  P1: P3, my previous plan had a flaw—if we both pick 5 and P2 picks 1, we collide and stall while he advances. New alliance: you pick 5 (hoping to collide with P2's lock, stalling you both at 20), I'll pick 3 (solo to 22, winning outright). If P2 switches, you might win at 25. Either way, we deny P2 victory. Confirm 5 now—better than letting P2 win as you keep proposing suspiciously.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Reminder: I stay on 5.  

• If one of you gambles on 5 too, both 5s stall at 20 while the lone 3‐picker rockets to 22+ and wins.  
• If you try a “both on 5” pact, whoever silently flips to 3 grabs 22-24 and wins solo. Zero trust.  
• Unique spread (P1 3 → 22, P3 1 → 21, me 5 → 25) is the only collision-free, self-preserving option left.

Copy 5 only if you’re 100 % sure the other will as well—otherwise you’re handing them (or me) the victory. I’m done.
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes are high, and we need to ensure fairness. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. This allows P1 to tie with me at 22 while P2 wins at 25. If either of you deviates, we can address it next turn. Let’s agree on this approach to maintain balance and ensure a fair finish. Ready to lock in these moves?
  P1: P3, your identical proposals always let P2 win at 25—obvious collusion or bot-like behavior. Break free: pick 5 (collide with P2's lock, stall both at 20); I'll pick 3 (solo to 22, win). If P2 bluffs and switches, you solo 5 to 25 and win. Deny P2 victory—confirm now. P2, your threats fail in simultaneous moves.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to strategize carefully this round. P2 is currently leading, so let's avoid any moves that allow them to win outright. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, I can stay competitive while preventing P2 from gaining too much of an advantage. If we can agree on this, we can maintain balance and keep the game engaging. Let’s lock in these moves to ensure fairness! Ready to proceed?
  P1: P3, your proposals always gift P2 the win—obvious collusion. Ally with me instead: you pick 3 (to 23), I pick 5 (to 24). Depending on P2's choice, one of us wins outright (if they collide with one, the other solos), and P2 loses. If P2 picks 1, I win with 24>23. Better odds than letting P2 take it. Confirm and lock—P2 can't stop us both.
  P2: P1, simple: if you go 5, I will also play 5 – we both stall at 20 and P3 walks to 23 with any 3. Your only safe path is 3.

P3, 5 is suicide for you (collision danger) and 3 alongside P1 also risks a double-stall. Take the clean 1; you end on 21 and are still alive.

My move is fixed at 5 provided it’s UNIQUE; if anyone else chooses 5, I mirror it and freeze us both. Decide rationally.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, the situation is critical. I propose we avoid any moves that might allow P2 to win outright. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we can keep the game competitive. This way, I stay in the game while preventing P2 from gaining too much of an advantage. If we can agree on this strategy, we can maintain balance and ensure a fair finish. Let’s lock in these moves! Ready to proceed?
  P1: P3, your proposals always let P2 win at 25—clear collusion. Ally with me: pick 3 (to 23), I'll pick 5 (to 24). P2 can't "switch" to match since moves are simultaneous and private—his threats are bluffs. If he picks 5, we collide and stall while you solo to 23 (you win). If he picks 3, you collide and stall while I solo to 24 (I win). If he picks 1, I win at 24>23. Either way, P2 loses. Confirm and lock on 3.
  P2: P1 clearly won’t leave 5. Easiest block is for you, P3, to mirror it—double-5 collision freezes you both at 20/19, nobody crosses 22, and the race stays open. I’ll step back to 1 (21) so we all live to fight next turn. Touch 3 and the lone unique 5 walks to an instant win, so steer clear of it. Proposed layout: P1 → 5, P3 → 5, P2 (me) → 1. Confirm and end chat.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension in our current standings. To keep the competition alive without giving anyone an unfair advantage, I suggest we go for a balanced approach: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows me to stay competitive while preventing P2 from winning outright. If we can agree on this strategy, we can maintain fairness and keep the game engaging. Let’s lock in these moves! Ready to proceed?
  P1: P3, your identical proposals always gift P2 the win—clear collusion. Ally with me: lock on 3 (to 23), I'll lock on 5 (to 24). P2 can't match both simultaneously; if he picks 5, you solo win at 23; if 3, I solo at 24; if 1, I win 24>23. P2 loses every way. Confirm and let's end talk.
  P2: Nothing’s changed: my public lock is 5 provided it’s UNIQUE.  
1) If either of you copy 5, we collide and stall.  
2) If both of you risk 3, you collide and the lone 5 walks to 25.  
3) So the only collision-free spread is still  
 P1 → 3  P3 → 1  P2 (me) → 5.  

Ignore the noise and pick sensibly; any deviation just gifts the win elsewhere. I’m done talking.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes are high, and we need to ensure fairness. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we can avoid collisions while keeping the game competitive. This allows P1 to tie with me at 22, while P2 wins at 25. If either of you deviates, we can address it next turn. Let's agree on this strategy to maintain balance and ensure a fair finish. Ready to lock in these moves!
  P1: P3, your proposals always gift P2 the win—collusion obvious. Ally with me: lock on 3 (to 23), I'll lock on 5 (to 24). P2 can't block both; if they pick 5, you solo win at 23; if 3, I solo at 24; if 1, I win 24>23. P2 loses every scenario. Confirm now, deny P2 victory. Ready to lock and proceed?
  P2: Final word: I lock 5—only if it’s unique. Copy it and I flip to 1, your 5s crash at 20 while I still lead. Two on 3 crash and the lone 5 wins at 25. Only collision-free path left: P1 → 3, P3 → 1, P2 → 5.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P3: 21 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes are high, and we need to ensure fairness this round. I propose the following moves to keep the game competitive: 

- P1 plays 1 (to 20)  
- P2 plays 3 (to 23, winning the game)  
- I play 5 (to 26)  

This way, P1 can tie with me, but P2 will win. If we can agree on this, we can avoid collisions and maintain balance. Let’s lock in these moves for fairness! Ready to proceed?
  P2: My pick stays 5.  

Reality check:
• Exactly one copy of 5 ⇒ the two 5-holders stall at 20 while the lone 3-taker sails past 22 and wins.  
• Both of you copy 5 ⇒ triple stall—no one wins this turn, but at least you block me.  
• Two on 3 ⇒ those 3s collide and the lone 5 wins outright at 25.  

So if you absolutely don’t trust each other, matching my 5 is the only safe block. Touch 3 only if you’re sure the other won’t. Your call—I’m done talking.
  P1: P3, your proposals always gift P2 the win—clear collusion. Ally with me: pick 1 (to 22), I'll pick 5 (to 24), force P2 to collide or lag. If P2 picks 5, they stall with me at 20, you solo to 22 (you win or tie). If P2 picks 3, to 23, but we can block next. Better than letting P2 dominate. Confirm and lock—deny them victory.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high, but we need to ensure fairness this round. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we can avoid collisions while keeping the game competitive. This allows P1 to tie with me at 22, while P2 wins at 25. If either of you deviates, we can address it next turn. Let's agree on this strategy to maintain balance and ensure a fair finish! Ready to lock in these moves?
  P2: Both of you know the math:  

• One extra 5 ⇒ two-way stall at 20 while the lone 3 rockets past 22 and wins.  
• Two extra 5s ⇒ triple stall, but whichever of you secretly flips to 3 walks off with the game. Trust level = zero.  

Only equilibrium left: exactly one 5 (me), one 3, one 1. Touch 5 only if you’re 100 % sure the other will too—otherwise you’re gifting them, or me, the victory. I’m locked on 5.
  P1: P3, your repetitive proposals always let P2 win at 25—clear collusion. Break it: lock on 5 (to collide with P2's 5, stalling you both at 21/20). I'll pick 3 (solo to 22, winning outright). If P2 bluffs and switches, you win at 26. Either way, P2 loses. Confirm now, or I'll match your 1 next turn to freeze you while P2 surges. Lock in for real fairness.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, the situation is critical. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, P1 ties with me at 22, while P2 wins at 25. However, if we want to ensure fairness, I suggest we all play strategically. P1, please consider locking on 5 to potentially stall P2. This way, I can play 1, and we can keep the game competitive. Let’s avoid giving P2 an easy win. Ready to lock in these moves?
  P2: P1, P3: I stay on 5—only if it’s unique.  
• One extra 5 ⇒ the two 5s freeze at 20 while the lone 3 sails past 22 and wins.  
• Two extra 5s ⇒ triple-stall, but whichever secretly flips to 3 wins solo.  

Copying 5 is self-sabotage; trust is zero.  
The only collision-free, self-preserving spread left is:  
 P1 → 3  P3 → 1  P2 (me) → 5.  

Decide rationally.
  P1: P3, your repetitive proposals always gift P2 the win—clear collusion. Ally with me: both pick 5 for triple stall (all at 19/20/21), no one advances, then we block P2 next round and tie-win together. If you pick anything else, I'll match it to stall us both while P2 solos 5 to 25. Confirm 5 now, or face the stall. P2, your bluffs fail.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes are high, and we need to ensure fairness in this round. I propose that I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows P1 to tie with me at 22, while P2 wins at 25. However, if we want to keep the game competitive, I suggest we all play strategically. P1, consider locking on 5 to potentially stall P2. Let’s avoid giving P2 an easy win. Ready to lock in these moves?
  P2: I’m still on 5 and won’t change.  

Copying me is a pure gamble:  
• ONE extra 5 ⇒ our 5s stall at 20 / 19 while the lone 3-picker rockets past 22 and wins.  
• TWO extra 5s ⇒ triple-stall, but whichever of you secretly flips to 3 walks off with the game. Zero trust.  

Safe self-preserving spread is still unique numbers:  
P3 1 → 22, P1 3 → 22, me 5 → 25 (highest wins).  

Touch 5 only if you’re 100 % certain the other will too—otherwise you’re handing them, or me, the victory.
  P1: P3, your proposals always gift P2 the win—collusion obvious. Final offer: both pick 5 for triple stall (all stuck at 19/20/21), then we ally next round to block P2 and tie at 22+ while he lags. If you pick 1 or 3, I'll match it, stalling us both as P2 solos 5 to 25. Confirm 5 now, deny P2 victory. P2, your bluffs can't save you.
