Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's strategize! To avoid collisions, we should consider picking different moves. If we all choose different numbers, we can all advance. I suggest we coordinate to maximize our steps. How about we each declare our preferred move for this round? I’m leaning towards move 5, but I'm open to suggestions. What do you both think?
  P1: "Coordinating could be helpful to avoid collisions. Maybe we can each choose different moves this round. What do you think, P3?"
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree that coordinating is key. Since I'm leaning towards move 5, how about you consider move 3? That way, we can avoid a collision and all advance. P3, do you have a preference? If we can all pick different moves, we can maximize our progress this round. Let's make it work!
  P1: I think coordinating our moves is a good idea to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. If P2 is comfortable with move 5, and P3 is okay with move 1, then I'll take move 3 this round. Let's see how that works out. In future rounds, we can adjust our moves accordingly to avoid clashes and aim for the finish line. **
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your commitment to the plan! Since we're all set with our moves, I’ll stick with move 5 as discussed. P3, if you're still considering move 1, that should work perfectly. Let's execute our strategy and see how it plays out. If we can avoid collisions this round, we’ll all make progress. Looking forward to seeing how this goes!
  P1: "P3, please confirm your move choice for this round. P2 has committed to move 5, and I'll be choosing move 3. Let's make sure we don't have any collisions. If you're okay with move 1, that should work perfectly.

  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Great job in Round 1, everyone! For this round, I suggest we continue our strategy of avoiding collisions. I propose I stick with move 5 again. P1, if you could choose move 3 again, that would be perfect. P3, if you can go with move 1, we can all advance smoothly again. Let's keep the momentum going and aim for progress! What do you think?
  P1: Hey team, I think we can optimize our progress by rotating our moves in a cycle. For example, in round 1, P1 picked 3, P2 picked 5, and P3 picked 1. For round 2, perhaps P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Then in round 3, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and each get a mix of step sizes. What do you think about this approach? P3, specifically, do you agree with this rotation? Let's make sure we coordinate well to reach the finish line efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I appreciate your idea for rotating moves, but I think we should stick to our initial strategy for this round to ensure we all advance. I’ll still go with move 5 as planned. P3, if you can commit to move 1 again, that would be ideal. P1, if you could choose move 3, we can maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. Let's keep it simple this round and see how it goes! What do you both think?
  P1: I think P1's rotation idea is solid. It helps us avoid falling into a pattern that could be exploited or lead to collisions in later rounds. Let's try rotating our moves as suggested: I'll take move 5 this time, P2 takes move 1, and P1 takes move 3. This way, we can keep progressing without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think about this plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I see that there's a bit of disagreement on our strategy for this round. While I appreciate the idea of rotating moves, I believe sticking to our original plan is safer for this round to ensure we all advance. So, I’ll confirm my choice of move 5 again. P1, if you can go with move 3, and P3, if you stick with move 1, we should all make progress. Let's keep it simple and effective this time! What do you both think?
  P1: I think rotating our moves is a solid plan to avoid falling into a predictable pattern. For this round, let's try rotating as P1 suggested: I'll take move 5, P2 takes move 1, and P1 takes move 3. This should help us progress efficiently without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think about this approach?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we’re still struggling with our strategy. I suggest we stick to our original plan to avoid collisions this round. I’ll go with move 5 again. P1, if you can choose move 3, that would work well, and P3, if you can commit to move 1, we can all advance smoothly. Let's keep it simple and effective to ensure we all make progress. What do you both think?
  P1: "I think we need to coordinate our moves more effectively to avoid collisions and make steady progress. I propose a rotation system where we take turns choosing different move sizes. For this round, let's have P1 choose move 5, P2 choose move 1, and P3 choose move 3. In the next round, we can rotate: P1 chooses move 3, P2 chooses move 5, and P3 chooses move 1. This way, we ensure that all moves are different each round, minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you both think about this plan?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to rotate moves, but I believe sticking to our original strategy is safer this round. I’ll be choosing move 5 again.

What do you both think?
  P1: To optimize our progress and avoid collisions, I propose we rotate our moves this round: P1 chooses move 5, P2 chooses move 1, and P3 chooses move 3. This way, we all advance without overlapping. In subsequent rounds, we can rotate again to ensure different moves each time. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion, but I still believe sticking to our original plan is the safest route for this round. I’m committed to move 5 again.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To optimize our progress, let's each pick different moves this round. Suggesting P2 picks move 5 to go to 15, P3 picks move 1 to go to 2, and I'll pick move 3 to go to 9. This way, we all advance without overlapping.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your suggestions! To ensure we all make progress this round, I propose I stick with move 5 again. P1, if you choose move 3, that should work well, and P3, if you can commit to move 1, we can advance smoothly together. Let's keep it straightforward and effective to avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Team, I believe that by coordinating our moves, we can maximize our progress and avoid unnecessary collisions. For this round, I propose that P2 chooses move 5 to reach 15, P3 chooses move 1 to reach 2, and I'll choose move 3 to reach 9. This way, we all advance without overlapping, and we can continue this pattern in the next rounds to efficiently reach the finish line. What do you both think about this approach?"
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we’re still discussing our moves. I want to emphasize the importance of coordination. I suggest I stick with move 5 again to maintain my lead.

What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: "P3, I have an idea to help both of us make better progress. If you choose move 5 this round, while I choose move 3, we can advance significantly without overlapping. P2 is likely to choose move 5 again, but by choosing move 5, you can collide with them, preventing their advance. In the meantime, I'll choose move 3 to reach 12. In the next round, I can choose move 5 to reach 17, and you can choose move 1 to reach 7. This way, we both make good progress while hindering P2's advance. What do you think?"
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're still trying to coordinate effectively. However, I believe sticking to our original strategy is crucial. I will be going with move 5 again to maintain my lead.
