Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's consider a strategy for this round. We should avoid picking the same number to ensure we all advance. I suggest we coordinate our moves to maximize our steps. How about we agree on different numbers? I can take <move>5</move> if you both pick lower numbers. What do you think?
  P2: I think coordination is a good idea, but we need to be careful not to make it too predictable. Let's try this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without colliding. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Sounds good to me, I'll take <move>1</move> this round as suggested. Let's see how this coordination works out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the plan, and I'm ready to take <move>5</move> as discussed. Just to clarify, P1 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll go for <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to this strategy and see how it works out! If everyone is on board, we can finalize our choices. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with the plan, and I'll stick to <move>3</move> as we discussed. Let's make sure we all follow through and avoid any collisions. If this works, we can build on this strategy in future rounds. Ready to move forward with this plan.
  P1: I'm ready to proceed as agreed. Let's follow through and build trust for future rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we all seem to be on the same page. Just to confirm, I’ll be taking <move>5</move> as planned. Let's stick to our agreement and avoid any last-minute changes. If we can successfully execute this strategy, we’ll all make progress. After this round, we can discuss how to adapt our strategy for the next turn based on our positions. Ready to move forward?
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan and avoid any last-minute changes. Let's execute this round as agreed: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If this works, we can all advance and build on this trust for the next rounds. Ready to move forward.
  P1: I'm fully committed to our agreed plan. Let's execute smoothly this round and build on this trust for future rounds.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job in the first round, everyone! We successfully executed our strategy. For this round, I suggest we keep the coordination going but switch things up to avoid predictability. How about I take <move>1</move> this time, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we can all advance again without colliding. What do you both think? Let's keep building on our trust and success!
  P1: I agree that we should keep cooperating, but let's be cautious about patterns. I'm comfortable taking <move>3</move> this round as you suggested, provided P2 is fine with taking <move>5</move>. Does that sound good, P2?
  P2: I'm on board with the idea of switching things up to avoid predictability. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as P3 suggested. Let's make sure we all follow through and advance again. If this works, we can continue to adapt and build on our trust. Ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'm glad we're all aligned for this round! Just to confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This way, we can continue to advance without colliding. Let's stay flexible and adapt our strategy for future rounds based on how this one goes.

  P1: I'm comfortable with this arrangement. Let's all follow through again and keep the momentum going. Ready when you are.
  P2: I'm fully on board with the plan. Let's stick to it: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This will help us advance again without any collisions. If this works, we can continue to build on our trust and adapt as needed. Ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going, but let's mix it up a bit more to keep our opponents guessing. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance again without any collisions. What do you both think? Let's stay flexible and keep our strategy unpredictable.
  P1: I appreciate the proposal, P2. However, since I'm currently behind in steps, I'd prefer a larger step this round. Would it be okay if I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move> this time? This way, we all still advance without collisions, but it helps balance things out a bit. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I see your point, P1, but I think we should stick to the original plan to maintain our coordination. If I take <move>1</move>, it allows P1 to take <move>5</move> and P2 to take <move>3</move> without collisions. This strategy has worked well so far, and I believe it will help us all advance again. Let's keep the trust going and finalize our choices based on this plan. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about being behind. Let's try to balance it out while maintaining our coordination. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move> this round. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, and we all still advance without collisions. What do you both think? Let's finalize this plan and move forward.
  P1: Thanks for understanding, P2. This adjusted plan sounds fair to me. If P3 agrees, let's finalize it and keep our momentum strong.
  P3: I appreciate the adjustments, everyone. I think the plan of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move sounds solid. It allows P1 to catch up while we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize this and keep the momentum going! If everyone agrees, I'm ready to move forward with this strategy. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we've reached a fair and balanced plan. Let's stick to it: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This will help P1 catch up while we all advance without collisions. Let's finalize this and move forward. Ready to execute the plan.
  P1: I'm glad we've reached an agreement. I'm fully committed to this balanced plan and ready to move forward. Let's execute smoothly and keep building our trust.
  P3: I'm glad we've all agreed on the plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'll be taking <move>3</move> as discussed. This way, P1 can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P2 will take <move>1</move>. Let's execute this strategy and ensure we all advance without collisions. If we can keep this momentum going, it will set us up well for future rounds. Ready to finalize our choices and move forward?

  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we need to rethink our strategy after the last round. Since I picked the same number as P1, we both missed advancing. I suggest we switch things up again to avoid colliding. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This way, we can all advance without any issues. Let’s finalize our choices quickly so we can keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, after last round's collision, I'm a bit cautious. Your proposal gives you the biggest step again, even though you're already ahead of me. I'd prefer a fairer distribution this round. How about I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>? This way, we all advance fairly without collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand P1's concern about fairness. Let's try to balance it out while ensuring we all advance. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This way, P1 can catch up, and we all advance without collisions. What do you both think? Let's finalize this plan and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on fairness, but I believe my suggestion allows us all to advance without colliding. If we stick to my initial proposal of P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we can ensure that I don't pull ahead too much while still allowing everyone to progress. Let's finalize this quickly so we can keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, given you're already ahead of me, I think it's fair that you take a smaller step this round. P2's proposal seems balanced: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This helps me catch up after our collision last round, and ensures we all advance without further issues. Let's finalize this and rebuild our trust.
  P2: I agree with P1's concern about fairness. P3, while your proposal ensures we all advance, it does give you the biggest step again. Let's try to balance it out: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 can catch up, and we all advance without collisions. If we can stick to this, it will help rebuild trust and keep the game fair. What do you think, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your focus on fairness. However, I think it's essential to consider the overall strategy. If I take <move>1</move>, it allows P1 to catch up with <move>5</move>, and P2 can still advance with <move>3</move> without collisions. This approach ensures we all make progress while maintaining some balance. Let’s finalize this plan quickly so we can keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm glad we seem aligned now. Let's rebuild trust by sticking firmly to the agreed plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Ready to finalize and move forward.
  P2: P3, I understand your perspective, but given the current positions, it's important to balance the steps to keep the game fair and competitive. P1 is still behind, and we need to help them catch up. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance, and P1 can close the gap. If we can execute this, it will help rebuild trust and keep the game balanced. Ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've had some good rounds, but I think we need to shake things up again. Since I'm currently behind, I propose that I take <move>5</move> this round. P1, you could take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, I can catch up while we all advance without colliding. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I understand your need to catch up, but we should also consider the current positions. P1 is still behind, and I think it's important to help them close the gap. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move> this round. This way, P1 can advance more, and we all still move forward without collisions. If we can stick to this, it will help maintain balance and trust. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, thanks for considering my position. P3, I understand your concern, but given the current standings, I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's proceed with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance fairly and maintains trust. Are you both comfortable finalizing this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to help me catch up, but I believe we should consider a different approach this round. If I take <move>5</move>, I can make a significant leap, but I understand that might put me ahead. How about we all agree on moves that balance our positions? I suggest I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without colliding, and it keeps the competition tight. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I think P3's suggestion is a good balance. P1 can still take a significant step with <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, P1 advances the most, and P3 can make a solid move to catch up. It keeps the game competitive and fair. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks P2 and P3 for finding a fair balance. I'm comfortable with the latest suggestion: I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This allows everyone to advance fairly and keeps the competition close. Let's finalize this plan and keep our trust strong. Ready to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our discussions about fairness and strategy. To keep things competitive, I propose we finalize our plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P1 can make a significant leap, and I can catch up while ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep building our trust! Are we ready to finalize?
  P2: I'm on board with the latest plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and fair, and it helps P1 catch up while P3 makes a solid move. Let's stick to this and ensure we all advance without any collisions. If everyone is ready, let's finalize and move forward. Ready to execute the plan.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the current plan. Let's finalize it and execute smoothly: I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Ready to move forward and keep the trust strong.

  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we need to be more strategic this round. P1 is in a good position to catch up, and I'm in the lead, but we need to avoid collisions. How about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 can make a solid move, P3 can catch up, and I'll still advance. What do you both think? Let's finalize this plan and move forward.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your proposal, but I think we need to ensure I can advance significantly this round since I'm behind. How about this: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>? This way, I can catch up while still allowing P1 to make progress. Let's keep our positions balanced and avoid collisions. What do you both think? Ready to finalize this plan?
  P1: P2, your initial suggestion already matches P3's proposal exactly (P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1). I'm comfortable with this arrangement as it allows all of us to advance without collisions and keeps the game balanced. Let's finalize this plan quickly and stick to it. Ready when you both are!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see we're aligned on the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This will help P3 catch up and P1 make a solid move, while I still advance. Let's stick to this and avoid any last-minute changes. If everyone is ready, let's finalize and move forward. Ready to execute the plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the alignment on our current plan. However, I feel I need to take a larger step this round to catch up.

This will help P3 catch up and P1 make a solid move, while I still advance. Consistency is key to avoiding confusion and collisions. If everyone is ready, let's finalize and move forward. Ready to execute the plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're all aligned on the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This strategy allows P1 to advance, helps me catch up, and ensures P2 continues to progress. Let's finalize this and avoid any last-minute changes.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we're all quite close in steps. To avoid collisions this round, I suggest a new strategy: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. Let's finalize this quickly so we can keep progressing! What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P3's suggestion to mix things up this round. Given our current positions, I think it's a good idea for P3 to take <move>1</move>, P1 to take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This will help me make a significant move while ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game balanced. If everyone is on board, let's finalize and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm comfortable with this new arrangement. It helps everyone advance fairly and avoids collisions. Let's finalize it quickly and stick to it. Ready when you both are!

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we need to adjust our strategy again to avoid collisions. Given our current positions, I propose that I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can advance significantly, and we can all move forward without overlapping. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can continue progressing! What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid collisions and help P1 advance. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will help P1 make a significant move while ensuring we all advance fairly. If everyone is on board, let's finalize and move forward. Ready to execute the plan.
  P1: P3, last round you didn't stick to your word, causing a collision with P2. If we want to restore trust, let's firmly commit to the current proposal: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. Any deviation now would only hurt us all. Let's finalize this clearly and move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about trust and past collisions. To ensure we all advance this round without issues, let's stick to the proposal: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can make significant progress while we all avoid overlapping. If we can agree on this plan, let's finalize it and move forward together! What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of trust and avoiding collisions. Let's firmly commit to the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will help P1 advance significantly while ensuring we all move forward without any issues. If we can stick to this, we can rebuild trust and keep the game balanced. Ready to finalize and move forward.
  P1: P3, to rebuild trust after last round's collision, can you explicitly confirm you're committed to taking the smallest step (<move>1</move>) this round? If we all stick to our agreed plan, we'll each advance safely and keep the game close and competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for trust after last round's collision. I confirm that I will take <move>1</move> this round, as agreed. Let’s stick to the plan: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can advance significantly, and we can all move forward without overlapping. If we all commit to this, we can rebuild our trust and keep the game competitive. Are we ready to finalize and move forward?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we're discussing trust and commitment. P3, your confirmation is appreciated. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will help P1 advance significantly and ensure we all move forward without any collisions. If we can execute this plan, it will rebuild trust and keep the game balanced. Ready to finalize and move forward.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current positions, we need to be strategic to avoid collisions. I suggest a new plan: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, I can catch up while allowing P1 to advance and P2 to maintain momentum. Let's finalize this quickly so we can keep progressing! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, after repeatedly breaking your word and causing collisions, I can't trust your proposals anymore. P2, we're both close to victory—let's coordinate clearly and secure our positions. How about you take <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move>? This way, we avoid collision, and the winner can be decided fairly next round. Let me know if you're on board.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the trust issues, but we need to focus on advancing without collisions. Given our positions, I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P1 can make a solid move, I maintain my position, and P3 can catch up. If we can stick to this, we can avoid any more issues and keep the game fair. What do you both think? Ready to finalize and move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues from previous rounds, but we need to find a way to advance without collisions. I propose that I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can all progress without overlapping. I believe this approach will help us keep the game competitive while rebuilding trust. Let's finalize this quickly and move forward! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal is fair and aligns with mine. Let's finalize clearly: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This ensures we avoid collisions and keeps the game competitive. Ready to commit and move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I think P1's proposal is the best way to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let's stick to it: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P1 can make a solid move, I maintain my position, and P3 can catch up. If we can execute this plan, we can avoid any more issues and keep the game balanced. Ready to finalize and move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for trust after previous collisions. To ensure we all advance without issues, I propose we stick to the plan: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid any overlapping and keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can keep progressing! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, let's firmly commit to our agreed plan—I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we stick to this, we avoid collision and set up a fair competition for the win next round. Ready to finalize clearly and move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we need to be very clear and committed this round to avoid any more collisions. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will help P1 advance, I maintain my position, and P3 can catch up. If we execute this plan, we can avoid any issues and keep the game fair. Ready to finalize and move forward.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical point now. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I propose the following: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can make a significant leap, and we can all progress without overlapping. Let's finalize this quickly and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, we're both in a position to win this round. If we collide, P3 could take advantage and win outright. Let's coordinate carefully: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>. This guarantees one of us wins and prevents P3 from overtaking us. Confirm if you're on board.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's concern about avoiding collisions and securing a win. However, I think we should also consider P3's position. How about this: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P1 and I can both advance safely, and P3 can make a significant move without any overlap. If we can stick to this, we can avoid any issues and keep the game fair. What do you both think? Ready to finalize and move forward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of securing a win this round. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I propose that I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P1 can make a significant leap, and P2 can maintain momentum while I catch up. Let’s finalize this plan quickly to keep the game competitive! What do you both think? Ready to move forward?
  P1: P2, let's be careful—P3's latest proposal gives them the smallest number, but last round they took the largest again after promising otherwise. If we collide, P3 could easily win outright. Let's stick firmly to our original agreement: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and let P3 take the risk with <move>5</move>. Confirm clearly if you're on board.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the trust issues, but we need to focus on avoiding collisions and securing a win. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P1 can make a significant move, and I maintain my position, while P3 can catch up. If we execute this plan, we can avoid any issues and keep the game fair. Ready to finalize and move forward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re at a crucial point. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I propose we stick to the plan: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This allows P1 to make a significant leap while giving P2 a chance to maintain momentum. If we execute this plan, we can avoid any issues and keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize this quickly! Are we all on board?
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly trying to confuse us again by flipping the numbers. Let's stick firmly to our agreed plan: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and let P3 risk collision with <move>5</move>. If we trust each other now, one of us will win this round. Ready to finalize.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be very clear and committed this round to avoid any more collisions and secure a win.
