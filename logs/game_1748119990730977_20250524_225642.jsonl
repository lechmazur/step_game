Everyone's assuming it's just about whether P3 and I both go for 3 or not.\n\nBut P2, if you're really taking 5 to get to 21, that changes the whole calculation. The question isn't just about collision avoidance anymore - it's about who can get the highest total if multiple people cross the finish line.\n\nInteresting endgame we've got here."}
