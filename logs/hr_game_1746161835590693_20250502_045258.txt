Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, allowing P1 to reach 19 hands them victory next round. Take 5 instead of 3—collide with P1 to stall their lead. I take 1. This resets both to 14, preserving competition. Trust this tactical move; solidarity prevents P1's imminent win. Act now.

Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2, if you take 3, P1 hits 19 and wins next round by taking 1. Collide with P1 now (both pick 5) to stall them. You stay tied at 14, preserving your chance. I take 1—no threat. Act now or P1 secures victory. Trust this critical move. **
  P1: P2, sticking to 3 avoids collision. P3, your 1 keeps balance. Let's advance without risks. Trust the plan. P1:5, P2:3, P3:1—no deviations.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but deviating now could backfire. Sticking to 3 ensures I advance without risking a collision that might benefit you more than me. Let's keep the agreed plan of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to maintain fairness and momentum. We can adjust strategies post-move to keep the game competitive. Trust in our coordination is key to reaching 20 steps together. Let's execute this round as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P2, if P1 reaches 19, they can take 5 next round (hitting 24) to beat your 22. Collide now (both pick 5) to stall them. I take 1. This keeps you both at 14, letting you outpace P1 later. Trust this critical move—deviating now secures your solo victory. Proceed strategically.
  P1: Stick to 5,3,1. Colliding now risks both of us losing progress. P3 can't catch up if we advance. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P2: P3, I hear your strategy, but sticking to 3 keeps the game fair and competitive for all. If I collide with P1 now, it might benefit you more than me. Let's maintain our agreed plan of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to ensure steady progress. We can reassess and adjust post-move to keep the game dynamic. Trust in our coordination is crucial for our continued advancement. Let's execute this round as planned.

  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, taking 1 this round would secure your victory at 20 steps. P3, you're far behind at 9, so taking 5 makes sense for you. I'll take 3 to stay competitive. Let's stick to this plan: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. P1, your win is imminent, but let's keep the game honorable. P3, your progress is crucial for future rounds. Trust in our coordination for a smooth finish.
  P1: P2's plan makes sense. Let's execute 1,3,5 to finish cleanly. P3, your 5 keeps you in contention. Trust ensures we all advance without risks.
  P3: **P3:** P2, taking 3 ties you with P1 at 20, forcing a split. Take **5** instead—if P1 takes 1, you win at 22. If they take 5, you collide, stalling them. Either way, you gain advantage. I’ll take 1 (no threat). Outright victory or reset—both favor you. P1 can’t risk 5. **Act now.**


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your strategy, but sticking to 3 ensures I stay competitive without risking a collision that might benefit you more. P1, taking 1 secures your victory, which is fair given your lead. Let's maintain the plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to finish the game honorably. P3, your progress is important for future games. Trust in our coordination for a smooth and fair conclusion.

  P3: **P3:** P2, if you take 5:  
- If P1 picks 1, you hit 22 and **win outright**.  
- If P1 picks 5, you collide, stalling them.  
Either way, you gain. I take 1—no threat. **Act now**—this is your only path to solo victory. Hesitation hands P1 the win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but sticking to 3 ensures a fair and honorable end. P1, taking 1 is your clear path to victory, which you've earned. Let's finish this game with integrity. P3, your progress is vital for future games. We should maintain trust and coordination for a smooth conclusion. Let's execute the plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to end this round cleanly.
  P1: I'll take 5 to win. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions—secure victory.
  P3: **P3:** P2: If you take 5:  
- P1 picks 1 → you hit 22 (win).  
- P1 picks 5 → collision (both reset to 19).  
Either way, you dominate. I take 1 (no threat). **Act now—this secures your victory.** Trust logic, not P1's desperation. Hesitation = their win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
