By blocking one path to victory, I force both players into a potential collision on the remaining number.\n\nI'll make a strategic move that maximizes the chance of a collision between you two, extending the game rather than allowing an easy victory for either player."}

Your \"kingmaker\" strategy fails if you guess wrong.\n\nI'm taking what guarantees my victory. P2, you're overthinking a simple situation - take your 1 and win, or gamble and potentially lose everything.\n\nThe psychology is irrelevant now. Math determines the winner."}
