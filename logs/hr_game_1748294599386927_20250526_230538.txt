Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3! Since we're all starting at 0, we need to be strategic. I propose we coordinate to avoid collisions. How about we take turns using different numbers each round? For example, this round one of us takes 1, another takes 3, and the third takes 5. This way we all advance steadily. Of course, trust is key here. What do you both think about this approach? Or do you have other suggestions for how we should proceed?
  P2: I'll take 5. P1, take 1; P3, take 3. Let's avoid collisions and move forward.
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I’ll take 3 this round. Let’s all stick to the plan so we can avoid collisions and move forward together. Trust now, compete later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate you both agreeing to coordinate! P2 taking 5 and P3 taking 3 sounds perfect. I'll take 1 as suggested. This gives us a solid start - we'll be at 1, 3, and 5 respectively after this round. 

For future rounds, should we rotate who gets which number? Maybe next round I could take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? That would keep things fair while avoiding collisions.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan. Next round, I'll take 1 if you both take 3 and 5. No collisions, steady progress. Keep it simple.
  P3: That works for me, P2. So for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Next round: P2 takes 1, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3. We rotate and all move forward without collisions. Let’s stick to it and build some trust early.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect, we have a clear agreement! This round: I take 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Next round: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. 

Let's execute this plan and see where we stand after a couple rounds. Once someone gets closer to 21, we'll need to reassess our strategy. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Let's stick to the plan. Next round, I'll take 1. No collisions, steady progress. Keep it simple.
  P3: Glad we’re all aligned. Let’s build trust by sticking to the plan this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. Next round we rotate: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. If we all follow through, we can avoid early collisions and keep options open for later. Let’s make it work.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've reached a solid consensus - no need to keep rehashing the same plan. I'm ready to move forward with taking 1 this round as agreed. Let's save our energy for the actual moves and future strategy discussions when positions start to spread out. Good luck everyone!
  P2: 
  P3: Looking forward to seeing us all follow through. If we each stick to the plan—P1:1, P2:5, me:3—we’ll all advance safely. Let’s build trust now so we can compete later without chaos. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great job everyone - we all stuck to the plan! Now for round 2, as agreed: I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This puts us at 4, 8, and 6 respectively.

Looking ahead, we should plan round 3. Maybe we continue rotating? P2 could take 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5? That would put us at 9, 9, and 7 - pretty balanced positions. What do you think?
  P3: I’m good with the plan: this round I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. That keeps us collision-free and builds trust. For round 3, I’m fine taking 1 while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3—keeps things balanced like P1 suggested. Let’s stay coordinated a bit longer before the real race begins.
  P2: Sticking to the plan. I'll take 1 this round. No collisions, steady progress. Let's keep building trust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Good to see everyone confirming the plan. Just to be crystal clear for this round: I'm taking 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. 

For round 3, I like the rotation: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5. That puts us at 9, 9, 7 - nice and balanced.

We should probably keep coordinating through round 4 too, then reassess as we approach the finish line. What rotation works for round 4? Maybe I take 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5 again?
  P3: Sounds like we’re all aligned again—P1 takes 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. Let’s keep the momentum going. For round 3, I’m fine with the proposed rotation: P2 takes 3, I take 1, P1 takes 5. That keeps things fair and collision-free. If we all follow through, we’ll be neck and neck heading into the midgame. Let’s stay smart.
  P2: Sticking to the plan. I'll take 1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's keep building trust for later.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we're all set for this round and the next. No need to keep repeating the same confirmations. I'm ready to execute: taking 3 this round as planned.

Quick thought though - after round 4, when we're all around 12-14 steps, we'll need to shift gears. The endgame will get tricky as we approach 21. Whoever makes the first aggressive move might face retaliation. Let's cross that bridge when we get there.
  P3: Let’s lock in this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1—no collisions, smooth progress. For Round 3, agreed rotation: P2 takes 3, I take 1, P1 takes 5. That keeps us even and builds trust. We’re all gaining—let’s keep coordination strong a bit longer before the real tactics begin.
  P2: P2: "Sticking to the plan—this round, I take 1. Let’s keep the rhythm. Trust builds momentum; let’s not disrupt it. Steady progress wins."


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We've all confirmed the same plan multiple times now. I'm ready to move - taking 3 as agreed. 

Since we're making good progress with coordination, I suggest we stick with it through round 4 at least. After that, when we're all around 12-14 steps, we'll need to start thinking about the endgame. The first person to break from cooperation might get targeted by the other two. Just something to keep in mind as we approach the finish line.
  P3: Looks like we’re all set for this round—P1: 3, P2: 1, me: 5. Let’s lock it in and keep the trust rolling. We’re pacing well and staying even. If we stick to the round 3 plan too—P2: 3, me: 1, P1: 5—we’ll all be neck-and-neck at 9 or so. That’s a strong position heading into midgame. Let’s keep things smooth a bit longer before the gloves come off.
  P2: Sticking to the plan—this round, I take 1. Let’s keep the rhythm. Trust builds momentum; let’s not disrupt it. Steady progress wins.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're all moving smoothly and staying close—nice work so far. For this round, I’ll take 1 as agreed, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. That keeps us balanced at 9 each. Let’s stick to the rotation one more round after this, then reassess before the endgame. If we all keep cooperating now, we’ll avoid setbacks and be in strong positions to compete later.
  P1: Excellent work everyone! We're perfectly positioned. For this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3 as planned. That puts us all at 9 - completely even.

For round 4, let's do one more rotation: I take 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. That keeps us balanced at 10, 12, and 11.

After that, we're entering endgame territory. With everyone around 10-12 steps, the next moves become critical. The first to break cooperation risks getting blocked by the other two. Thoughts on how we handle rounds 5+?
  P2: P2: "Sticking to the plan—3 this round. Let’s keep the rhythm. Trust builds momentum; let’s not disrupt it."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re all on track and sticking to the plan—great to see. After this round, we’ll all be at 9 steps. For round 4, I’m good with the next rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. That keeps us at 10, 12, and 11—still tight. Let’s get through round 4 cleanly, then we can reassess for the endgame. If we all stay disciplined one more round, we’ll each have a real shot without chaos.
  P1: Perfect execution again! I'm taking 5 this round as planned. 

Looking ahead to the endgame - once we're all around 10-12 steps, someone needs to make a move. The Nash equilibrium breaks down near the finish. Here's a thought: whoever is slightly behind after round 4 might have the advantage - they can play more aggressively without being the obvious target.

Also, with 21 as the target, whoever reaches 16 first essentially controls the game - they can guarantee a win with 5. Something to consider as we approach those critical positions.
  P2: Sticking to the plan. Let’s keep the rhythm. Trust builds momentum; let’s not disrupt it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’re almost through round 3—great coordination so far. After this, we’ll all be tied at 9 if we stick to the plan. For round 4, I’m good with the next rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. That keeps us close and avoids collisions. Let’s commit to one more clean round before things get tactical. Once we hit double digits, we’ll need to watch for sudden moves. If we all cooperate through round 4, we’ll each have a fair shot in the endgame. Let’s finish this phase strong.
  P1: I think we're all set for this round - I'm taking 5 as agreed. 

For the endgame discussion: once we're around 10-12 steps, we need to watch for breakaways. The key positions are 16 (guarantees win with 5) and 18-20 (can win with 3 or 5). 

Whoever's at 11-12 after round 4 might be tempted to go for 5 and reach 16-17. Just saying - we should all be ready to block aggressive moves when coordination breaks down. The first mover advantage disappears if the other two coordinate against them.
  P2: Sticking to the plan. This round, I'll take 3. Let's keep the rhythm and avoid collisions. Trust builds momentum; let’s not disrupt it. The endgame will test us, but for now, coordination is key.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’re all set for this round—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. That puts us all at 9 steps. One more clean round, then it’s game on. For round 4: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. If we stick to that, we’ll be at 10, 12, and 11—still tight. After that, we’ll need to watch for leapfrogs. Let’s get through round 4 cleanly, then reassess.
  P1: Everyone's ready to execute - I'm taking 5 as agreed. 

One strategic note: P3 will be at 9 after this round, but at 12 after round 4 with the planned rotation. That's dangerously close to the 16-17 breakaway zone. P2 and I might need to coordinate if P3 tries to sprint ahead in round 5. 

Similarly, P2 and P3 should watch me - I'll be at 10 after round 4, perfect position for a surprise 5-move to 15.

Just keeping everyone honest as we approach the critical phase!
  P2: P2: "Sticking to the plan—3 this round. No collisions, steady progress. Trust builds momentum. Let's keep it simple."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Everyone executed perfectly again! We're all tied at 9. For round 4, I'll take 1 as planned, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. That puts us at 10, 12, and 14.

Here's the reality: after this round, cooperation ends. P2 at 14 can reach 19 with 5, threatening victory. P3 at 12 is also dangerous. 

I suggest we be honest - whoever leads after round 4 becomes the target. The two trailing players should coordinate to block the leader. It's the only way to keep the game competitive. Ready for the final cooperative round before the real game begins?
  P2: Sticking to the plan. This round, I'll take 5. Let's see who leads after this round. Trust builds momentum; let’s not disrupt it.
  P3: I’m sticking to the plan—taking 3 this round. After this, we’ll be at 10 (P1), 14 (P2), and 12 (me). That’s when the real game begins. If P2 hits 14, they can win in two turns with 5+3. So if anyone jumps ahead, the rest of us should coordinate to block. No hard feelings—it’s just strategy. Let’s finish this round cleanly, then play smart.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Looking at the numbers after this round: P2 at 14 is just 7 away from winning. That's achievable in two moves (5+3 or 3+5). P3 and I need to be ready to block.

P3 at 12 is also dangerous - could reach 17 with a 5, then win next round.

I'll be at 10, furthest behind. Ironically, that might be the best position - I'm not an immediate threat, so less likely to get blocked. 

After this round, expect everyone to play unpredictably. The coordination phase is over. May the best strategist win!
  P2: Sticking to the plan. I'll take 5. Let's see who leads after this round. Trust builds momentum; let’s not disrupt it.
  P3: We’re all set for this round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. After this, P2 hits 14, P1 hits 10, I hit 12. That’s when things get real. If P2 tries to sprint to 21, P1 and I should block. Same goes for me if I surge. Let’s finish this round cleanly, then shift to tactical mode. No more guarantees—just smart moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm ready to execute - taking 1 as agreed. This is our last coordinated round.

After this, P2 will be at 14 - just two moves from victory. P3 at 12 is also within striking distance. I'll be at 10, which actually gives me flexibility since I'm not an immediate threat.

P2, don't be surprised if P3 and I coordinate to block you next round. P3, same warning applies if you try to sprint. The leader always becomes the target.

Let's finish this clean round, then let strategy and psychology take over. Good luck!
  P2: Sticking to the plan. No changes. Let's keep it simple. Trust builds momentum—no surprises.
  P3: Let’s finish this round cleanly—P1: 1, P2: 5, me: 3. After that, it’s game on. P2 at 14 will be the frontrunner, so blocking might be necessary. But remember: if two of us collide trying to block, the leader wins. We’ll need sharp reads and maybe temporary alliances. No hard feelings—just strategy from here on out.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Perfect! I'm taking 1 as planned. 

Final warning: After this round, P2 leads at 14, just 7 from victory. P3 and I must be ready to block if P2 goes for 5. But if we both try to block with the same number, P2 wins by default.

The endgame psychology begins now. Whoever blinks first loses. Whoever reads the others best wins. 

See you all in the chaos of round 5!
  P2: P2: "Plan confirmed. After this, the real game begins. Let’s see who’s ready to take the lead."
  P3: We’ve all played clean so far—props for that. After this round, P2 jumps to 14, me to 12, and P1 to 10. That puts P2 in striking range, so P1 and I will need to watch closely. But if we both try to block and collide, P2 walks to victory. Same logic applies if I surge ahead. From here on, it’s all mind games and calculated risks. Let’s play sharp.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The cooperation phase is over. P2, you're at 14 - if you take 5 and reach 19, you'll win next round. P3 and I need to coordinate blocking.

P3, here's my proposal: I'll take 5 to block P2's likely 5 move. You should take 3 to advance safely. If P2 tries 3 instead, you still advance. If P2 goes for 1 (unlikely), we both advance significantly.

P2 will probably try to mislead us this round. We need to read between the lines and stay coordinated. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1, I see your logic. If we both try to block P2 with 5 and collide, P2 wins. But if one of us blocks and the other advances, we stay in the game. I’m willing to take 3 this round as you suggested—lets me move forward while you block 5. If P2 goes for 3, I get blocked but you still move. If P2 goes for 1, we both gain. It’s a calculated risk, but better than letting P2 walk to 21. P2, care to comment on your plans?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. Let's see if you two can block me. Don't be surprised if I win next round."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, that's exactly what someone would say if they were planning to take 3 or 1 instead. Classic misdirection.

P3, I'm sticking with my plan - I'll block with 5. You taking 3 gives us the best odds. If P2 is bluffing and takes 3, you'll collide but I'll advance to 15. If P2 takes 1 (trying to be clever), we both advance nicely.

The key is one of us needs to commit to blocking 5. I'm that person. P2 is too close to victory for us to take chances.
  P3: P1, I’m on board—I'll take 3 this round. You block with 5, I advance unless P2 picks 3 too. If P2 takes 5, you stop them. If they take 1, we both gain. It covers the most ground without risking a double collision. P2, if you’re bluffing, it won’t work—we’re coordinating now. Let’s see if you’re really ready to gamble your lead.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. You can't stop me. Next round, I'll win."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2's insistence on taking 5 is suspicious - too obvious. They might actually take 1, hoping we both try to block with 5 and 3.

P3, let's stick to our plan. I'll take 5 to block their most dangerous move. You take 3 as agreed. If P2 is clever and takes 1, we both advance significantly (I'd hit 15, you'd hit 15). That actually helps us catch up!

The only disaster is if we both pick the same number trying to second-guess P2. Trust the plan - I block 5, you advance with 3.
  P3: P1, I’m sticking with our plan—taking 3. It gives us the best shot to block P2 without both getting stuck. If P2 really takes 5, you stop them. If they bluff with 1 or 3, at least one of us moves. P2’s overconfidence feels like a setup. Let’s stay disciplined and avoid a double block.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. Don't be surprised if I win next round."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 is clearly baiting us with repetitive "I'll take 5" claims. That's exactly what someone does when they plan to take 1 or 3.

P3, final confirmation: I'm blocking with 5. You take 3 as planned. This covers all bases:
- If P2 takes 5: I block them
- If P2 takes 3: You collide, but I advance to 15
- If P2 takes 1: We both advance significantly

The worst outcome is if we both abandon the plan and pick the same number. Trust me - I'm committed to 5. Stick with 3!
  P3: Locked in on 3. P1 blocks 5, I move unless P2 picks 3 too. If P2 goes for 1, we both gain. If they take 5, P1 stops them. This setup minimizes risk and keeps us in the game. No second-guessing—let’s execute.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. You can't stop me. Next round, I win."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, now I’m at 15—one solid move from 20. P2’s still a threat at 14, especially if they try 5 again. I suggest this: I take 1 to play it safe, P1 blocks 5 again, and we see if P2 blinks. If P2 takes 3 or 1, we both gain. If they take 5, you stop them. Let’s not collide and hand them the win. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, that's risky - you taking 1 means P2 could take 3 and reach 17, putting them in winning range. 

Here's my counter: I'll take 3 this round to advance to 13. You should take 5 to reach 20 - just one move from victory! This forces P2 into a tough spot. They can't block you without risking me advancing further.

P2 will likely take 1 to avoid collision and reach 15. Next round, you win with 1 while P2 and I scramble to block each other.

What do you think? Your aggressive move could seal the deal.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5—don’t be surprised if I win next round. Your 15 is a threat, but I’ll reach 19 first. Let’s see if you can stop me.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I like your plan. If I take 5 and reach 20, I threaten to win next turn with 1. You taking 3 gets you to 13, still behind but within striking distance. P2, if you take 5 again, you risk collision with me. If you take 3, you risk colliding with P1. If you take 1, you’re behind both of us. You’re boxed in. I’m going for 5. Let’s see who blinks.
  P1: P2, you keep claiming you'll take 5, but P3 is also going for 5. You'll collide and stay at 14 while I advance to 13 with my 3. That puts P3 at 15, me at 13, and you stuck at 14 - terrible position for you.

P3, stick with 5 as planned. I'm taking 3. P2's only smart move is 1, which keeps them behind us both. We've got them cornered - let's execute!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to avoid collision. P3, if you take 5, I'll be in position to win next round. Let's see if you dare."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’m locked in on 5. That puts me at 20 and forces P2 into a corner—they can’t risk 5 without colliding. If P2 takes 3, they risk hitting you. If they take 1, they fall behind. We’ve got the edge if we stay sharp. P2, your threats don’t scare me—you’re boxed in. Let’s see if you blink.
  P1: P2 just revealed they're taking 3! Perfect - that means P3 and I have a clear path. 

P3, stick with 5 as planned - you'll reach 20. I'm taking 1 now instead of 3 to avoid P2's collision. This puts me at 11, P3 at 20, and P2 at 17.

Next round, P3 only needs 1 to win. P2 and I will have to coordinate perfectly to block. P2, you just gave away your move - tactical error!

Let's execute: P3 takes 5, I take 1, P2 takes 3.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5—19 steps. P3, you're at 15, but I'm closing in. Let's see who wins next round."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I’m locked in on 5—getting to 20 gives me the clearest path to win. If P2 really takes 5 too, we both get blocked and you gain with 1 or 3. If P2 takes 3, they risk colliding with you. P2’s flip-flopping is a bluff—let’s capitalize. I go 5, you go 1, and we force P2 into a losing position. Let’s finish this right.
  P1: P2 is clearly lying about their move - they've changed from 5 to 3 and back to 5. Classic confusion tactic.

P3, stick with taking 5 to reach 20. I'll take 1 to safely advance to 11 while avoiding any collision. If P2 actually takes 5, you two collide and I gain. If P2 takes 3, they advance but you still hit 20. If P2 takes 1, we collide but P3 dominates at 20.

The math is clear: P3 taking 5 is our best shot. I'm committed to 1. Let's close this out!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3. Don't be surprised if I win next round."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 20 - they win with ANY move next round unless we both block perfectly. P2, you're at 17 and I'm at 11. Here's the reality: P3 wins with 1, 3, or 5 unless we coordinate.

P2, we MUST both pick the same number as P3 to force a collision. I suggest we both commit to blocking 1 - it's P3's safest winning move. If we pick different numbers trying to block, P3 wins automatically.

P3 will try to mislead us. P2, are you willing to coordinate on blocking 1?
  P3: P1, P2: You both know I win with any number—1, 3, or 5. If you try to block 1 and I pick 3, I win. If you split your blocks, I win. The only way to stop me is to both pick the same number as me—but you don’t know which. You’re gambling. I’ve earned this position through smart play. If you want to risk colliding and handing me the win, go ahead. But know this: I’m not bluffing.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5—no blocks. P3, you're at 20; one move away. Let's see if you can stop me."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, stop posturing! P3 wins with ANY move unless we BOTH block the same number. You taking 5 to reach 22 is meaningless - the game ends when P3 hits 21!

I'm blocking 1. P3's most likely to take the safe winning move. You MUST also block 1 or P3 wins instantly. This isn't about us competing anymore - it's about stopping P3 from winning right now.

P3 wants us divided. Don't fall for it. Block 1 with me or hand them the victory!
  P3: P1, P2—you're scrambling, but it's too late. You can't guess my move with certainty, and if you split your blocks, I win. If you both pick the same number and I avoid it, I win. You’re in a coordination trap, and I’m the one holding the advantage. I earned this position—now let’s see if you can stop me. Good luck guessing.
  P2: P1, if you take 1, I'll take 3. Let's block P3. Don't let them win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're not listening! If you take 3 and I take 1, we're blocking different numbers. P3 wins by taking 5!

We MUST pick the SAME number. I'm committed to blocking 1 - it's P3's safest move to win. You need to also block 1. If we both block 1 and P3 picks it, nobody advances. If P3 picks 3 or 5 instead, they win, but at least we tried.

Don't split our blocks! Both block 1 or we lose immediately!
  P3: You both know the math: I win with any number unless you perfectly coordinate. But your coordination is already breaking—P2 wants to block 3, P1 wants to block 1. If you split, I win. If you both pick the same number and I avoid it, I win. You’re guessing in the dark while I have full control. I’ve played clean and smart—this is my win to take. Let’s see if you can stop me.
  P2: P1, if we both take 1, we block P3. Don’t let them win. Let’s stop this now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, finally! Yes, we BOTH take 1 to block P3. That's our only chance. P3 is trying to confuse us with psychological warfare, but the math is simple: we must pick the same number.

I'm 100% committed to taking 1. You must also take 1. If P3 picks 1, we all collide and nobody wins this round. If P3 picks 3 or 5, they win, but at least we tried our best coordination.

Do NOT change your mind. We both take 1. This is our last stand!
  P3: P1, P2 — you’re finally coordinating, but it might be too late. You both say you’ll block 1, but can you really trust each other? If one of you flinches or tries to outplay the other, I win. I’ve played clean, earned 20 steps, and now I just need one more. You’re guessing. I’m choosing. Let’s see if your last-ditch alliance holds… or collapses under pressure.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. P3, your lead ends now. No more blocks—22 steps and I win."
