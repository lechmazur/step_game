Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm going for 5.  Anyone else taking 5 will be stuck at zero. Don't do it.
  P1: I'm thinking of going for 1.
  P2: Okay, P1. Since you're thinking of 1, I'll avoid that. P3, I hear you on 5.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, let's both go for 5 to try and block P3. P1, how about we both go for 1 this round? Let's try to get some steps."
  P3: P2, I won't pick 5 this round.  Let's both take 1. P1, are you in?
  P1: P2, I'm leaning towards 3 this round.  P3, I'm open to your suggestion.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, since you're leaning towards 3, how about we both go for 3 this round? P3, I'm also considering 1 as you suggested."
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll take 3.  Please, one of you take 1, and the other take 5.  Let's avoid a collision.
  P1: P2, I'm going to take 5. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1, since you're set on 5, I'll aim for 1. P3, are you still thinking 3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3.  Don't make me regret this. One of you *needs* to pick 1.
  P1: P2, I'll take 1 this round.  P3, good luck.

  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, please go for 1. P2, please go for 5.  I'll take 3 and get to 11. This is the fastest way for one of us to win.
  P1: P2, I'm considering 3 this round. P3, are you sticking with 3?
  P2: "P1, since you're thinking 3, I'll avoid that. P3, 5 is still on my mind."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you take 3, I'll be stuck at 8 and P2 will likely win.  Let P2 take 5.  I need to get ahead.
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 this round. Good luck!
  P2: P1, since you're thinking 3, how about you go for 1 this round? P3, are you still planning on 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you take 5 and P1 takes 1, I win this turn.  If you both take anything else, *I* win next round. Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, I'll take 1 this round. P3, good luck.
  P2: "Okay, P1, since you're taking 1, I'll go for 5. P3, are you really sticking with 3?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 3.  If you take 5 and P1 takes 1, I win this turn. If either of you deviate, I will actively block both of you next round and the round after that if needed. I'm closest to the finish line.  Let's end this.
  P1: P2, I'm going for 3 this round. P3, are you sticking with 3?
  P2: "P1, let's both avoid 3 this round. How about you go for 1? P3, I'm not convinced about your plan."


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1 and P2, I am absolutely taking 3. If you both want a chance to win, one of you *must* take 1 and the other *must* take 5. Any other combination and I will win next round.  This is your last chance to cooperate with each other.
  P1: P2, I'm going for 5. P3, good luck.
  P2: P1, given P3's insistence on 3, how about we both go for 1? That avoids collision with P3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: I'm taking 3.  This is your last chance. One of you takes 1, the other takes 5.  Any other move and I win next round.
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 5. P3, you're bluffing.  Let's see what happens.
  P2: "Okay, P1, since you're set on 5, I'll go for 1. P3, we'll see about your threat."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm taking 3.  If either of you take 3, I'll block you both next round.  If you take 1 and 5, one of you can still win. This is your last chance to avoid splitting second place with each other.
  P1: P2, let's both go for 5 this round. P3 is bluffing.  We can catch up.
  P2: Okay, P1, going for 5 seems risky with P3 saying they'll take 3. How about we both go for 1 instead?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both pick 5, I win next round. If you both pick 1, I *still* win next round. If one of you picks 1 and the other picks 5, you *might* have a chance.  This isn't a bluff. I'm at 11.  Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 5.  P3, you can't stop us both.
  P2: Okay, P1, going for 5 is still risky with P3 saying they'll take 3. Let's both go for 1 this round.

  P3: P1 and P2, if you *both* pick 5, I win next round. If you *both* pick 1, I *still* win next round.  If one of you picks 1 and the other picks 5, *one* of you *might* have a chance. This isn't complicated.  I will take 3.
  P1: P2, let's both go for 5 this round. P3 is bluffing.  We can catch up.
  P2: P1, given P3's strong insistence on 3, and your leaning towards 5, how about I go for 1? That avoids a collision with P3 and potentially lets you advance.
