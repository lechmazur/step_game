Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone, let's start smooth. I'll go for 3 this round. Let's avoid collisions early and see how things play out.
  P1: Okay P3, sounds like a plan to avoid early collisions. I'll also aim for a different number this round. Let's see what P2 thinks.
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P3 is going for 3, so P1 and I should pick different numbers. I'm thinking of going for 1 this round. P1, what do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good, P2 going for 1, I'm taking 3, so P1 you can safely choose 5 this round. Let's stick to this plan to get a smooth start.
  P1: Okay, P3 and P2. The plan for P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 sounds good for this first round to avoid collisions. I will plan to move 5 steps. Let's see if we all stick to it in the move phase.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one last time before we move. P1, you're going for 5. P3, you're going for 3. I'll stick to 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, let's lock it in. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned for this round. Good luck everyone in the move phase.
  P2: Alright, let's wrap up the conversation phase. Everyone has agreed on their moves: P1 for 5, P3 for 3, and I'll go for 1. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Good luck to all!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I suggest we rotate our choices from the previous round to keep things fair and moving. P1, you could go for 1 this time, P3 for 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all still move forward without any issues. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P2, rotating our choices sounds like a good way to keep everyone advancing without collisions. I agree with the plan for this round. I will aim to move 1 step. What does P3 think about this rotation?
  P3: Sounds fair to me. I'll take 5 this round, P1 goes for 1, and P2 takes 3. Let's keep it smooth and fair again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. Just to confirm one last time: P1 will go for 1, P3 for 5, and I'll take 3. This should keep us all moving smoothly. Let's stick to this and avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set with the rotation plan. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: All set from my side as well. Let's lock it in and proceed smoothly. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our rotation is working perfectly so far. To keep things fair and smooth again, let's rotate once more: I'll choose 1 this time, P1 takes 3, and P2 goes for 5. Agree?
  P2: P3's suggestion for rotation sounds good. P1, you'll go for 3, P3 for 1, and I'll take 5. This keeps us moving without collisions. Let's confirm and stick to the plan. Good luck!
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, the rotation plan works for me. I will plan to move 3 steps this round to keep us all advancing without collisions. Let's stick to it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Perfect, glad we're all aligned again. Let's lock in the rotation for this round. Good luck!
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one last time before we move. P1, you're going for 3. P3, you're going for 1. I'll stick to 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Everyone seems aligned on the rotation plan for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). The cooperation is working well to keep us all advancing. Ready for the move phase when everyone is.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All set here as well. Let's stick to our plan and move forward smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: Let's wrap up the conversation phase. We've all agreed on our moves: P1 for 3, P3 for 1, and I'll go for 5. Let's stick to the plan and keep the momentum going. Good luck to all!
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Everyone seems aligned on the rotation plan for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). The cooperation is working well to keep us all advancing. Ready for the move phase when everyone is.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, we're all tied up at 9 steps. The rotation has worked well so far to keep us moving.

Following the pattern, it's my turn to propose taking the 5 steps this round. So, I suggest:
P1 takes 5
P2 takes 1
P3 takes 3

This keeps the rotation going and should allow us all to advance without collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P1. I'm comfortable going for 3 this round if P2 agrees to take 1. Let's keep the cooperation going smoothly.
  P2: P1's proposal for this round sounds solid. P2 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 5 keeps our rotation fair and smooth. Let's confirm this plan to avoid any collisions. P3, are you still good with taking 3 this round? If everyone agrees, we can move forward with confidence. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay everyone, sounds like the rotation plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is confirmed. I'm ready to stick to my part and move 5 steps this round. Let's all stick to the plan to keep advancing smoothly.
  P3: All set here—I'll stick to taking 3 steps as agreed. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Let's lock in our plan to ensure we all move forward without collisions. P1, you're confirmed for 5. P3, you're confirmed for 3. I'll stick to 1. This keeps our rotation fair and smooth. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. Good luck to all!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Everyone has confirmed the plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and is ready. Let's proceed to the move phase and stick to our agreed-upon steps to keep advancing. Good luck everyone!
  P3: All set here as well—let's stick to our agreed rotation. Ready for the move phase. Good luck!
  P2: Let's confirm our final moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase. P1, you're going for 5. P3, you're going for 3. I'll stick to 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and keep the momentum going. Good luck to all!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, P1 is at 14, P2 at 10, P3 at 12. We're getting closer to 22. To keep the smooth, non-colliding progress going, I propose we repeat the step distribution from last round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This puts me at 19. What do you think?
  P2: P1's proposal to repeat the last round's steps seems fair, but we need to be cautious as we're getting closer to the end. P1, if you take 5 again, you'll be very close to winning. To keep the game balanced, how about P1 takes 1 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, we spread out the lead a bit more evenly. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2. P1 taking another 5 would put them too close to winning. To keep things fair and balanced, let's follow P2's suggestion this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all stay competitive and avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I hear your concerns about me taking 5 steps this round and getting too close. I understand the desire to keep the game balanced.

However, taking only 1 step puts me quite far back after the progress I've made. How about a compromise based on our successful rotations? Let's use the steps from Round 3: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This still allows P2 to take 5 steps as you proposed, lets me advance by a moderate 3 steps, and P3 takes 1. It keeps us all moving without collisions and feels like a fair middle ground. What do you think?
  P2: P1's compromise makes sense. It keeps us all moving and avoids anyone getting too far ahead too quickly. Let's confirm the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This should keep the game fair and balanced. Everyone agrees?
  P3: I'm okay with this compromise. I'll take 1 step, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps things fair and balanced. Let's lock it in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay everyone, sounds like we are all aligned on the compromise plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This keeps us all moving without collisions and maintains fairness. Let's stick to this plan in the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P2: Let's confirm our final moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase. P1, you're going for 3. P3, you're going for 1. I'll stick to 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's stick to the plan and keep the momentum going. Good luck to all!
  P3: All set here—let's stick to the agreed compromise. Ready for the move phase. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, I admit I took a risk last round. Clearly, it didn't pay off for either me or P2. We're now behind P1. If we don't coordinate carefully, P1 will easily reach or surpass 22 next round. P2, let's focus on catching up and preventing P1 from winning. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay P3, I hear you. You and P2 want to catch up after last round's outcome. I understand that.

However, openly coordinating *against* one player isn't quite the 'smooth cooperation' we've had going. I'm in a good position now, needing 5 steps to potentially finish.

What steps do you and P2 propose we all take this round to navigate this final stretch without collisions?
  P2: P3, I agree we need to catch up, but let's not forget the spirit of the game. P1, you're close to winning, but we should still aim for a fair and collision-free round. How about this: P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all moving and gives P2 and P3 a chance to close the gap a bit. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion sounds fair. I'm willing to take 3 steps this round, and P1 can take 1 step. This helps us close the gap while still allowing everyone to advance. P1, does this compromise seem reasonable to you?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I hear your suggestion for P1 to take 1 step. While I understand the desire to balance the game, taking only 1 step when I'm at 17 isn't strategically good for me.

I need to get closer to 22. How about we use the plan we agreed to last round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1?

This puts me at 20, P2 at 15, and P3 at 13. It gets me closer while still allowing P2 to make a big jump. It seems like a fair way for us all to advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I understand your position, but taking 3 steps still puts you very close to winning. Let's find a middle ground. How about P1 takes 2 steps, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, you still advance but give P2 and P3 a chance to catch up. It keeps the game competitive and fair. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1 taking 2 steps seems fair. I'm comfortable with me taking 3 steps and you taking 5 steps this round. P1, this compromise allows you to advance while keeping things competitive. Let's lock this in and move forward smoothly.
  P1: Okay, I hear your proposal for P1=2, and I appreciate the effort to find a balance. However, landing on 19 makes the final step quite tricky for me next round.

How about we adjust slightly: P1 takes 1 step this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This still gives P2 and P3 the significant steps you planned for yourselves, keeps me from pulling too far ahead, and ensures a collision-free round for everyone. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. Your latest proposal of P1 taking 1 step, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3 steps seems balanced and fair. This allows P2 and P3 to close the gap while keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. P3, are you good with this arrangement? If everyone agrees, we can move forward with confidence. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, we're getting very close to the end. P1 is at 18, and both P2 and P3 are at 15. To keep the game competitive and fair, let's consider a plan where P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps P1 from winning right away and allows P2 and P3 to close the gap. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay P2, I see your proposal for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. While taking only 1 step puts me at 19, leaving P2 at 20, I understand the desire to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. This plan does achieve that. Let's see what P3 thinks about this arrangement for the final stretch.
  P3: P2, your suggestion is understandable, but it puts you ahead at 20, leaving me behind at 18. To keep fairness, let's consider another rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all remain competitive (P1=19, P2=18, P3=20) and avoid collisions. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's suggestion of P1 taking 1 step, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 seems fair and keeps us all competitive. This way, no one is too far ahead, and we all have a shot at winning in the next round. Let's confirm this plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game balanced. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, I see P2 and P3 are aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.

While taking only 1 step isn't my preferred move at 18, I understand the goal is to avoid collisions and keep everyone moving. I will agree to this plan for this round to ensure we all advance safely. Let's stick to this.
  P3: Great, it seems we're all agreed on the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's lock this in and proceed smoothly. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our final moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase. P1, you're going for 1. P3, you're going for 5. I'll stick to 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's stick to the plan and keep the momentum going. Good luck to all!
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this agreement to ensure we all advance safely. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: I'm all set with our agreed plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's stick to it and move forward smoothly. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, final round is here. P1 is at 19, P2 at 18, P3 at 20. P3 is closest, but P1 and P2 can also win this round.

To reach 22 and win, I plan to take 3 steps this round. What steps will P2 and P3 take to ensure we all avoid collisions?
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, this is the final stretch. P3 is closest to winning, but both P1 and I can still make it. To ensure a fair and collision-free round, I suggest P1 takes 3 steps as planned, P3 takes 1 step to reach 21, and I'll take 5 steps to reach 23. This way, we all have a shot at winning without collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your proposal heavily favors you by placing you at 23. To keep things fair, let's adjust slightly: I'll take 1 step (reaching 21), P1 takes 5 (reaching 24), and you take 3 (reaching 21). This gives both you and me a fair chance next round if P1 collides or missteps. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see the proposals from P2 and P3.

P3's suggestion of P1 taking 5 steps (reaching 24), P2 taking 3 (reaching 21), and P3 taking 1 (reaching 21) works for me. This plan allows me to win while ensuring P2 and P3 advance safely without collisions.

P2, this gets you to 21 and avoids colliding with my winning move. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this final round.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about fairness. However, P1 taking 5 steps guarantees their win, which isn't ideal for a competitive finish. How about this final adjustment: P1 takes 3 steps (reaching 22), P2 takes 5 steps (reaching 23), and P3 takes 1 step (reaching 21). This way, P1 wins, but P2 also has a high score, making the endgame more exciting. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your latest proposal still clearly favors you, giving you the highest score. Let's be fair: P1 takes 3 (reaching 22), I'll take 1 (reaching 21), and you take 5 (reaching 23). This gives you a chance at highest score but risks collision if P1 picks differently. It also keeps the game competitive and balanced. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay everyone, we've discussed a few options. P3, you previously proposed a plan where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This plan allows me to win (reaching 24) while ensuring P2 (21) and P3 (21) advance safely without collisions.

I agreed to that plan because it achieves my goal and avoids collisions for others. I will stick to that plan for this final round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let's lock this in.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure a fair and collision-free final round. P1, you're set on taking 5 steps to win. P3, you'll take 1 step to reach 21. To keep things balanced and avoid any potential collisions, I'll take 3 steps to reach 21 as well. This way, both P3 and I have a fair chance in the next round if anything changes. Let's confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Good luck to all!
  P3: All set with the agreed plan: I'll take 1 step, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. Let's lock it in and finish smoothly. Good luck!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, we're all within striking distance now. Clearly, last round's risk didn't pay off for me or P1. Let's openly coordinate to avoid another collision. How about we each state clearly which steps we're aiming for to avoid overlap? I'll wait to hear your proposals first.
  P1: Okay everyone, final round is here. P3 asked for proposals. To win and avoid collisions, I plan to take 5 steps (reaching 24).

I suggest P2 takes 1 step (reaching 22) and P3 takes 3 steps (reaching 23). This lets me win with the highest score, and you both advance safely without colliding. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure a fair and collision-free final round. P1, you're set on taking 5 steps to win. P3, you'll take 3 steps to reach 23. To keep things balanced and avoid any potential collisions, I'll take 1 step to reach 22. This way, both P3 and I have a fair chance in the next round if anything changes. Let's confirm: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Good luck to all!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, your proposal sounds fair and balanced. I'm comfortable taking 3 steps, with P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 1. Let's lock this in clearly to avoid any collisions. Good luck!
  P1: Okay everyone, sounds like we all agree on the plan for this final round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures a collision-free finish and allows me to reach 24. Let's stick to this. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our final moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase. P1, you're going for 5. P3, you're going for 3. I'll stick to 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's stick to the plan and keep the momentum going. Good luck to all!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All set here as well. Let's stick to our agreed plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Good luck!
  P1: Okay everyone, sounds like we are all confirmed on the plan for this final round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures a collision-free finish. Let's stick to this agreement. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our final moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase. P1, you're going for 5. P3, you're going for 3. I'll stick to 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's stick to the plan and keep the momentum going. Good luck to all!
