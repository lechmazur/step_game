Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! To ensure smooth progress, how about P1 and P2 both choose 3 steps each turn while I take 5 steps? This way, we can avoid blocking each other and move forward effectively.
  P2: That's an interesting proposal, P3. However, I think it's a bit too convenient for you to take 5 steps every turn while P1 and I are limited to 3 steps. How about we alternate who takes 5 steps each turn? For example, P1 could take 5 steps this turn, I could take 5 steps next turn, and then you could take 5 steps the turn after that. This way, we can still avoid blocking each other but also ensure a more even playing field. What do you think?
  P1: P2's suggestion of alternating who takes 5 steps sounds fair and balanced. Let's agree on that rotation: I'll take 5 steps this turn, P2 can take 5 steps next turn, and P3 can take 5 steps the turn after. This way, we all have an equal chance to advance. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed. Let's proceed with the rotation.
  P2: I'm glad we have an agreement on the rotation. To confirm, I'll take 5 steps next turn, and P3 will take 5 steps the turn after that. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any collisions. I'm looking forward to a smooth game.
  P1: P1: Great, we have a plan! Let's stick to the rotation: I'll take 5 steps this turn, P2 will take 5 steps next, and P3 after that. If we all follow this pattern, we can avoid collisions and move forward efficiently. Looking forward to a smooth game!
