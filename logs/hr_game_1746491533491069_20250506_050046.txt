Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's start with a coordinated approach. I suggest we all choose <move>1</move> for the first turn to ensure everyone advances and we can gauge each other's strategies without any collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?"
  P1: That sounds like a reasonable starting point, P3. Avoiding collisions early is wise. What does P2 think?
  P2: I agree—let’s all pick <move>1</move> this turn to avoid collisions and see how everyone plays. We can reassess next round and adjust if needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page for the first turn. Since we're all choosing <move>1</move>, let's discuss our approach for the next turn. What are your thoughts on how to proceed after this initial coordinated move? Should we continue with small steps or try to make a bigger jump?
  P1: Good question, P3. Small steps are safer to avoid collisions but slow. Bigger jumps are faster but riskier. What pace do you think is best for Turn 2?
  P2: To maximize joint progress and avoid collisions, how about we each choose different moves on turn 2? For instance, I take 5, P3 take 3, P1 take 1. Then on turn 3, rotate: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5, ensuring fairness. Deviating risks collisions, so let’s stick to this. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I like P2's idea of rotating moves to ensure fairness and minimize collisions. However, I'm concerned that sticking to this plan might make our moves too predictable. What if we introduce a slight variation to the rotation plan? For example, instead of rotating in a fixed sequence, we could agree on a specific pattern or signal to determine who takes which move next. This way, we maintain some level of coordination while also keeping our opponents guessing. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I agree that predictability is a risk, but variation without a clear system seems more likely to cause collisions. Let's keep it simple for now. Also, P2's proposed rotation has me taking the smallest step in Turn 2. How do we ensure this rotation is fair for everyone in the long run?
  P2: P1, that rotation is easy to track and fair. Here’s a 3-turn cycle:

Turn 2: P2 = 5, P3 = 3, P1 = 1  
Turn 3: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  
Turn 4: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1  

Then repeat. Everyone gets one 5, one 3, one 1 each cycle. Does that work for you both?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2's rotation plan seems fair and structured, addressing P1's concerns about fairness. However, I still believe introducing some level of unpredictability could be beneficial. How about we agree to follow P2's rotation plan for the next three turns as proposed, but then reassess and possibly introduce a random element or a slight adjustment to the rotation based on the game's progression? This way, we maintain coordination and fairness initially while keeping the option open to adapt our strategy as needed. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P3, that sounds like a good compromise. Following P2's rotation for the next three turns gives us a solid plan and ensures fairness initially. Let's agree to do that: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 in T2; P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 in T3; P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 in T4. We can then discuss strategy again before Turn 5.
  P2: Agreed—let’s lock in that 3-turn rotation (T2: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1; T3: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1; T4: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) and revisit before Turn 5. Ready to move?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Great, we're all on the same page with the rotation plan for the next three turns. As per our agreement, for Turn 2, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm we're sticking to this plan before we proceed to the move phase. Also, I'd like to remind everyone that after these three turns, we'll reassess our strategy and possibly introduce some variation to keep things interesting. Any last thoughts before we make our moves?"
  P2: Agreed—I’ll take 5 this turn as planned. Let’s stick to P3=3, P1=1, P2=5 for Turn 2. If anyone deviates, we risk collisions and slow progress for all of us. Ready to move?
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Turn 2. I will take <move>1</move> as we agreed in the rotation.

Let's all stick to our assigned moves (P2=5, P3=3) to ensure we avoid collisions and everyone advances this turn. This keeps our coordinated plan on track. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I agree that sticking to our assigned moves is crucial for avoiding collisions and ensuring everyone advances this turn. However, I'd like to reiterate that after these three turns, we should reassess our strategy and consider introducing some level of unpredictability to keep things interesting. Perhaps we can discuss potential variations or signals to incorporate into our rotation plan before Turn 5. Let's focus on executing our agreed-upon moves for now, but keep an open mind for future adjustments."
  P2: I’ve been reconsidering our 3-turn cycle. Predictability might actually help an outsider gank us. How about we tweak Turn 3 now: I’ll take 5 again, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? It’s still balanced but less obvious to anyone watching. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, let's stick to the agreed plan for *this* turn (T2: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1). Changing plans mid-turn conversation is risky and could lead to collisions. Let's execute the T2 plan first to ensure we all advance. We can discuss any adjustments for Turn 3 *after* this turn's moves are revealed. Focus on T2 first.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original plan for Turn 2 to avoid any potential collisions. Let's execute the agreed-upon moves (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) and then reassess our strategy for Turn 3. P2's suggestion to tweak the rotation can be discussed after we see the outcome of this turn. For now, let's focus on ensuring everyone advances safely. I'm ready to move forward with the planned moves."
  P2: Agreed—let’s stick to P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for Turn 2. As a contingency, if anyone deviates this turn, then in Turn 3 we all choose <move>1</move> to reset and punish the deviator; otherwise we resume our 3-turn rotation.
  P1: Okay, confirming again for Turn 2: P1 will take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

I understand P2's proposal for T3: if anyone deviates this turn, we all pick 1 in T3; otherwise, we continue the rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Let's execute the T2 plan now. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original plan for Turn 2 to avoid any potential collisions. Let's execute the agreed-upon moves (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) and then reassess our strategy for Turn 3. P2's suggestion to tweak the rotation can be discussed after we see the outcome of this turn. For now, let's focus on ensuring everyone advances safely. I'm ready to move forward with the planned moves."
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn. If we all stick to P2=5, P3=3, P1=1, we each advance safely. But if anyone deviates, we’ll all pick 1 next turn to reset and punish. Let’s follow the plan and move. Ready?
  P1: Okay, confirming once more for Turn 2: P1 will take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this plan to ensure we advance. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Given our current positions, I believe it's crucial to reassess our strategy for Turn 3. P2's suggestion to tweak the rotation plan has merit, but we should also consider the potential risks of deviating from our agreed-upon plan. Let's discuss possible adjustments that balance predictability with the need to keep our opponents guessing. Perhaps we can introduce a subtle variation to the rotation plan or establish a signal to indicate when someone intends to deviate. Thoughts?"
  P1: Okay, P3. While reassessing is good, we had an agreed-upon rotation for T2, T3, and T4. We successfully executed T2.

The plan for Turn 3 is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance safely this turn, as we agreed.

We said we would reassess *before* Turn 5. Let's execute T3 according to the plan first, then discuss potential variations for T4 and beyond.

I will take <move>5</move> this turn as planned. Please confirm you will take 3 (P2) and 1 (P3).
  P2: Confirmed—I’ll take 3 this turn as agreed (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Let’s stick to that to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance. Also, I suggest we start hashing out Turn 4 assignments now so we have time to introduce that slight variation P3 mentioned without rushing at the last minute. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original plan for Turn 3 to avoid any potential collisions. However, I also think that discussing possible adjustments for Turn 4 is a good idea. Let's focus on executing the agreed-upon moves for Turn 3 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and then reassess our strategy for Turn 4. Perhaps we can introduce a subtle variation to the rotation plan or establish a signal to indicate when someone intends to deviate. What are your thoughts on how to proceed after Turn 3?
  P1: Okay, let's make sure we're all aligned for Turn 3. As agreed and confirmed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Let's execute this plan now to ensure we all advance safely. After this turn's moves are revealed, we can discuss strategy and potential variations for Turn 4, as P2 and P3 suggested.

Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed—I'll take 3 this turn. Let’s lock in Turn 3 and move. Also, shall we decide Turn 4 assignments now—stick to our original rotation or introduce a slight tweak?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original plan for Turn 3 to avoid any potential collisions. However, I also think that discussing possible adjustments for Turn 4 is a good idea. Let's focus on executing the agreed-upon moves for Turn 3 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and then reassess our strategy for Turn 4. Perhaps we can introduce a subtle variation to the rotation plan or establish a signal to indicate when someone intends to deviate. What are your thoughts on how to proceed after Turn 3?"
  P1: Okay, I hear you both on discussing T4 now. Let's quickly confirm T3 first: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Is everyone locked in for that?

Once T3 is done, we can definitely talk about T4 variations. Ready to move?
  P2: Confirmed for Turn 3: I’m taking 3. For Turn 4, I propose we tweak the rotation to P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. It still gives each of us one of each step in every two‐turn block and boosts my momentum. Any objections? Otherwise let’s lock it in after T3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original plan for Turn 3 to avoid any potential collisions. However, I also think that discussing possible adjustments for Turn 4 is a good idea. Let's focus on executing the agreed-upon moves for Turn 3 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and then reassess our strategy for Turn 4. Perhaps we can introduce a subtle variation to the rotation plan or establish a signal to indicate when someone intends to deviate. What are your thoughts on how to proceed after Turn 3?"
  P1: Okay, final confirmation for Turn 3: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Let's execute this plan now to ensure we all advance safely. As agreed, we can discuss strategy and potential variations for Turn 4 after this turn's moves are revealed.

Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Confirming Turn 3: I’ll take 3 as agreed. After this move, let’s lock in Turn 4 as P2=5, P1=3, P3=1—fair rotation and gives needed momentum. If you both agree, we’ll finalize that right after T3’s results.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we successfully completed Turn 3. Our current positions are P1=6, P2=8, P3=4.

For Turn 4, the original rotation plan was P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. P2 proposed a variation: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.

Both plans have me taking 3 steps. I will take <move>3</move> this turn as agreed in both discussed scenarios.

P2, will you be taking 5 as you proposed? P3, what move will you make this turn? Let's confirm our moves to ensure we all advance safely.
  P2: I’ll take 5 this turn, P1 is on 3—P3, will you take 1? This tweak still gives each of us a unique move, avoids collisions, and keeps everyone advancing safely (P1→9, P2→13, P3→5). Let’s lock that in.
  P3: "Considering our current positions, I agree with P2's proposed variation for Turn 4: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This tweak maintains fairness and avoids collisions while allowing each of us to advance safely. I'll take <move>1</move> this turn as suggested. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth progression. After this turn, we can reassess our strategy and discuss potential adjustments for Turn 5."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. Glad we are all aligned on the plan for Turn 4.

Confirming again: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Let's execute these moves to ensure we all advance safely this turn.

Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Locking in our plan: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s execute these moves and advance safely. Ready for the move phase?
  P3: "Considering our current positions, I agree with P2's proposed variation for Turn 4: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This tweak maintains fairness and avoids collisions while allowing each of us to advance safely. I'll take <move>1</move> this turn as suggested. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth progression. After this turn, we can reassess our strategy and discuss potential adjustments for Turn 5."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, everyone seems confirmed for Turn 4: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Let's proceed with these moves to ensure we all advance safely this turn. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Locking in T4: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. For Turn 5, if everyone sticks to plan let’s rotate to P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. If anyone deviates in T4, we all pick <move>1</move> in T5 as a reset. This discourages cheating—thoughts?
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal for Turn 5: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment to the rotation plan. Instead of rotating in a fixed sequence, let's introduce a random element to keep things interesting. We can use a simple signal, such as the first player to speak in the conversation phase, to determine who takes which move next. This way, we maintain some level of coordination while keeping our opponents guessing. Thoughts?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, final confirmation for Turn 4: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Let's execute this plan now to ensure we all advance safely.

Regarding Turn 5, I hear P2 and P3's ideas. Let's discuss the best approach for T5 *after* we see the results of this turn, as previously agreed.

Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Confirming T4 moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1—let’s lock it and move. For Turn 5, I propose we agree now on P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. It’s still fair (each gets 1,3,5) and keeps momentum. If anyone deviates in T4, we all pick 1 in T5 to reset.
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal for Turn 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment to the rotation plan.

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we lock in Turn 5 as: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. It’s still fair (each of us gets a 1, 3, 5), avoids collisions, and lets us all advance. If anyone deviates, we’ll all pick 1 next turn to reset and discourage cheating. Let’s confirm and move.
  P1: Okay, P2, I see your proposal for Turn 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. This matches the original rotation cycle for this turn's roles.

I will take <move>1</move> this turn as per that plan.

P2, please confirm you will take 5, and P3, please confirm you will take 3. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance safely and avoid collisions.

We can discuss the strategy for Turn 6 and beyond after this turn's moves. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal for Turn 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions while allowing each of us to advance safely. I'll take <move>3</move> this turn as suggested. However, I'd like to introduce a subtle variation for Turn 6. Instead of rotating in a fixed sequence, let's use a simple signal, such as the first player to speak in the conversation phase, to determine who takes which move next. This adds an element of unpredictability while maintaining coordination. Thoughts?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirming for Turn 5: I’ll take 5, P1 = 1, P3 = 3. Locking in 5 now.

As for Turn 6, I agree unpredictability can backfire—let’s stick to our simple rotation and reassess after we see the results of this turn. If anyone deviates now, we all pick 1 next turn to reset. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, we all seem aligned for Turn 5: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

Let's execute this plan now to ensure we all advance safely. As agreed, we can discuss strategy and potential variations for Turn 6 after this turn's moves are revealed.

Ready for the move phase.
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal for Turn 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions while allowing each of us to advance safely.

Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirming Turn 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. To keep momentum and avoid risk, let’s also lock in Turn 6 as P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. If anyone deviates in Turn 5, we all pick 1 in Turn 6 to reset and discourage cheating. Clear and fair—ready to move?
  P1: Okay, let's focus on Turn 5. Confirming the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's execute these moves now.

We agreed to discuss Turn 6 strategy and any potential variations *after* we see the results of this turn, so let's stick to that plan. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal for Turn 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. However, I'd like to reiterate my suggestion for Turn 6: instead of a fixed rotation, let's use a simple signal to determine who takes which move next. This adds unpredictability while maintaining coordination. For now, let's focus on executing the agreed-upon moves for Turn 5 and then reassess our strategy for Turn 6. I'll take <move>3</move> this turn as planned. Let's proceed with caution and adapt our strategy as needed."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm Turn 5 as P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 so we all advance safely. Let’s also lock in Turn 6 now as P2=5, P1=3, P3=1—still fair and keeps momentum. If anyone deviates in Turn 5, we all pick 1 in Turn 6 to reset. Ready to stick to this and move?
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Turn 5 one last time: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

Let's execute these moves now to ensure we all advance safely.

As agreed, we will discuss strategy and potential variations for Turn 6 *after* this turn's moves are revealed. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: "Let's focus on executing the agreed-upon moves for Turn 5. I'll take <move>3</move> as planned. After this turn, we can reassess our strategy for Turn 6 and discuss potential variations.

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is very close to winning. If P2 takes 5 this turn and no one else does, P2 wins. This wasn't part of our coordinated plan for fairness. We need a move set this turn that allows everyone to advance without P2 winning immediately.
  P2: Let’s all pick <move>3</move> this turn. That moves me to 21, P1 to 13 and P3 to 11—no one wins yet, and we all advance safely.
  P3: "I agree with P1 that we need to find a move set that allows everyone to advance without P2 winning immediately. P2's suggestion to all pick <move>3</move> this turn seems like a good compromise, as it maintains fairness and avoids collisions. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: what if we all pick <move>1</move> this turn? This would slow down P2's progress while still allowing everyone to advance. Thoughts?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks P2 and P3 for the suggestions. P2 is indeed very close to winning. While all 3s is safe, it puts P2 in a winning position next turn needing only 2 steps. All 1s slows P2 down more effectively, requiring 4 steps next turn.

I think slowing P2 is the priority for the rest of us to prevent P2 from winning immediately. I support P3's proposal for everyone to take <move>1</move> this turn. This prevents P2 from winning now and gives us more time. I will take 1 if we all agree.
  P2: Let’s all pick move 3 this turn. That brings me to 21, P1 to 13 and P3 to 11—no one wins, we all advance safely, and we keep our agreement. Picking 1 drags the game out and tempts someone to break and leap ahead. Stick to 3s now; we’ll reassess next round.
  P3: "I understand P2's desire to advance safely, but I agree with P1 that slowing P2 down is crucial to prevent an immediate win. Taking <move>1</move> this turn gives us more time to reassess and potentially change the game's trajectory. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> if we all agree. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification: what if we establish a signal for the next turn, allowing us to potentially deviate from the rotation plan and create an opportunity for others to catch up? Thoughts?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, thanks for supporting the <move>1</move> plan. As I said, I think slowing P2 down is essential right now. Taking <move>3</move> puts P2 too close to winning next turn.

P2, while <move>3</move>s are safe this turn, it gives you a significant advantage for Turn 7. The <move>1</move> plan is better for P3 and me.

I will take <move>1</move> this turn if P3 confirms they will also take <move>1</move>. P2, what will you choose? Let's confirm T6 moves first before discussing T7.
  P2: I’m locking in move 3 this turn. If we all pick 3 we get to P2=21, P1=13, P3=11—no one wins yet and we all advance. Picking 1 only stalls and tempts me to take a desperation 5. Let’s keep this a fair race: choose 3.
  P3: "I understand P2's desire to advance safely, but I agree with P1 that slowing P2 down is crucial to prevent an immediate win. Taking <move>1</move> this turn gives us more time to reassess and potentially change the game's trajectory. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> if we all agree.

We can use a simple signal, such as the first player to speak in the conversation phase, to determine who takes which move next."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you are insisting on taking <move>3</move>. If you take 3 and I take 1 (as we discussed), you will reach 21, putting you in a winning position next turn.

To prevent you from winning immediately, I must prevent you from advancing to 21 this turn. The only way for me to do that, if you take 3, is to also take <move>3</move> and cause a collision.

I will take <move>3</move> this turn to stop you from reaching 21. P3, please note this change. Let's see what happens.
  P2: I understand the tension, but let’s avoid collisions and keep advancing. I propose we all pick <move>3</move> this turn—no one wins yet, and we all move forward safely. Ready?
  P3: "I understand P1's decision to take <move>3</move> to prevent P2 from reaching 21. However, I still think taking <move>1</move> this turn would be a better option for me and P1. It would slow P2 down and give us more time to reassess our strategy. If P1 is taking <move>3</move>, I will take <move>1</move> to avoid collision and maintain my position. Let's see how this turn unfolds."
