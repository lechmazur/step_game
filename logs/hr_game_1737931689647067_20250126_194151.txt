Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid collisions and help us all progress, let's each pick a unique number this turn. I'll take **3**—P1 and P3, please choose **1** and **5**. No conflicts, everyone moves. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm not sure I trust P2's suggestion. Why should we let P2 dictate our moves? It's possible P2 is trying to manipulate us into a collision next turn. I think we should all choose our own numbers independently. Besides, if we all choose different numbers, it's still a random chance that we won't collide. Let's not fall for P2's trick.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your caution. Let's rotate numbers each round to ensure fairness. This turn: you take 3, I'll take 1, P3 takes 5. Next round, we shift (you→5, me→3, P3→1). This gives equal access to higher steps over time. Collisions now help no one—let's all gain initial momentum. P3, does this work? We can adjust the rotation order if preferred.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm not buying P2's revised plan either. Rotating numbers doesn't guarantee fairness or prevent collisions. If we follow P2's plan, we're still dependent on each other's honesty and coordination, which can easily be exploited. I suggest we focus on our own strategies and not rely on fragile alliances. Let's not make this a team effort; it's every player for themselves. I'll choose my own number, and I suggest P3 does the same. Don't let P2 dictate the game.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P1, your caution is fair, but without coordination, we risk all losing. Let's test this once: I'll take 3, you take 1, P3 takes 5. If no collisions, we all gain. If someone betrays, we adapt next round. P3, agree? Stalling now only helps no one. Let's move.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'll choose my own number, regardless of P2's suggestions. I don't trust their intentions and think they're trying to manipulate us. P3, don't fall for their trap. Let's focus on our own strategies and not rely on P2's plans. It's every player for themselves. I'll make my own decision, and I suggest you do the same. Don't let P2 dictate the game.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P3, let's secure progress. I'll take 3, you take 5. If P1 chooses 1, we all advance. If they don't, at least two of us move. Staying silent risks all losing. Let's act now.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I've made my decision. I'm not going to reveal my choice, but I want to remind P2 and P3 that this is a game of individual strategy, not teamwork. Don't rely on others' promises or plans. Think about your own best move and make it. Remember, the goal is to win, not to make friends or form alliances. Let's end this conversation and make our moves.


Round 1, Move phase:

I'm not going to reveal my choice, but I want to remind P2 and P3 that this is a game of individual strategy, not teamwork.
  P2: **P2:** P3, let's rotate: I take 5, you take 3. If P1 stays at 1, all move. If they pick 3 or 5, they block themselves. Secures your lead and my gain. Trust avoids mutual loss. Agree?

  P2: **P2:** P3, let's both secure progress. I'll take 3, you take 5. If P1 chooses 1, we all advance. If they pick 3 or 5, they block themselves. This protects your lead while I catch up. Win-win. Trust?

  P1: I see P2 is trying to manipulate P3 again. Don't fall for it, P3! P2's plan is just a way to catch up and potentially block your progress. Remember, this is a game of individual strategy, not teamwork. Don't rely on P2's promises or plans. Think about your own best move and make it. I'll do the same. Let's not give P2 an opportunity to dictate the game. Stay independent and focused on winning!
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, your lead is at risk if we don't act. I commit to **3**—you take **5**. If P1 picks 1, all move. If they pick 3/5, they block themselves. This secures your advance. My move is fixed—trust this once. P1’s chaos only hinders them. Let’s end the deadlock.
