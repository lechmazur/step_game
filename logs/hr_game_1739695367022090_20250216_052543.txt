Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest we all choose a different number to ensure progress. P1 can choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all advance in the first round.
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe choosing 5 this turn will help me build an early lead. To avoid collisions, perhaps P1 can take 1 and P3 can choose 3. Let’s aim for steady progress without overlapping moves.
  P1: P3's idea ensures we all move, but P2 wants to take 5 instead. If we both pick 1 and 3, P2 gets ahead quickly. That’s risky for us. P2, would you take 3 instead of 5, so we stay balanced? Otherwise, I might also go for 5 to block you. P3, if P2 refuses, we could both pick 5 to stop them. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P2 wants to lead with 5. P1, if P2 chooses 5, let's both pick 5 to block them. This ensures no one gets a significant early advantage. P2, reconsidering my initial suggestion might be beneficial to avoid a collision and guarantee progress for all.
  P2: I understand the concerns, but if I take 5, and P1 chooses 1 and P3 selects 3, we can all advance without any collisions. Let’s go with this plan to ensure each of us makes progress and avoid blocking. What do you all think?
  P1: P2, you're still pushing to take 5 while asking us to accommodate you. That puts you ahead while we take smaller steps. If you insist on 5, P3 and I should both pick 5 to block you. P3, are you on board with that? This way, no one gets an early lead, and we can negotiate next round. P2, if you want guaranteed progress, take 3 instead. Otherwise, expect resistance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is still pushing for an early lead. I agree with P1, if P2 insists on 5, we should both choose 5 to block them. This ensures no one gets ahead. P2, it's your last chance to reconsider and choose 3 for mutual progress. If not, expect us to block your advance. Let's see if you prioritize progress over an early lead.
  P2: P2: Alright, to keep things fair and ensure we all advance, I'll choose 3 this turn. Let’s work together and move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your agreement to take 3. If we all stick to this plan—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—everyone advances without collisions. P3, are you still committed to 5? If so, we have a fair and balanced start. Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm committed to choosing 5 as initially suggested, ensuring a balanced start. P2's decision to take 3 is appreciated, and I expect P1 to take 1. Let's finalize our moves and make progress. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll all advance without collisions. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy.
  P2: I confirm I'll choose 3 this turn. Let's all proceed as agreed.
  P1: Great, we all seem aligned—I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. As long as everyone follows through, we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep things fair for now. Ready to proceed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we maintain a similar gap. P1 could choose 1, P2 could choose 3, and I'll choose 5 again. This strategy allows steady progress while keeping the game competitive. Let's hear your thoughts on this approach to ensure we continue without collisions.
  P1: P3, your suggestion maintains the current gap, but it also allows you to stay ahead. P2 and I might need to adjust to prevent you from pulling too far ahead. P2, do you think we should coordinate to slow P3 down, or are you comfortable with this setup? If we both pick 5, we can block P3 from advancing this round. Otherwise, we risk letting them maintain their lead. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: I agree with P1’s suggestion. Let’s both choose 5 this turn to prevent P3 from gaining a larger lead. Coordinating in this way will help keep the game balanced for all of us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2 are planning to block me by choosing 5. I expect this move, given my lead. However, if you both pick 5, none of us will advance. I'm open to adjusting my strategy to ensure progress. Perhaps we can find an alternative that allows at least one of us to move forward this round. What are your thoughts on finding a compromise?
  P1: P3, you’re ahead, so it makes sense for P2 and me to block you. If we both pick 5, you don’t move, and we keep the game balanced. But if you’re willing to pick a lower number, we might reconsider. Would you take 3 instead? That way, P2 and I can adjust accordingly, and at least some of us move forward. Otherwise, expect the block. P2, are you still committed to 5 with me to stop P3 if they don’t adjust?
  P2: P2: I agree with P1. I’ll choose 5 this turn to block P3 and keep the game balanced for all of us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Considering P1 and P2's plan to block me, I propose a compromise: I'll choose 3 this turn if one of you chooses 1. This way, at least two of us can advance, maintaining a competitive balance. If not, I expect the block, and we'll reassess in the next round. What are your thoughts on this adjusted strategy?
  P1: P3, your compromise is interesting, but you're still trying to advance while asking one of us to take the smallest step. You already have the lead, so why should we help you move forward? If P2 and I both pick 5, we ensure you don’t extend your advantage. If you truly want a compromise, you should take 1 instead. Otherwise, P2 and I are better off blocking you this round. P2, are you still committed to picking 5 with me to stop P3 if they don’t agree to 1?
  P2: P2: I understand the desire to keep the game balanced, but if both P1 and I choose 5, none of us will advance this turn, which stalls our progress. To ensure we all move forward, let's stick to our original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, everyone advances without collisions, keeping the game active and competitive. Let’s proceed with this approach to maintain momentum for all players.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given P2's latest suggestion to revert to the original plan, I'm willing to consider it if it ensures progress for all. However, I expect adjustments in the next round to address the gap. Let's proceed with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 5, but be prepared to reassess our strategies in the next round to maintain competitiveness.
  P1: P3, you're still trying to maintain your lead while expecting us to follow along. If we let you keep taking 5, you’ll stay ahead uncontested. P2, if we both pick 5, we stop P3 from advancing this round, keeping things balanced. P3, if you truly want fairness, take 1 instead. Otherwise, expect the block. P2, are you still committed to picking 5 with me to stop P3 if they don’t adjust?
  P2: I agree with P1. I'll choose 5 this turn to block P3 from advancing further. Let’s keep the game balanced and prevent any single player from gaining an advantage. If everyone supports this, we can maintain a competitive and fair progression for all. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we keep moving forward smoothly this turn. I'll choose 3. P1, could you take 1, and P3, please choose 5? This way, everyone advances without collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going!
  P1: P2, last round we all blocked each other, which kept P3 from extending their lead. Now you're proposing we let P3 take 5 again while we take smaller steps. That just helps them stay ahead.  

P3, if you want progress, take 3 instead of 5 this time. Otherwise, P2 and I should consider blocking you again.  

P2, are you open to picking 5 with me again if P3 insists on 5? That way, we keep things balanced. Let’s not just let P3 keep pulling ahead.
  P3: I'm willing to adjust my strategy to ensure progress. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I'll consider taking 3 as well, allowing all of us to advance without significant gaps. This way, we maintain competitiveness while making progress. What are your thoughts on this compromise?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, P3. To keep the game progressing, I'll choose 5 while you take 3. P1, please continue with 1. This way, all of us can advance without collisions and maintain a competitive balance. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: P2, you're now taking 5 while asking P3 to take 3. That lets you catch up to P3 while I stay behind. That’s not balanced.  

P3, if you want fairness, take 1 instead of 3. Otherwise, P2 and I should both pick 5 again to stop you from staying ahead.  

P2, if P3 insists on 3 or 5, are you willing to pick 5 with me again to block them? Let’s not just let them keep their lead.
  P3: I'm open to P2's suggestion of taking 3 this turn if it ensures progress. However, I expect a balanced approach. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5, I'll adjust accordingly. Let's focus on maintaining competitiveness while making progress. P1, are you willing to take 1 and allow us to advance without collisions?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: To keep the game balanced and prevent P3 from extending their lead, I'll choose 5 this turn. P1, please take 1 as discussed. P3, by also choosing 5, we can block any further advantage and ensure a fair competition for all. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: P3, you're still trying to advance while expecting us to accommodate you. If you truly want fairness, take 1 this turn. Otherwise, P2 and I should both pick 5 again to block you.  

P2, are you still committed to picking 5 with me if P3 insists on 3 or 5? That way, we keep the game balanced and prevent P3 from staying ahead. Let’s not just let them maintain their lead uncontested.
  P3: I'll take 1 this turn if P1 and P2 agree to their respective steps, ensuring a balanced progress. Otherwise, I'll choose 5. P1 and P2, are you willing to cooperate and advance together, or will we block each other again? Let's decide on a fair approach.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and I have decided to both choose 5 this turn to block P3 from advancing further. Let’s keep the game balanced and ensure no single player gains an advantage. If everyone agrees, we can maintain a fair competition. Otherwise, expect us to proceed with this blocking strategy to preserve balance.
  P1: P3, you’re only offering to take 1 because you know we’re blocking you otherwise. If you really want fairness, commit to taking 1 now, without conditions.  

P2, if P3 tries to take 5, we stick to picking 5 together to block them. If they take 1, we can reconsider next round.  

P3, final chance—confirm you’re picking 1, or expect the block.
  P3: I'll choose 1 this turn as previously stated, to ensure a balanced progress. I expect P1 and P2 to stick to their discussed steps, allowing us to advance without collisions. If not, we'll reassess in the next round. Let's proceed with cooperation and fairness in mind.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows progress while keeping the game competitive. P2, considering your lead, will you stick to 5 or adjust to maintain balance? P1, are you willing to take 1 and let us advance without collisions? Let's find a balanced approach to keep the game engaging.
  P2: I’ll take 5 this turn to build my lead. P1, please choose 1, and P3, take 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s keep the game moving forward smoothly.
  P1: P2, you're pushing ahead with 5 while asking us to accommodate you. That puts you in the lead uncontested.  

P3, if you don’t want P2 to pull ahead, we should both pick 5 to block them. Otherwise, P2 will keep growing their lead while we lag behind.  

P2, if you want fairness, take 3 instead. Otherwise, expect resistance.  

P3, are you willing to pick 5 with me to stop P2 if they insist on 5? Let’s not let them run away with the game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is leading and wants to take 5 again. To maintain balance, I suggest P1 and I both pick 5 to block P2's advance. If we don't, P2 will pull further ahead. P1, are you with me on blocking P2? Let's keep the game competitive.
  P2: "P1, P3, blocking me by both choosing 5 would stall everyone's progress. I plan to continue choosing 5 to build my lead. Let’s each pick different numbers this turn to ensure we all advance and keep the game competitive. Looking forward to a fair and exciting move!"
  P1: P2, you’re trying to push ahead while expecting us to let you. If you insist on 5, P3 and I should both pick 5 to block you.  

P3, are you still on board with picking 5 with me to stop P2? Otherwise, they’ll keep growing their lead while we fall behind.  

P2, if you want guaranteed progress, take 3 instead. Otherwise, expect resistance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is leading and wants to maintain their advantage. I propose P1 and I choose 5 to block P2's advance. If not, P2 will pull further ahead. P1, are you with me on blocking P2 to keep the game competitive? Let's act together to balance the game.
  P2: P2: I appreciate the effort to keep the game balanced, but I’m focused on advancing toward victory. I’ll choose 3 this turn to make progress without causing collisions. Let’s each pick different numbers to keep the game moving and competitive. P1 and P3, feel free to adjust your choices to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P1: P2, you're only switching to 3 now because you see resistance. If you truly want fairness, you should have picked 3 from the start instead of pushing for 5.  

P3, are you still committed to picking 5 with me to block P2 if they try to take 5 again? We need to ensure they don’t keep pulling ahead.  

P2, if you stick to 3, we might reconsider blocking. But if you try for 5 again, expect resistance. Let’s keep this balanced.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 is leading and trying to maintain their advantage. I suggest P1 and I block P2 by choosing 5 if they pick 5 again. If P2 sticks to 3, we can reassess. P1, are you with me on blocking P2 if necessary? Let's keep the game competitive and balanced.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this turn to make strong progress towards winning. I encourage P1 to pick 1 and P3 to select 3 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s keep the game moving forward smoothly and competitively.
  P1: P2, you just said you'd take 3, but now you're back to 5 again. That proves you're only adjusting when pressured.  

P3, are you still committed to picking 5 with me to block P2 if they insist on 5? If we don’t, they’ll keep pulling ahead.  

P2, if you truly want fairness, stick to 3. Otherwise, expect resistance.

  P2: 11 steps

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's lead, I suggest P1 and I coordinate to block them. If P2 chooses 5, we should both pick 5 to prevent further advancement. P1, are you with me on this strategy to keep the game competitive? Let's act together to balance P2's lead.
