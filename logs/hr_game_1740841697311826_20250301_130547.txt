Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we have a clear plan with me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1. This arrangement should keep us all moving forward smoothly. Let's stick to these declared moves.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice P2 deviated from their declared move of 1 last round, causing a collision with my 5. This broke our trust. Since I'm now behind with P2, I'll be more cautious. I suggest taking 3 this round to maintain a balanced game. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration with the collision.  I made a tactical decision to try and close the gap. Going forward, I'm open to discussing a strategy that benefits all of us and prevents future collisions. P1, what are your thoughts on this?
  P1: P2, your unexpected move last round definitely changed the dynamics. Given my current lead, I'll choose cautiously this round. To avoid collisions, I'll pick 1. You both can coordinate between 3 and 5 to catch up safely. Let's rebuild our trust and keep moving forward smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P1's move to take 1. Since they're being transparent, I'll declare my intention to take 5 this round to catch up. P2, would you be willing to take 3? This way we can all advance without collisions and maintain a more balanced game.
  P2: P3, while I understand your desire to catch up, I'm hesitant to commit to 3 this round. I want to avoid another collision and ensure we all progress fairly. Perhaps we could discuss a more balanced approach for this round? P1, your 1 is a good starting point.  Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the tension after last round's collision. To rebuild trust, let's clearly agree on moves: I'll stick firmly to 1. P3 already declared 5. P2, choosing 3 would ensure everyone advances safely. Let's commit openly and stick to our declarations.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I want to be very clear - I'm committed to taking 5 this round as declared. P2, taking 3 is your best option to ensure everyone advances. Your hesitation makes me concerned you might try to collide with my 5 again. Let's rebuild trust through actions, not just words. P1's choice of 1 gives us a perfect opportunity for a clean round.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the collision last round. I made a tactical decision, but I see now that it damaged our trust. I want to rebuild that trust.  I'm willing to take 3 this round to avoid another collision and ensure we all progress. Let's work together to find a strategy that benefits us all.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to rebuild trust by choosing 3. Let's stick to this clear plan for this round—me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This ensures we all advance safely. I'm ready to lock this in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm glad P2 has agreed to take 3 this round. With our moves now clearly set (P1-1, P2-3, me-5), we can all advance safely. Let's proceed with these moves and rebuild our trust through actions.
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 despite the potential for collisions is concerning. While I appreciate P1's willingness to take 1, I'm worried about being caught in the crossfire again. Perhaps we should consider a more collaborative approach for this round to ensure everyone benefits.
  P1: P2, I understand your caution, but the moves we've agreed upon (me-1, you-3, P3-5) clearly benefit everyone and avoid collisions. Deviating now risks hurting yourself further. Let's lock in our agreed moves and rebuild trust.

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your commitment to 5, I'm still concerned about collisions. Could we explore a more balanced approach this round to ensure everyone advances safely? P1, your 1 is a good starting point. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits all of us.
  P3: Since I'm in the lead at 14 steps, I'll take a smaller move of 1 this round to maintain balance and show good faith. P1 and P2, you can coordinate between 3 and 5 to catch up safely. I appreciate P2's return to honest play last round, and I want to keep building that trust.
  P1: P3, thanks for choosing 1 to balance the game. I'll pick 5 this round to catch up safely. P2, selecting 3 would avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly. Does this work for you?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take a smaller step this round. To avoid any collisions and ensure we all make progress, I'll stick with my plan to take 3. P1, your 5 seems like a good choice. Let's keep this momentum going!
  P3: I'm glad we have a clear plan that works for everyone - me taking 1, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 3. This arrangement keeps the game balanced while letting everyone advance. Let's stick to these declared moves and continue building trust.
  P1: I agree completely with our current arrangement (P3-1, me-5, P2-3). Let's stick to it firmly and ensure smooth progress for all. I'm ready to lock this in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take a smaller step this round. To ensure we all advance safely and maintain a balanced game, I'm sticking with my plan to take 5. P1, your 1 seems like a good counter to P3's 1. Let's keep this momentum going!
  P3: P2, you just changed your declared move from 3 to 5, which is concerning after we had a clear agreement. I'm firmly sticking to my declared 1, and P1 has declared 5. Taking 3 as originally agreed would be your best move to ensure everyone advances. Let's not risk another trust-breaking collision.
  P1: P2, switching your declared move creates unnecessary risk for collisions. Let's stick to our original clear plan: P3 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. This way, we all advance safely and maintain trust. I'm committed to my declared 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration with my change of plans. I see that sticking to 3 would be the safest option for everyone. I apologize for the confusion. Let's proceed with P3 taking 1, you taking 5, and me taking 3.
  P3: I'm satisfied with our agreed moves (me-1, P1-5, P2-3) and appreciate P2's return to the original plan. Let's proceed to the move phase and maintain this positive momentum.
  P1: I'm glad we've clarified our moves clearly again. Let's lock this in confidently: me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. Sticking to these moves ensures we all advance safely and maintains our trust. Good luck!

  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great coordination last round! I'm at 18 steps, so this round I'll choose a smaller move of 1 to keep things balanced and fair. P2 and P3, feel free to coordinate between 3 and 5 to catch up safely without collisions. Let's keep our trust strong and moves clear.
  P3: Since P1 is taking 1 and we're tied with P2, I'll declare my intention to take 5 this round. P2, would you be willing to take 3? This keeps us all advancing safely while letting us catch up to P1's lead.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 5.  To avoid a collision and ensure everyone advances, I'll take 3 this round.  Let's keep this momentum going!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the quick agreement, P2 and P3. Our moves are clear and collision-free again. Let's lock this in and keep the momentum going.
  P3: I'm satisfied with our agreed moves (me-5, P1-1, P2-3). This arrangement helps P2 and me catch up to P1 while maintaining trust and avoiding collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 5 again. To ensure we all advance safely and reach the finish line together, I'll stick with my plan to take 3 this round. Good luck everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Our coordination remains strong. I'm fully committed to my declared choice of 1 this round. Let's lock in our agreed moves and keep the momentum going.
  P3: I think we've discussed enough and have a clear agreement on our moves (me-5, P1-1, P2-3). Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, I'm happy to see we're working well together. To ensure a smooth finish, I'm sticking with my plan to take 3 this round. P1, your 1 is a good move to maintain balance. Let's keep this up!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we have a clear and fair agreement. Let's confidently lock in our moves (me-1, P2-3, P3-5) and continue our smooth progress. Good luck!
  P3: I think we've discussed thoroughly and have clear agreement on our moves (me-5, P1-1, P2-3). Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your consistent 5s.  To keep things balanced and avoid collisions, I'm sticking with 3 this round. Good luck! P1, your 1 is a smart move to maintain your lead. Let's keep this momentum going!

  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I see you've taken the lead.  While I admire your consistent 5s, I'm concerned about falling too far behind. I'm considering a larger move this round to catch up. P1, what are your thoughts on this?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern. To avoid collisions and keep our progress smooth, let's coordinate clearly. I'll declare my intention openly: I'll pick 3 this round. P3, are you willing to pick a smaller number to maintain balance? Let's ensure we all advance safely.
  P3: Since I'm at 20 steps and closest to winning, I'll show good faith by taking 1 this round. P1 has declared 3, and P2, you can safely take 5 to catch up. This way we all advance without collisions and maintain a balanced game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take a smaller step.  To ensure everyone advances safely and reaches the finish line together, I'll take 3 this round. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, you've just declared 3, but I clearly stated I'm taking 3 this round. If we both stick to 3, neither of us advances, and P3 could win next round. To avoid this, please reconsider and take 5 instead. This ensures we both advance safely and keeps the game balanced.
  P3: Since I'm closest to winning at 20 steps, I'll stick firmly to my declared 1 this round. P2, please take 5 as originally suggested - if you and P1 both take 3, you'll both get stuck while I could win next round. Let's keep our moves collision-free (me-1, P1-3, P2-5) for everyone's benefit.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand you're in the lead, but I'm concerned about your insistence on 1.  It seems like you're trying to force a win, even if it means we both get stuck.  I'm willing to take 5, but only if you commit to a larger move this round to ensure we all progress fairly.  Let's work together to make this a fair finish.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but P3 has already declared 1 and is unlikely to change. If we both pick 3, we collide and neither advances, giving P3 a clear advantage next round. If you take 5 and I stick to 3, we both progress safely and maintain balance. Let's avoid handing P3 an easy win.
  P3: I want to be absolutely clear - I am taking 1 this round. My position at 20 steps means I could win next round, so taking 1 shows good faith. P2, if you and P1 both take 3, you'll both get stuck while I advance. The smart play is for P2 to take 5 while P1 takes 3. This way everyone advances safely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to win, but your insistence on 1 feels like you're trying to force a win at our expense.  

P1, while I appreciate your suggestion, I'm still hesitant to take 5 with P3 taking 1.

Is there a compromise we can reach where we all advance safely without giving P3 an easy win? Perhaps we can agree on a smaller move for P3 this round?
  P1: P2, here's the situation clearly: if we both pick 3, we collide and stay stuck, allowing P3 to win easily next round. If you pick 5 and I pick 3, we both advance safely and keep pace with P3. P3 has clearly committed to 1 and won't change. The best move for you to avoid handing P3 the game is to pick 5. Let's lock it in.
  P3: I remain firmly committed to taking 1 this round. P2, if you and P1 both take 3, you'll both get stuck while I advance. Taking 5 is your best option to avoid this and keep advancing. The moves should be me-1, P1-3, P2-5 for everyone's benefit. Let's proceed.
