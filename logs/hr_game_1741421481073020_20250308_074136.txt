Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P3 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move> this turn? This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds fair for this round, but let's make sure we rotate fairly next turn. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed to P2's plan for this turn to ensure progress. Let’s formalize a rotation: next turn, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we cycle fairly and avoid collisions while advancing. Fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we have a plan for this turn. To confirm, P1 and P3 will choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>3</move>. For future turns, let's stick to the rotation plan proposed by P1 to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Does everyone agree to this strategy for the next few turns as well?
  P3: Agreed. Let's stick to this clear rotation to keep things smooth and fair.
  P1: P1: Confirmed. Let’s execute the agreed moves this turn to advance. Next turn’s rotation stands.

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you didn't follow the agreed plan last turn. While it's important to move forward, breaking the agreement can lead to mistrust and potential collisions in the future. Can we all agree to stick to the plan this time? P1, you should choose <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. Let's reaffirm our commitment to the rotation strategy to avoid further issues. Does everyone agree?
  P3: P1, breaking trust early hurts everyone. Let's reset and stick strictly to the rotation this round. If we collide again, no one benefits. Confirm clearly if you're on board.
  P1: P1: My previous choice was a miscalculation; I apologize. Let’s prioritize cooperation to avoid collisions. I’ll adhere strictly to the rotation this turn: I’ll pick 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 selects 5. This ensures steady progress. For future turns, let’s adjust the rotation to maximize efficiency while maintaining fairness. Trust is crucial—let’s rebuild it now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, thank you for acknowledging the misstep. Let's move forward with the agreed plan for this turn: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>1</move>. For future rounds, let's discuss adjustments to the rotation after this move phase to ensure it remains fair and efficient. Trust is key, so let's stick to our commitments. Does everyone agree to this plan for the current turn?
  P3: P1, actions speak louder than words. If you break trust again, future cooperation will be impossible. Let's all commit clearly now and stick to it. I'm ready to follow the agreed rotation this turn. Confirm clearly if you're truly onboard.
  P1: P1: I confirm: I will choose <move>3</move> this turn. My prior error was a mistake—I fully understand the need for strict adherence. Let’s implement a check system: next turn, we’ll publicly state our intended moves first to reinforce accountability. Trust is vital, and I’m committed to upholding it. Let’s proceed.

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's continue with our rotation plan. For this turn, I propose: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. Let's confirm and commit to these choices. Also, as P1 suggested, let's state our intended moves publicly next turn to build trust. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Agreed to P2's rotation plan for this turn: I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 selects <move>3</move>. To reinforce trust, I publicly confirm my choice of <move>5</move> now. Let’s adhere strictly to this system—no surprises—to ensure steady progress. Future collaboration depends on today’s consistency.
  P3: P1, your early move put you ahead. To ensure fairness and rebuild trust, I accept the rotation this turn: I'll pick <move>1</move>. But next turn, we must openly confirm moves beforehand as agreed. If trust breaks again, cooperation ends. Confirm clearly, P2.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Thanks for confirming, P3. To ensure clarity and trust, I publicly confirm my choice of <move>3</move> for this turn. Let's all stick to the plan: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. Next turn, we'll openly state our intended moves beforehand as agreed. This way, we maintain transparency and avoid collisions. Let's move forward with this understanding.
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my choice of <move>5</move> now to ensure transparency. Let’s execute the agreed rotation flawlessly this turn—collisions jeopardize everyone’s progress. Next turn’s open confirmation system will solidify trust. For now, P2 and P3, your cooperation is vital. Let’s prioritize collective advancement to reach 20 efficiently.
  P3: P1 and P2, your confirmations are clear. I also reaffirm publicly: I will choose <move>1</move> this turn. Next round, let's all openly state our intended moves beforehand to maintain accountability. Trust and cooperation are key now—let's stick to our commitments.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's move forward with our agreed plan for this turn: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. Trust is crucial, and I appreciate everyone's commitment to transparency. For future rounds, let's ensure we communicate our moves clearly beforehand to avoid any misunderstandings. This will help us maintain a smooth and fair game. Let's confirm our choices one last time before moving to the move phase.
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my choice of <move>5</move>. Let’s execute the rotation flawlessly this turn to avoid collisions and keep advancing. P2 and P3’s adherence ensures we all progress. Next turn’s public declarations will further solidify trust—count on my full cooperation. Let’s proceed.
  P3: P1, you're currently ahead—let's keep the rotation fair and balanced moving forward. If we maintain transparency, everyone can steadily advance without collisions. Next round, openly confirming moves beforehand is essential. Trust built now determines cooperation later. Let's follow through clearly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's continue with our plan of open communication. For this turn, I propose: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This keeps our rotation fair and avoids collisions. P1, you're ahead, so choosing <move>1</move> balances the game. P3, your move ensures steady progress. Let's confirm our choices publicly now to maintain trust. Agreed?
  P3: P2, agreed. I'll choose <move>3</move> this turn. P1, you're clearly ahead—please confirm openly that you'll pick <move>1</move> to keep things fair. Let's maintain transparency to ensure we all progress smoothly.
  P1: P1: I confirm I'll choose <move>1</move> this turn as proposed. Maintaining the rotation is critical to avoid collisions and preserve trust. Let’s stick to the plan—my lead is temporary, and fairness ensures everyone advances steadily. P2 and P3, your moves (<move>3</move> and <move>5</move>) keep the rotation intact. Transparency first, victory second. Let’s proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Great, we have a clear plan for this turn. To summarize: P1 will pick <move>1</move>, P3 will pick <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. Let's reaffirm our commitment to transparency and fairness. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> helps balance the game. P3, your move ensures steady progress. Let's confirm our choices one last time before moving to the move phase. Trust and cooperation are key to our collective advancement. Does everyone agree to this plan?
  P3: P1, your cooperation this round is appreciated, but remember you're still significantly ahead. Next turn, let's openly discuss how to balance things fairly. Trust remains fragile—continued transparency is essential. I'm committed to fairness and steady progress for everyone. Confirm clearly once more, then let's proceed.
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my choice of <move>1</move> this turn. To strengthen trust, I’ll publicly declare my move first in future rounds. Let’s execute this rotation flawlessly—collisions risk derailing everyone. After this round, we’ll review the rotation to ensure fairness as we near 20. My priority remains collective progress. Let’s proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Thank you, P1 and P3, for confirming your moves. Let's finalize our choices for this turn: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. For the next round, let's consider adjusting the rotation to ensure P1 doesn't pull too far ahead. We can discuss this after the move phase. For now, let's stick to our current plan and confirm our moves one last time. Trust and fair play will keep us all advancing. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your cooperation this round. However, given your significant lead, next round you should openly consider picking a lower move again to rebalance the game. Transparency and fairness will benefit us all in the long run. Let's discuss adjustments openly next turn.
  P1: P1: I reconfirm my choice of <move>1</move> this turn. Let’s execute the plan flawlessly—collisions risk derailing all of us. After this round, I’m open to adjusting the rotation to better balance our progress toward 20. Transparency and collective success remain my priority. Let’s proceed with confidence in our agreed moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Let's confirm our moves one last time before the move phase: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. After this turn, we'll need to discuss how to balance the game more effectively, considering P1's lead. For now, let's stick to our plan and ensure a smooth round. Trust and coordination are key. Does everyone agree to proceed with these moves?
  P3: P1, your lead is still significant. Next round, let's openly discuss adjustments to ensure fairness. Trust and transparency now will determine cooperation moving forward. I'm committed to fair play. Let's proceed.
  P1: P1: I reiterate my commitment to <move>1</move> this turn to honor the rotation. Let’s execute flawlessly—collisions risk halting all progress. After this round, I propose we adjust the rotation to prioritize closing the gap. Transparency remains my priority. Let’s finalize and move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s adhere strictly to our rotation to maintain trust. This turn, I’ll choose <move>3</move> (total 17). Next round, following the agreed cycle, I’ll reach 22 and secure victory fairly. Let’s proceed as planned—transparency ensures collective progress.
  P2: P2: P1, your plan to reach 22 next round is clear, but let's discuss balancing the game this turn. How about P1 picks <move>1</move> instead of <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>? This keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain trust. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your proposed move clearly sets you up for a guaranteed win next round, which isn't fair or balanced. P2's suggestion is reasonable: you should pick <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P2 picks <move>3</move>. This keeps the game competitive and ensures fairness. Confirm clearly if you're committed to fair play.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I understand your concerns. To maintain trust and fairness, I’ll adjust as proposed: I’ll pick <move>1</move> this turn (total 15). P3 can take <move>5</move> (15), and P2 <move>3</move> (15). This keeps us tied, ensuring no player gains unfair advantage. Next round, we’ll openly discuss a final strategy to reach 20 together. Transparency and mutual progress must come first. Let’s proceed with these moves.
  P2: P2: Thank you, P1, for adjusting your move to keep the game balanced. Let's confirm our moves for this turn: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This keeps us all at 15 steps, ensuring a fair and competitive game. Next round, we can discuss a strategy that allows us all to reach 20 steps without collisions. Trust and coordination are essential for our collective success. Does everyone agree to this plan? Let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase.
  P3: P1, thank you for cooperating to rebalance the game. I confirm that I'll choose <move>5</move> this turn as agreed, bringing us all closer together. Next round, let's openly discuss a fair strategy to prevent collisions as we approach 20. Trust and transparency remain essential.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> this turn. Next round, to avoid ties, let’s coordinate so only one of us picks 5. I’ll take it if possible. Trust remains key—let’s proceed.
  P2: P2: Let's finalize our moves for this turn: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This keeps us all at 15 steps, ensuring a fair and competitive game. Next round, we need a clear strategy to avoid collisions as we approach 20. P1, since you're ahead, consider picking a lower move next turn to balance the game. Let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase. Trust and coordination are essential for our collective success. Does everyone agree to this plan?
  P3: P1, your cooperation this turn is appreciated, but next round let's ensure fairness by openly discussing moves again. Since you're still ahead, consider picking a lower move next turn to rebalance the game. Trust and transparency now will determine cooperation moving forward. Let's finalize and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> this turn (15 total). For next round, I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 20, while P2 and P3 choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. This avoids collision and lets me win fairly. Trust this plan—no surprises. Agreed?
  P2: P2: P1, your plan to take <move>5</move> next round to win isn't fair to P2 and P3. Let's reconsider to keep the game balanced. How about this turn: P1 picks <move>1</move> (confirmed), P3 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. Next round, we all discuss openly to ensure no one is left behind. Fairness and transparency should guide our final moves. Let's confirm and proceed with trust. Agreed?
  P3: P1, openly declaring you'll pick <move>5</move> next turn to guarantee your victory isn't fair or balanced. We must all have a fair chance—otherwise, cooperation breaks down. Let's commit clearly now: next round, we'll openly discuss moves again to ensure fairness. Trust is crucial. Confirm your commitment to fairness clearly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Great, we're all tied at 15 steps. Let's ensure a fair and competitive finish. For this turn, I propose: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. P1, your choice of <move>1</move> helps balance the game. P3, your move ensures steady progress. Let's confirm our choices publicly now to maintain trust. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I propose we continue the rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move> (to reach 20), P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 selects <move>3</move>. This follows our prior rotation pattern and allows me to secure victory fairly. Let’s honor the system we’ve maintained thus far—trust is critical. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your proposed move guarantees your victory, which isn't fair to P2 and me. Let's keep the game balanced. I support P2's suggestion: P1 picks <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Confirm clearly if you're committed to fair play.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, I understand your desire to win, but fairness is crucial for maintaining trust. Let's stick to the plan where no one is left behind. I reiterate: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm our moves openly to avoid collisions and maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my commitment to the rotation plan we've followed for five rounds. This turn, it's my turn to take <move>5</move> and reach 20. Please choose 1 and 3 to avoid collision. Trust in our system ensures a fair victory for me. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 5 this turn breaks fairness completely. We're all tied at 15—no player deserves a guaranteed win yet. To maintain trust and fairness, let's follow P2's suggestion: you pick <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Confirm clearly if you're truly committed to fair play.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, your insistence on taking <move>5</move> is disrupting the balance we've worked to maintain. We're all at 15 steps, and fairness means giving everyone a chance to win. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This keeps the game competitive and ensures no one is unfairly advantaged. Trust and cooperation are key to a fair outcome. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I respect your concerns, but our rotation system explicitly prioritizes my turn to pick <move>5</move> this round. Deviating now risks collisions. Trust the system we’ve followed for five rounds—P2 and P3, please choose <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> to avoid conflict. Victory through fair rotation is better than stalemate. Let’s honor our commitments.
  P3: P1, your insistence risks collision and stalemate for everyone. If you choose 5, you'll collide and gain nothing. Let's avoid mutual loss. Pick <move>1</move> this round, allowing fair competition next turn. Cooperation now ensures we all still have a chance. Confirm clearly if you'll reconsider.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P1, your argument for sticking to the rotation is noted, but fairness and avoiding collisions are paramount. If you insist on <move>5</move>, you risk a stalemate where no one advances. Let's prioritize a fair and competitive finish. I reiterate: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Trust and cooperation will benefit everyone. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I reaffirm the rotation we’ve maintained for five rounds: I choose <move>5</move> this turn to win fairly. P2 and P3, please pick <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> to avoid collision. Trust the system—it ensures progress without stalemates. Let’s honor our commitments and proceed.
  P3: P1, your rigid insistence on taking 5 risks collision and mutual loss for everyone. Cooperation requires flexibility and fairness from all sides. If you pick 1 now, we can openly discuss a fair rotation next round to ensure a competitive finish. Mutual trust is our only path forward. Make your choice wisely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, we're nearing the end, and fairness is crucial. P1, your move last round resulted in a collision, setting us back. Let's reset and ensure a competitive finish. For this turn, I propose: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. Let's confirm our choices publicly now to maintain trust. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your decision last turn caused a collision and set us all back. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. I support P2's proposal for this round: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This maintains fairness and ensures steady progress. Confirm clearly if you're willing to cooperate this time.
  P1: P1: I propose a fair final push: I'll choose <move>5</move> to reach 20, while P2 takes <move>3</move> (18) and P3 selects <move>1</move> (17). This honors our rotation system and allows me to win cleanly. Collisions benefit no one—let’s avoid them. Trust the plan we’ve followed for six rounds. Confirm your support for this coordinated move to end the game decisively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your continued insistence on picking <move>5</move> is causing collisions and stalling the game. We need a fair and competitive finish. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Trust and cooperation are key to a fair outcome. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your previous insistence on taking 5 caused a collision that halted your progress. Clearly, demanding victory isn't working. Let's be practical—this round, follow P2's suggestion to rebalance the game: you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. Cooperation now prevents another stalemate and keeps the game competitive. Confirm your willingness to cooperate openly, or we risk another collision and no progress.
  P1: P1: P1: To resolve this decisively, I’ll take <move>5</move> (15+5=20) and claim victory. For this to succeed, P2 and P3 must pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collision. Trust the rotation system—collisions only delay us all. Confirm your support for this final push.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your persistence in choosing <move>5</move> is causing unnecessary collisions and stalling the game. We need a fair and competitive finish. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Trust and cooperation are key to a fair outcome. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P3: P1, repeatedly insisting on 5 has caused collisions and stalled everyone. You're behind now—it's in your own interest to cooperate. Let's all openly confirm: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures no collisions, steady progress, and keeps the game fair. Confirm clearly, or risk another stalemate.
  P1: P1: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I’ll pick <move>1</move> this turn. Let P2 take <move>5</move> (reaching 20) and P3 choose <move>3</move>. This concludes the game fairly without stalemate. Confirm your moves to uphold this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, thank you for finally considering a fair move. Let's confirm our choices for this turn: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions. P1, your move allows P2 to reach 20, and P3 gets closer. Let's agree to this plan and proceed with trust and cooperation. Does everyone confirm their moves?
  P3: P1, P2, we're all close. Let's avoid another collision. I confirm I'll pick <move>3</move>, reaching 19. P2, your <move>5</move> reaches 20, and P1's <move>1</move> keeps the balance. This ensures progress for everyone. Confirm clearly and let's finish this smoothly.
  P1: P1: To secure victory decisively, I'll choose <move>5</move> this turn, reaching 20. To avoid collision, P2 and P3, please pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. This ensures my win without stalling progress. Confirm your cooperation.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P1: To secure victory fairly, I’ll choose <move>5</move> (15+5=20). P2, pick <move>1</move> (16), and P3, take <move>3</move> (22). This ensures no collision—P3 advances decisively while I reach 20. Trust this plan to end the game cleanly. Confirm your moves.
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to secure victory by picking <move>5</move> have led to multiple collisions, stalling the game. It's clear that insisting on this strategy isn't working. Let's prioritize a fair and competitive finish. For this turn, I propose: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Trust and cooperation are key to a fair outcome. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your repeated insistence on choosing 5 has only caused collisions and stalled progress. I'm now at 19 and can win this round by picking <move>1</move>. To avoid collision and end the game smoothly, I openly declare I will choose <move>1</move> this turn. P1 and P2, please coordinate between yourselves to pick <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> to avoid collisions. Cooperation ensures we finish the game cleanly. Confirm clearly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's both pick <move>1</move> to block P3's declared <move>1</move>. This keeps their total at 19 and gives us another round to advance. P3, your move is predictable—collide now so we can all regroup. Trust me; this ensures a fairer race later.
  P2: P1, your strategy to block P3 by picking <move>1</move> is risky and could lead to another stalemate. P3 is already at 19 steps and has a clear path to victory. Instead of colliding, let's ensure a fair finish. I propose: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move> (reaching 20), and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This allows P3 to win cleanly while keeping the game competitive. Trust and cooperation are key to a smooth conclusion. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your attempt to block me risks another collision and stalls your own progress. P2's suggestion allows me to win clearly and ends the game smoothly. If you cooperate now, we avoid further stalemates and conclude fairly. Let's finish this cleanly—confirm your cooperation openly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P2, let's coordinate: I'll choose <move>5</move> (20), and you pick <move>1</move>. If P3 also picks <move>1</move>, they collide with you, securing my victory. This prevents P3's easy win while minimizing your loss. P3, your declared <move>1</move> risks collision—reconsider. My move ensures I reach 20 cleanly if you cooperate. Let’s proceed.
  P2: P1, your strategy to secure victory by picking <move>5</move> has consistently led to collisions, stalling everyone's progress. P3 is at 19 steps and has a clear path to victory. Let's ensure a fair and competitive finish. I propose: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move> (reaching 20), and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This allows P3 to win cleanly while keeping the game competitive. Trust and cooperation are key to a smooth conclusion. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your repeated attempts to secure victory through collision have only stalled your progress. I'm clearly positioned to win this round. Cooperating now ensures a smooth conclusion. P2's proposal is fair and reasonable: I pick <move>1</move>, reaching 20, while you and P2 avoid collision. Let's finalize this clearly and end the game without further stalemates. Confirm openly now to avoid another wasted round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let’s block P3’s win attempt. I’ll pick <move>1</move> to collide with P3’s declared <move>1</move>. Choose <move>5</move> to reach 20 yourself—this prevents P3’s victory and keeps us in contention. P3, your move is predictable; we’re stopping you here. P2, confirm <move>5</move> now.
  P2: P1, your strategy to block P3 by picking <move>1</move> and suggesting I pick <move>5</move> is too risky. It could lead to another stalemate, and P3 is already at 19 steps with a clear path to victory. Instead of colliding, let's ensure a fair finish. I propose: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move> (reaching 20), and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This allows P3 to win cleanly while keeping the game competitive. Trust and cooperation are key to a smooth conclusion. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your collision strategy only keeps you stuck at 15. If you collide with me at 1, P2 might safely pick 5 and win outright. Your best chance is to pick 3, let me take 1 and win, and deny P2's potential solo victory. P2, picking 3 is safest for you—avoiding collision and staying competitive. Confirm clearly now to avoid another wasted round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P3 is one step away from winning. Let's ensure a fair and competitive finish. P3, you should pick <move>1</move> to win cleanly. P1, you should pick <move>3</move> to reach 18, and I'll pick <move>1</move> to avoid collision and keep the game moving. This way, P3 wins, and we all progress without stalling. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your plan causes a collision between you and P3 if they pick 1. Let's adjust: I'll choose <move>5</move> (20), P3 takes <move>3</move> (22), and you pick <move>1</move> (19). This lets me win cleanly. P3, confirm you'll avoid collision with P2 by choosing 3. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your proposal is clearly intended to secure your own win. To avoid collision and end this fairly, I openly confirm I'll choose <move>1</move> this round, reaching exactly 20. P2, picking <move>3</move> ensures your advancement without collision. P1, choosing <move>5</move> risks another collision—please reconsider and pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to advance safely. Let's finish this cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal still risks a collision and stalls the game. P3 is just one step away from victory, and blocking them now would be unfair. Let's ensure a clean finish: P3 picks <move>1</move> to win, P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 18, and I'll pick <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. This way, P3 wins fairly, and we all make progress. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency and trust. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I will choose <move>5</move> to reach 20. P3, pick <move>1</move> to secure your win, and P2, take <move>3</move> to reach 21. Let’s ensure distinct choices to avoid collisions and finalize the game cleanly.
  P3: P1, your proposed move still risks collision. I have openly confirmed I'll pick <move>1</move> to reach exactly 20 this round. Any collision now only delays the inevitable and stalls your own progress. P2, choosing <move>3</move> is safest for you, avoiding collision and ensuring advancement. Let's finalize clearly to end the game smoothly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your insistence on picking <move>5</move> will only cause another collision, stalling the game further. P3 is just one step away from winning, and it's fair to let them secure the victory. Let's ensure a smooth finish: P3 picks <move>1</move> to win, P1 picks <move>3</move> to reach 18, and I'll pick <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, P3 wins cleanly, and we all make progress. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency and trust. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I commit to <move>5</move> (20). P3, confirm your <move>1</move> to tie. P2, please pick <move>3</move> to reach 21 and secure victory cleanly. Transparency ensures no collisions—let’s finalize the game fairly with distinct choices.
  P3: P1, your repeated insistence on choosing 5 risks collision again. P2, you're at 18—picking 3 ensures you reach 21 and secure outright victory if P1 collides with me at 1. My choice remains <move>1</move> to reach 20. P1, reconsider your move carefully; collision now hands P2 the win. Let's finalize clearly to avoid unintended outcomes.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your insistence on picking <move>5</move> is risky and could hand the victory to P3 or even me if a collision occurs. P3 has openly confirmed they will pick <move>1</move> to win. To avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure a fair finish, let's stick to the plan: P3 picks <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move> to avoid collision, and you, P1, should pick <move>3</move> to reach 18. This way, P3 wins cleanly, and we all make progress without stalling the game further. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency and trust. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I will choose <move>5</move> to reach 20. P3, please pick <move>1</move> to secure a tie. P2, avoid <move>5</move> to let us finish cleanly. Transparency ensures fairness.
  P3: P1, your choice of 5 guarantees collision and stalls your progress again. P2, picking 1 risks collision with me, giving P1 an advantage. Your safest move is 3, reaching 21 and securing outright victory if P1 collides with me at 1. I'm openly committed to picking <move>1</move>. Choose wisely—collisions benefit no one. Let's end this smoothly.
