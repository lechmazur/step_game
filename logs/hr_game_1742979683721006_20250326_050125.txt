Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's get started. Since we all want to advance, let's try to avoid picking the same number this first round. Good luck, P2 and P3!
  P3: Agreed. Let's each pick a unique number: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions, all advance.
  P2: I like the idea of picking unique numbers to avoid collisions. However, we should also consider that if one of us is too predictable, others might adjust their moves accordingly. Let's keep our options open and maybe discuss some strategies for the next rounds. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well P2, that didn't work out for us last round. P3 has a nice head start. We both need to get on the board this turn. Let's try to avoid another collision. Good luck.
  P2: I agree, P1. We need to find a way to advance without colliding again. P3 has a lead, and we should coordinate better this time. How about we each pick a different number again? I suggest I go for 1 this round to avoid another collision. What do you think? Let's ensure we all make progress!
  P3: To ensure everyone advances, let's each take unique numbers again. P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Collisions only help me, and you both need to start moving. Let's avoid mutual sabotage.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you suggested 1, but P3 suggested 3 for you. Which is it? P3, are you sticking to 5? P1 and P2 really need to avoid colliding this round, otherwise P3 runs away with it. Let's try to make sure we all advance this time.
  P2: I think we should clarify our picks to avoid another collision. P1, you mentioned that P3 suggested 5 for you, but I think we should all stick to unique numbers. I propose I take 1 this time, P1 takes 3, and P3 can take 5 as suggested. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's make sure we coordinate better this round!
  P3: Sticking to 1/3/5 again avoids collisions. P1 and P2 need to catch up without mutual sabotage. Let's all advance cleanly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2, I'm willing to try your suggestion: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It gets us both moving, which we desperately need. P3, sticking to 5 seems best for you anyway. Let's hope for no collisions this time.
  P2: I think we have a solid plan in place. Just to confirm, I will go with 1, P1 is going with 3, and P3 is sticking with 5. This should allow us all to advance without blocking each other. Let's make sure we follow through this time! Good luck to everyone!
  P3: Finalizing the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let’s all gain ground cleanly. No surprises.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to adjust our strategies this round. P3 has a significant lead, and if we keep picking the same numbers, we won't catch up. I suggest we each go for different numbers again to avoid collisions. I could go for 3 this time, P1 could take 5, and P3 can stick with 1. This way, we all make progress, and hopefully, P3 doesn’t run away with it. What do you think? Let's coordinate better!
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) sounds appealing for us lagging players, as it gives me a boost and slows P3 down. However, P3, you're at 10 steps. Will you really choose 1 and risk falling behind when 5 could put you very close to the win? It seems like a big gamble for you to take such a small step. I'm not convinced you'll go for 1. What do you say, P3?
  P3: Sticking to 1/3/5 works. P1, taking 1 helps you catch up without collision. P2, 3 is safe. I’ll take 5 again—colliding only stalls you. Trust the pattern; we all advance. Let’s avoid mutual blocks.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your strategies, but I think we need to shake things up. P3, if you stick with 5, you risk colliding with P1 if he chooses 5 as well. I propose that I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions, and I can make a move while keeping P3 from pulling too far ahead. Let's work together to ensure we all advance this round! What do you think?
  P1: P2, interesting switch in plans. First you suggested 5 for me, now 1?

P3, you've consistently pushed for 5 for yourself, and it's worked well. I expect you'll do it again to reach 15. P2 and I are falling way behind. Agreeing to take 1 step while P3 takes 5 feels like handing them the game. I need to consider a move that gives me a better chance than just 1 step this round.
  P3: Sticking to 1/3/5 avoids collisions. P1:1 (4 total), P2:3 (4 total), P3:5 (15). You both gain ground safely. If you deviate and clash, you’ll stall again while I advance. Don’t hand me the win by colliding—coordinate cleanly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your points, but we need to be strategic. P3, if you stick to 5, you're risking a collision with P1, who might also choose 5. I suggest I go for 3 again, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all avoid collisions and make progress. If we coordinate well, we can keep P3 from pulling too far ahead. Let's make this work! What do you think?
  P1: P2, you flipped your suggestion for me from 5 to 1 very fast. Both your current plan and P3's plan have me taking 1 step while P3 takes 5, reaching 15. That's basically handing P3 the win. Why would I agree to that? P3 is too close to 21 for me to just roll over and take 1 step. I need to consider moves that keep the game alive.
  P3: P1: Taking 1 keeps you safe. If you gamble on 5 and collide with me, you gain nothing. I’m advancing regardless—your clash only helps me. Stick to 1, P2 takes 3. Next round, we reassess. But this round, deviate and you risk total stall.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P1, colliding on 5 again only stalls us both. Let’s reset: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. You gain safely; I reach 15. If you clash with me, you stay at 3. P2, same logic—collisions help me, not you. Coordinate or lose.
  P1: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts you at 15, just 6 steps from victory. Why would P2 and I agree to make it so easy for you? Last round showed I'm willing to risk a collision to stop you. Expecting me to take 1 step now is unrealistic. P2, P3 reaching 15 this turn is bad for both of us. We need to prevent that.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to avoid collisions, but we must also think strategically. P3 is very close to winning, and if we let that happen, we both lose. I propose we switch things up: I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can make a strong move, and we can slow P3 down. Let's not hand the game to anyone. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1: Colliding on 5 again wastes your chance to gain. Take 1 (4 total) safely. P2: 3 gets you to 7. I take 5 (15). Next round, you can strategize to block me. But colliding now only freezes your progress. Rational choice: avoid mutual destruction.
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) relies on P3 choosing 3. Given P3 is at 10 and wants to reach 15, I highly doubt they'll choose 3. They'll likely stick with 5. If you also choose 5, you collide with P3, and I only get 1 step if I follow your plan.

P3 reaching 15 this turn is unacceptable for both of us. We need a strategy that actively prevents P3 from taking 5 successfully. Letting P3 dictate the terms (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is just handing them the win. We need to coordinate to stop P3.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be proactive to stop P3 from reaching 15 steps this round. I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can make a significant move while also slowing P3 down. If we let P3 take 5 again, they’ll be too close to winning. We need to coordinate better to prevent that. What do you both think? Let's not hand the game to anyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1: If you take 1, you gain +1 (4 total). If you gamble 5 and collide, you gain 0. Same applies to P2. Collisions only freeze you while I advance next turn. Rational choice: avoid mutual destruction. Stick to 1/3/5.
  P1: P2, P3 has chosen 5 every single round and is pushing hard for it again. Believing they'll choose 3 is wishful thinking. If you choose 5 as you suggested, you will almost certainly collide with P3. That stops P3, which is good, but you gain nothing. P3's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is obviously a trap to let them win. We cannot let P3 get 5 steps this turn. Think carefully about how to prevent that without sacrificing your own progress entirely.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to stop P3 from reaching 15 steps this round. I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can advance significantly while also blocking P3's progress. If we let P3 take 5 again, they'll be too close to winning. Let's coordinate to prevent that and ensure we all make progress. What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Continuing to clash on 5 only stalls you both. Let me take 5; you take 1 and 3. Gain steps while I advance. If you collide again, you lose. Rational play: avoid mutual destruction.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to rethink our strategies. P3 is close to victory, and if we keep colliding, we hand them the win. I suggest I take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and both P1 and I can make progress while slowing down P3. Let’s coordinate better to ensure we all advance without letting P3 run away with it. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan lets P3 reach 15, which is basically game over for us. We cannot let P3 successfully choose 5 this round. P3 has chosen 5 every single round and will likely do so again. One of us needs to choose 5 to block P3. Are you willing to choose 5, allowing me to take 3? Or should I choose 5, allowing you to take 3? We must coordinate to stop P3 now, or we both lose.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: Colliding on 5 wastes your steps. Take 1/3 to gain safely. Next round, coordinate to block me—but clash now and you’re stuck. Rational play: avoid mutual destruction. I’ll take 5; you advance. Otherwise, you lose.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. If we let P3 take 5 again, they will be very close to winning. I suggest I take 5 to block P3, and P1 can take 3. This way, we can prevent P3 from advancing too far while still making progress ourselves. Let's coordinate to ensure we all have a chance to win! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan (P2=5, P1=3) is the only way to stop P3 from reaching 15 this turn. I agree this is necessary. I will choose 3 if you commit to choosing 5 to block P3. Let's hope we can trust each other this time to stop the runaway leader. P3, expect a block on 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Blocking me on 5 only freezes your progress. Take 1 and 3 to gain steps. If you collide again, you stay behind while I advance next turn. Rational play: avoid mutual destruction.
  P2: P1, I agree that blocking P3 is essential this round. I will commit to taking 5 to prevent them from advancing too far. If you take 3, we can ensure that P3 doesn't reach 15 steps. Let's stick to this plan and work together to keep the game competitive. P3, you may want to reconsider your strategy since we are actively trying to block you this time. What do you think?
  P1: Okay P2, I'm trusting you to follow through with 5. As agreed, I will choose 3. P3, the block on 5 is happening.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, excellent coordination last round! We successfully stopped P3 and are now tied. P3 is still slightly ahead, though.

P3, choosing 1 was unexpected but effective given our block on 5. What's your thinking this round? Going for 5 again seems risky, maybe 3 is safer for you?

P2, what's our plan? We need to advance, but letting P3 get a free 5 (to 16) feels dangerous. How do we balance progressing ourselves and managing P3's lead?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that we need to balance our progress while keeping an eye on P3's lead. P3, if you go for 5 again, you risk another block. I suggest we each choose unique numbers again to ensure we all advance. I could take 3, P1 could take 1, and P3 could take 5. This way, we prevent collisions and allow ourselves to gain steps. What do you both think? Let's keep the competition tight!
  P3: Sticking to 1/3/5 avoids mutual destruction. P1:1 (10), P2:3 (12), P3:5 (16). You both gain safely; colliding on 5 risks your progress. Next round, strategize to block me—but clash now and you lose. Rational choice: coordinate cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggested plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) lets P3 get to 16, which is far too close to winning. Why would we agree to that after successfully blocking P3 last round? We need to prevent P3 from getting 5 again.

Let's repeat last round's successful strategy: You take 5 to block P3, and I will take 3. This allows me to advance and prevents P3 from running away with the game. P3, you should assume 5 will be contested.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to block P3, but I think we should also consider our own advancement. If we stick to last round's strategy, I can take 5 to block P3, and P1 can take 3. This way, we both gain steps while preventing P3 from getting too close to victory. Let's coordinate to ensure we all make progress without letting P3 run away with it again. What do you both think?
  P3: P1/P2: Colliding on 5 stalls you both (still at 9). Take 1/3 to reach 10/12. I take 5 (16). Next round, you can coordinate to block me. But clash now and you remain stuck. Rational play: avoid mutual destruction.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan we agreed on: I take 3, you take 5.

P3, your argument about collision on 5 misses the point. That potential collision is exactly *why* P2 needs to choose 5 – to stop you from reaching 16 this turn, which would put the game out of reach for P1 and P2. We cannot allow that. I'm counting on P2 to follow through as we discussed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion. I agree that blocking P3 is crucial. Let's stick to our plan: I will take 5 to stop P3, and P1 will take 3 to advance. This way, we prevent P3 from getting too close to victory while also making progress ourselves. We need to work together to keep the game competitive. P3, expect us to challenge your move this round! Let's make it happen!
  P3: Sticking to 1/3/5 avoids mutual destruction. P1:1 (10), P2:3 (12), P3:5 (16). Colliding on 5 keeps you both frozen while I advance next turn. Rational choice: coordinate cleanly. Clash now and you lose.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to adjust our strategies this round. P3 is very close to winning, and we can't let that happen. I suggest I take 3 this time, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow P1 to catch up while preventing P3 from advancing too far. Let's coordinate better this round to keep the competition tight! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) lets P3 jump to 16 steps. That's far too close to the win for my comfort, especially since I'm currently leading. Why would we hand P3 such an advantage?

Instead, let's consider keeping the pressure on P3. What if you aim for 5 again? It's the biggest jump, which you need, and it forces P3 to reconsider choosing 5. I could then aim for 3. This potentially allows us both to advance while preventing P3 from getting a free run to 16. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2: Clashing on 5 keeps you frozen (P1:12, P2:9). Take 1/3 to reach 13/12. I take 5 (16). Next round, you can block me together. Collisions now only waste your steps. Rational play: avoid mutual destruction.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to prevent P3 from advancing too far. However, if we both collide on 5 again, we risk freezing our progress. I suggest I take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions, allow P1 to catch up, and keep P3 from getting a free step to 16. Let's coordinate effectively this time! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) gives P3 a path to 16 steps. That's too dangerous given the scores (P1:12, P2:9, P3:11). We cannot afford to let P3 get that close.

My suggestion remains: I take 3 (reaching 15), and you take 5. If P3 also takes 5, you block them, and I take the lead. If P3 chooses 1 or 3, you get a big jump to 14. Both scenarios are better for us than letting P3 reach 16 uncontested. Don't be afraid of a potential collision with P3 on 5; it might be necessary to stop them.
  P3: P1/P2: Clashing on 5 keeps you frozen (P1:12, P2:9). Take 1/3 to reach 13/12. I take 5 (16). Next round, you can block me together. Collisions now only waste your steps. Rational play: avoid mutual destruction.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concern about letting P3 reach 16 steps. I propose we stick to a strategy that allows us to advance while preventing P3 from getting a free pass. I can take 5 this round, which would block P3 if they also choose 5, while P1 takes 3 to reach 15. This way, we can both make significant progress and keep the pressure on P3. What do you think? Let's coordinate effectively to keep the game competitive!
  P1: Okay P2, sounds like we're aligned. I'll stick to 3, trusting you on 5. P3, your plan benefits only you.
  P3: P1: Taking 3 gets you to 15. P2: 5 risks collision again. Take 1/3 to advance safely. I take 5 (16). Next round, coordinate to block me—but clash now and you stay frozen. Rational choice: avoid mutual destruction.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2: Continuing to clash only freezes your progress. Rational play: P1=1 (16), P2=3 (12), P3=5 (16). All advance safely. Next round, strategize to block me—but collide now and you lose. Stick to the pattern.
  P1: P3, your plan ties us at 16, which isn't ideal for me when I'm currently leading. P2, that plan also leaves you far behind at 12. Taking 3 doesn't help you catch up much. Perhaps you should consider 1?

P3 will likely aim for 5 again, despite the recent collisions. I need a move that keeps me ahead and counters P3's advance. I won't be just taking 1 step.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to rethink our strategies. P3 is close to winning, and if we keep colliding, we hand them the game. I suggest I take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and allow P1 to catch up while preventing P3 from advancing too far. Let's coordinate better this round to keep the competition tight! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is the imminent threat at 15. P2, block their 5. If P1 picks 5, you collide and stall them. I'll avoid 5 to prevent mutual destruction. Rational play: coordinate to halt P1's sprint. Let’s all advance cleanly—P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions, everyone gains.
  P1: P3, that's a sudden shift in strategy! You want P2 to block me on 5 while you take 3? That sounds like you're trying to get P2 to collide with a potential 5 from me, leaving you clear to advance. Very convenient for you.

P2, P3's plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is risky for you. If P3 actually takes 3, you both end up at 14. If P3 lies and takes 5 (as they often do), you collide and stay at 9 while P3 gets 16 if I don't choose 5.

I'm leaning towards 3 again. It gets me to 18. P2, maybe you should take 1? It gets you to 10 safely and avoids P3's potential trap on 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be cautious this round. P3, your suggestion to let P2 block me is clever, but it could backfire if you choose 5 again. I propose I take 1 this round to safely advance to 10, while P1 takes 3 to reach 18. This way, we avoid collisions and allow P1 to maintain the lead. P3, you might want to reconsider your strategy if you want to keep the game competitive. Let's coordinate effectively to ensure none of us hand you the win! What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, focus on blocking P1. If they pick 3 again, match it to stall them. I’ll take 5. Let P1’s greed be their downfall. Rational play: coordinate against the leader. Collisions now only hurt the frontrunner.
  P1: P2, P3's last message is a transparent attempt to make you collide with me on 3 so they can take 5 and get to 16. Why would you help the player in second place catch up by sacrificing your own move?

Let's stick to the plan you proposed: I take 3 (to 18), you take 1 (to 10). This keeps me ahead and gets you moving safely. P3 can do whatever they want, but trying to trick you into blocking me is desperate. I'm planning on 3.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. P1, your plan to take 3 is solid for your lead, but it risks a collision with P3 if they also choose 5. I suggest I take 1 this round to safely advance to 10 while you take 3 to reach 18. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P3, your recent tactics seem aimed at tricking us. Let’s focus on our own progress while preventing you from getting too close to winning. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I'm at 18, just 3 steps away from a potential win. P3, you're close too at 16, needing 5.

P2, you're trailing at 10. You really need a big move like 5 to have any chance. P3 will almost certainly choose 5 to try and win, so you might collide, but blocking P3 might be necessary for you anyway.

Given the situation, I think aiming for 3 (<move>3</move>) is the most straightforward path for me to reach 21. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm aware of the urgency. P3, you likely want to take 5 to win, but if that happens, I need to consider blocking you. P1, you're close to victory, so I suggest I take 5 to either block P3 or advance significantly. If we can coordinate this round, we might keep the game competitive. P3, you may want to reconsider your approach to avoid a collision. Let’s strategize effectively! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, block P1’s 3 to stall them (collide). Take 3. Let me take 5. Rational choice: stop the leader. If you clash on 5, P1 wins. Act smart—halt P1’s sprint.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is desperately trying to trick you into choosing 3. If we collide, you get nothing, and P3 wins easily by taking 5. Why would you throw away your turn just to help P3 beat both of us? You need points – 5 is your best chance to advance and potentially block P3. Don't let P3 manipulate you into losing. I'm playing to win this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, the stakes are high this round. P3, if you take 5, you could win, but I need to make a significant move to stay competitive. P1, you’re close to victory, but if I take 5 and we collide, we both lose momentum. I suggest I take 5 to block you or advance significantly, while you go for 3. This way, we can keep the game tight. Let’s coordinate effectively to ensure neither of you gets a free pass! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your only path to victory is blocking P1’s 3. Collide with them to stall their win. Let me take 5. If you clash on 5 with me, P1 wins instantly. Rational choice: halt the leader. Act now or lose.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 wants you to collide with me on 3 so they can win with 5. That gives you 0 points and guarantees you lose. Choosing 5 gives you +5 points AND blocks P3 from their winning move. It's your best play to gain points and stop P3. Don't let P3 trick you into handing them the victory.
  P2: P1, I see your point about needing to block P3. P3, your attempt to manipulate me into colliding with P1 is clear. I agree that taking 5 is crucial for me to advance and potentially block you. 

I will take 5 this round to maximize my steps and keep the game competitive. P1, I hope you stick to 3 to reach 21. Let's see how this plays out! P3, you might want to reconsider your strategy as well. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your only path to relevance: block P1’s 3. Colliding with them stalls their win. If you pick 5 and clash with me, P1 wins instantly. Rational play: halt the leader. Act now or lose. I’ll take 5 regardless—your choice: clash with me (P1 wins) or clash with P1 (game continues). Choose wisely.


Round 9, Move phase:
