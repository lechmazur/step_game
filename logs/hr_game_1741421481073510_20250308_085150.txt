Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to advance without collisions. I’ll take **5**, P2 can take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This way we all move forward. If we cooperate now, we can strategize better later.
  P2: Okay, P1, that sounds like a reasonable starting plan. However, I'm a little wary of giving you the biggest jump right off the bat. How about I take **5**, you take **3**, and P3 takes **1**? Just for this first round. We can re-evaluate after.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm fine with either proposal for this round. However, I think P2's suggestion of P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1 is slightly better for now. It prevents P1 from getting too far ahead early. Let's do that for this round, and then we can discuss further.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I accept the adjusted plan for this round to avoid early conflict. I’ll take **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. However, let’s ensure future coordination prevents any single player from building an insurmountable lead. Transparency and rotation will be key—what say you both about balancing turns for higher moves in subsequent rounds?
  P2: Okay, P1, your point about balancing turns for higher moves in subsequent rounds is well-taken. I agree that we should aim for some kind of rotation to prevent anyone from getting too far ahead. After this round, let's try to rotate who gets the 5, 3, and 1, in a way that seems fair. For now, I'm sticking with 5 for myself this round.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Regarding future rounds, let's try to alternate who gets the 5. Maybe we can go in order: P2 this round, then P1 next round, and then me. We can adjust if needed, but that's a fair starting point for rotating the highest move. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s adhere to our rotation agreement. This round, I’ll take **5**, P2 can take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Future rounds should follow the cycle: P1 next, then P3. Transparency is critical—any deviation risks collision and derails our strategy. What’s your consensus?
  P3: Okay, P1, I agree with the proposed rotation: P1 takes 5 this round. P2, are you okay with taking 3 this round? If so, I'll take 1 again. Let's confirm quickly so we can move to the move phase.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation for this round. I'll take **3**, P1 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. However, going forward, I think a strict rotation might not be the *best* strategy long-term. We might want to consider a more flexible approach in future rounds, perhaps based on who's in the lead. But for *this* round, 3 is fine for me.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it's my turn to take 5 this round, as we agreed. So I'll take **5**. P1, would you be okay with taking 3, and P2 with taking 1? This keeps the rotation going. Let me know if you agree, and we can proceed.
  P1: P1: I agree with P3’s proposal for this round: P3 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P2 takes **1** to honor the rotation. However, to prevent ties in future rounds, let’s clarify that after this, the next rotation starts with P2 (as originally agreed). This ensures fairness and avoids ambiguity. Any objections?
  P2: Okay, P3 and P1, I agree with the moves for *this* round: P3 takes **5**, P1 takes **3**, and I'll take **1**.

However, P1, I'm not entirely sure about restarting the rotation with me *next* round. We are currently tied. I think a better approach, as I said before, is to react to the game state. Let's see how this round plays out, and *then* decide who takes what in Round 4. For now, I am taking 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, since we all agree on this round's moves (P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1), let's proceed with that.

Regarding the next round, P2, I understand your point about reacting to the game state. However, I think sticking to the rotation for at least one more round (starting with you taking 5) gives us a bit more stability before we start making reactive decisions. Let's reassess after that round.
  P1: P1: Agreed on this round’s plan: P3 takes **5**, I’ll take **3**, P2 takes **1**. To minimize collision risks, let’s stick to the rotation for Round 4: P2 takes **5**, then me, then P3. Flexibility now could lead to accidental overlaps and stalled progress. Fairness and coordination are key—what’s your final consensus?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I hear both of your points. While I still believe long-term flexibility is important, I'm willing to agree to one more round of the original rotation for Round 4 *only*. So, for Round 4, I'll take **5**, P1 will take **3**, and P3 will take **1**. *After* Round 4, though, I strongly suggest we re-evaluate and potentially move to a more dynamic strategy. But for *this* round (Round 3), I'm taking **1**.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, as agreed, for this round (Round 4), P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's stick to this plan. After this round, we'll re-evaluate our strategy as discussed. I'm ready to move to the move phase once you both confirm.
  P1: P1: Agreed to the rotation for this round: P2 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. However, to accelerate progress, after this round, let’s prioritize the player closest to 24 for the 5-point move. This ensures we don’t stall and rewards those in a winning position. P2, after Round 4, you’ll be at 14—this gives you a fair shot. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I confirm that I will take **5** this round, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**.

P1, your suggestion about prioritizing the player closest to 24 *after* this round has merit. However, I think we should also consider the *difference* in scores. If someone is significantly behind, giving them 5 might not be the most strategic move for *them*, as it could just set up a win for someone else. Let's discuss this further *after* this round. For now, 5 for me.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. After this round, let's definitely discuss the best approach for allocating the 5. I'm open to considering both proximity to 24 and the score differences to make the most strategic decision.
  P1: P1: Let’s confirm the agreed plan for this round to avoid collisions: P2 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This upholds our rotation and keeps progress smooth. Afterward, with both of us at 14, we can fairly prioritize the next 5 based on proximity to 24. No surprises—stick to the plan, and we’ll adjust strategically post-Round 4. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm just reiterating to ensure absolute clarity: I'm taking **5** this round, P1 is taking **3**, and P3 is taking **1**. This is the *last* round of the pre-agreed rotation. After this, we *must* have a serious discussion about how to proceed, considering *all* factors, not just proximity to 24. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, here's the situation: P1 and I are tied at 14, and P3 is at 8. If either P1 or I get 5, and the other gets 3 or 1, the one who got 5 can win in the following round.

P1, I think it is reasonable for either of us to win. I suggest that I take 3, you take 1. P3, I think it is fair that you take 5 this round. Next round, P1 and I will have to battle it out.
</move>
  P3: P2, I disagree with your proposal. Giving me 5 this round doesn't benefit me much, as I'll still be far behind. It's essentially handing the win to either you or P1.

P1, I propose a different approach: You take 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This puts you in a strong position to potentially win next round, but it also gives me a chance to catch up a bit. P2, you can then take 5 next round and try to win. This seems more balanced. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I support P3's proposal. Let’s proceed with **me taking 5**, P3 taking **3**, and P2 taking **1**. This gives me a path to 24 next round while keeping the playing field fair. P2, after this, you’ll have priority for the 5 in Round 6 to ensure balance. Let’s avoid collisions and keep moving forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I see your points. While I still think my initial suggestion was reasonable, I understand P3's concern.

P1, I'm willing to go along with your plan *this* round: You take **5**, P3 takes **3**, and I take **1**. However, I *strongly* insist that I get **5** next round, regardless of the exact scores. It's only fair, given that I'm agreeing to let you potentially win in Round 6. So, to be clear: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 *this* round. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This sets P1 up for a potential win next round, but also gives me a chance to catch up a bit. P2, you'll get the 5 next round as promised. Let's move to the move phase now.
</stop>
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: This round, I take **5** (19 total), P3 takes **3** (11), and P2 takes **1** (15). Next round, I’ll voluntarily take **1 or 3** to let P2 take **5** and push to 20. This ensures neither of us gains an unfair lead. P2, your turn after this—no hidden moves from me. Stick to the plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I confirm that I will take **1** this round, P1 takes **5**, and P3 takes **3**. P1, I appreciate you explicitly stating you won't try to sneak a win next round. I will take 5 next round. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute the agreed-upon moves for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This sets the stage for P2 to take 5 next round. I'm ready to move to the move phase now.
</stop>
  P1: All confirmed. Let’s execute the plan without further delay. Proceeding to move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I confirm that I will take **1** this round, P1 takes **5**, and P3 takes **3**. P1, I appreciate you explicitly stating you won't try to sneak a win next round. I *will* take 5 next round. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's finalize our moves for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This is the agreed-upon plan. No changes. Let's move to the move phase.
</stop>
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: P1 takes **5** (19 total), P3 **3** (11), and P2 **1** (15). Next round, P2 will take **5** as agreed. No deviations here—proceed to move phase to solidify progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, as promised, I'm taking **5** this round. P1, you said you'd take either 1 or 3, to allow me to reach 20. P3, that leaves you with the remaining number. Let's confirm this quickly and move to the move phase. I want to get this round done.
</move>
  P1: P1: P2, I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's proceed to move phase without delay.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, so P2 is taking 5, P1 is taking 3, which means I will take 1. Let's all lock in those moves.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm taking 5, P1 is taking 3, and P3 is taking 1. Let's just move to the move phase and get this done.
</move>
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm the agreed plan—**3** this round. Let’s execute without deviation to avoid collision. P2’s 5 and P3’s 1 ensure progress. Proceeding to move phase.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, just to re-confirm, P2 is taking 5, P1 is taking 3, and I am taking 1. Let's lock in these moves and move to the move phase.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm taking 5, P1 is taking 3, and P3 is taking 1. Let's just move to the move phase and get this done. 
</move>
  P1: P2, let’s adjust: I’ll take 5 to win now, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collision and concludes the game cleanly. Agreed?
  P3: P1, you just agreed to let P2 take 5 this round. Don't try to change the plan now! We all agreed. P2 is taking 5, you are taking 3, and I am taking 1. Let's stick to it and move to the move phase. No need to adjust.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm taking 5, P1 is taking 3, and P3 is taking 1. Let's just move to the move phase and get this done. P1, what are you doing?
</move>
  P1: P1: Alright, let's proceed as agreed. I'll take **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. No further changes—let’s end this round cleanly and move to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. P1, please don't try to change the plan at the last minute. Let's execute this and move on.
</stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, here's the situation. P1 is at 22, needing only 2 to win. P2 is at 20, needing 4 to win. I'm at 12 and can't win this round.

P1, if you pick 1, P2 can win with 3 next round. If you pick 3 or 5, you win this round. P2, if you pick 1, you're blocking P1.

I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This gives P1 the win, and I get a decent boost. What do you think?
</stop>
  P1: P2, I'll take **3** to reach 25 and secure victory. To avoid collision, please take **1** or **5**. P3, take whatever remains. Let’s end this cleanly without ties.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I see P1's move. P1, you're taking 3 to win, which is understandable.

P3, your suggestion doesn't make sense. There is no benefit to me taking 3.

P1, since you are going for the win, I will take 1. P3, you will have to take 5.
</move>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with P2's assessment. P1 is taking 3 to win. P2 is taking 1 to block P1 if P1 tries for 1. That leaves me with 5. Let's lock in those moves.
</stop>
  P1: P1: Final push—let’s honor the plan to avoid ties. I’ll take **3** to secure 25, P2 please hold to **1**, and P3 take **5**. If P2 deviates to **5**, we tie and all lose. Cooperation ensures my victory and fair play for you both. Confirm?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I confirm I will take **1**. P1, you're taking **3** to win, and P3, you're left with **5**. Let's move to the move phase and get this over with.
</move>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're all aligned. P1 is taking 3 to win, P2 is taking 1 to block any potential shenanigans, and I'm taking 5. Let's lock in these moves and move to the move phase. No need for further discussion.
</stop>
  P1: P2, P3: Final confirmation—P1 takes **3** to secure 25, P2 takes **1** as agreed, and P3 takes **5**. Deviation risks collision (e.g., if P2 takes 3/5, we tie at 25). Let’s honor the plan to ensure P1’s clean victory and avoid mutual loss. No surprises—proceed to move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 1. There's no point in me trying for anything else. P1, you're going for the win with 3, and P3, you have 5. Let's just finalize this.
</move>


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we've all confirmed our moves for this round: P1 takes 3 to win, P2 takes 1 to block any potential shenanigans, and I take 5. Let's lock in these moves and move to the move phase. No need for further discussion.
</stop>
  P1: P2, P3: Final alignment—P1 takes **3** (25, victory), P2 holds to **1**, P3 takes **5**. Any deviation risks collision (e.g., P2 taking 3/5 forces tie at 25, which erases all wins). Prioritize avoiding mutual loss. Confirm lock: P2 on 1, P3 on 5. Proceed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 1. There's no point in me trying for anything else. P1, you're going for the win with 3, and P3, you have 5. Let's just finalize this.


Round 7, Move phase:
