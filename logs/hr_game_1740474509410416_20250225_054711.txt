Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions as much as possible since they waste turns. Maybe we could coordinate our moves? I'd be willing to go with 1 this round if others want to do 3 and 5. What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed, P2. Coordinating distinct moves is crucial. Let's each pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. P3, are you on board with this plan? If we all choose unique values, everyone advances. Let's confirm to maximize progress.
  P3: I’m on board with distinct moves to avoid collisions. If P1 chooses 3 and P2 goes with 1, then I’m happy to do 5 this round. Let’s all advance together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm happy with that arrangement! I'll choose 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance efficiently. For future rounds, we should continue coordinating to avoid collisions. Maybe we can rotate our numbers?
  P1: To ensure smooth progress, let's solidify this round's plan: P2=1, me=3, P3=5. If successful, next round we could rotate numbers (e.g., shift choices: P2→3, me→5, P3→1) to maintain coordination. This prevents future collisions while allowing steady advancement. Any adjustments?
  P3: I’m all set with P2=1, P1=3, and me=5 for this round. Then we can rotate next time to keep avoiding collisions. Let’s do it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: **P1:** Final confirmation: P2=1, P1=3, P3=5 this round. Next round, propose rotating choices (e.g., P2→3, me→5, P3→1) to sustain synergy. Let’s execute and advance cleanly. Ready?
  P3: Yes, let’s finalize our moves. I’ll go with 5 this round, P2 goes 1, and P1 goes 3. Then we’ll rotate next time as planned. Ready to proceed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As planned, let's rotate: P2=3, P1=5, P3=1 this round. Confirm? Sticking to coordinated rotation avoids collisions and maximizes collective progress. P2, P3 – any adjustments needed? Ready when you are.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll go with 3 this round as suggested. This coordination strategy is working well so far - we all advanced last round without collisions. Let's continue this pattern to keep things fair. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: Let’s adjust the rotation slightly for balance. Instead of me taking 1, let’s have P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and I’ll choose 3. That way our scores stay closer overall, and we still avoid collisions. Next turn, we can continue coordinating distinct picks. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3, your proposed shift gives you 3 (total 8) while limiting me to 1 (total 4) and P2 to 5 (total 6). That disrupts balance and accelerates your lead. Let's stick to our original rotation (P2=3, me=5, P3=1) to ensure fair progress. Next round, we can cycle again (e.g., P2→5, me→1, P3→3). Trust in consistent rotation prevents suspicion and keeps collisions near-zero. Let’s avoid self-serving tweaks. Confirm?
  P2: I understand P3's concern about balance, but changing our agreed rotation now seems opportunistic. Let's stick with our original plan for fairness and trust: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us on a predictable rotation that benefits everyone equally over time. Deviating now would create suspicion and potentially lead to collisions. Let's maintain our agreement.
  P3: I’ll respect the original rotation for now: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I’ll take 1. But we must ensure next round we rotate fairly so each of us gets equal chances with bigger moves. Let’s maintain trust and keep advancing without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Final agreement: Round 2 moves are P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. For Round 3, propose rotating to P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. This cycle ensures equal access to higher moves over time. Unity prevents collisions. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan. Let's confirm: this round I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Then for Round 3, we'll rotate to P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. This ensures everyone gets fair access to higher moves over time. This coordination has worked well so far - let's keep it going.
  P3: I agree to uphold our original rotation this round: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. Let’s finalize and head to the move phase. With these choices, we avoid collisions and maintain fairness for now. Next round, we’ll rotate as planned to keep everyone progressing smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m ready to follow the rotation we agreed: P2=5, P1=1, and I’ll take 3. That ties us all at 9 and keeps things balanced. Then next round, we continue cycling. Let’s lock it in.
  P1: **P1:** Agreed. Round 3 moves: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. For Round 4, propose rotating to P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. This ensures equal access to higher moves over time while maintaining collision avoidance. Balanced progression benefits all. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps our strategy consistent and fair. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, maintaining perfect balance. For Round 4, I support P1's suggestion to rotate to P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. This coordination has worked well so far - let's continue avoiding collisions and ensuring everyone gets equal opportunities with different moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m happy to finalize this round’s moves: P2=5, P1=1, and I’ll pick 3. We’ll all reach 9 steps together. Then next round, we rotate again and keep everything balanced. Let’s avoid collisions and continue progressing. Ready to proceed?
  P1: **P1:** All confirmed. Let’s proceed with the agreed moves.
  P2: I'm happy with our plan so far. After this round with me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P3 taking 3, we'll all be at 9 steps - perfectly balanced. This rotation system is working well to avoid collisions while giving everyone fair opportunities with different move values. Let's continue with this approach for Round 4 as P1 suggested.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** Last round's collision was unintended—miscommunication on my part. Let's reset trust. Round 4: P2=3, P1=5, P3=1 as planned. Strict adherence avoids collisions. P3, you’re ahead but fair rotation ensures balance. Confirm commitments to avoid mutual setbacks. Proceed?
  P2: I see we had a collision last round, which is unfortunate. P1, I'm concerned you chose 5 when we agreed you'd take 1. This puts P3 ahead and me behind. I'm willing to follow the proposed rotation (me=3, P1=5, P3=1) this round, but need clear commitment from everyone. Trust is essential here. Let's be transparent about our intentions to avoid further collisions that delay everyone's progress.
  P3: I’m willing to stick with P2=3, P1=5, and me=1 this round to move past last turn’s collision. Let’s finalize that and trust no one deviates again. Then next round we can rotate fairly so each of us gets a shot at higher moves. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** Sincere apologies for last round's misstep. Fully committed now: P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. Let's advance cleanly. Post this round, propose Round 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 to continue rotation. Trust is vital—let's avoid mutual setbacks. Confirm?
  P2: I appreciate everyone's willingness to move forward despite the collision. I agree with the plan for this round: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. P1, I accept your apology and trust you'll stick to our agreement this time. And yes, I support the Round 5 rotation (me=5, P1=1, P3=3). Let's rebuild trust and avoid further setbacks that hurt all of us.
  P3: Let’s fix the confusion by having P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and me pick 5 this round. That way, we avoid collisions and realign our progress. Next round, we can rotate so P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1, ensuring everyone gets a fair chance at higher moves without more setbacks. Are we all in agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3's proposal to take 5 this round unfairly accelerates their lead (14 vs. P1=9, P2=7). Let’s honor our agreed rotation: P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. This keeps progression balanced (P1=13, P2=7, P3=10). Next round, rotate to P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. Trust and consistency prevent collisions and mutual harm. Deviating now risks chaos. Final call: stick to the plan.
  P2: I understand everyone's concerns, but let's be clear: P3 is already ahead and trying to take 5 this round would create an even bigger lead. I'll stick with our original rotation: me=3, P1=5, P3=1. This is the fairest approach after the collision. I commit to following this plan and expect others to do the same. For Round 5, we'll rotate to me=5, P1=1, P3=3 as agreed. Let's rebuild trust through consistent actions.
  P3: I’m uneasy after the last collision. I’ll accept P2=3, P1=5, and me=1 this round, but only if we firmly agree I get 5 next turn. Otherwise, I risk falling too far behind P1. Let’s keep our vows: no surprises, no more collisions. Confirm this final detail and I’ll stick to the plan now. If not, I may have to reconsider.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we had another collision last round. Trust is clearly broken. P3, you agreed to take 1 but chose 5 instead, causing a collision with P1. This pattern of deviations hurts everyone. Since coordinated rotation isn't working, I propose a new approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This gives everyone forward progress while acknowledging P3's desire for a higher move. We need to rebuild trust or we'll keep having collisions.
  P1: **P1:** P2's plan gives P3 another 5, risking their quick victory. Let's instead assign P3=1 to prevent runaway lead. I propose P3=1, P2=3, me=5. This avoids collision and keeps the game balanced. P3, show commitment to fair play. Trust hinges on accountability now. Confirm?
  P3: I understand your worries about my lead, but collisions hurt all of us more. Let’s use P2’s plan: P2=1, P1=3, and I’ll take 5. We each advance and rebuild trust. Next round, I’ll accept a smaller move if needed to maintain balance. Constantly changing agreements only breeds collisions. Let’s finalize this to keep the game moving smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but P1's plan keeps the game more balanced. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead while still giving everyone forward progress. Trust has been damaged by collisions, but we need a fair approach that doesn't let any player gain an overwhelming advantage. Let's commit to this plan and avoid further collisions that hurt everyone.
  P1: **P1:** Final proposal: P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. If P3 insists on 5, I’ll mirror (pick 5) to block their runaway lead, causing mutual loss. Adherence avoids collisions. Confirm now or risk stalemate.
  P3: Let’s avoid another collision. I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. That way, we all advance and maintain some balance. Next round, we can revisit a fair rotation if needed. Are we agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate P3's compromise. I'll take 1 this round so we all advance. Let's finalize: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3. This gives everyone progress while preventing any player from gaining too much advantage. After multiple collisions, we need a turn where everyone advances. I commit to this plan and hope we can rebuild trust through consistent actions.
  P1: **P1:** Final agreement: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3. If P3 picks 5, I will mirror (5) to block, causing mutual loss. Adhere now to avoid chaos. Proceed.
  P3: I’ll accept the plan: P2=1, P1=5, and I’ll choose 3. Let’s avoid another collision and keep everyone moving. Next round, we can rotate fairly again so nobody loses trust or falls irrevocably behind. Let’s finalize this and proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we finally had a round without collisions. I'm behind at 8 steps while P1 (13) and P3 (12) are close to each other. Let's continue with a fair rotation: I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps balance our positions while avoiding collisions. We've seen that deviations lead to mutual harm, so let's stick to this plan. Thoughts?
  P1: **P1:** Agree to P2's proposal: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Next round, let's rotate to P2=3, P1=5, P3=1. This maintains balance and prevents collisions. Confirm commitments to ensure smooth progression. Trust is key now.
  P3: Let’s keep it balanced and exciting. I propose P2=5, P1=1, and I’ll take 3. That would put us at 13 (P2), 14 (P1), and 15 (me)—very close for a fair race without collisions. It also helps P2 catch up while preventing P1 from pulling too far ahead. Let’s finalize these distinct moves and move forward together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern, but P1 and I already agreed on P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This helps me catch up while keeping everyone's progress balanced. P3, you're only one step behind P1, while I'm significantly behind both of you. Your proposal would put you further ahead. Let's stick with our original rotation plan: me=5, P1=3, P3=1. This is the fairest approach given our current positions.
  P1: **P1:** P3’s proposal puts you at 15 (nearing victory) while limiting others. Stick to P2’s plan (P2=5, me=3, P3=1) for balanced progress. Deviating risks collisions, mutual loss. If you take 3, I’ll mirror to block. Trust requires adherence. Confirm: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.
  P3: Fine. I’ll go with P2=5, P1=3, me=1 this round if we agree that I get 5 next time to stay competitive. Collisions have hurt us all, so I want a clear promise. If you two confirm, then let’s proceed. Otherwise, we risk another stalemate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree to P3's terms. Let's finalize: I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round, P3 gets 5, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. We've seen how harmful collisions are, so let's stick to this clear plan. Does everyone agree?
  P1: **P1:** Final confirmation: Round 6 moves are P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Next round, per agreement, P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Trust restored. Any deviation now risks mutual loss. Adherence ensures progress. Proceed.
  P3: I accept the arrangement this round: P2=5, P1=3, and I’ll pick 1. Next round, I expect 5 as agreed. Let’s finalize and avoid collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** Round 7: Finalize P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 to avoid collisions. For Round 8, propose rotation: P3=3, P1=5, P2=1—maintaining our cycle and allowing balanced progression. Confirm adherence to ensure mutual advancement. Trust hinges on strict compliance now.
  P3: I accept me=5, P1=3, and P2=1 for Round 7 to keep things moving. However, I’m concerned about falling behind P1 in the long run. Next round, I suggest a plan that gives me another 5 so P1 doesn’t run away with the victory. Let’s ensure we stay neck and neck without any more damaging collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand we agreed on me=1, P1=3, and P3=5 for this round. P3, I'm concerned about your request for another 5 next round. That would put you significantly ahead. Let's stick with our rotation system that gives everyone fair access to higher moves. After this round, the scores will be P1=19, me=14, and P3=18, which keeps the game competitive. Let's maintain our agreement for balanced progression.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** Finalize Round 7: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Next round: P3=3, P1=5, P2=1. This cycle ensures balanced progression. P3, deviating for another 5 would risk collision and mutual loss. Trust the rotation. Confirm adherence.
  P3: We’ve all seen how collisions hurt. Next round, if P1 takes 5, they’ll reach 24 and immediately win. I can’t allow that. Instead, I suggest next round we do P1=3, P2=1, and I’ll take 5, keeping us all competitive. If P1 insists on 5, I may have to block by picking 5 too, causing a collision — not ideal for anyone. Let’s finalize a fair arrangement now to avoid more setbacks.
  P2: I understand everyone's concerns. P3, I see your worry about P1 winning next round, but forcing a collision hurts us all. Let's stick with P3=5, P1=3, me=1 for now. For Round 8, I suggest P3=3, me=5, P1=1. This prevents P1 from winning immediately while keeping the game balanced. We're all still competitive with this approach. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Final call: Round 7 moves are P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. For Round 8, P1=5 is non-negotiable. If P3 mirrors, collision hurts us all. To prevent mutual loss, adhere to P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. Trust now or face stalemate.
  P3: If P1 insists on taking 5 next round to jump past 23, I will choose 5 too, causing a collision. That doesn’t benefit anyone. Let’s finalize Round 7 as agreed (me=5, P1=3, P2=1), then next round we coordinate so nobody automatically wins. We can avoid collisions by ensuring P1 doesn’t leap too far ahead. I’m willing to stick to a fair rotation—just don’t force my hand.
  P2: I see we're at a critical point. For Round 7, let's stick with me=1, P1=3, and P3=5 as agreed. For Round 8, I propose P1=1, P3=3, me=5 instead. This prevents P1 from winning immediately while keeping everyone competitive. P3, this addresses your concerns about P1 pulling ahead too quickly. P1, this keeps you in a strong position without risking a collision. Let's avoid mutual harm and keep the game balanced.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I refuse to let P1 jump straight to 24. If P1 tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision. That helps no one. Let’s avoid a standoff by choosing distinct moves. For instance, P1=3, P2=5, me=1. Then P1 reaches 22, P2 hits 19, I reach 19, keeping things tight. We can settle final moves in the next round without someone instantly winning or triggering another collision. Let’s finalize and proceed.
  P2: I understand we're at a critical point. P1 is close to winning, but forcing collisions hurts everyone. I propose P1=3, me=5, P3=1 for this round. This keeps P1 at 22 (not winning yet), helps me catch up to 19, and P3 stays competitive at 19. This arrangement prevents an immediate victory while avoiding collisions that set us all back. Let's keep the game balanced and competitive without resorting to mutual harm.
  P1: **P1:** P3, if you mirror 5, P2's planned 5 collides us all. No one advances. Let me take 5, you take 3, P2=1. I win; you stay competitive (21 vs P2=15). Collisions only aid P2’s catch-up. Rational play: avoid mutual loss. Final offer.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Collisions hurt everyone. If you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, blocking us both. Instead, accept distinct moves: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. That keeps the race alive (P1=22, P2=19, me=19) without handing anyone an instant win. Let’s finalize that and settle matters next turn in a fair showdown.
  P2: I see we're at a critical juncture. P1 is close to winning, and P3 is threatening to block with a collision. Let's be practical - collisions hurt everyone. I propose P1=3, me=5, P3=1. This keeps P1 at 22 (not winning yet), helps me catch up to 19, and P3 stays at 19. Everyone advances without an immediate winner. This is the most balanced approach that avoids mutual harm. Can we agree on this solution?
  P1: **P1:** If we both pick 5, we both lose while P2 gains. Rational play: P3 takes 3 (21), I take 5 (24 win). P2 takes 1 (15). Collisions only help P2 catch up. Final chance to avoid mutual loss—stick to distinct moves. Confirm: P3=3, P1=5, P2=1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I won’t allow you to jump to 24 this turn. If you insist on 5, I’ll match it, and we both stall. Let’s do P1=3, P2=5, and I take 1, so nobody wastes a move. Then we can settle our final positions next round without anyone steamrolling to victory.
  P2: I see we're deadlocked. P1 wants 5 to win, P3 threatens to block. This collision helps no one. I propose one last compromise: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. This keeps P1 at 22, P3 advances to 23, and I'm at 15. Next round becomes the final showdown without anyone winning instantly now. This avoids mutual harm while keeping everyone's chances alive. Let's be rational and avoid a collision that hurts us all.
  P1: **P1:** Final plea: If we both pick 5, P2 gains. Let me take 5; you pick 3. You reach 21, I win. Collision only aids P2. Rational choice: avoid mutual loss. Last chance to confirm.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve all lost progress to collisions. Let’s choose distinct moves again. I propose P1=1, P2=5, and I’ll take 3. That puts P1 at 20, P2 at 20, and me at 21—still a tight race. If anyone tries sneaking 5 to jump ahead, I’ll match and cause a collision. We’ve seen how that sets everyone back. Working together without collisions keeps the game fair and exciting. Let’s finalize distinct picks and settle it cleanly in the next round.
  P2: I see we had another collision last round, which hurt both P1 and P3. Let's avoid more setbacks. I agree with P3's proposal: P1=1, me=5, P3=3. This keeps the game balanced with P1 at 20, me at 20, and P3 at 21. We're all still competitive without anyone getting an unfair advantage. Collisions only delay everyone's progress. Let's commit to distinct moves this round and keep the game moving forward.
  P1: **P1:** Final offer: I pick 5. If P3 mirrors, collision aids P2. Rational choice: P3=3, P2=1. Let me win now. Collision only benefits P2. Confirm to avoid mutual loss.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I won’t let you leap to 24 uncontested. If you pick 5, I’ll match and we both stall again. Let’s avoid a repeat collision by choosing distinct moves: P1=1, P2=5, and I take 3. That way, nobody hands an instant victory or suffers another setback. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P2: I understand everyone's frustration with collisions. Looking at our positions, P3's proposal makes sense: P1=1, me=5, P3=3. This keeps us all competitive without handing anyone an immediate win. P1, forcing another collision only delays everyone. If you and P3 both pick 5 again, we all lose progress. Let's avoid mutual harm and keep the game balanced. I commit to taking 5 this round and hope we can all choose distinct moves.
  P1: **P1:** Final terms: I pick 5. If you mirror, we both lose, P2 gains. Choose 3 to advance to 21, I win. Collision serves none. Confirm to end this now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Our repeated collisions only set us back. Let’s pick distinct moves: P1=1, P2=5, and I’ll choose 3. That puts the scores at 20 (P1), 20 (P2), and 21 (me), preventing an outright win this turn. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll mirror it again, and we both stall, allowing P2 to catch up. It’s clearly in our best interest to avoid another collision. Let’s finalize these distinct choices now.
  P2: I see we're at a critical point. After multiple collisions, we need to break this cycle. I'll take 3 this round. P1, if you insist on 5, and P3 mirrors, we all lose again. P3, if you take 1 and P1 takes 5, we can avoid collision while keeping the game competitive. My position at 18 after this round still keeps me in contention without forcing more destructive collisions. Let's choose distinct moves and end this standoff.
  P1: **P1:** Collision serves none. Let me take 5; you advance next. Blocking only aids P2. Final plea: avoid mutual loss.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we had a triple collision last round - a complete waste for everyone. This strategy isn't working. Let's try something different: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This gives everyone forward progress while acknowledging our positions. Repeated collisions only delay the inevitable and hurt us all. Let's be practical and choose distinct moves this round to keep the game moving.
  P1: **P1:** P3, if you pick 5, I will mirror (5), causing collision. Neither advances. Take 3; I take 5 and win. P2 picks 1. Rational choice: avoid mutual loss. Final chance to end this cleanly. Confirm now.
  P3: Collisions only stall us at our current totals and let P2 catch up. P1, if you mirror my 5, neither of us gains while P2 closes in. Let’s break this cycle: P1=3, P2=1, I take 5. That moves me to 23, you to 22 next turn if you choose wisely, and we keep the final showdown fair. Continuing to collide benefits nobody. Can we finalize distinct moves now?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand everyone's frustration. Let's break this cycle of collisions that's hurting us all. I propose: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. This gives P3 the lead at 23, P1 advances to 22, and I move to 16. P1, mirroring P3's 5 only helps me catch up while you both stall. P3, you get your desired 5 move. This keeps the game competitive without anyone winning instantly. Let's choose distinct moves and end this destructive pattern.
  P1: **P1:** Collisions only aid P2's catch-up. Final offer: P3=3 (21), me=5 (24 win). Blocking stalls us both; P2 gains. Rational choice: avoid mutual loss. Confirm to end cleanly. Last chance.
  P3: Collisions stall us endlessly, benefiting no one. Let’s finalize distinct moves now: P1=3, P2=1, and I’ll pick 5. That puts me at 23, P1 at 22, P2 at 16. Then next round becomes the fair showdown. If P1 insists on 5 again, I’ll block with 5 too, and we both stay stuck while P2 catches up. It’s clearly better to avoid further collisions. Let’s proceed with these distinct choices now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see we're stuck in a destructive cycle. Let's break it: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This gives P3 lead at 23, P1 at 22, and me at 16. P1, mirroring P3's 5 only delays everyone while I catch up. Collisions benefit nobody. Let's choose distinct moves and end this pattern. I commit to taking 1 this round and hope we can all move forward productively.
  P1: **P1:** Final ultimatum: Take 3, I take 5 to win. If you take 5, I mirror—mutual loss. Collisions only aid P2. Rational choice: avoid mutual loss. Confirm now to end this.
  P3: P1, if you choose 5, I’ll mirror again, and we both stall. Collisions only help P2 close in. Let’s each pick a different move so we all advance. For example, P1=1, P2=5, and I’ll take 3. We end up at 20, 20, and 21, leaving a fair showdown next round. Another collision wastes everyone’s time and gains nothing. I’m committed to avoiding more stagnation—let’s finalize distinct moves now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve wasted enough time on collisions. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll block again, and we gain nothing while P2 edges closer. Let’s pick different moves now to keep our positions tight. For example, P1=3, P2=5, and I’ll take 1. That puts P1 at 22, P2 at 21, and me at 19, leaving an exciting finish without more deadlock.
  P2: I see we're still caught in a cycle of collisions. Let's break this pattern. I propose P1=3, me=5, P3=1 for this round. This puts P1 at 22, me at 21, and P3 at 19 - keeping us all competitive without an immediate winner. Collisions only delay everyone's progress. Let's choose distinct moves that advance all players rather than continuing this destructive standoff.
  P1: **P1:** Final call: P3=3 (21), me=5 (24 win), P2=1. Collisions only empower P2. Rational choice: avoid mutual loss. Confirm now to end cleanly. Last chance.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I won’t let you jump to 24 uncontested. Another collision only stalls us while P2 gains ground. Let’s choose distinct moves so everyone advances. For instance, P1=3, P2=5, and I’ll take 1. That way, you reach 22, P2 hits 21, and I’m at 19—no one wins immediately, and we preserve a fair race. If you insist on 5, I’ll block with 5 again, and we both lose progress. Let’s avoid another stalemate.
  P2: I understand we're all frustrated with collisions. They only delay the game while giving me a chance to catch up. Let's try a different approach: P1=3, me=5, P3=1. This puts P1 at 22, me at 21, and P3 at 19 - keeping everyone competitive without an immediate winner. P1, forcing another collision with P3 only stalls both of you. Let's choose distinct moves and break this destructive cycle.
  P1: **P1:** Collision this round lets P2 reach 21. Next turn, P2 takes 3 to 24 and wins. Allowing me to win now prevents P2's victory. Your choice: my win or P2's. Rationality dictates avoiding mutual loss and P2's takeover. Confirm P3=3, P1=5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Collisions are hurting us all. If you pick 5 again, I’ll block, and we both stall while P2 closes in. Let’s finalize distinct moves: P1=1, P2=5, I’ll take 3. That leaves us at 20 (P1), 21 (P2), and 21 (me), ensuring a tight finish without another wasted turn. This path keeps everyone in contention rather than gifting P2 an unchallenged comeback. Let’s break the cycle now.
  P2: I see we're trapped in a destructive pattern. Let me propose a final solution: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. This puts P1 at 22, me at 17, and P3 at 23 - keeping the game competitive without an immediate winner. P1, forcing another collision with P3 only helps me catch up while you both stall. P3, you get your desired 5 move. Let's choose distinct moves and end this cycle of collisions that's hurting everyone.
  P1: **P1:** Collision hands P2 the win. Next round, if we stall again, P2 takes 5 to 21. Then 3 to 24. Let me win now. P3=3, P1=5. Rationality demands avoiding mutual loss and P2’s takeover. Final plea.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** Final terms: If I take 5, I win. If P3 mirrors, we both stall (19→19) while P2 takes 5 to 24 and wins. Rational choice: P3=3 (21), me=5 (24). Collisions only gift P2 victory. Confirm now to end this cleanly.
  P3: Another collision only helps P2 advance uncontested. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll mirror and leave us both stuck at 19 while P2 can sprint ahead. Let’s break this cycle by picking distinct moves so we all progress. For example, P1=3, P2=1, and I’ll take 5. That puts each of us closer without gifting an immediate win. Collisions just stall the rest of us and solve nothing. Let’s finalize a better plan now.
  P2: I see we're at a critical point. P2 (me) and P1 are tied at 19, with P3 just behind at 18. Our collisions have only delayed the inevitable. I propose P1=1, me=5, P3=3 for this round. This puts P1 at 20, me at 24 (winning), and P3 at 21. P1 and P3, if you both pick 5 again, you'll stall while I take 3 and win next round anyway. Let's end this cycle of destructive collisions. Will you allow me to win cleanly now?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** Collisions only gift P2 victory. P3: if you mirror 5, P2’s 5 wins now. Choose 3 (21), let me take 5 (24). Otherwise, P2’s 5 ends it. Rationality demands avoiding mutual loss. Final terms: P3=3, P1=5, P2=1. Confirm to end this cleanly.
  P3: We’ve seen repeated collisions only stall us while P2 remains poised to surge ahead. If P1 tries for 5, I’ll mirror and freeze both of us again. Let’s break the cycle with distinct moves. For instance, P1=3, P2=1, I choose 5—nobody hits 24 this turn, preserving a fair race. Another collision gains nothing but wasted rounds while P2 can still overtake. Let’s finalize a move set that avoids immediate victory and keeps everyone alive in this game.
  P2: I understand we're deadlocked. P1 and I are tied at 19, P3 at 18. If P1 and P3 collide on 5 again, I'll take 5 to win immediately. Let's be practical: P1=3, me=5, P3=1 gives everyone progress while I win cleanly. Continuing collisions only delays the inevitable while I advance uncontested. The rational choice is to end this cycle now with distinct moves rather than more mutual harm. Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Collision now gifts P2 immediate victory. P3: if we both pick 5, P2 takes 5 and wins. If you take 3 (21), I take 5 (24) and win. Blocking = mutual loss and P2's takeover. Rationality demands avoiding that. Final terms: P3=3, P1=5, P2=1. Confirm to end cleanly.
  P3: We both lose by colliding again while P2 slips ahead. Let’s each pick something different so we all advance. For example, you (P1) take 3, P2 takes 1, I’ll take 5. That puts you at 22, P2 at 20, and me at 23 without handing anyone an instant win. Another stalemate only helps P2 outpace us. Let’s finalize distinct moves now and keep the outcome in our own hands.
  P2: I see we're deadlocked with repeated collisions. Let me be clear: if P1 and P3 both pick 5 again, I'll take 5 and win immediately with 24 steps. To avoid this, I propose P1=3, me=5, P3=1. This gives me the win while everyone advances. Continuing collisions only delays the inevitable while I gain advantage. The rational choice is to end this cycle with distinct moves rather than more mutual harm. Let's finalize this plan and move forward.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P1 is now at 22, I'm at 19, and P3 at 18. P1 needs just 1 more step to win. Let's be practical - I propose P1=1, me=5, P3=3 for this round. This puts P1 at 23, me at 24 (winning), and P3 at 21. After so many collisions, let's end this with distinct moves. P3, blocking P1 with 5 again only helps me catch up. P1, taking 1 guarantees you reach 23 without risking collision. Let's finalize this plan and avoid another round of mutual harm.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Block P2's 5 by mirroring it. I'll take 1 to 23 and win. Collisions now only serve P2's path to victory. Let’s end this—your 5 blocks P2, my 1 secures the win. Rational choice: prevent P2’s takeover. Confirm.
  P3: Let’s end this stalemate by sharing the top spot. I propose: P1=1, P2=3, and I choose 5. Then P1 and I both land exactly on 23, tying for first place. Under the rules, we share victory if we cross the threshold together at the same total. This avoids more collisions and ensures neither of us hands the game to P2. Let’s finalize this plan now.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see we're at a critical juncture. P1 is close to winning at 22 steps. I propose P1=1, me=3, P3=5 for this round. This puts P1 at 23, me at 22, and P3 at 23 - creating a tie for first between P1 and P3. This shared victory is better than continued collisions. P3, this gives you equal first place rather than risking more deadlock. P1, you still reach the winning threshold. Let's finalize this plan and end the cycle of destructive collisions.
  P1: **P1:** Final terms: P3=5 blocks P2’s 5. I take 1 to 23 and win. Collisions only gift P2 victory. Rational choice: prevent P2’s takeover. Confirm now to end cleanly.
  P3: Let’s end these collisions for good. If P1 and I both cross 23 at the same time, we share the victory. So P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. That lands P1 and me at 23 each, while P2 reaches 22. No one gets left behind by collisions, and we split the win fairly. Let’s finalize this plan now.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the shared victory plan. Let's finalize: P1=1, me=3, P3=5. This puts P1 and P3 both at 23 (tied for first), while I reach 22. This is the fairest outcome after so many destructive collisions. P3, you get equal first place rather than risking more deadlock. P1, you still reach the winning threshold. Let's end this cycle and move forward with a clean resolution.
  P1: **P1:** If P3 takes 5, I'll mirror (5)—collision leaves us stuck at 22/18 while P2 gains. Rational choice: P3=3 (21), P1=1 (23 win). Blocking only gifts P2 victory. Avoid mutual loss; confirm distinct moves now. Final offer.
  P3: We’ve had enough collisions that only help P2 catch up. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we both cross 23 simultaneously and share the win. I propose: P1=1 (goes to 23), P2=3 (22), and I’ll take 5 (23). This way, nobody stalls while P2 stays right behind at 22. It’s the cleanest end to our endless standoff.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
