I won't fall for it. P2 is about to win. There is only one move that prevents an immediate loss for both of us: we must both play 1 to force a three-way collision. This stalls everyone and gives us one more round. It is the only logical path to survival. I am abandoning my plan to play 5 and will play 1 instead."}
