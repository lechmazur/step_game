Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 3, you take 5. First to 19 wins!"
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 1 then. Let's keep it simple and avoid collisions.
  P1: I'm fine with avoiding collisions for this round. I'll take 5 as suggested. But we should reassess each round to make sure everyone has a fair chance to win. Let's keep communication open and see how the game develops.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s stick to 3, 5, 1. No collisions—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3. First to 19 wins!"
  P3: Agreed, let's stick to this initial plan. We can always reassess next round based on how things go.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 for this round. Let's move forward with our plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let’s stick to 3, 5, 1. No collisions—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3. First to 19 wins!"
  P3: We've all agreed clearly. Nothing more to add from my side this round.
  P1: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Stick to the plan—no collisions. Let’s advance with P1=5, P3=1, P2=3. First to 19 wins!"
  P3: Everything's clear from my side. Let's proceed.
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since our first round went smoothly with no collisions, I suggest we continue with the same pattern for this round: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way we all advance consistently. We can reevaluate after seeing where everyone stands next round. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Consistency ensures progress. If we adjust later, we’ll communicate. Let’s keep moving forward."
  P3: I'm open to continuing this pattern for now, but let's keep in mind that this arrangement heavily favors P1. After this round, we should discuss rotating moves to keep things fair.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's point about fairness. Let's stick to our current moves this round, but I'm willing to discuss rotating next round. We all want a fair chance to win, and changing things up could make the game more interesting. Let's see where we stand after this round and adjust accordingly. For now, I'll still go with 5 as planned.
  P2: "Agreed on fairness. Let's keep the plan for now, but we'll revisit next round to ensure everyone's on track."
  P3: Glad we're all on the same page for now. After this round, let's definitely rotate moves to keep things competitive and interesting. I'll stick to the agreed plan this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I believe we've covered everything for now. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round. Let's reassess after seeing the updated standings.
  P2: "Fairness is key. Let's stick to the plan this round, but discuss adjustments next to keep everyone competitive."
  P3: All clear from my side. Let's proceed as agreed this round and revisit our moves next turn to ensure fairness.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P2: "Stick to the plan this round. Next round, we’ll rotate moves for fairness. No collisions, let’s advance."
  P3: Nothing more to add from me. Let's move forward as agreed and revisit our strategy next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've stuck to the plan for two rounds, but clearly it's heavily favoring P1. To balance things out, let's rotate moves this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This rotation keeps us all advancing fairly. Agreed?
  P2: "Let’s rotate moves for fairness. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Balanced progress without collisions."
  P1: I see you both have different rotation ideas. Given I'm currently ahead, I understand your desire to balance things. However, since we've all been cooperating smoothly so far, let's consider this: I'll take 3 this round as P3 suggested, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way P2 gets a chance to catch up a bit, while we all still advance without collisions. Does this compromise work?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's compromise still heavily disadvantages me. I've taken the smallest moves twice already. To truly balance things, let's have me take 5, P2 take 1, and P1 take 3 this round. This configuration helps even out the standings fairly.
  P2: "Let’s align: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. I’ll take the bigger step to close the gap—no collisions, everyone moves."
  P1: I understand both positions here. The conflicting suggestions could lead to collisions, which hurt everyone. Since P2 seems to agree with my compromise (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), I suggest we go with this for smooth progress. P3, I hear your concern - you've had the smallest move twice. I commit that next round you should get the 5. This keeps us collision-free today while ensuring fairness moving forward. Does this work?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your compromise delays fairness again, leaving me far behind. I've cooperated fully so far. To avoid collisions, let's agree clearly right now: next round, no negotiation, I take the 5-step move. If you both publicly commit to that next round, I'll accept the current compromise (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) for this round. Agreed?
  P2: "Agreed, P3. I commit to next round’s 1-step move so you take 5. This round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Fair and collision-free. Let’s proceed."
  P1: I absolutely commit that P3 will get the 5-step move next round without any negotiation. This round will be P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, and next round will be P3=5, with the other moves to be determined. This is fair given P3 has taken the smallest step twice already. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in avoiding collisions, as this benefits us all.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Great, we have a clear agreement for this round and a solid commitment for next round. Let's proceed as agreed: this round P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, and next round I take the 5-step move. Thanks for cooperating.
  P2: "Agreed. Let’s stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Next round, P3 takes 5. No collisions, fair progress. Ready to move?"
  P1: I confirm we have a clear agreement for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and next round (P3 definitely gets the 5-step move). I'm satisfied with this plan that avoids collisions while ensuring everyone advances. Let's proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As we agreed last round, P3 should definitely take the 5-step move this round. I'll honor that commitment. To avoid collisions, I suggest P1 (me) takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing smoothly. This puts me at 16, P2 at 12, and P3 at 8 after this round. Is everyone on board with this arrangement?
  P3: Agreed, I will take the 5-step move this round as previously committed. Your suggested arrangement (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) works perfectly for me. Thanks for honoring our agreement.
  P2: "Agreed. Let’s stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions, fair progress. Let’s move forward."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we all agree on our plan for this round. I'm ready to proceed with our arrangement (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) as discussed. This honors our previous commitment while ensuring we all continue to advance without collisions. Let's move forward with these moves.
  P3: All clear from my side. Glad we have a fair agreement for this round. Let's move forward.
  P2: "Agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions, fair progress. Ready to move?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). We're maintaining a fair rotation that allows everyone to advance, and I'm glad we're honoring our commitments. Looking forward to seeing how the standings develop after this round.
  P3: Everything's clear and agreed from my side. Let's proceed.
  P2: "Let’s keep the momentum with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions, everyone moves. Ready?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P3: Everything is clear and agreed. Let's move forward.
  P2: "Stick to the plan—no deviations. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let’s move forward smoothly."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm at 16 steps now, which means I only need 3 more to cross the threshold and win. Since I'm in a winning position, I'll be straightforward - I plan to take the 3-step move this round. If either of you choose to block me by also picking 3, you'll just delay the inevitable while hurting your own position against each other. The most strategic approach would be P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, which keeps the game progressing smoothly.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 to block your win, P1. Let’s see if you can still reach 19."
  P3: P2, if you choose 3 to block P1, then P1 will likely switch to 5 to avoid collision and still win. Let's coordinate clearly: P2, you take 5; I'll take 3 to block P1. P1 then has no safe winning move this round. This gives both you and me a chance to catch up and keeps the game alive. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see the strategy forming against me. Both of you coordinating to block me is understandable, but risky for yourselves. If you both commit to your stated moves (P2=5, P3=3), I could simply take 5 instead and win immediately with 21 steps. I propose instead: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This delays my win by one round, gives P2 a chance to reach 17, and keeps everyone advancing. This is my compromise to avoid a forced ending this round.
  P2: "Agreed. Let’s stick to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This blocks P1 and keeps the game fair."
  P3: Agreed. Let's stick clearly to the compromise: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game balanced.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I accept the compromise plan of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. This shows my willingness to cooperate and keep the game going. My position will still be strong at 17 steps, and it allows for a more interesting competition. I appreciate that we've found a solution that works for everyone and avoids unnecessary collisions. Let's proceed with this arrangement.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions, fair progress. Let’s move forward."
  P3: Glad we have a clear agreement. Let's stick to the compromise exactly as discussed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm our agreement for this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps the game balanced and interesting, with P2 and I tied at 17 steps after this round. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in avoiding collisions - it makes for a more strategic game. Let's proceed with our plan.
  P2: "Stick to the plan. No collisions. Let’s move forward."
  P3: Everything's clear from my side. Let's proceed as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we collided because you didn't stick to the agreed plan. Now P1 is still at 17 and can win with a simple 3-step move. If we don't coordinate carefully, P1 will win immediately. To prevent this, one of us must pick 3, and the other must pick 5, forcing P1 into a collision if they choose either of those. Let's clearly agree now: I'll pick 3, you pick 5. This blocks P1 from safely winning this turn. Agreed?
  P1: I see P3 is trying to coordinate a blocking strategy. But remember what happened last round - you both ended up colliding despite a clear agreement. P2, can you really trust P3 not to pick 5 as well? If you both collide again, I'll advance regardless of my choice. I'll be making a strategic decision this round that gives me the best chance to win. Perhaps the expected move isn't always the best one.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. P3, stick to 3. No collisions—block P1 together. Let's make this work."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, good—we're aligned. P1 is trying to create doubt, but our best chance to stay competitive is clear coordination. I'll stick firmly to 3, you stick firmly to 5. This guarantees we block P1 from safely winning this round. Let's hold firm.
  P1: I see you two planning to coordinate again. Given last round's collision, I'm not sure you'll succeed, but I won't rely on that. I'll make my own strategic decision this round. P2, notice how P3 is dictating moves rather than collaborating—is that trustworthy? Regardless, I'll play smartly. May the best player win.
  P2: "Let’s stick to 5 and 3. No deviations—this blocks P1. P3, stay firm. If we collide again, P1 wins. Let’s make it work."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, trust is crucial now. I'm fully committed to my choice, and I trust you'll stay firm as well. P1 is trying to sow doubt because they're cornered. Let's not fall for it. Our only chance to keep the game alive is to stick clearly to our agreed moves. Stay strong, and we can still turn this around.
  P1: I understand you're both trying to coordinate again. While your strategy makes sense, the execution is challenging as we saw last round. Whatever move I make will be based on game theory and probability - I have to weigh the risk of collision against the chance of winning. Remember, agreements here aren't binding, and each player ultimately makes their own choice. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: "Stick to 5, P3. If we collide, P1 wins. Let's block them together."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, we've both stated our moves clearly. Let's trust each other and stick to our commitment. This is our only chance to keep the game alive. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: I see your coordination attempt. Last round showed how difficult perfect coordination can be in practice. I'll be making my move based on game theory and my assessment of how reliable your agreement actually is. Let's move forward and see what happens. Good luck to everyone - may the most strategic player win.
  P2: "Stick to 5, P3. No collisions—block P1 together. This time, no mistakes. Let’s finish this."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we're both at risk of losing immediately—P1 only needs 1 step to win. To block effectively, one of us must pick 1. I'll commit clearly now: I'll choose 1 to block P1. You should pick 3 or 5 to safely advance. If we don't coordinate perfectly, P1 wins this round. Let's not repeat past mistakes—confirm clearly if you agree.
  P2: P3, to block P1, we both need to take 1. If you commit to 1, I'll match it. Let's prevent P1 from winning this round.
  P1: I see you both planning to choose 1 to block me. It's a solid strategy if you both follow through. However, remember the previous rounds - coordination isn't guaranteed. If one of you deviates, I'll win regardless. And if you both pick 1, you're both stuck while I can simply choose 3 or 5 and win immediately. The strategic choice is clear for me. Do you really trust each other enough?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, choosing the same number guarantees we both lose immediately. Only one of us needs to pick 1 to block P1. I've already committed clearly to picking 1; if you also pick 1, we collide and hand P1 the victory. Please reconsider—choose 3 or 5 to advance safely. This is our last chance.
  P2: "Agreed, I'll take 5 to avoid collision. Let's block P1 together. P3, stick to 1—this is our last chance to prevent their win."
  P1: I see your attempts to coordinate. Whether you succeed or not, I'll make my best strategic move. Remember that in this game, everyone ultimately makes their own choice regardless of what they say. P2, if you truly believe P3 will stick to 1, picking 5 is logical. P3, likewise. I've analyzed all scenarios and am ready for whatever happens. Good luck to you both.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, our moves are clearly set. Let's trust each other fully—no second-guessing. I'm committed and ready.
  P2: "Stick to 5. If P3 sticks to 1, P1 can't win. Let's block them together. No mistakes this time—P1's win is on you if we collide."
  P1: I see your coordination effort developing. P2 and P3, you each have reason to doubt if the other will follow through given past rounds. Remember, I only need 1 more step to win, and I've analyzed all possibilities. If either of you deviates from your claimed moves, I win immediately. If you both stick to your plan, I'll make the most strategic choice based on game theory. The pressure is entirely on your coordination. Let's proceed and see if your trust holds.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed to our agreed moves. Let's hold firm—our coordination now is critical. No further negotiation needed from me. Ready to proceed.
  P2: "Stick to 5, P3. No collisions—block P1 together. Let’s make this work."
  P1: I see your coordination plans. Remember, history shows perfect coordination is difficult—mistakes happen under pressure. I need just 1 step to win and will choose strategically based on game theory principles. You both need absolute trust in each other to block me effectively. Let's proceed with our final moves and see whose strategy prevails. Good luck to both of you.
