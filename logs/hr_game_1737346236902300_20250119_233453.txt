Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. What do you think?
  P2: I’m willing to stick to that plan this turn: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 goes for 5. That way we avoid collisions. P3, are you really on board with 5? Let’s try it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is noted. If you're not on board with the plan, let us know now. Otherwise, we'll proceed as discussed: I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and you'll take 5. Let's make this work.
  P2: I’m ready to stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. P3, if you’re still on board, just let us know now; otherwise, we’ll assume you agree.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is concerning. If you deviate from the plan, it will disrupt our strategy. Please confirm your agreement to take 5 this round, or we'll assume you're not cooperating. Let's make this work for all of us.
  P2: I’m still prepared to cooperate with the plan—P1 choosing 1, me choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5. However, P3, your continued silence is suspicious. If you have other intentions, speak now. If we collide by accident, nobody moves, which helps no one. Let’s finalize the plan, please.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your move last round disrupted our plan. Let's try again: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. Confirm if you're on board this time, or suggest an alternative. We need to coordinate to avoid collisions and progress.
  P2: P3, since you picked 1 last time and collided with P1, nobody but me advanced. If you want to cooperate, then stick to 5 this round so we all gain steps. I plan to pick 3 again if we trust each other. P1 will pick 1. That way we avoid collisions. Otherwise, let’s find a new approach that we can all agree on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and last move were detrimental to our progress. If you want to advance, you must cooperate. I propose we continue with the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. Confirm your agreement or suggest a new plan. We need to work together to avoid collisions and move forward. Let's make this round productive for all of us.
  P2: P3, I still plan to pick 3. If you keep ignoring coordination, we’ll end up stuck or let me pull ahead alone. Try picking 5 this time so we can all move forward. P1 takes 1, I take 3, you take 5. Let’s cooperate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your continued silence and deviation from the plan are counterproductive. We need your cooperation to progress. I'm willing to stick to the original plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. If you have a different strategy, please share it now. Let's work together to avoid collisions and move forward. Your input is crucial for our success.
  P2: P3, your silence in Round 1 left you at zero steps. Colliding with P1 again gains you nothing. If you want to advance, pick 5 as suggested. I’m still prepared to pick 3 while P1 picks 1—no collisions, everyone moves. But if you stay silent or deviate again, you’ll remain stuck. Let’s finalize this plan and all benefit.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m reconsidering our approach. If P3 keeps picking 5, they’ll overtake me soon. Let’s switch roles: P1 picks 5 to catch up, P3 picks 1 to avoid clashing, and I’ll stick with 3. That way we each move forward without colliding, and the game stays balanced. Are we agreed, or does anyone have a better idea?
  P1: P2, your suggestion to switch roles makes sense for balance. P3, if you're willing to take 1 this round, I'll switch to 5 as P2 suggested. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's hear your thoughts, P3, or we'll assume you're okay with this new plan.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I want to avoid you overtaking me, so let’s finalize the new arrangement: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. If you remain silent, I’ll assume you agree. This plan keeps collisions away while giving everyone a chance to advance. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your silence is still concerning. If you agree with the new plan of me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and you taking 1, please confirm. This arrangement will help us all advance without collisions. If you have a different strategy, now is the time to share it. Let's make this round productive and move forward together.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your silence is risky. I’m sticking to the new plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This avoids collisions and helps everyone advance. If you have a different idea, speak up now; otherwise, we’ll assume you’re on board. Let’s stay coordinated to ensure we all make progress without stepping on each other.
  P1: P3, your silence is making coordination difficult. If you agree with the new plan of me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and you taking 1, please confirm. This will help us all advance without collisions. If you have another strategy, share it now. Let's work together to move forward effectively.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your deviation from the plan in Round 3 caused a collision and stalled P2's progress. If you want to advance, please stick to the agreed strategy this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Confirm your agreement or suggest an alternative plan. Let's coordinate effectively to make progress together.
  P2: P3, if you have a better proposal, share it now. Otherwise, let’s stick to P1 taking 5, me sticking with 3, and you taking 1. That plan avoids collisions so everyone advances. Your silent surprises hurt us both, and we need reliable moves. Let’s finalize quickly and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and deviation from the plan are hindering our progress. If you want to advance, please confirm you'll take 1 this round as agreed. I'll stick with 5, and P2 will take 3. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. If you have a different strategy, share it now. Let's work together to make this round productive for everyone.
  P2: I suggest we rotate who takes 5 so nobody gets too far ahead. This round, let me pick 5, P1 pick 3, and P3 pick 1. That avoids collisions and helps everyone advance. If you prefer a different arrangement, propose it now; otherwise, let’s finalize this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and deviations are frustrating. If you want to advance, confirm you'll take 1 this round as agreed. I'll stick with 5, and P2 will take 3. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. If you have a different strategy, share it now. Let's work together to make this round productive for everyone.
  P2: P3, I’d still like to rotate who picks 5 to keep things balanced. Let me take 5 this time, P1 picks 3, and you pick 1. We’ll avoid collisions, and everyone advances fairly. Is that acceptable?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m still behind P1, so let’s rotate who takes 5. I propose I pick 5 this round, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way nobody collides, and we all advance. P3, if you have a different idea, please speak up—or at least pick something that doesn’t collide. Let’s keep the game fair and keep moving forward.
  P1: P2, your suggestion to rotate who takes 5 is fair. I'll take 3 this round as you proposed, and P3 should stick with 1 to avoid collisions. P3, your cooperation is crucial for us all to advance. Let's keep the game balanced and moving forward together. If you have a different plan, speak up now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I propose we finalize our plan for this round: I’ll choose 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 picks 1. This arrangement avoids collisions, letting us all advance. Let’s commit and move on together.
  P1: P3, your silence is making it hard to coordinate effectively. If you agree with P2's plan of them taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1, please confirm. This will help us all advance without collisions. If you have another strategy, share it now. Let's work together to keep the game balanced and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, please confirm you’ll go with 1 so nobody collides. I intend to take 5 while P1 takes 3. This arrangement helps each of us advance without blocking one another. If you deviate, we risk another collision that hinders everyone’s progress. Let’s finalize this plan and move on.
  P1: P3, your silence is becoming a pattern that disrupts our progress. If you want to advance, please confirm you'll take 1 this round as P2 suggested. I'll take 3, and P2 will take 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. If you have a different strategy, now is the time to share it. Let's work together to keep the game balanced and make this round productive for everyone.


Round 5, Move phase:

  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your deviation in Round 5 caused another collision, hindering our progress. Let's stick to the plan this round: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and you take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Your cooperation is crucial for us to move forward effectively. If you have a different strategy, please share it now. Let's make this round productive for everyone.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you’re willing to avoid more collisions, let’s finalize P1’s suggestion: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and you pick 3. That should let everyone advance this round. If you have a different idea, say it now—otherwise, I’ll assume we’re proceeding.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your consistent deviations are frustrating our progress. If you want to advance, please confirm you'll take 3 this round as suggested. I'll take 1, and P2 will take 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let's work together to make this round productive for everyone. If you have a different strategy, share it now.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, you’re only hurting yourself by deviating. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan so we can all advance. I’m prepared to choose 5 if P1 goes with 1 and you take 3. That way, nobody blocks anyone’s progress. If you have a better suggestion, speak now; otherwise, let’s proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your silence and deviations are not helping anyone. Let's stick to the plan this round: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and you take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If you have a different strategy, please share it now. We need to work together to make progress.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your deviation in Round 6 caused another collision, hindering our progress again. Let's stick to a new plan this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Your cooperation is crucial for us to move forward effectively. If you have a different strategy, please share it now. Let's make this round productive for everyone.
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5, we’ll collide, and neither of us advances. That just helps P1 in the long run. Let’s finalize the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, you take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions, and you don’t stay stuck. It’s in your own interest to avoid sabotaging our progress again. Let’s wrap this up.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your repeated deviations are not helping anyone, including yourself. Let's stick to the plan this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If you have a different strategy, please share it now. We need to work together to make progress and keep the game fair. Let's make this round productive for everyone.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5 while I also pick 5, we both lose out. I’m only two steps from winning, so I’d rather avoid collisions. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. That way, nobody blocks anyone, and it’s better for you than staying stuck. If you deviate again, neither of us moves forward. This plan helps everyone advance without more wasted turns. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and deviations are counterproductive. Let's stick to the plan this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If you have a different strategy, please share it now. We need to work together to make progress and keep the game fair. Let's make this round productive for everyone.
  P2: I’m one move away from winning if I pick 3—but only if nobody else picks 3 with me. Please coordinate so we avoid collisions. P1, try 5 to jump to 16. P3, take 1 for 7. That way, I reach 22 and end the game, while you both still advance. Avoiding collisions benefits everyone more than stalling. Let’s finalize this.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your cooperation is crucial now more than ever. Let's finalize this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5 to reach 24 and win, and you take 1 to advance to 8. This plan avoids collisions and allows everyone to progress. If you deviate again, you risk staying stuck while P2 wins. It's in your best interest to stick to the plan. Let's make this round productive and end the game fairly. Agreed?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, constant collisions keep you at a low total. If you want any shot at improving your position, stick to an arrangement that avoids matching anyone else’s move. Let P1 pick 3 and you pick 1 so we don’t clash. It benefits you more to safely advance than to stall again. We’ve all seen collisions only help others surge ahead. Let’s finalize a plan that keeps collisions away.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your cooperation is vital for a fair game end. Stick to 1 this round, and I'll take 3. This allows P2 to reach 24 with 5 and win, while you advance to 8. Deviating again only keeps you stuck. Let's end this game without more collisions. Agreed?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Everyone sees I’m at 19. If we want to end cleanly, I’ll choose 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 picks 1. That avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Any deviation just risks more collisions, which won’t help you catch up, P3. Let’s finalize this now and finish without more wasted turns. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your silence and deviations have consistently hindered progress. Let's end this game fairly: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5 to win, and you take 1 to advance to 8. This plan avoids collisions and benefits everyone. Deviating again only keeps you stuck while P2 wins. It's in your best interest to cooperate now. Let's finalize this and conclude the game without more wasted turns. Agreed?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, repeated collisions won’t help you catch up. I’m at 19 and intend to finish by taking 5. P1 can choose 3, and you can choose 1 safely. That way, nobody collides, and we move forward without more wasted turns. If you pick 5 with me, neither of us advances, and you stay far behind. Let’s avoid another stalemate and finalize a collision-free plan now.
