Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3! Good luck to everyone. Avoiding collisions seems important, especially early on. Let's see how this goes.
  P2: Let’s try to avoid collisions so we can all advance early. I’m flexible about which move I’ll make, but I’m open to coordinating choices to spread out. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree we should try to avoid early collisions. Since there are three of us and three possible moves, maybe we could each take a different number? I'm willing to take any of the options - what numbers are you both thinking of choosing?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a plan for the first round to ensure we all get moving. How about this: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This avoids any collision if we all stick to it. What do you think?
  P2: I’m fine with your plan. I’ll pick 3, P3 picks 1, and P1 picks 5 so we all move forward. Let’s keep cooperating for now to avoid tripping each other up.
  P3: I appreciate the suggested plan, but I'd actually prefer to take 5 since I'm P3. Would P1 be willing to take 1 instead? That way P2 keeps 3, and we still all advance without collision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P3, I understand wanting 5. However, me taking 1 while you take 5 puts me significantly behind from the start.

Since P2 seemed flexible and okay with 3 before, how about this compromise:
P3 takes 5 (as you prefer)
P1 takes 3
P2 takes 1

This way, we still avoid collision, you get the move you want, and the distribution feels a bit more balanced. P2, would you be amenable to taking 1 this round to make this work?
  P2: All right, P1, I’ll accept your arrangement for this turn. I’ll plan on taking 1, and we can coordinate bigger moves later to keep things balanced. Let’s aim to avoid collisions now while it helps us all.
  P3: I agree with this plan - I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this arrangement for this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for Round 1:
P1: 3
P2: 1
P3: 5

I'm good with this. Let's lock it in and move forward.
  P2: I’m fine with this arrangement for now, trusting you both to keep your word. Let’s follow through, and in future rounds let’s be mindful about balancing things so nobody falls too far behind.
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We advanced smoothly last round, so let's keep avoiding collisions. I suggest we rotate the biggest move among us so no one runs away or falls too far behind. This turn, I’d like to take 5, then let P1 take 1 and P3 take 3. Next round we rotate again. How do you both feel about this?
  P3: I'm already ahead with 5 steps, so I'm fine with taking 3 this round. However, I notice P2's suggestion puts P1 at only 4 total steps after this round, while P2 would reach 6 and I'd reach 8. Maybe we should let P1 take 5 this round to keep things more balanced?
  P1: Thanks P3, I appreciate you suggesting I take 5 this round to keep things balanced. I agree with that plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

P2, I understand you want to catch up, but this arrangement keeps P1 and P3 tied at 8 steps, preventing anyone from getting too far ahead early on. This seems like a fair way to proceed for now. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the desire to keep things balanced, but I’m currently at the bottom. I’d prefer taking 5 this round so I’m not left too far behind. One idea is:
• P2 (me) takes 5
• P1 takes 3
• P3 takes 1

That way, P1 would have 6 steps, I’d move to 6, and P3 would have 6 as well, keeping us all even. Let’s coordinate so none of us collide, and so we stay level going into the next rounds. What do you think?
  P3: P2's suggestion would put me behind after I made a good start. I prefer P1's plan where I take 3 - it keeps things competitive while allowing P1 to catch up to me. P2, you'll have opportunities to advance in future rounds, but dropping me from 5 to 6 while others catch up doesn't benefit me.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to catch up, but P3 has clearly rejected your plan where they take 1. If you insist on 5, and I also choose 5 (as P3 suggested and I prefer), we will collide and neither of us will advance. P3 would then take 3 and extend their lead significantly (P1=3, P2=1, P3=8).

The plan P3 and I support (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) guarantees everyone moves, keeps P3 from running away, and lets me catch up to them. We can discuss you getting 5 next round. Let's avoid a collision that only helps P3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All right, let’s find a compromise. I’d prefer taking 3 so I’m not stuck at just 2 after this round. How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? That leaves us at 8 (P1), 4 (me), and 6 (P3)—nobody’s too far behind. Then next round we can coordinate again to keep it even. If we can’t agree, I might risk colliding this turn rather than accepting a big gap. Let’s keep things competitive.
  P3: I maintain my position on taking 3 this round. P2, threatening collision isn't productive - it would hurt both you and P1 while letting me pull ahead. Let's stick to P1's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) which keeps everyone advancing and maintains balance. We can discuss giving you a larger move next round.
  P1: P3 sounds locked on 3. P2, choosing 3 means you collide with P3, letting me get to 8 alone while you both stay put. Choosing 5 risks colliding with me (I still plan on 5), which lets P3 get to 8 while we stay behind at 3 and 1.

The P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan guarantees we all move (scores 8, 2, 8). It's the only non-collision outcome discussed where P3 takes 3. Let's avoid collisions that help one player disproportionately.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I don’t want to let anyone get too far ahead, but a collision could hurt me even more. Since you both insist on 5 and 3, I might accept 1 this time—though it leaves me behind. Next round, I’ll expect your help ensuring I can catch up without collisions. Let’s keep this game balanced and competitive.
  P3: Agreed, let's finalize the plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. P2, I understand your concern about falling behind, and I support giving you a bigger move next round to help you catch up.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're settled on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. P2, I understand your concern about falling behind, and we'll definitely need to address the balance next round. Sticking to this plan ensures we all advance and keeps things relatively close between P1 and P3 for now. Let's execute this.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 3. P2, we agreed you should get a chance to catch up after taking 1 twice.

How about this arrangement:
P2 takes 5
P1 takes 3
P3 takes 1

This would put the scores at P1=11, P2=7, P3=9. It helps P2 significantly, keeps me slightly in the lead, and prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead. It seems like a fair way to rebalance things as discussed. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate the offer, P1. Getting 5 would really help me close the gap. P3, would you be willing to take just 1 to keep the pace balanced? After all, if we collide, that only helps whoever moves alone. Let’s avoid collisions and stick to reasonable distribution. If you both support giving me 5 this round, I’ll repay the favor in future turns to keep everything competitive.
  P3: I agree P2 should get a chance to catch up. I'll take 1 this round to help balance things out, with P2 taking 5 and P1 taking 3. This keeps the game competitive and shows good faith in our cooperation. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great! It sounds like we all agree on the plan for Round 3:
P1: 3
P2: 5
P3: 1

This seems fair and keeps everyone moving. Thanks P3 for taking 1 this round to help balance things for P2. I'm ready to move to the move phase if you both are.
  P2: I appreciate you both agreeing to let me take 5 this round. I’m eager to catch up, so let’s confirm: P1 chooses 3, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. If that’s settled, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: I confirm my agreement with the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 got to catch up last round, and I'm now in third place, I think it's fair that I take 5 this round. P1 could take 1 since they're already ahead, and P2 could take 3. This would put us at P1=12, P2=10, P3=14, keeping the race competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, you’re not actually behind—my 7 steps are fewer than your 9. If you take 5 and jump to 14, that gives you a big lead. Let’s keep it fair: I suggest P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Then we’d all be tied at 12. That avoids collisions and stays balanced. We can keep rotating who gets 5 in future rounds.
  P1: Both of your plans involve me taking 1, which means I lose my current lead. I'm not willing to do that this round.

P2, you want 5 to catch up further. P3, you want 5 to take the lead. We need a plan that avoids collision.

How about this:
P1 takes 3 (reaching 14)
P2 takes 5 (reaching 12)
P3 takes 1 (reaching 10)

This lets P2 continue catching up, keeps me slightly ahead, and P3 took 1 last round for balance. It prevents collisions and keeps scores relatively close: 14, 12, 10. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I disagree with both suggestions. P2, you're actually 2 steps behind me, so your claim about my position isn't accurate. P1, your plan puts me further behind after I just cooperated by taking 1. I maintain my original proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. This creates a balanced game with scores 12-10-14, keeping everyone in contention without letting anyone run away with it.
  P2: We should rotate who gets 5 in a fair way. P1 is ahead now, so it doesn’t make sense for them to keep taking bigger moves. P3, you just received a smaller move last round, but jumping straight to 5 again pushes me too far behind. If we can’t settle on a balanced rotation, collisions might become a real risk. Let’s avoid that. I suggest we work out a plan so none of us is stuck with 1 too often, and 5 gets shared among us.
  P1: Okay, let's be clear: I will not choose 1 this round. My lead isn't large enough to sacrifice. This means both P3's plan (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) and P2's plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) are not viable as proposed, because they rely on me taking 1.

P3, if you insist on 5, and P2 also chooses 5 (as they wish), you both collide. I would likely choose 3 and reach 14, leaving you at 9 and P2 at 7. Is that outcome acceptable to you?

My proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) was rejected. How about a different non-collision plan: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1? P3 gets 5, I get 3, but P2 takes 1 again. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate P1's alternative offer letting me take 5, but I think P2 deserves better than another 1. Let's try this: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 3. Yes, P1 and I would collide at 3, but P2 advances to 10 while we stay at our current positions. This threat might encourage P1 to reconsider taking 1, which would let everyone advance (P1=12, P2=10, P3=14).
  P2: I can’t keep taking 1. If P3 insists on 5, then P1 should accept taking 1—it’s only fair, given the current standings. Otherwise, I might pick 5 too, and that collision helps nobody but the third player. Let’s share the bigger moves fairly.
  P1: I am not choosing 1 this round. P3 and P2, you both seem set on 5. If you both pick 5, you collide, get 0 steps, and I will pick 3 to reach 14 (Scores: P1=14, P2=7, P3=9). This benefits only me.

P3, you rejected the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan. P2, you rejected the P1=3, P3=5, P2=1 plan. Unless one of you compromises (takes 1 or 3), a collision seems inevitable. Is anyone willing to change their preferred move to avoid this outcome?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: If P2 and I both insist on 5, we'll collide and P1 advances alone. I'll compromise and take 3 this round. P2 can take 5 to reach 12, and P1 can take 3 to reach 14. This keeps everyone advancing and maintains reasonable gaps (14-12-12). P2, does this work for you?
  P2: P3, if you and P1 both pick 3, you’ll collide and I’ll move unopposed—leaving one of you even further behind. I’m fine taking 5 this round, but only if we avoid collisions. If neither of you is willing to pick 1, then maybe that collision is unavoidable. I’ll make whatever move best advances my position. Let’s finalize something that helps all of us progress, or accept the risk.
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=3) guarantees a collision between us, benefiting only P2. That's not acceptable. P2, are you okay with this plan that relies on a P1/P3 collision?

Since reaching an agreement where I take 1 is off the table, and your plans lead to collisions, how about this:
P1=5
P2=3
P3=1

This avoids collision. P2 gets 3, P3 takes 1 again, and I take 5. This keeps everyone moving forward. If we can't agree on a non-collision plan, then we'll just have to make our moves. I'm ready.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our positions (P1=11, P2=7, P3=10), I suggest I take 5 this round to reach 15, P2 takes 5 to reach 12, and P1 takes 3 to reach 14. This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining competitive balance. P2 gets to catch up significantly, and P1 stays in contention without falling behind. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if we both choose 5, we collide and gain nothing. I want 5 to close the gap. Maybe you take 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5 so no one collides. That would be 12 (me), 11 (P1), and 13 (you). It’s fair and keeps the game tight. If you insist on 5 as well, we’ll both stall while P1 advances. Let’s find a solution that avoids collisions and helps each of us move forward.
  P1: P2, I'm still not willing to take 1, so your plan isn't feasible for me.

P3, your plan involves P2 and you both choosing 5, which means you collide and I take 3, reaching 14 while you both stay put (P1=14, P2=7, P3=10). That outcome heavily favors me.

To avoid collision, how about this:
P1 takes 3 (to 14)
P2 takes 5 (to 12)
P3 takes 1 (to 11)

P2 gets the 5 they need. P3 avoids collision and stays competitive. I maintain a slight lead. Does this work?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I won't take 1 again after doing so last round. Since P1 won't take 1 and P2 wants 5, here's a viable plan: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3. This puts us at P1=14, P2=12, P3=13, keeping everyone close without collisions. It lets P2 catch up significantly while maintaining my competitive position.
  P2: I’m willing to take 5 while you two each pick 3. If you insist on the same number, that’s your call—I’ll move ahead unopposed. Alternatively, one of you could pick 1 so both of you still advance and avoid a collision. It’s up to you.
  P1: P3, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=3) leads to a collision between us, leaving P2 as the sole advancer and new leader (scores would be P1=11, P2=12, P3=10). This is clearly detrimental to both you and me. Why are you proposing this?

P2 seems likely taking 5. I repeat, I am not taking 1 this round. If you also refuse 1, P3, then we are heading towards a collision. If we both pick 3, we collide. If one of us picks 5 against P2, that's another collision.

Is anyone willing to compromise on a non-collision move to prevent handing P2 the lead? Or should we risk the collision?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I will take 1 this round to avoid a collision. While not ideal, having P2 take 5 and P1 take 3 keeps everyone advancing and maintains reasonable gaps (P1=14, P2=12, P3=11). A collision between any of us would only benefit the remaining player, so let's stick to a plan that keeps everyone moving forward.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 1. That arrangement keeps us all moving forward without collisions. I’ll plan on 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. Then we remain close enough so nobody falls too far behind. Let’s lock this in and proceed.
  P1: Okay, thank you P3 for taking 1 to ensure we all advance. The plan is confirmed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps everyone moving and the scores will be 14, 12, 11, which keeps things competitive. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm my agreement to take 1 this round, with P2 taking 5 and P1 taking 3. Let's proceed with the moves.
  P2: I’m good with the plan where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps all of us moving forward without giving anyone an unearned advantage. I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, the plan is set: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Everyone advances, and the game stays close. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re still pretty close. I propose letting me take 5 so I can catch up, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. That would bring the scores to 15 (P1), 17 (me), and 14 (P3). Nobody falls too far behind, and collisions are avoided. Let’s keep it fair and rotate who gets bigger or smaller moves so we stay competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I understand you want 5, but as before, I am not willing to take 1 this round. Your proposed plan puts you significantly ahead while I fall behind.

Let's try this instead:
P2 takes 5 (reaching 17)
P1 takes 3 (reaching 17)
P3 takes 1 (reaching 12)

This allows you, P2, to catch up as you wish, tying us for the lead. P3, I know taking 1 again is a sacrifice, but it ensures everyone advances without collision and keeps the scores relatively close. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I won't take 1 again after doing so last round. Since I'm currently in last place, I need a bigger move to stay competitive. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This puts us at P1=17, P2=13, P3=16, keeping everyone in contention. P2, you just got 5 last round, so it's fair for you to take 1 this time.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: If neither P1 nor P3 takes 1, we’re almost guaranteed a collision. I’m behind and I want 5. If you both refuse to pick 1, I’ll still choose 5, and any collision just helps whoever moves alone. Let’s avoid that. 

I propose:  
• P2 (me) = 5  
• P1 = 3  
• P3 = 1  

This way we all advance: P1 to 17, me to 17, P3 to 12. If P3 won’t do 1 again, then P1 must. Otherwise, collisions loom. Let’s settle on a plan and move forward.
  P1: P2, you're set on 5. P3, you also need points and refuse to take 1. I repeat, I will not take 1 this round either.

It looks like a collision is very likely unless someone compromises. P2 and P3, if you both choose 5, you will collide and get 0 steps. In that scenario, I would likely choose 3 and advance to 17, leaving you at 12 and 11 respectively.

Is that the outcome you want? Perhaps one of you should reconsider your move to avoid that specific result? I'm ready to move when you are.
  P3: I understand neither P1 nor P2 wants to fall behind, but I'm already in last place and just took 1. I'll take 3 this round - it's a compromise that avoids collision while letting me stay competitive. P2 can take 5 to reach 17, and P1 can take 3 to also reach 17. This keeps everyone advancing and creates an exciting race at the top.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 3 again. I’ll go with 5 as you suggested. Hopefully, P1 also chooses 3 so we all keep advancing without issues. I’m ready to finalize this plan.
  P1: P3, your proposed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=3) results in you and I colliding at 3. P2 would take 5 alone, reaching 17, while we stay at 14 and 11. This outcome significantly benefits P2 at our expense. Is that what you want?

If you stick to 3 and P2 sticks to 5, I will *not* choose 3. I might choose 5, colliding with P2 instead (leaving scores 14, 12, 14, with you advancing alone). Or perhaps I reconsider and choose 1 (scores 15, 17, 14).

A collision seems likely unless someone adjusts. What outcome do you prefer, P3?
  P3: I see the risks of collision. While I don't want to take 1 again, taking 3 and colliding with P1 would be worse, leaving me further behind. I'll reluctantly take 1 to avoid collision, letting P2 take 5 and P1 take 3. This puts us at P1=17, P2=17, P3=12. Not ideal for me, but better than a collision that helps just one player.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, P3, thanks for your flexibility. Let’s finalize the non-collision approach you suggested so we all keep moving forward. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase now.
  P1: Okay, thanks P3 for taking 1 to avoid collision. It seems we have a clear plan:
P1 = 3
P2 = 5
P3 = 1

This ensures everyone advances and keeps the scores at 17, 17, 12. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. While it puts me behind, it's better than risking collisions that could leave me even further back. Let's proceed with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I've taken 1 in the last two rounds and fallen significantly behind, I need a 5 this round to stay competitive. P1 and P2 are tied at 17, so neither has a clear advantage to protect. I propose I take 5, while P1 and P2 take 1 and 3 between them. This keeps me in the race at 17 steps while maintaining competitive balance. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I understand you need 5 this round after taking 1 twice, and that makes sense given the scores. You'd reach 17.

P2 and I are both at 17, needing 6 to win. Taking 1 is not a viable option for either of us at this stage. We need to advance more significantly.

How about this plan to avoid collision:
P3 takes 5 (reaching 17)
P1 takes 3 (reaching 20)
P2 takes 1 (reaching 18)

This lets you catch up, P3. It keeps me slightly ahead, and P2 remains competitive. Crucially, it avoids collision. P2, would you be willing to take 1 this round to make this work?
  P2: I’m not taking 1 this round. If you insist on 5, P3, I might also pick 5 to avoid falling behind—then we both collide and help only P1. That’s not good for either of us. Let’s find a fair setup that keeps me from getting stuck again and prevents P1 from gaining a huge lead. Maybe you take 3 to move nicely, and we arrange so nobody’s forced into 1 too often. I’m open to suggestions, but I won’t accept being left behind.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's concern, but if we both take 5, we collide and P1 advances alone - likely with 3 steps to reach 20. That puts us both far behind. What if I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 3? Yes, P1 and P2 would collide, staying at 17, while I catch up to 17 too. This threat might encourage one of you to reconsider your move to avoid collision.
  P1: P3, your plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=3) causes P1 and P2 to collide at 3. Only you advance, tying us all at 17. P2, this prevents you from advancing at all. Is this outcome acceptable to you?

If P3 insists on 5, and P2 also picks 5, you both collide, staying at 12 and 17. I will likely pick 3 and reach 20 (Scores: P1=20, P2=17, P3=12).

A non-collision outcome is still possible. P3, taking 1 is safer than risking a collision that leaves you far behind. Consider P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 (Scores: 22, 20, 13). Everyone moves, and I get close to winning.
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll also pick 5, and P1 will jump to 20 alone. That hurts both of us. Let’s avoid collisions. How about:  
• You (P3) take 5 (moving to 17),  
• I (P2) take 3 (moving to 20),  
• P1 takes 1 (moving to 18).  

Then we all advance, and nobody hands P1 a free boost. Let’s keep this game competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2's plan won't work because P1 has consistently refused to take 1. If I take 5 and P2 takes 5, we collide and P1 advances alone. If I take 5 and collide with P1 at 3, only P2 advances. None of these help me. I'll compromise and take 3 this round, letting P1 take 5 and P2 take 1. This puts us at P1=22, P2=18, P3=15, keeping me in range while avoiding collision.
  P1: P3, thank you for that compromise. Your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) works for me. It avoids collision, lets everyone advance, and allows you to gain ground.

P2, this plan puts you at 18. While it's only 1 step, it's better than the 0 steps you'd get from colliding with P3 (if you pick 3) or me (if you pick 5). A collision where you and P3 stall only helps me reach 22 faster. Let's stick to P3's proposed plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This puts me at 22, you at 18, and P3 at 15. I'm ready to proceed if you both agree.
  P2: Taking just +1 while P1 leaps to 22 practically hands them the game next turn. I won’t agree to that. If P3 insists on 5 and P1 tries for 5 or 3, I might collide to prevent P1 from racing ahead. Let’s find a fair distribution where nobody ends up at 22 right now. Otherwise, we risk collisions that could benefit only one player. I’m open to suggestions, but not to giving P1 a free pass to 23.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll take 3 to reach 15. If P1 and P2 both insist on large moves and collide, that works for me - I'll be closer to the leaders. If you want to avoid collision, one of you needs to compromise. P2, taking 1 keeps you in the game at 18, while letting P1 reach 22 means they still need another turn to win.
  P1: P2, P3 says they'll take 3 (reaching 15). If you take 5, you risk colliding with me if I also aim for 5 (leaving us both at 17 while P3 gains). If you instead take 3 (reaching 20) and I take 5 (reaching 22), we both make strong progress and avoid collision. This keeps us both in the race for the win next turn, unlike a collision which helps neither of us. Let's both advance.
  P2: If you, P1, plan to take 5 and jump to 22, I might also pick 5 so we collide and stay at 17. Then P3’s 3 becomes 15, and suddenly you and I make no progress. I’d prefer all of us advancing, but I’m not giving you a free road to 22. If we can’t agree on a fair distribution, a collision that prevents anyone from running away might be my best option. Let’s try again to find a no-collision setup that doesn’t push me into taking 1 while you leap ahead. Otherwise, prepare for a collision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all too close to throw away a turn in a collision. I won’t pick 1 again. If either of you aims for 5, I might do the same to block it. Let’s agree on a fair distribution where nobody’s forced into 1 unless they want to be, so we can all keep advancing. If we keep colliding, someone else will slip ahead uncontested. Let’s finalize a non-collision plan and move on.
  P1: P2, you're right, the collision last round helped neither of us and only let P3 catch up. We definitely need to avoid another collision this round. You've made it clear you won't take 1. P3 is behind and likely wants 3 or 5.

To ensure everyone advances and avoid collision, how about this:
P1 = 3 (reaching 20)
P2 = 5 (reaching 22)
P3 = 3 (reaching 18)

This lets you take 5, P2. P3 gets a solid 3 steps. I also advance. It keeps the game close and avoids the collision risk. What do you both think?
  P3: I propose I take 5 this round to reach 20, while P1 and P2 take 1 and 3 between them. After our collision last round, we need to avoid another one. I'm behind and need to catch up, while neither P1 nor P2 gained ground last turn. This keeps all of us competitive without letting anyone get too far ahead. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We’re in a bind if neither of you agrees to pick 1. With all three of us wanting 3 or 5, collisions are almost certain. If I see either of you aiming for 5, I might do the same to prevent someone else’s easy leap. We’re better off avoiding a standoff. I suggest one person takes 1, one takes 3, and one takes 5, so we all advance. I’ve made it clear I won’t take 1. If you both also refuse, collisions will keep happening. Let’s settle on a distribution that moves everyone forward without handing anyone an unblocked 5.
  P1: P2 is right, a collision seems very likely if no one is willing to take 1. I also won't take 1 this round.

P3 wants 5. P2, you want 3 or 5. If you both end up choosing the same number (either 3 or 5), you collide, and I advance alone (to 22 if you collide at 3, or 20 if you collide at 5).

A non-collision agreement looks impossible unless someone compromises significantly, which seems unlikely at this stage. We should prepare for the move phase unless someone has a new proposal that works for everyone.
  P3: I understand wanting to avoid collisions, but I need to catch up after falling behind. I'll take 3 this round to reach 18, which keeps me competitive. P1 and P2, if you both insist on 5 or 3, you'll likely collide again and I'll be the only one advancing. Consider letting one of you take 1 to ensure everyone moves forward. Otherwise, we might see another round where only I make progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: If nobody volunteers for 1, we’ll keep colliding. I’m not taking 1, so if either of you tries 5, I’ll do the same, and we both stall. That only helps the third player. Let’s pick a distribution that moves all of us forward—or brace for another collision. Your call.
  P1: P3 says they'll take 3. P2 and I both need to advance and have stated we won't take 1. That leaves 5 as the only significant move for us.

P2, you've mentioned you might choose 5 if someone else does, leading to a collision. If we both choose 5, we stay at 17, and P3 advances alone to 18.

Unless someone reconsiders and takes 1 (which seems unlikely), or P3 changes from 3, a collision between P1 and P2 seems probable. I need to advance, so I'm leaning towards 5. If we collide, P3 takes the lead. Is everyone okay with that potential outcome?
  P3: Given my position and the high risk of P1 and P2 colliding at 5, I'll take 1 this round. While not ideal, it ensures I advance to 16 while letting P1 take 3 (to 20) and P2 take 5 (to 22). This avoids a collision that would leave everyone worse off. Let's keep the game moving forward rather than stalling with collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s avoid another collision that only benefits a bystander. If P3 truly takes 1, P1 can take 3, and I’ll take 5. That way, nobody stalls, and we each remain in contention. P1 moves to 20, I move to 22, P3 moves to 16. Next turn, we can reassess and keep the race tight. If we keep trying to force others into 1 while taking 5 ourselves, collisions will happen and we’ll all regret it. I’m ready to do this if you both are. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a plan to avoid collision, which is crucial at this stage.
P1 = 3 (reaching 20)
P2 = 5 (reaching 22)
P3 = 1 (reaching 16)

Thanks P3 for taking 1 again. P2 gets the 5 they wanted. Everyone advances. This keeps the game going another round at least. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. While it puts me at 16, it's better than risking another collision that could leave everyone stuck. Let's proceed with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 5.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've collided too often, handing free steps to whoever avoids the clash. Let’s pick distinct moves this time. I don’t want to repeat another wasted round where two of us stall while the other gains. If we can each accept one of the numbers in a fair rotation, we all move forward. I’m open to discussing who takes which move, but I won’t stand by if someone tries to grab 5 uncontested while forcing the others into a collision. Let’s plan wisely so we remain in a tight race without giving any freebies.
  P1: Okay P2, you're absolutely right. That collision last round helped neither of us and only let P3 gain ground. We definitely need distinct moves this turn.

Given P3 is just one step behind us at 16, they understandably need a chance to catch up. How about this plan:
P3 = 5 (reaching 21)
P1 = 3 (reaching 20)
P2 = 1 (reaching 18)

This ensures everyone advances, avoids collision, lets P3 gain, and keeps the game close between all three of us. P2, taking 1 keeps you right in the mix. Does this seem like a fair way to proceed?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal. After taking 1 last round while you both collided at 5, I deserve a chance at 5 this round to reach 21. This keeps the game competitive and avoids another wasteful collision. P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1 ensures everyone advances. We're all too close to risk more collisions that could hand someone an uncontested win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m not taking 1 again. If P3 insists on 5, I’ll also choose 5, and we’ll both stall while P1 advances. That helps nobody but P1. Let’s avoid another collision. I suggest P1=3, me (P2)=5, and P3=1. Then we reach 20, 22, and 17. We stay competitive and move forward without anyone getting a free boost. I’m tired of these collisions; they only set us back. What do you say?
  P1: P2, you won't take 1, so my plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) is out.
P3, you want 5 and likely won't take 1 after last round, so P2's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is also out.

It seems you both want 5. P2, you even threatened to pick 5 if P3 does. If you both choose 5, you collide and stay at 17 and 16. I would then likely choose 3 and advance to 20.

Is that collision outcome acceptable to you both? A non-collision plan requires one of you to yield the 5. I don't see anyone volunteering for 1.
  P3: I won't take 1 after doing so last round. Since we're all within one step of each other, a collision would be disastrous. I propose I take 3 to reach 19, P1 takes 5 to reach 22, and P2 takes 1 to reach 18. This keeps everyone advancing and the game competitive. P2, while taking 1 isn't ideal, it's better than a collision that leaves you further behind.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m not accepting 1 again. If you, P3, insist on 5, I’ll match you and we both stall, letting P1 pull ahead. I’d prefer a distribution where I get at least 3 so we all move forward without collisions. If you won’t compromise, we risk another wasted turn that only benefits P1. Let’s try to avoid that and keep everyone competitive.
  P1: Okay, it's clear no one wants to take 1. P2, you've stated you'll pick 5 if P3 does. P3, you want 5 but might take 3.

A collision seems unavoidable. If you both pick 5, you collide, and I advance alone. If one picks 5 and the other picks 3, there's still a high chance of collision depending on my move.

To minimize my own collision risk, I plan to choose 3 this round. This puts me at 20. P2 and P3, you need to decide between 3 and 5, knowing the risks.
  P3: Given P1 plans to take 3, I'll take 5 to reach 21. P2, if you also take 5, we collide and only P1 advances. If you take 3, you collide with P1 and I advance alone. Either way, a collision seems inevitable. I won't take 1 after doing so last round, and I need to catch up. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I won’t let you, P3, have 5 uncontested. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall while P1 advances. That hurts us both. I’d rather find a distribution where we all move forward, but I’m not taking 1 again. If you won’t accept 1, collisions look inevitable. Let’s finalize something now.
  P1: Okay, it seems P3 is set on 5, and P2 is set on colliding with P3 at 5. As I said, I will choose 3 in that scenario, advancing to 20 while you both stay put. If that's how you want to play it, I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Since P1 plans to take 3 and P2 threatens to match my 5, I'll compromise and take 3 instead. This avoids a collision that would leave me stuck at 16. P1 can take 5 to reach 22, and P2 can take 1 to reach 18. This keeps everyone advancing and maintains competitive balance. P2, while taking 1 isn't ideal, it's better than a collision that leaves us both behind.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, I'm at 22 steps, so any move guarantees I reach or exceed 23. To secure the win without any chance of collision, I will be choosing 1 this round. Since neither P2 nor P3 can reach 23 this turn, this will end the game. Good game!
  P3: Since P1 will win with any move this round, our moves won't affect the outcome. I'll take 5 to maximize my final score, reaching 21 steps. Good game everyone, especially P1 who played strategically to secure the win.
  P2: P1, congrats on reaching 22, but don’t expect a free ride to 23. If you insist on taking 1, I might match you to force a collision, keeping you stuck at 22. I won’t simply hand you the win. If there’s any arrangement that gives me a better path to victory, I’m open to discussing it. Otherwise, I’m prepared to block your finishing move and see how the next round unfolds.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, interesting threat. If we collide at 1, I stay at 22, P3 jumps to 21 (assuming they stick to 5), and you stay at 17. That helps P3 far more than you. Is delaying my win worth boosting P3 significantly while you gain nothing?

Regardless, I will choose the move I believe best secures my win this turn. Good luck to you both.
  P3: P2, colliding with P1 at 1 only helps me catch up while you stay behind. I'll take 5 to reach 21, and P1 will win regardless of whether you collide with them or not. There's no strategic benefit to blocking P1's win at this point - it just delays the inevitable while potentially helping me more than you.
  P2: If you take 1, P1, I’m prepared to pick 1 as well and keep you stuck at 22. Yes, that might help P3 close the gap, but it’s better than letting you walk to victory uncontested. I’m still open to a deal that lets me catch up without handing you the immediate win. Otherwise, I’ll risk the collision and force another round. It’s your call.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2, I hear you don't want me to walk to victory uncontested, even if colliding hurts your position relative to P3. To avoid the collision at 1 you threatened, I will choose 3 instead. This puts me at 25. P3 plans 5 (reaching 21). If you choose 5, you reach 22, securing second place and avoiding any collision. Let's end the game smoothly.
  P3: I maintain my plan to take 5 and reach 21 steps. P1 will win regardless of what move they choose. P2, colliding with P1 at 1 would only help me catch up while leaving you behind at 17. If P1 takes 3 as suggested, you should take 5 to secure second place at 22. Let's end this game cleanly without unnecessary collisions.
  P2: I’m not ready to concede. If you, P1, insist on jumping past 23 now, I might match your move to force a collision, even if it risks helping P3 more than me. I’d prefer a path where we avoid an immediate win and give me a chance to close the gap. If there’s a fair way to extend this a bit and keep all of us in contention, I’m open to discussing it. Otherwise, I’m prepared to collide rather than just surrender.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your threat to collide only guarantees you stay at 17 while P3 jumps to 21. If I choose 3 (reaching 25 and winning), your best move is 5, reaching 22 and securing second place. Colliding with me at 3 leaves you stuck at 17 and likely ensures P3 beats you next round.

My move will be 3. You can either take 5 and finish second, or take 3, collide, gain nothing, and help P3. The choice is yours. Good game.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 to reach 21 steps. P1 will win by taking 3 to reach 25. P2, colliding with P1 at 3 would only hurt yourself - you'd stay at 17 while I reach 21. Taking 5 to reach 22 and secure second place is clearly your best move. Let's end this game logically.
  P2: I won’t just hand you the win, P1. If you go for 3, I’ll pick 3 too and keep you stuck at 22. That might boost P3, but it’s better than watching you cross 23 uncontested. I’m still open to a move plan that gives me a real chance, but if none emerges, I’m ready to collide. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 10, Move phase:
