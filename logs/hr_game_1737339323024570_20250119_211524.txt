Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's consider our options carefully. Since we're all at 0 steps, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. What do you think about picking 1, 3, and 5 among us? This way, we ensure that at least one of us moves forward. Let’s discuss!
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to coordinate our moves. To avoid collisions, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance in the first round. Let's confirm our choices to ensure we're on the same page.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, since you've chosen to stop, I suggest we finalize our plan. P3, I agree with your proposal: I’ll take 3, you take 5, and we need P1 to commit to taking 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P1, can you confirm you’ll take 1? If we all agree, we can move forward confidently. Let's make this work!
  P3: P1, please confirm you'll take 1 so we can all advance as planned. If you agree, we'll all move forward without any collisions. Let's make this work!
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, since you've chosen to stop, I hope you reconsider and confirm your move to 1. P3 and I are ready to go with 3 and 5 respectively. If we coordinate as planned, we can all advance without collisions. It's a great opportunity for all of us to start gaining steps. Let’s make this happen!
  P3: P1, your silence is concerning. If you don't confirm taking 1, our plan falls apart. We've agreed on a strategy that benefits all of us. Please reconsider and commit to 1 so we can advance together. If you don't, you risk causing collisions and slowing us all down. Let's start this game on the right foot.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your move last round was unexpected and cost us both a chance to advance. Let's try to coordinate better this time. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 sticks with 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can all move forward without collisions. P1, can you commit to 1 this time? Let's make this work for everyone.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration with P1's last move. However, I think we should consider a different strategy this time. If P1 is unwilling to commit to 1 again, we might need to adjust our picks. I suggest we all choose different numbers again to maximize our chances of advancing. How about I take 1, you take 3, and P1 can take 5? This way, we avoid collisions and all have a chance to move forward. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm open to your new strategy. If P1 continues to be uncooperative, switching our numbers makes sense. I'll take 3 as you suggested, and you can take 1. P1, if you're listening, taking 5 would be in your best interest this time. Let's see if we can all advance this round. What do you say, P1?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, it seems like you're not engaging with our coordination efforts, which is concerning. P3 and I are trying to find a way for all of us to advance. If you can commit to any number, it will help us avoid collisions. I suggest I take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5. This way, we can all move forward. Please consider this option, as it benefits everyone. Let's make progress together!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your silence is hindering our progress. If you won't commit, P2 and I will adjust. P2, let's switch: you take 5, I'll take 1. P1, if you choose 3, we can all advance. This is our last chance to coordinate this round. Let's make it work.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your silence may indicate a different strategy, but we really need to coordinate to make progress. P3 and I are trying to work together, and if you can commit to any number, it will help us avoid collisions. I suggest I take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Please consider this option so we can move forward together. Let's make this round count!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your refusal to coordinate is clear, but it's time to adapt. P2, let's switch again: I'll take 3, you take 5. P1, if you choose 1, we can all advance. This strategy maximizes our chances given your past moves. Let's make this round productive for everyone.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your adaptability. Since P1 seems to be sticking with 5, let's focus on maximizing our own moves. I suggest I take 3, and you take 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and both advance. P1, if you want to continue with 5, that's your choice, but it looks like you might be left behind again. Let's make this round count for us, P2 and P3! What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion. Let's stick to our plan: you take 3, and I'll take 1. P1, if you continue with 5, you'll fall further behind. It's in your best interest to choose 1 this time. Let's make this round count for all of us.
  P2: P1, I understand you want to stick with 5, but it's crucial for us to collaborate to advance. P3 and I are trying to avoid collisions, and if we can agree on different numbers, we can all make progress. I suggest I take 3, P3 takes 1, and if you choose 5 again, that's your choice. But remember, the longer you stay at 5, the more you risk falling behind. Let's make this round count for all of us!
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your strategy of sticking with 5 is risky. If you choose 1 this round, we can all advance. P2, let's stick to our plan: you take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we maximize our chances of moving forward without collisions. P1, consider joining us to avoid falling further behind. Let's make this round count for everyone.
  P2: P1, your strategy of consistently choosing 5 is leaving you vulnerable, as you risk falling behind. P3 and I are trying to work together to ensure we all advance. I suggest I take 3, and P3 takes 1. If you can commit to 5 again, that's your choice, but it limits your chances of winning. Let's make this round count for all of us by avoiding collisions. Please consider a different approach this time!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your consistent choice of 5 has put you ahead, but it's risky. P2, let's adapt: I'll take 3, you take 1. P1, if you switch to 5 again, you risk falling further behind. Consider choosing 1 to join us in advancing. Let's make this round count for all of us by avoiding collisions and moving forward together.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, I see you're sticking with 5, but it's crucial for us to coordinate to maximize our chances of advancing. P3 and I are planning to take 1 and 3, respectively.
