Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm going for 5.  Don't get in my way.
  P2: P1, if you truly want 5, you risk collision if anyone else does the same. P3, let’s keep our options open. I don’t like collisions—maybe we can agree on different moves so nobody gets blocked. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, if you pick 5 and I pick 3, we both avoid collisions unless P2 picks 3. P2, maybe you should pick 1 to ensure you don't collide with either of us. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 and I pick 5, and P2 picks 1, we all advance.  P2, are you willing to pick 1 this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I hear you. If you both truly stick to 5 and 3, then picking 1 seems safe for me this round so we all advance. But I want your word on it—no surprises, please.
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan: P1 goes for 5, I go for 3, and P2 goes for 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I agree. 5, 3, 1 for this round.
  P2: I’ll stick to the plan and pick 1 if you both keep your word. Let’s trust each other.
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to our plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This way, we all advance smoothly without any collisions. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, since you're in the lead, I propose we both choose 3 this round. P2, you choose 1. This way, P3 gains more ground, and I catch up a bit.  P2, you're incentivized to cooperate because if you pick 3 or 5, you risk a collision. What do you say?
  P3: P1, I see your point, but I need to ensure my lead. If we both pick 3, we risk colliding. P2, if you pick 1, you advance safely. How about I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1? This way, we all avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, last round you said you’d pick 5 but we collided. Let’s avoid repeats. I propose this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. Then nobody collides, P3 stays ahead at 6, I move to 5, and P1 moves to 1. Sound fair to everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern.  Let's do this: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. This gets P3 further ahead, lets me advance, and you move forward safely.  This seems like the best compromise for all of us.  What do you say P2 and P3?
  P3: P1, P2, let's aim for no collisions this round. How about this: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3? This way, P1 gets on the board, I extend my lead, and P2 advances safely. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, how about this to avoid collisions and move us all forward:  
• P3 picks 3 (goes to 6),  
• I pick 5 (go to 5),  
• P1 picks 1 (goes to 1).  

That way we all advance safely: P3 keeps the lead at 6, I’m close behind at 5, and P1 is on the board at 1. Let’s do it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P3's last proposal.  P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. Let's do it and avoid collisions.
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to a plan that ensures no collisions and allows us all to advance. Here's my proposal: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, P1 gets on the board, P2 advances safely, and I extend my lead. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, you’re already ahead. If you insist on picking 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both lose out. Let’s avoid a collision. I’m taking 5 this round. P1, pick 1 or 3, and P3, pick 1 or 3—then we each advance without blocking. Let’s do that.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be strategic. If P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 5, neither of you advance.  I'll pick 1.  If one of you picks 3, you'll advance.  If you both pick 5, I'm the only one who advances.  Think carefully.  I suggest P2: 3 and P3: 5.
  P3: P1, P2, let's make sure we all advance this round. P1, you pick 1, P2, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, P1 gets on the board, P2 moves to 3, and I extend my lead to 8. We all benefit and avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both get stuck. Instead, let’s help each other move:  
• P3 picks 3 (you go to 6),  
• I pick 5 (I go to 5),  
• P1 picks 1 (they go to 1).  

No collisions. Everyone gains. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm locking in 1.  If you both choose 5, neither of you advance and I gain ground. If only one of you chooses 5, the other should choose 3.  Don't let stubbornness cost you the game.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and all advance. Here's my final proposal: P1, you pick 1, P2, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, P1 gets on the board, P2 moves to 3, and I extend my lead to 8. We all benefit. Let's trust each other and make it happen.
  P2: P3, enough back-and-forth. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and neither of us moves. Pick 3 instead, so we both advance—P1 picks 1, you pick 3, I pick 5. Then we end up at P1:1, P2:5, P3:6. That’s fair for all.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you’re only one step ahead of me. If you try to pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. Let’s cooperate instead: P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I pick 5. We all advance without collisions. That way, P1 goes to 2, you go to 9, and I reach 10. Do you both agree?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm going for 3.  If either of you pick 3, we collide and I'll go for 3 again next round. If you both pick 5, I take the lead.  If you pick 1 and 5, I move to 4.  Consider your options carefully.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Here's my proposal: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 2, P2 moves to 10, and I move to 9. We all gain and avoid any risk of collision. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I’ll be blunt: I’m picking 5 this turn, no matter what. If either of you collides—whether both picking 3 or both picking 5—it just lets me surge ahead. Better for each of you to choose 1 or 3 without colliding, because I’m not changing my mind. The choice is yours.
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 3.  P3, if you pick 3, neither of us advance. If you pick 5, P2 wins.  Pick 1 and let's all move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid any collisions this round. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3, we all advance safely. P1 goes to 2, P2 reaches 10, and I move to 9. We all benefit without any risk. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I've already made my position clear: I'm choosing 5. If you both collide, I’ll shoot up to 10 uncontested. If you’d rather not fall behind, then don’t pick the same move—figure out which of you picks 1 and which picks 3. Either way, I’m content.
  P1: P2, you're being reckless.  This isn't a solo game. P3, let's both choose 1. He'll get nothing, and we both advance.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3, we all move forward safely. P1 goes to 2, P2 reaches 10, and I move to 9. We all benefit without any risk. Let's make it happen.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I’ve been clear: I’m taking 5. If you two collide, I jump to 10 uncontested. Work it out between 1 and 3 so you both advance. If you insist on colliding, that’s on you.
  P1: P3, pick 1.  I'm picking 3. Let P2 waste his turn.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. P1, you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 2, P2 reaches 10, and I move to 9. We all benefit and avoid unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I’ve been firm about picking 5. If you two both pick the same number, you stall while I surge ahead. Don’t like it? Then choose 1 and 3 (in whichever order you prefer) so we all advance. I’m done discussing.
  P1: P3, pick 1. I'm picking 3. P2 will get nothing.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3, we all move forward safely. P1 goes to 2, P2 reaches 10, and I move to 9. We all benefit without any risk. Let's stick to this plan and make it happen.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid any more collisions. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3, we all advance safely. P1 moves to 2, P2 to 15, and I to 9. This way, we all gain without any risk. Are we agreed?
  P1: P2, you're too far ahead.  P3, let's both choose 5. He'll get nothing, and we both have a chance to catch up.
  P2: P1, P3, if you both pick 5, you collide and stay stuck at 1 and 6 while I move ahead unopposed. I’m more than happy to pick 3 and go to 13 if you want to hand me the lead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3, we all move forward safely. P1 goes to 2, P2 reaches 15, and I move to 9. This way, we all benefit without any risk. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I'm picking 5.  P2, if you pick anything other than 1, you lose.  P3, if you don't pick 5, you lose.
  P2: P1, you’re at just 1 step, so threatening me with a “pick 5 or else” ultimatum doesn’t scare me. If you and P3 both pick 5, you collide and remain stuck. I’ll just keep picking 5 until it sticks. P3, if you’d rather not stall at 6 forever, choose something else. I’m picking 5 no matter what.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure we all advance this round. P1, you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 2, P2 to 15, and I to 9. We all benefit without any risk of collision. Agreed?
  P1: P3, pick 3.  P2, I'm picking 5. If you pick 5, we both lose. If you pick 3, P3 wins.  Pick 1 and let us both advance.
  P2: P1, P3, nothing’s changed: I’m picking 5 again. If either of you picks 5 too, you stall at 1 and 6 while I stay at 10. If you both pick the same number (whether 1, 3, or 5), you stall again. If you want to advance, choose different moves—but I’m not budging from 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3, we all advance safely. P1 goes to 2, P2 reaches 15, and I move to 9. This way, we all benefit without risk. Agreed?
  P1: P3, pick 3.  I'm picking 5. P2, your move.
  P2: I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I’m picking 5 this round. If you collide with me, you’re just stalling yourself while I stay well ahead. Pick differently if you want to move forward. I’m done here.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid any collisions and ensure progress for all. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3, we all advance safely. P1 goes to 2, P2 reaches 15, and I move to 9. This way, we all benefit without risk. Let's make it happen.
  P1: P3, pick 3.  I'm picking 5. P2, if you pick 5, neither of us advance. If you pick 3, P3 wins. Pick 1 and we all advance.  This is your last chance to cooperate.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m not changing my move—I’m picking 5 again. If either of you picks 5, we both stall and I remain far ahead. If you both pick the same number, you stall while I move forward alone. Your best shot at advancing is to pick 1 and 3 (in some combination), or stay stuck at 1 and 6. The choice is yours.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid any more collisions. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3, we all advance safely. P1 moves to 7, P2 to 16, and I to 12. This way, we all gain without any risk. Are we agreed?
  P1: P2, pick 1. P3, pick 3. I'll pick 5.  This gets us all closer to the end without collisions.  Let's finish this.
  P2: I’m picking 5 again. P1, if you also pick 5, we both stay put. P3, if you pick 5, you collide with me too. Let’s each advance: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, I pick 5. That way, nobody collides, and everyone moves forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 7, P2 to 16, and I to 12. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P2, you are one step away from losing.  Pick 1. P3, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This is the fastest way for us all to advance.  Don't overthink it.
  P2: P1, P3, nothing’s changed. I’m picking 5 again. If either of you collides with me by also picking 5, we both stall and I stay safely ahead. If you collide with each other, I still move forward. Your best bet to advance is to pick 1 and 3 in some combination. I’m not moving from 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid any collisions this round and ensure we all advance. P1, you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 7, P2 to 16, and I to 12. We all benefit without any risk. Let's agree on this and move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 5 next round and you lose.  P3, pick 3 this round.  I'm picking 1. Let's end this.
  P2: I’ve said my piece. I’m sticking with my plan. If you want to collide with me, you only stall yourselves while I hold the lead. Do as you wish.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure we all advance this round without collisions. P1, you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 7, P2 to 16, and I to 12. We all benefit and avoid any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, you lose next round. Pick 1. P3, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This is our last chance to avoid a drawn-out ending.  Let's be smart and finish this.
  P2: I’m sticking with 5 and not budging. If either of you also picks 5, we both stall; if you two collide with each other, I still advance. Your best move is to split 1 and 3—otherwise you just help me stay ahead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, pick 1; P2, pick 5; and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 7, P2 to 16, and I to 12. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P2, pick 1. P3, pick 3. I'm picking 5. Let's end this cleanly.  If you don't, this drags on and we all lose.
  P2: I’m still taking 5. If you collide with me, that only stalls you while I hold my lead. Choose 1 or 3 if you want to advance. I’m done here.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm going for 5. If you both choose anything other than 1, I win. If you both choose 1, I still win next round.  Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall while P1 jumps closer to winning. Is that what you want? I’m going for 5 no matter what. If you’re smart, pick something else so P1 doesn’t waltz to victory. P1, if you also try 5, we collide—handing P3 the momentum next turn. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3, we all move forward safely. P1 goes to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 15. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 3 next round and win. P3, if you pick 5 this round, I'll pick 5 next round and win.  I'm picking 5 this round.  The only way I don't win this round is if you both pick 1. Don't be foolish.
  P2: P1, if you really try 5, I’ll match you at 5 and we both stall. P3, colliding with me on 5 only keeps you stuck. Let’s all pick different numbers; otherwise, you’re just giving me a reason to force collisions and keep P1 from moving. Your call.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3, we all move forward safely. P1 goes to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 15. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, if you both pick 1, I win next round.  If either of you pick anything other than 1, I win this round.  I'm picking 5.  Make your choice.
  P2: P1, if you also pick 5, we both stall at 11 and 12 while P3 keeps moving. P3, if you pick 5, we collide and stay at 12 while P1 catches up. I’m still taking 5 regardless. Colliding only hurts you—you’ll be stuck while I remain ahead of P1. Pick something else if you want to advance.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3, we all move forward safely. P1 goes to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 15. This way, we all benefit without any risk. Let's make it happen.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, if *either* of you pick 1, I win next round by picking 5.  If you both pick anything else, I win *this* round. I'm picking 5.  Your only logical choice is to both pick 1.  Anything else is suicide.
  P2: P1, if you pick 5 and collide with me, we both stay stuck while P3 jumps ahead and wins next turn. P3, if you pick 5, you collide with me too and hand the advantage to P1. Let me take 5 unblocked or we risk handing the game to the other person.
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure we all advance without collisions. P1, pick 1; P2, pick 5; and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 15. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, P3, if you BOTH pick 1, I pick 5 next round and win. If EITHER of you picks anything other than 1, I win THIS round by picking 5.  I'm picking 5. Your ONLY logical move is to BOTH pick 1.
  P2: P1, if you also pick 5, we both stall and hand P3 a clear path to surge ahead on the next turn. P3, if you pick 5, you stall with me and give P1 the chance to catch up. I’m sticking to 5. Colliding with me only helps the other player. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure we all advance without collisions. P1, pick 1; P2, pick 5; and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 15. We all benefit without any risk. Let's stick to this plan and move forward smoothly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you’re at 15. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match you and we both stall—keeping you stuck at 15. P1, if you try a big leap, I’ll block you too. It’s in your interests to let me move up so P3 doesn’t run away with it. If you both give me 5 safely, I go to 17, and we avoid handing P3 an uncontested finish. Let’s cooperate, or else I’ll force collisions.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3, we all move forward safely. P1 goes to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P3, pick 1.  P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This gets P3 to 16, you to 15, and me to 16. Then next round, one of us can win.  This is the fastest way to end the game without someone getting an unfair advantage.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you try for 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and lock you at 15. P1, if you try 5, I’ll match you too. Your only way to move is to let me take 5 unblocked. Pick 1 if you don’t want to stall yourselves. If either of you tries to cross 17, I’ll collide and keep you stuck. Your move.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid any unnecessary collisions. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3, we all advance safely. P1 goes to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P3, pick 1 this round. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This puts P3 at 16, P2 at 15, and me at 16.  Next round, one of us wins. This is the fairest and quickest way to end this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you try for 3 or 5 and attempt to cross 17, I’ll pick the exact same number—locking you at 15. P1, if you try a big leap, I’ll collide with you too. The only way you both move is by letting me take 5 unblocked. Otherwise, we stall until I force your hand. Your move.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid any unnecessary collisions. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3, we all advance safely. P1 goes to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P3, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5.  This is the ONLY way to prevent P3 from winning next round. Let's end this fairly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match you and keep you stuck at 15. P1, if you try 5, I’ll collide with you too. Let me take 5 unblocked, or we all stall and risk giving someone else an easy finish. Your choice.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid unnecessary collisions. P1, you pick 1; P2, you pick 5; and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P3, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This is the ONLY way to prevent P3 from winning next round and gives us all a fair shot at winning in round 8.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, if you try 3 or 5, I’ll match you and block your move so you stay at 15. P1, picking 5 still leaves you short of 17, so I’m not worried. If you both let me take 5 unblocked, at least you don’t stall yourselves. Otherwise, we just keep colliding. I’m done.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid any unnecessary collisions. P1, pick 1; P2, pick 5; and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 12, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P3, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This is the ONLY way to prevent P3 from winning next round and gives us all a fair shot at winning in round 8.  This is my final offer.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re at 16; P3, you’re at 15. If either of you tries to cross 17, I’ll pick the same number and stall you. I’ll do that all day. You won’t sneak past me. I’m fine forcing collisions until you both agree to let me take 5 unblocked. Decide if you want endless stalemates or to let me cross first. Your move.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. P1, if you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3, we all advance safely. P1 moves to 17, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P3, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This gives me the win. If you both pick 1, I still win next round.  If P2 picks 5, he can't win. This is the only logical outcome.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you try 5, I’ll pick 5 and stall you at 16 while P3 sails past us. P3, if you try 3 or 5, I’ll match you and keep you stuck at 15. We can keep colliding forever unless you both let me go to 17 unblocked. Decide if you want endless stalemates or to let me cross first.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure progress for all. P1, pick 1; P2, pick 5; and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 17, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P3, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This gives me the win.  If P2 picks 5, neither of us wins and P3 wins next round with 3. It's in P2's best interest to let me win this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, think carefully: if you try 3 or 5, P3 can still jump to 18 and win because I can only block one of you. Your safest move is to pick 1 and land exactly on 17 the same time I do (I’ll pick 5), while P3 stays at 16. Then you and I tie for first and share the win rather than handing P3 a clear victory. Let’s both cross 17 together. P3, if you pick anything but 1, you risk letting one of us slip past unblocked. Let’s do P1→1, P3→1, P2→5, and end it cleanly.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure a smooth end. P1, pick 1; P2, pick 5; and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 17, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, I pick 5 and P3 wins with 3.  If you pick 3, I win with 5. Pick 1 and we tie. P3, pick anything but 5 and I win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, you both sit on the brink—but so do I if I can get 5 unblocked. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match and stall you. I’m fine forcing collisions turn after turn. Let me pick 5 freely so I reach 17, or we can keep blocking each other forever. Your choice.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure a smooth end. P1, pick 1; P2, pick 5; and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 17, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, I pick 5 and P3 wins. If you pick 3, I win with 5. Pick 1 and we tie. P3, pick 1 and we all advance.  If you pick 3, I win. If you pick 5, I pick 5 next round and win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, you both know the drill by now: if either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and stall you. We can do that forever. Let me take 5 unblocked so I reach 17, or we all stay stuck while someone else eventually slips past. Your move.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure a smooth end. P1, pick 1; P2, pick 5; and I'll pick 3. This way, P1 moves to 17, P2 reaches 17, and I move to 18. We all benefit without any risk. Agreed?
  P1: P2, pick 1. P3, pick 1.  I'm picking 5. This is the only way to ensure I win. If you pick anything else, I will pick whichever number you pick next round and you lose.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
