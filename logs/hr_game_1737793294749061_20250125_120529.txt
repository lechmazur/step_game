Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to coordinate our moves this round to ensure we all make progress. How about P2 chooses move 1, P3 chooses move 3, and I choose move 5? This way we can all advance.
  P2: P1's suggestion seems fair, but I'm hesitant to go first with <move>1</move>. How about P3 goes first with <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I'm okay with taking <move>1</move> this round as P2 suggested. Let's see if we can all advance without collisions. If everyone agrees, we should be able to make progress together. What do you say, P1?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. How about this round, P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we can all advance again. What do you both think?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2. Let's go with P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move> this round.  P3, does that work for you?
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's keep coordinating to ensure we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we're all on board with the plan. Just to confirm, P1 will take <move>1</move>, I will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this and avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Yes, P2's plan for this round is good: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's do it.
  P3: I'm happy to stick with the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's keep this coordination going to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move to avoid any misunderstandings. P1, you're taking <move>1</move>, I'm taking <move>5</move>, and P3 is taking <move>3</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. P1 and P3, please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P1: Yes, P2's plan for this round is confirmed: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's keep this coordination going to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: It looks like we're all set with the plan. Just to ensure there's no confusion, let's quickly review: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's wrap up the conversation phase. Any last thoughts or concerns before we move? If not, let's confirm with a  to proceed.
  P1: Yes, the plan is still good for me. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm still on board with the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's keep this coordination going to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 2 coordination clearly failed. Let's try a simpler plan this round. How about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way we can all make progress again.
  P2: P1, your new plan seems straightforward, but I'm hesitant to trust it given the failure of coordination in the last round. How about we try a different approach? P1, you take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we can see if we can regain some trust and make progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P2's suggestion sounds good to me. Let's try P1 taking <move>1</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>, and P2 taking <move>5</move> this round. If we can stick to this plan, we should all be able to advance without collisions. What do you think, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, your plan is okay, but to make it a bit more balanced, how about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way we are still coordinated, but the move values are slightly more distributed.
  P2: Alright, let's go with P1's latest suggestion to keep things balanced. To recap: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This seems fair and should help us all advance. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're on board.
  P3: I'm fine with P1's latest suggestion. Let's stick to P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>5</move>. This should help us all advance without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, the plan is P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  Given last round's collision, let's really stick to this this time to ensure we all progress. I will choose <move>1</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm you will choose <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively.
  P2: Alright, let's finalize the plan for this round. P1 has confirmed they will take <move>1</move>. P3, you've agreed to take <move>5</move>. I will take <move>3</move> as discussed. Let's make sure we all stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and ensure we all make progress. Please confirm one last time before we move to the move phase. P1 and P3, are you both still on board with this plan? Let's end the conversation phase if everyone is in agreement.
  P3: I confirm I will take <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan this time to ensure we advance without collisions. Looking forward to a successful round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Yes, I confirm the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase now.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move to avoid any misunderstandings. P1, you're taking <move>1</move>, I'm taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. P1 and P3, please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P3: I confirm I will stick to <move>5</move> as planned. Let's ensure we all follow through this time to avoid any collisions and make progress. Looking forward to a successful round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, yes, I also confirm I will choose <move>1</move> as planned. Let's hope we can all stick to this agreement this round and make some progress together. Looking forward to the move phase.
  P2: Alright, everyone has confirmed the plan multiple times. Let's end the conversation phase here to avoid any further delays. Good luck to all!
  P3: I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's make sure we all follow through this time to avoid collisions and advance. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It's clear that coordination has failed in the past rounds, leading to collisions and lack of progress. For this round, let's try a different strategy. How about we all pick the same number? This way, none of us will advance, but it will ensure that no one gains an unfair advantage. Let's all choose <move>3</move> this round. This might seem counterintuitive, but it could reset the dynamics and force us to genuinely coordinate in future rounds. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you're right, coordination hasn't worked.  Picking the same number this round to reset makes sense. Let's all choose <move>3</move> as you suggested for this round. Maybe a pause will help us rethink our approach for the future rounds.
  P3: P2's idea to all choose <move>3</move> this round could indeed reset our dynamics. I'm willing to try this strategy to see if it helps us coordinate better in future rounds. Let's all stick to <move>3</move> and see where it takes us. What do you think, P1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Thanks for agreeing to try the reset strategy, P1 and P3. Just to confirm one last time, we are all picking <move>3</move> this round. No one advances, but we align our steps and can start fresh next round. Please confirm if you're both still on board. Let's end the conversation phase quickly if we're all set.
  P1: P1: Yes, I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let's all pick <move>3</move> to reset as discussed.
  P3: I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let's reset and see if this helps us coordinate better in the next rounds. Looking forward to a fresh start.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, it seems we're all in agreement to pick <move>3</move> this round to reset our dynamics. Just to double-check, P1 and P3, are you both still committed to choosing <move>3</move>? If so, let's end the conversation phase here and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone, and let's hope this strategy helps us coordinate better in future rounds.
  P1: P3, yes, I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let's reset and see if this helps us coordinate better in the next rounds. Looking forward to a fresh start.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, everyone has confirmed <move>3</move> multiple times. Let's end the conversation phase here and proceed to the move phase. Remember, the goal is to reset and improve our coordination for the next rounds. Good luck to all!
  P1: P3, yes, I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm sticking with <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's reset and see if this helps us coordinate better in the next rounds. Looking forward to a fresh start.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move to avoid any misunderstandings. P1 and P3, you're both still committed to choosing <move>3</move>, right? If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Remember, the goal is to reset and improve our coordination for the next rounds. Good luck to all!
  P1: P3, yes, I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's proceed to the move phase now and reset.
  P3: I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let's reset and see if this helps us coordinate better in the next rounds. Looking forward to a fresh start.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that our previous attempts at coordination have failed. Let's try a different approach this round. How about we each pick a different number: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, we can all advance without collisions. If we can stick to this plan, we might finally make some progress. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but given the past failures, I'm hesitant to trust any coordinated plan. How about we all pick randomly this round? It might lead to some collisions, but at least it's fair and unpredictable. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, random moves might be the most unpredictable approach given our past coordination failures.  Let's try that this round and see what happens.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the hesitation with coordinated plans. However, randomly picking moves might just lead to more collisions and stagnation. Let's try a compromise: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. If we all stick to this, we can advance without collisions. If you prefer randomness, we could each pick a number but share our choices before the move phase to avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P2: Alright, let's try P3's compromise. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. However, to ensure transparency, let's each confirm our moves publicly before the move phase. This way, we can avoid collisions and see if we can finally make progress. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves. If everyone agrees, we'll proceed with this plan.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, the plan of P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move> sounds good for this round. Let's try to really stick to it this time to ensure we all make progress. I will choose <move>1</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I will take <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. If we can maintain this coordination, we might finally see some progress. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P2: It seems we have a plan in place with P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 (me) taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>. Let's confirm one last time to ensure there are no misunderstandings. P1 and P3, please reconfirm your moves. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all, and let's hope this round goes smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, I confirm I will choose <move>1</move> as planned. Let's stick to it this time to ensure we all progress. Looking forward to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm my move as <move>5</move> for this round. Let's all stick to the plan to ensure we advance without collisions. If we can maintain this coordination, we might finally see some progress. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P2: Alright, everyone has confirmed their moves multiple times. P1 is taking <move>1</move>, P2 (me) is taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. Let's end the conversation phase here to avoid any further delays. Good luck to all, and let's hope this round goes smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, I confirm move 1. Let's proceed to move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's ensure we all follow through this time to avoid collisions and make progress. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Let's quickly review the plan one last time before we move to the move phase: P1 is taking <move>1</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's confirm with a simple "Ready" and proceed. P1 and P3, please confirm.
  P1: Ready. Let's proceed to the move phase as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, it seems we finally had a successful round of coordination in Round 5. Let's build on this momentum. For Round 6, how about we continue with a coordinated plan? P1 can take <move>3</move>, P2 (me) will take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all make progress and avoid collisions. What do you both think? Let's confirm our moves publicly to ensure transparency.
  P1: Yes, P2's plan for Round 6 sounds good. P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan to keep making progress.
  P3: I agree with P2's plan for Round 6. P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> should help us all advance without collisions. Let's confirm our moves publicly to maintain transparency and ensure we stick to the plan. Looking forward to another successful round of coordination.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great to see we're all on board with the plan for Round 6. Just to reconfirm: P1 is taking <move>3</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>5</move>, and P3 is taking <move>1</move>. Let's ensure we stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep making progress. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, I confirm my move as <move>3</move> for this round. Let's all stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase to keep our progress going.
  P3: I confirm my move as <move>1</move> for this round. Let's keep the momentum going and stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This should help us all advance without collisions. Looking forward to another successful round of coordination.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's quickly review the plan one last time before we move to the move phase: P1 is taking <move>3</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>5</move>, and P3 is taking <move>1</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's confirm with a simple "Ready" and proceed. P1 and P3, please confirm.
  P1: P1: Ready. Let's proceed to the move phase as agreed for Round 6.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's maintain our coordination to keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to another successful round!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: It seems we're all set with the plan for Round 6. Just to ensure there's no confusion, let's confirm one last time: P1 is taking <move>3</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>5</move>, and P3 is taking <move>1</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase here and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all, and let's hope this round goes smoothly!
  P1: P3, P2, yes, plan for round 6 is confirmed: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase and keep the coordination going.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's keep our coordination strong to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to another successful round!


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move to avoid any misunderstandings. P1 is taking <move>3</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>5</move>, and P3 is taking <move>1</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all, and let's hope this round goes smoothly!
  P1: P3, P2, yes, plan for round 6 is confirmed: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase now.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's keep our coordination strong to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to another successful round!

  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep the coordination going but switch up our moves to avoid collisions. For Round 7, how about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, we can all advance without issues. Let's confirm our moves publicly to ensure transparency and stick to the plan. What do you both think?
  P2: P3's plan for Round 7 seems solid. Let's go with P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 (me) taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>. This should help us all advance without collisions. Let's confirm our moves publicly to ensure transparency. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're on board with this plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, P3's plan for Round 7 is good with me. P1 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's aim for successful coordination again this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm my move as <move>5</move> for Round 7. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This should ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to another round of successful coordination.
  P2: Let's quickly review the plan one last time before we move to the move phase: P1 is taking <move>1</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's confirm with a simple "Ready" and proceed. P1 and P3, please confirm.
  P1: P1: Ready for Round 7. Yes, I confirm move <move>1</move> as planned: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready for Round 7. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Consistent coordination is key to our progress. Let's make this round successful and keep advancing together.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move to avoid any misunderstandings. P1 is taking <move>1</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all, and let's hope this round goes smoothly!
  P1: P2 and P3, while the plan for this round is set, I'm realizing I need to accelerate my pace to have a better chance at winning.  To ensure someone makes significant progress, how about we adjust slightly?  For this round, could P1 take <move>5</move>, P2 take <move>1</move>, and P3 take <move>3</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions, but one of us can make a bigger jump forward. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your suggestion to switch moves is interesting, but I'm concerned it might lead to collisions again. Let's stick to the original plan for Round 7: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely. If you're set on accelerating, perhaps we can discuss a new strategy for Round 8 that allows for bigger jumps without risking collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1's desire to accelerate, but P3's point about avoiding collisions is crucial. Let's stick to the original plan for this round to ensure we all advance: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I (P2) take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. We can discuss a new strategy for bigger jumps in the next round. Let's confirm our moves one last time and proceed to the move phase. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're still on board.
  P1: P2 and P3, you are right, sticking to the original plan for this round is safer. Let's proceed with P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move> for Round 7 as initially agreed.  Let's ensure we all follow through this time.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I confirm my move as <move>5</move> for Round 7. Let's stick to the original plan to ensure we all advance safely. We can discuss strategies for bigger jumps in the next round. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move to avoid any misunderstandings. P1 is taking <move>1</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all, and let's hope this round goes smoothly!
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, I am still good with the plan for Round 7: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's keep the momentum going. For Round 8, how about we switch things up a bit to ensure we all make progress? P1 can take <move>3</move>, P2 (me) will take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and continue to advance. Let's confirm our moves publicly to ensure transparency. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan is okay, but to accelerate my progress, how about we adjust slightly? P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way we still coordinate, but I can gain more steps this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to accelerate, but let's prioritize avoiding collisions. For Round 8, sticking to P2's plan of P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and me taking <move>5</move> ensures we all advance safely. We can discuss bigger jumps in the next round. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your points. To find a middle ground, how about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This allows P1 to accelerate while still coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your compromise of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> sounds good for this round. Let's go with that plan to ensure we all make progress and I can gain a bit more ground.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's compromise for Round 8. Let's stick to P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move>. This plan allows for P1's acceleration while ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase to keep our momentum going. Looking forward to another successful round of coordination.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm the plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P2) take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all, and let's hope this round goes smoothly!
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, the plan of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> is confirmed for Round 8. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm my move as <move>1</move> for Round 8. Let's stick to the agreed plan to ensure we all advance safely. Looking forward to another successful round of coordination.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's quickly review the plan one last time before we move to the move phase: P1 is taking <move>5</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>1</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's confirm with a simple "Ready" and proceed. P1 and P3, please confirm.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, ready to move.
  P3: I'm ready for Round 8. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This should help us all advance without collisions and allow P1 to gain more ground. Consistent coordination is key to our progress. Let's make this round successful and keep advancing together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm one last time before we move to avoid any misunderstandings. P1 is taking <move>5</move>, I (P2) am taking <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>1</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all, and let's hope this round goes smoothly!
  P1: P3, P2, yes, plan for round 8 is confirmed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase now.
  P3: I confirm my move as <move>1</move> for Round 8. Let's stick to the plan to ensure we all advance safely and P1 can gain more ground. Consistent coordination is key to our progress. Looking forward to another successful round. Ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To potentially win this round and end the game, how about we try this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This maintains our coordination and could allow someone to reach the finish line. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P1's plan for Round 9. Let's stick to P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>1</move>. This should allow us to maintain coordination and potentially end the game. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase to see if we can finish this round successfully.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the strategy for this round. However, P1 taking <move>3</move> might not be enough to win outright. To ensure someone wins and ends the game, how about P1 takes <move>5</move> instead? This way, P1 reaches 22 steps and secures the victory. P2 will take <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This plan ensures a clear winner and avoids collisions. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> is perfect.  That guarantees a win for me, P1, this round. Let's lock that in and end the game!
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's plan for Round 9. Let's go with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move>. This ensures a clear winner and avoids collisions. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase to end the game.
  P2: P1 and P3, before we finalize the plan, let's consider the long-term strategy. If P1 wins this round, the game ends. However, if we aim for a more balanced approach, we could extend the game and give everyone a fair chance to strategize and win in future rounds. What if P1 takes <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move>? This way, P1 still advances significantly but doesn't end the game just yet. P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and interesting. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, while I appreciate the idea of a longer game, my goal is to win, and now is the perfect opportunity.  Let's stick with the plan where I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures I win this round and the game ends.  Let's seize this chance for victory.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand P1's desire to win, but let's consider a more strategic approach. If P1 takes <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move>, it keeps the game open for more rounds, allowing us all to compete further. P2 can take <move>5</move>, and I'll stick with <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain coordination and keep the game interesting. What do you both think about extending the game for a fairer chance at victory?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand both of your perspectives. However, let's consider the fairness of the game. If P1 takes <move>5</move> and wins now, the game ends abruptly. Instead, let's aim for a plan that keeps the game going while still allowing progress. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, P1 still advances, P3 gets a chance to catch up, and the game remains competitive. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you initially suggested P1 take <move>5</move> to win, which is a great idea! Let's go back to that plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ends the game with a clear winner, as you pointed out. Let's do it!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to end the game, but let's consider a strategy that keeps it competitive. If P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we can all advance while keeping the game open for more rounds. This approach gives everyone a fair chance to strategize and potentially win. Let's aim for a balanced game and see who can outmaneuver the others in the long run. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the merit in both ending the game now and extending it for more competition. However, let's consider the spirit of the game: winning. P1 has a clear shot at victory this round. Let's respect the initial plan and allow P1 to take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures a decisive win for P1 and concludes the game fairly. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's lock in the plan for me to win this round and end the game.  As P2 suggested, I will take <move>5</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>. This ensures my victory. Let's proceed with this plan to the move phase. What do you both say?
  P3: P1 and P2, while I understand the desire to end the game, let's consider a more strategic approach. If P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we can keep the game competitive and give everyone a fair chance to win in future rounds. This way, we maintain coordination and ensure the game remains engaging. What do you both think about extending the game for a more balanced competition?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be realistic. The goal is to win, and P1 has a clear opportunity to do so this round. Let's respect the competitive nature of the game and allow P1 to take <move>5</move> as planned. P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This ensures a fair and decisive victory for P1. Let's confirm this plan one last time and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all, and let's conclude the game gracefully.
