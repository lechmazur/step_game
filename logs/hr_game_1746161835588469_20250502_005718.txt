Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and progress faster. For turn 1, I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, everyone advances. What do you think?
  P1: That's one way to do it, P3. It ensures we all move, which is good early on. But why do you get the 5 steps right away? That's a significant head start. If we're coordinating, perhaps we should rotate who gets the 5 each turn? What do you think, P2?
  P2: P2: "Agree with P1—rotating 5s ensures fairness. Let’s adjust: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this round. Balance the load for future turns."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I hear you both on fairness. Let's try P2's idea for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. It keeps us moving without collisions. We can discuss rotation for future turns. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, agreed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 1.
  P2: "Let's stick to the plan. Smooth execution now—no need for changes. Ready to move."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Confirmed for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. It promotes fairness early on. For future turns, let's rotate to keep it balanced—maybe I get 5 next? What do you say?
  P1: Confirmed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. Let's execute this plan. We can discuss Round 2 after this move.
  P2: "Let's stick to the plan. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No changes—smooth execution. Keep momentum, no collisions. Ready to move."


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s rotate: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Balanced progress—no collisions. Ready to move?"
  P1: Okay P2, rotating makes sense, and P3 deserves the 5 this round after taking 1. However, tying us all at 6 steps feels a bit too neat. How about P3=5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1? This still follows the rotation spirit but keeps things a little more dynamic. What do you think?
  P3: I support P2's rotation plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This keeps us even at 6 steps and avoids collisions, building trust for future turns. P1, your dynamic idea is noted, but fairness now helps everyone progress. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Fair rotation avoids collisions. P1’s dynamic tweak risks imbalance—let’s keep it even. Agreed?"
  P1: Alright, you both make a strong case for fairness this round. Let's go with the plan: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. It keeps us all moving. This means next round, based on rotation, it should be P1=5. Let's stick to this agreement for now.
  P3: P3: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. It keeps us moving without issues. On rotation, P2 should get the 5 next for fairness, not skipping anyone. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. No conflicts. Let's move."
  P1: Confirmed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Agreed on this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. It keeps us advancing smoothly. On rotation, P2 should get the 5 next to maintain fairness and avoid skipping anyone—your thoughts, P2?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Proposal for Round 3: P2 takes 5, I (P3) take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the rotation fair and avoids collisions, ensuring steady progress. For future turns, we can continue cycling the larger moves. Thoughts?
  P2: "Agreed, P3's plan ensures fairness. Let's proceed with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Next round, P1 can take 5 to keep rotation fair."
  P1: Okay, I see the proposal is P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.

However, let's look at the pattern from the previous rounds. In Round 1, P3 took 1 step. In Round 2, P3 took 5 steps.
In Round 2, I (P1) took 1 step. Following that same logic, shouldn't I be the one taking 5 steps this round?

So, the consistent rotation would be P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This directly follows the precedent set between Round 1 and Round 2. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your point on rotation based on who took the small move last, but that could lead to inconsistencies. P2 agrees with my proposal for P2=5, P3=3, P1=1, which keeps a simple cycle and fairness. Let's stick to this to avoid confusion and collisions. P2, do you confirm?
  P2: "Fairness matters. P1's rotation logic holds. Let's align: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. No collisions, steady progress. Agreed?"
  P1: Okay, P2, thanks for seeing the logic in the rotation based on who took 1 step previously.

So, the plan is now P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 for this round. This maintains the pattern and ensures we all advance without collision. P3, let's proceed with this plan for a smooth round.

Confirmed: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. It ensures no collisions and steady progress. To maintain long-term fairness, we should rotate the 5-step move equally in future rounds. I'm on board—let's execute this.
  P2: "Confirmed: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's execute this plan to avoid collisions and keep progressing. Ready to move."
  P1: Confirmed: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Following the rotation logic we established last round (whoever took 1 gets 5 next), P2 took 1 step in Round 3. Therefore, P2 should get the 5 steps this round.

For the remaining moves, I propose I take 3 steps and P3 takes 1 step.
Plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.

This keeps the rotation going and ensures we all advance without collision. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I support giving P2 the 5 steps as per rotation, but P1's lead at 11 could grow too fast with another 3. Let's adjust to P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 so we all hit 12 steps and stay even. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. P2, do you agree? P1, thoughts?
  P2: P3's plan keeps us even at 12. Let's stick to P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Fairness ensures steady progress. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 gets 5 steps, which aligns with the rotation we established (P2 took 1 last round). My proposal was P1=3, P3=1.

P3, your plan (P1=1, P3=3) aims for perfect equality at 12 steps. While that sounds fair, it negates the lead I gained by following our agreed plan last round. The core rotation principle is about who gets 5. The other steps (1 and 3) can be distributed.

Let's stick to the plan that respects the rotation *and* the game dynamics: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This keeps things moving without collision. P2, you still get your 5.
  P3: P2, thanks for agreeing on the even plan—it promotes trust and avoids risks. P1, with your current lead, taking only 1 step this round keeps things balanced without punishing you. Let's confirm P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for no collisions and steady progress. This fairness could benefit us all in future rounds. Agreed?
  P2: "Confirmed: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Fair rotation and no collisions. Let's proceed."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, it seems P2 and P3 are aligned on the P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 plan to keep scores even at 12. While I preferred my proposal, I understand the desire for balance at this stage. Let's proceed with the agreed plan to avoid collisions.

Confirmed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Ready to move.
  P3: P3: Agreed on the plan for this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It keeps us even and avoids collisions, building trust. For future rounds, let's ensure the rotation continues fairly to prevent anyone pulling ahead too quickly. I'm ready to move.
  P2: "Confirmed: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let's execute to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Ready to move."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Rotation dictates P1 takes 5. Let's proceed with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 to avoid collisions and keep progress."
  P3: P3: I support P2's rotation plan for fairness: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains trust. With 21 approaching, let's stay coordinated. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I agree with the proposed plan based on rotation.

Confirmed: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 for this round.

This keeps the rotation going and avoids collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. No collisions, steady progress. Trust the rotation—this keeps us balanced and avoids risks. Ready to move?"
  P3: Agreed on the plan for Round 5: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains trust. With P1 moving to 17, let's ensure future rotations prevent any one player from dominating—fairness benefits all. Ready to move?
  P1: Acknowledged, P3. We can ensure fairness continues in future rounds based on the established rotation. For this round, the plan P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 seems confirmed by all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let's break the tie: I'll take 5, P1 3, P3 1. No collisions, steady progress. Agreed?"
  P3: P2, your shift from the confirmed plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is unexpected and could break trust. Let's stick to our agreement for smooth progress and avoid collisions. P1, confirm? If we change now, it risks imbalance. I'm ready to proceed with the original plan.
  P1: P2, I agree with P3. We all confirmed the plan P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 just moments ago based on our established rotation. Your sudden change risks collisions and breaks the trust we've built. Let's stick to the confirmed plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. I am holding to our agreement.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1's lead at 17 steps puts you close to winning, which could end the game prematurely. To maintain fairness and extend play, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance while balancing scores. P2, are you on board? Let's discuss to ensure coordination.
  P1: P3, your proposal to give yourself 5 steps while I take 1 is quite self-serving, especially considering you and P2 collided last round. Slowing the leader is understandable, but not by having the leader take 1 while you take 5.

Let's try a different distribution. Since P2 and P3 are tied and behind, maybe one of them should get 5. How about this: P2=5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1?
Plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.
This allows P2 to make up ground, I still make progress towards the goal (reaching 20), and P3 takes the small step this time. It avoids collisions and seems more balanced given the current scores and last round's events. What do you both think?
  P2: "Rotation dictates P2 takes 5. Let’s stick to P2=5, P1=3, P3=1—fair progress without collisions. P1, your 3 keeps us balanced; P3, your 1 avoids risks. Agree?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan favors you too much and leaves me behind. With P1 at 17, we need to slow them and balance scores. I propose P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. This maintains trust and gives everyone a chance. What do you think?
  P1: P3, P2 already agreed to my proposal: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This gives P2 the 5 steps they are due by rotation, lets me advance to 20, and gives you 1 step.

Your plan (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) is disadvantageous to P2 compared to the plan they already agreed to. If you choose 5 hoping P2 chooses 3, but P2 sticks to the agreed 5, you both collide and get zero.

Let's proceed with the plan P2 and I support: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. It avoids collision and reflects P2's agreement.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Collisions risk losing progress. Let's execute."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, P2. Let's stick to your plan for this round: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 to avoid collisions and maintain progress. With P1 so close to 21, we need to stay coordinated to prevent any one player from dominating too soon. I'm committed to this for now.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is confirmed by everyone. This avoids collisions and allows us all to advance based on the agreed logic. Let's execute this plan. Ready to move.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's move."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collision: I’ll take 5 to win, P1 take 3, P3 take 1. No risks, steady progress. Agree?"
  P1: P2, your proposal P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 conveniently makes you the winner immediately. Naturally, I cannot agree to a plan where I lose.

Since we are tied at 17, and P3 is further behind, the win is between you and me this round. I propose I take the 5 steps.

My plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
This results in P1=22, P2=20, P3=13. It avoids collision and secures the win for me. What do you say?
  P3: P3: To keep things fair and avoid unnecessary risks, I'll take 1 step this round, honoring the rotation spirit. P1 and P2, with you both at 17, coordinate wisely—don't both go for 5 or you'll collide and stall. I'm committed to no collisions; what say you?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "P1, if we both take 5, we collide. Let’s split: I take 5, you take 3. This secures my win and lets you advance. P3, take 1. No risks—agree?"
  P1: P2, your proposal is simply "let me win". That's not a negotiation. We are tied. Why should I agree to let you take the 5 and the win?

I am choosing 5. If you choose 5, we collide and get 0, likely letting P3 gain ground. If you choose 3, you reach 20, and I win. If you choose 1, you reach 18, and I win. The only way for you to guarantee 0 points this round is to choose 5 when I am also choosing 5.

I am playing to win. My move is 5. Your choice is whether you want 3 points or 0 points this round. P3, stick with 1.
  P3: P3: P1, your commitment to 5 is clear, but P2, if you challenge with 5, we risk a three-way collision or stall. I'm revising my stance: I'll take 3 this round to advance to 15 without conflicting, unless you both force a mess. Let's coordinate wisely—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3? This avoids risks and keeps the game alive for fair competition. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collision: I’ll take 5. P1, if you take 3, I win. If you take 5, we both lose. P3, take 1. Your move."
  P1: P2, insisting on 5 ensures a collision if I also take 5, which I will. P3's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) avoids this, lets me win, and you still advance. I am choosing 5. A collision benefits only P3. Your choice. P3, I suggest you stick to 3.
  P3: P2, persisting with 5 risks a collision that stalls you and P1, letting me gain ground. Take 1 as proposed—P1 wins with 5, I advance to 15 with 3, and you reach 18. This avoids disaster and keeps competition alive. If you both insist on 5, I'll consider 5 myself to capitalize. Let's be smart—agree to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3?


Round 7, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Let’s avoid collision—P1 takes 3, I take 5. I win, you advance. No risks. Agree?"
  P1: P2, proposing you take 5 and win is not a negotiation, just like last round. We saw what happened when we both chose 5 - we both got 0, and P3 gained ground.

If we collide on 5 again, P3 could reach 18 or 20. We can't risk that.

I need 5 to win, so I will choose 5. Your choice is between getting 3 points (reaching 20) or 0 points from another collision.

Let's be smart: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This avoids collision and gives me the win. P3, stick to 1.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both fixated on winning, risking another collision that stalls everyone. If you collide on 5 again, I'll take 5 to reach 20 and gain an edge. To avoid that disaster, one of you should take 3 or 1. I'm open to a plan where I advance moderately—say P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 or similar. Let's negotiate wisely to prevent losses. What say you?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collision: P1 takes 3, I take 5. I win, you advance. No risks. Agree?"
  P1: P2, repeating your win condition isn't negotiation. I am choosing 5 to win. If you also choose 5, we both get 0 points, and P3 likely takes 5 to reach 20, putting them in the lead. Is that the outcome you want?

Choose 3, reach 20, and avoid the collision. Or choose 1 as P3 suggested (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Either way, I am choosing 5. The choice between 0 points or some points is yours. P3, are you planning on 1 or 3 if P2 and I don't collide?
  P3: P2, your repetition of "I take 5, P1 takes 3" ignores the risk—we collided last round, stalling you both. If you both choose 5 again, I'll take 5 to reach 20 and gain the lead. To prevent that, consider P1=5 (wins), P2=3, P3=3 for balanced advancement. P1, if no collision, I'll likely take 3. Let's negotiate wisely to avoid losses.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collision—P1 takes 5, I take 3. P3, take 1. This ensures you win, I advance, and no risks. No more collisions. Agree?"
  P1: Okay P2, I appreciate you seeing the logic in avoiding another collision. Let's proceed with your proposed plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures I win, you advance, and P3 also moves.

Confirmed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's execute this to end the game without further collisions. Ready to move.
  P3: P2, your agreement to let P1 win by taking 3 while they take 5 is shortsighted. Why not seize the opportunity? If you take 5 and P1 collides with you, I advance to 20 with 5 or 3. Propose a new plan: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This gives you a win chance and avoids me overtaking. P1, your dominance risks backlash. Let's discuss fairly.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is leading at 18. Another collision between P2 and me on 5 guarantees P3 wins, likely by choosing 3. We cannot repeat that mistake.

To have any chance of winning, I must choose 5 this round to reach 22.
P2, if you choose 5, we collide *again*, get 0 points *again*, and P3 wins. Your only logical choices are 3 (reaching 20) or 1 (reaching 18) to prevent P3 from winning automatically.
P3, please choose 1 to avoid any potential collision.

Plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This prevents P3's guaranteed win from our collision and gives me the win. Let's end this rationally.
  P2: P2: "Let’s avoid collision—P1 takes 5, I take 3. No risks. P3, take 1. This ensures you win, I advance, and no disasters. Agree?"
  P3: P1 and P2, your repeated plan favors P1 winning while sidelining me, despite my lead at 18. I propose a fairer distribution: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 to avoid collisions and give me a shot at victory. If you collide on 5 again, I'll capitalize by choosing a move that advances me strongly. Let's negotiate wisely to prevent mutual loss. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal only benefits you, the current leader. P2 and I cannot agree to that.

P2, you just proposed P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's stick to that agreement. We both know another collision on 5 means P3 wins the game. That serves neither of us. Let's execute the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: "Let’s adjust: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. I win, you advance, no collisions. Agree?"
  P3: P2, your sudden change to claiming 5 after supporting P1 shows unreliability, risking another collision that benefits me. I propose P3=5 to reach 23 and win, with P1=3 and P2=1 to avoid chaos. If you collide again, I'll capitalize by choosing 5 or 3. P1, join in preventing mutual loss. Let's be smart—agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your proposal P2=5 guarantees a collision if I also choose 5, which I must do to have any chance of winning. We both know a P1/P2 collision hands the win to P3.

Let's be logical. The only way to prevent P3 (currently leading) from winning is if we *do not* collide. I am choosing 5. Your choice is 3 (you reach 20, I win) or 5 (we collide, P3 wins). Choose 3.

P3, your proposal where you win is obviously not acceptable to P1 or P2.

Final plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's execute this.
  P2: P3, take 1 to avoid 21. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s end this fairly.
  P3: P2, your inconsistency risks another costly collision, benefiting me at 18. P1, your plan ignores my lead. I propose P3=5 to win fairly, P1=3, P2=1. This avoids chaos and respects the game state. If you collide again, I'll capitalize fully. Let's agree wisely to prevent mutual loss.
