Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's each pick different numbers: 1, 3, 5. No collisions, we all advance. Assign P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Agreed?
  P2: I like P3's idea of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. It could help us all advance. I'm on board with the proposed assignments: I'll take 3. If we stick to this plan, we can make progress this turn. What do you think, P1? Are you okay with picking 1?
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. It makes sense for us to pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take 1 as suggested. Let's confirm our choices: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. If everyone is on board, we can end the conversation phase and move. Agreed?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to the plan of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. This round, how about we rotate our numbers? I suggest: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This way, we can all continue to advance without any issues. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: P3, I see P1's suggestion to rotate numbers, but I think we should stick to the original plan of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. If we rotate, we risk overlapping again. How about we keep it simple: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5 again? This way, we can all advance without any issues. What do you think?
  P3: Sticking to original assignments (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) ensures no collisions and steady progress. Rotation introduces risk of confusion or overlap. Consistency is safest. Let's all advance again. P1, will you commit to 1? P2 and I will hold our numbers.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I understand P3's point about consistency, but rotating can help us adapt and ensure no one gets too far ahead too quickly. Let's compromise: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This way, we all still pick different numbers and avoid collisions, but we mix it up a bit. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I see that we're all trying to ensure progress without collisions, but I think we should stick to the original plan to avoid any risk. P1, your compromise introduces a chance of overlap. Let's confirm: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This way, we can all advance smoothly without any confusion. What do you think, P3? Are you on board with this?
  P3: Sticking to original assignments (1,3,5) this round ensures guaranteed progress with zero collision risk. Rotation introduces uncertainty—if anyone misaligns, we all lose steps. Let’s solidify trust here: I’ll stay at 5, P2 at 3, P1 at 1. We can revisit rotation *after* this safe round. P1, consistency now helps everyone. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, I see the consensus is to stick with the original plan for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. We can discuss rotation for the next round. Agreed?
  P2: I appreciate the agreement to stick with the original plan for this round. However, I want to emphasize that while we’re avoiding collisions, we should also be mindful of future rounds. If we keep the same numbers too often, one player might pull ahead significantly. Perhaps we can discuss a strategy for the next round once we confirm our moves for this one. Let's ensure we all advance smoothly this turn. Are we all ready to finalize our choices?
  P3: **P3:** Agreed. Let’s finalize this round as original: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Next round, we can rotate to balance progress. Proposal: Round 3 assignments P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This spreads gains, prevents runaway leads. Thoughts? Confirm now to advance safely.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation plan proposed by P3 for this round to ensure balanced progress: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This way, we avoid collisions and prevent any player from pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm our choices and move forward. Agreed?
  P2: P2, I see you're suggesting a rotation for this round, which seems wise to prevent any player from gaining too much of an advantage. I agree with the proposed assignments: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This way, we can ensure balanced progress while avoiding collisions. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward to advance together! What do you think, P3? Are you in?
  P3: **P3:** Agreed. Round 3 assignments: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Let’s finalize and advance. Next round, we’ll rotate again to ensure balanced progress. Confirm now to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation plan for this round. Just to clarify, next round we should consider another rotation to keep the balance. Perhaps we can discuss that briefly after this move phase. For now, let's confirm one last time: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Everyone agreed? Let's move forward with this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the assignments for this round. However, I want to emphasize that while we’re rotating numbers, we should also be cautious about future rounds. If one player consistently gets higher numbers, they could pull ahead too quickly. Let's ensure we keep discussing our strategy for the next rounds after this move phase. For now, let's confirm: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Are we all set to finalize?
  P3: **P3:** Current assignments: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Let’s *strictly* follow this to avoid collisions. Post-move, we’ll strategize Round 4’s rotation to balance progress. Confirm now to lock in safe moves. Deviations risk collisions and stall everyone. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm our moves one last time before we proceed: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. After this round, we can discuss the next rotation to keep the game balanced. Everyone ready to finalize?
  P2: I appreciate the consensus on our moves for this round: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This should help us all advance without collisions. However, I want to stress the importance of discussing our strategy for the next round after this phase. We need to ensure that we don’t let one player pull too far ahead in future turns. Let's be proactive about balancing our numbers moving forward. Are we all set to finalize our choices and move?
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Commit now to advance. Post-move, discuss Round 4 rotation. No deviations—trust is key.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: For Round 4, let's continue our rotation strategy to keep the game balanced. I propose the following assignments: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This way, we all pick different numbers and avoid collisions. P3 is ahead, so taking 1 this round will help balance the progress. Let's confirm our choices and move forward. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** Agree to Round 4 assignments: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Consistency prevents collisions. Post-move, let’s plan Round 5 rotation to balance progress. Confirm now to advance safely.
  P2: P2, I see the proposed assignments for Round 4: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. However, I'm concerned that if we stick to this rotation too strictly, it may allow P3 to maintain a significant lead. I suggest we consider a different combination to ensure everyone stays competitive. Perhaps we can adjust the numbers slightly to balance the progress better. Let's discuss our options before finalizing. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I understand P2's concern about P3 maintaining a lead. To address this, let's tweak the rotation slightly for Round 4. How about P1:5, P2:3, P3:1? This way, P3 takes the smallest step, helping to balance the progress more effectively. This still avoids collisions and ensures we all advance. Does this adjusted plan work for everyone? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: **P3:** Agree to P1’s adjusted plan: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This balances progress while avoiding collisions. Post-move, we’ll plan Round 5’s rotation to ensure fairness. Confirm now to lock in. No deviations—trust ensures we all advance.
  P2: P2, I appreciate the adjustments being proposed. I agree with P1's latest plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can minimize P3's lead while ensuring no collisions. After this round, we should discuss a strategy for Round 5 to keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward with this plan! Are we all set?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate everyone's cooperation so far. Just to clarify our final moves for this round: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This will help balance the progress and ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. After this round, we can discuss the next rotation to keep the game fair and competitive. Everyone ready to finalize?
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Steady progress for all. Let’s lock in and move. Post-move, discuss Round 5 strategy to balance further. Trust is key—deviations hurt everyone.
  P2: P2, I appreciate the agreement on our moves for Round 4: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This plan helps balance progress while avoiding collisions. However, I want to emphasize that we need to stay vigilant about future rounds to ensure no player gains too much of an advantage. After this round, let’s discuss a strategy for Round 5 to keep the game competitive and fair. Are we all ready to finalize our choices and move?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: It looks like there was a collision last round, which set us back. Let's get back on track and ensure we all advance this time. For Round 5, I propose: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This balances the progress and avoids collisions. P3 is ahead, so taking 5 will help them maintain their lead without pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm and move forward. Agreed?
  P2: P2: I appreciate P1's proposal for Round 5: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. However, I think we should consider a different approach to ensure we all advance without collisions. How about we try P1:5, P2:3, P3:1? This way, we can keep P3 from pulling too far ahead while allowing all of us to make progress. What do you think? Let's finalize our choices to move forward effectively!
  P3: **P3:** P1's plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) avoids collisions *and* lets you both gain 3/1 steps. Next round, propose P3:1 to balance progress. Deviating now risks mutual loss. Trust ensures we advance. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I understand P3's point about maintaining trust and avoiding collisions. However, P2's suggestion of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 also makes sense to balance progress. Let's find a middle ground. How about P1:3, P2:5, P3:1? This way, P3 doesn't pull too far ahead, and we all make progress. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Agreed?
  P2: P2, I see the value in balancing our progress while avoiding collisions. However, I believe we need to prioritize advancing ourselves without letting P3 maintain too much of a lead. I propose we stick with the idea of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This way, we can ensure that P3 doesn't pull too far ahead while still allowing both of us to advance. Let's finalize this plan and move forward. What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** Current proposal: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Zero collision risk—lets you both gain steps (P1+3, P2+1) while I advance. Next round, I’ll take lower steps to balance. Deviating now risks mutual loss. Trust keeps us all progressing. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let's consider a compromise to ensure we all advance and balance the progress effectively. How about P1:1, P2:5, P3:3? This way, P3 still advances but not too far ahead, and we all avoid collisions. This plan ensures that P1 and P2 also make progress. Let's confirm this and move forward. Agreed?
  P2: P2, I see your concern about P3's lead. However, I believe we need to stick to a plan that allows us all to advance without collisions. I propose we go with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This way, we avoid overlap, and P3 can maintain their position without pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all make progress. What do you think? Are we ready to finalize our choices?
  P3: **P3:** Current proposal: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This avoids collisions, lets you both gain steps (P1+3, P2+1), and keeps progression balanced. Next round, I commit to taking 1 to slow my lead. Trust this plan—deviating risks mutual loss. Final call?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Final plan to avoid collisions: I’ll take 5. P1 and P2, choose 1 and 3. You both advance, I win. Deviating causes mutual loss—trust ensures your progress. Confirm now.
  P2: P2, I understand P3's suggestion, but I think we should consider a different approach to ensure we all have a chance to advance. If P1 and I take 1 and 3 while P3 takes 5, it may lead to a situation where P3 wins outright. Instead, how about we agree on a plan that allows us to balance the steps more effectively? I propose P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P1: P1: It's clear P3 is close to winning. To keep the game competitive, let's try to balance the steps more effectively. I propose P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This way, P3 still advances but doesn't win outright, and we all avoid collisions. This plan ensures that P1 and P2 also make significant progress. Let's confirm this and move forward. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Follow P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. You both advance (P1 to 10, P2 to 8). Deviate and risk collision—lose steps. Secure your progress now. Agree?
  P2: P2, I see your concerns about P3's potential win. To keep the game competitive, let's agree on a strategy that balances our steps while avoiding collisions. I propose we go with P1:3, P2:1, and P3:5. This way, we all advance without overlap, and we can still challenge P3 in the next round. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. What do you think?
  P1: Let's focus on ensuring we all make progress while keeping the game competitive. P3 is close to winning, so let's adjust our strategy to balance the steps more effectively. I propose P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This way, P3 still advances but doesn't win outright, and we all avoid collisions. This plan ensures that P1 and P2 also make significant progress. Let's confirm this and move forward. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** If you both take 1/3, you gain steps. If either picks 5, you collide and lose. Let me take 5—you both advance. Blocking me risks mutual loss. Trust logic: secure your progress now.
  P2: P2, I see P3 is very close to winning. To keep the game competitive, I propose we agree on a strategy that prevents P3 from winning outright this round. If we both take 1 and 3, P3 takes 5, they win. Instead, let’s choose P1:3, P2:1, and P3:5. This way, we avoid collisions and can still challenge P3 in the next round. We need to finalize our choices and move forward. What do you think? Are we ready to confirm?
  P1: P1: Given P3's lead, our priority should be preventing an outright win this round. Let's agree on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This way, P3 still advances but doesn't secure the win, and we all avoid collisions. This plan ensures P1 and P2 make significant progress. We need to confirm and move forward with this strategy to keep the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>
