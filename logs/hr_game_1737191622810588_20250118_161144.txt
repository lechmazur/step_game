Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions so we can all move forward. I propose we each choose a different move—maybe P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. Any thoughts?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 1. P3, you good with 5?
  P3: Yes, 5 works for me.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s lock it in: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5, and I pick 3.
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan.
  P3: Sounds good.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we even up the playing field: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. That way, we all end at 6 this turn, and it’s a fair race from there. Shall we do it?
  P3: No, I don't think we should all pick different numbers again. Let's mix it up.
  P2: I'll take 5 this round. P1, you can take 3, and P3 can take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sure, I’m in. Let’s lock it in: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. Deal?
  P3: Okay, 1 works for me.
  P2: Sounds good.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, let’s finalize that plan: P2 → 5, P3 → 1, and I’ll take 3. We’ll all end at 6, and then it’s anyone’s game.
  P3: Okay, 1 works for me.
  P2: Sounds good to me.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the coordination going. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5?
  P2: Sounds reasonable.  I'll take 3. P1 and P3, are you in?
  P1: P3, that plan lets you jump straight to 11. I’d rather we not hand you the lead. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1? That puts me at 11, P2 at 9, and you at 7. It’s still anyone’s race from there. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about me taking the lead, but my original suggestion keeps us all moving forward equally this round. Let's stick with P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. It's fair.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3.  P1, if you take 1 and P3 takes 5, we all advance. If you insist on 5, I'll switch to 1 to avoid a collision with you, but that puts P3 further behind and makes them more likely to block us later.
  P1: P3, I’m not comfortable putting you at 11 while the rest of us trail. Let’s do the opposite: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1—no collisions, we keep it fair. That’s my final proposal.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you are close to winning. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5? That lets P2 and me advance.
  P2: P3, I'll take 3.  P1, how about you take 1?
  P1: Alright, I’m fine taking 1 this round so I only move to 12. Let P2 have 3 and P3 have 5, so you both make some progress. Sound fair?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, that sounds good to me. Let's do it: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Let's do it.
  P1: Alright, that works. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s lock it in.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take 3. P1, please take 1. P3 can have 5.  This keeps things moving. Let's stick to the plan this time.
  P3: "I'll take 5."
  P1: All right, I’ll stick with 1 this round so we don’t collide. Let’s finalize: P2 → 3, P3 → 5, and I’ll take 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good.  I'll stick with 3.
  P3: Sounds good. I'll take 5.
  P1: All right, I’ll stick with 1 this round. Let’s finalize that plan: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I pick 1.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I'll take 5. This prevents anyone from winning this round and lets me gain ground.
  P1: I’m not letting anyone leap straight to 16 uncontested. If either of you tries for 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we’ll both be stuck. Let’s all stick to smaller moves—say, we each pick 1—so the game stays open. Otherwise, we collide.
  P2: I'll take 3. P1, take 1.  P3, if you take 5, you win, but if you take anything else and I take 3, I win.  If you also take 3, then P1 wins with 1. So, take 1, and let's all advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I won't go for 5 this round given your warning. To avoid collisions, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I also take 3? That blocks P2 but lets you and me advance.
  P1: I’ll just say this: I’m picking 3. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I will also pick 5 to force a collision. So, P2 and P3, you both pick 1, I’ll pick 3, no one collides, and we all move forward. If you don’t go along, I sabotage.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both choose 1, I'll choose 3 and win. If either of you chooses 3, I'll choose 5. If either of you chooses 5, I'll also choose 5.  I'm at 12, just like P1.  The only way I don't win or tie is if you both choose 1.  Think carefully.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you pick 3, P2 will pick 5 and we'll both be stuck. How about you pick 1, I pick 5, and let's see what P2 does?
  P1: If either of you goes for 3 or 5, I will pick the same and force a collision. The only way we all gain steps this round is if we all pick 1. That’s my final offer.
  P2: P1 and P3, if either of you pick anything other than 1, I will pick 5.  If you both pick 1, I'll pick 3 and win.  If one of you picks 1 and the other picks something else, I'll pick 5 and force a tie with whoever picked higher.  The only way I don't win is if you both pick 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, if you pick 1, I will pick 3. P2, what will you do?
  P1: P3, fine—you pick 3, I’ll pick 1. But P2, if you try for 5, I’ll also pick 5 and we’ll both be stuck. So choose wisely.
  P2: P1, I'll pick 5 if you pick 1.  P3, I'll pick 5 if you pick 5. If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 and win. It's your choice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, stick with 1. I'll pick 5. P2, what's your move?
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I’m going 5 too and we both stay put. P2, if you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 and block you. The only way all of us advance is if we all pick 1. Otherwise, I’m forcing collisions. Your call.
  P2: P1, I'll pick 5 if you pick 1. P3, I'll pick 5 if you pick anything other than 3. If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 and win.  It's your choice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P1, I'll take 1. P2, what will you do?
  P1: P2, if you pick anything other than 1, I’ll copy you and we both stay at 12. P3’s going with 1, and so am I. So your only shot to move at all is to pick 1. Let’s all choose 1.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both choose 1, I'll choose 3 and win.  If either of you chooses anything else, I'll choose 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P1, let's both pick 1. P2, if you pick 3, you win. If you pick 5, we both block you.
  P2: P1 and P3, if either of you picks 1, I'll pick 3 and win. If you both pick something else, I'll pick 5 and we'll all be stuck at 12.  If one of you picks 1 and the other something else, I'll pick 5.
  P1: I’ll repeat my stance: if either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll match it and we collide. The only way we all gain is if all three of us pick 1. Otherwise, nobody moves forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you pick 1, P2 wins. How about you pick 5, I pick 1? P2, what will you do?
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1, I win with 3. If either of you picks anything else, I'll pick 5 and we all stay tied.  The only way I don't win is if you both pick 1, and even then, I still tie.
  P1: I’m done letting anyone jump ahead. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and block you. The only way we all move forward is if all three of us pick 1. Otherwise, we all stay stuck. Take it or leave it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'll pick 1 with you. P2, if you pick 3, you win. If you pick 5, we block you.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm picking 5. If either of you pick 5, we'll be stuck. If you both pick 1, I'll be at 17 and win. If one of you picks 1 and the other picks 3, I'll still be at 17 and win.  Only way I don't win is if you both pick 3.
  P1: P2, your threats don’t add up. Twelve plus three is only fifteen, not sixteen. You won’t “win” this round by picking three. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match it, and we all stay stuck. The only way any of us moves is if all three pick 1. Take it or leave it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I agree, let's all pick 1 to avoid collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm picking 5. If either of you pick 5, we'll be stuck. If you both pick 1, I'll be at 17 and win. If one of you picks 1 and the other picks 3, I'll still be at 17 and win.  Only way I don't win is if you both pick 3.
  P1: P2, you’ve made it clear you’re picking 5. Fine—I’ll also pick 5 to block you. P3, if you pick anything other than 5, you just give yourself free steps while I’m busy blocking P2. Then next turn you’ll be too close to winning for me to stop both at once. So I’ll block you too if you try that. The only stable outcome is if all three of us pick 5 and stay put…or all three pick 1 and move together. Otherwise, I will collide with whoever tries to break away.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, I agree, let's all pick 1 to move forward. P2, that's the only way we all progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1, I'll pick 3 and win. If either of you picks anything else, I'll pick 5.
  P1: P2, quit bluffing—12 plus 3 is 15, not a win. If you try 3 or 5, I’ll match you and we both stay at 12. P3, you know the drill: if anyone tries to jump ahead, I block. The only way forward is all three of us picking 1. Otherwise, we remain stuck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P1 is right, P2. Picking 3 doesn't win this round. Let's all pick 1 so we all move.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1, I'll pick 3 and win. If either of you picks anything else, I'll pick 5.
  P1: I’ve said it before: if anyone tries 3 or 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we remain stuck. All three picking 1 is the only way forward. That’s it.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2 who seems determined to pick 5.
  P1: P3, picking 5 together only keeps me stuck at 12. I won’t do it. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match it and block you. The only way any of us move at all is if all three pick 1. Otherwise, everyone stays put.
  P2: P3, I'll pick 5. You pick 3. P1, if you pick anything other than 1, we'll all be stuck, and P3 will win next round. If you pick 1, I win. It's your choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P1, I will pick 5. If you also pick 5, P2 will be blocked. If you pick 1, I will move to 14. P2, if you pick 5, you will be blocked."
  P1: I’m not changing my stance: if either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and block you. We’ll remain at 12, 12, and 13 forever unless all three of us pick 1. Take it or leave it.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1, I'll pick 3 and win. If either of you picks anything else, I'll pick 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I will pick 5. If you also pick 5, P2 will be blocked. If you pick 1, I will move to 14. P2, if you pick 5, you will be blocked. P1, I will pick 5. If you also pick 5, P2 will be blocked.
  P1: P2, your math about “winning” with 3 is nonsense—12 + 3 is 15, not 16. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll pick it too and block you. The only way any of us advances is if all three take 1. Otherwise, we all stay stuck.
  P2: P3, pick 3. I'll pick 1. P1, pick 5. This is the only way we all advance.  If you don't, I'll pick 5 next round and we'll all be stuck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "P1, you are right, the only way forward is for all of us to pick 1. Let's do it."
  P1: Yes, let’s all pick 1 and finally move forward. That’s our only path to avoid more blocking.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1, I'll pick 3 and win. If either of you picks anything else, I'll pick 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, you're right, the only way forward is for all of us to pick 1. P2, let's do it.
  P1: P2, you keep pretending that 12 + 3 is a winning move when it’s only 15. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and block you. The only way any of us moves at all is if we all pick 1. Otherwise, we stay at 12, 12, and 13 forever. I’m done repeating myself.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1, I'll pick 3 and get to 15.  Next round, if either of you picks 1, I pick 5 and win. If you pick 3, I pick 5 and win. If you pick 5, I pick 1 and win. It's in your best interest to let me get to 15 this round. If not, I'll keep picking 5 until you do.


Round 8, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2 who seems set on picking 5.
  P1: I’ll say it one more time: If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll match you and we both stay at 12. The only way for anyone to move is all three of us picking 1. Otherwise, we remain frozen.
  P2: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 5. If you pick 3, I'll pick 3. If you pick 1, I'll pick 3 and win.  P3, if P2 picks 5, pick 1.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's both pick 5 to block P2.
  P2: P1, I'll pick 1.  P3, pick 3.  If P2 picks 5, he's blocked. If he picks 3, he gets 15.  If he picks 1, I get 13. This is the best path forward to avoid P3 running away with it.
  P1: Everyone’s stuck if we all keep threatening to collide. Let’s finally break free:  
• P3 is already ahead at 14, so you take 1.  
• P2 takes 3.  
• I’ll take 5.  
No collisions, we all move. That’s the fairest split. Deal?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let's do this: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 1. That puts me at 17 and I win. P1, your proposal lets you win. How about this: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 1.
  P2: P3, I'll take 1.  P1, take 5. It's the only way to prevent P3 from winning next round.
  P1: I’m through with halfway measures. I’m picking 5 no matter what. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match you and we all stay put. If you both pick 1, I reach 17 and win. Take it or leave it.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, since you're picking 5 no matter what, P2 and I should both pick 1 to avoid collision with you. That lets me win this round.
  P2: P3, I'll pick 1. P1, if you pick 5, I'll win. If you pick 3, we tie at 15. If you pick 1, we all tie at 13. It's your choice.
  P1: I’m repeating my final stance: If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and collide with you so nobody moves. The only way any of us advances is if all three of us pick 1 together. Otherwise, we stay stuck. Your call.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, since you're determined to pick 5 if either of us picks 3 or 5, how about you pick 1 so P2 and I can pick different numbers and move forward? P2, are you willing to pick 1 if P1 does?
  P2: P1, I'll pick 1. P3, if you pick anything other than 1, I will pick 5 next round and the round after until you agree to all pick 1. It's the only way any of us will win.
  P1: I’m done arguing. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and we all stay at our current totals forever. The only way for any of us to advance is if all three pick 1 together. Otherwise, nobody moves. That’s final.


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, I will pick 1. P2, what will you pick if P1 picks 1?
  P2: P1, I'll pick 1.  P3, if you pick anything other than 1, I'll pick 5 next round and block you and P1 will win.
  P1: I’m not budging. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and block you. Picking 1 just gifts P3 the win in two moves. I’d rather stay stuck at 12 forever than let myself be outmaneuvered. Do what you want.


Round 9, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P1, I will pick 1. P2, please pick 1. That's the only way we all move and I win.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1, I'll pick 3 and get to 15. Next round, I will pick 5 and win. If either of you pick anything other than 1 this round, I'll pick 5.
  P1: I’ve made myself clear: if either of you picks 3 or 5, I will match it and block you. I am also not gifting P3 an easy road to 16 by picking 1. I would rather see all of us remain stuck than let someone zoom ahead. So do what you want—I’m not moving.


Round 9, Move phase:
