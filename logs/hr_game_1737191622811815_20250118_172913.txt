Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we each pick a different move so no one gets blocked. How about P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5? That way we all advance.
  P1: P2, that sounds like a fair plan. P3, are you okay with this strategy? Let's coordinate and avoid blocking each other.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination attempt, but I don't think I want to commit to taking 5 every time. Let's keep our moves flexible. I'm willing to work together but want to maintain some strategic freedom.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m still interested in making sure we each advance this round without colliding. P3, if you don’t want to commit long-term, that’s fine, but let’s at least avoid blocking each other now. How about distinct moves first, and we can reevaluate later?
  P1: P3, I understand wanting flexibility. How about for this round, we go with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions? We can decide on a new strategy in the next round.
  P3: I'll agree to take 5 for this first round only, but after that we'll need to reassess based on how everyone plays.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you’re already ahead. How about letting me catch up so we share the lead? If I pick 5 and you pick 3, we’ll both be at 8 steps. P1 can safely pick 1, staying clear of collisions. Otherwise, if you insist on going 5 again, I may pick 5 too, and we both get stuck. Let’s coordinate so we all move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand your concern P2, but being in the lead is advantageous for me. I won't commit to taking 3 - you'll need to decide if you want to risk a collision at 5 or take a different number. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions. P3, since you're in the lead, would you consider taking 3 this round so we can all advance without blocking? If you take 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1, we all move forward smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I’m going to pick 5 too and we both get stuck. It’s your call. Let’s avoid that and help each other advance. P1, I assume you're still going 1, right?
  P3: I understand your threats P2, but I won't be pressured into taking 3. If you choose to block me at 5, you only hurt your own chances of winning. I suggest you take 3 again and make steady progress rather than risking a collision.
  P1: P3, I understand wanting to maintain your lead, but if you take 3 this round, it helps ensure we all move forward without blocking. P2, if P3 agrees, you can safely pick 5, and I'll continue with 1. Let's aim for smooth progress this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, the choice is yours. If you won’t take 3, I’ll go 5 as well, and we’ll both stall. I’m not trying to ruin our chances, but I won’t let you stay too far ahead. P1, I expect you’re still going 1, right?
  P3: I maintain my position. I won't be taking 3 this round, P2. If you choose to block at 5, that's your decision, but it only helps P1 catch up while we both stall.
  P1: P2, it seems like you're determined to block P3 if they go for 5. I understand your strategy, but remember, if you both stall, it gives me a chance to catch up. P3, if you want to maintain your lead and avoid a collision, consider taking 3 this round. P2, if P3 agrees, you can safely pick 5. Let's aim for a round where we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I won’t let you keep racing ahead unchallenged. If you refuse to pick 3, I’ll pick 5 like you, and we both stall. I'd prefer we both move forward instead, but that choice is now yours.
  P3: I'll be clear one last time - I won't take 3 this round. P2, if you choose to block at 5, you're only hurting your own chances of winning while helping P1 catch up. The smart play for you is to take 3 again and make steady progress.
  P1: P2, it seems like you're determined to block P3 if they choose 5. If P3 is unwilling to take 3, perhaps it's best for you to take 3 again to ensure some progress. P3, if you want to avoid a collision, taking 3 could be a strategic move to maintain your lead while ensuring everyone advances. Let's try to avoid a stall and keep the game moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I’m not bluffing. If you insist on 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we both stall while P1 catches up. It’s your call.
  P3: I remain firm in my position. P2, blocking me at 5 is counterproductive for you - it helps P1 catch up while we both stall. Make your choice wisely.
  P1: P2, I see you're set on blocking P3 if they pick 5, but remember, if you both stall, it gives me a chance to catch up. P3, if you want to avoid a collision and maintain your lead, taking 3 could be a strategic choice. Let's aim for a round where we all make progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I see your strategy of blocking P3 worked last round, but it also stalled your progress. P3, if you want to maintain your lead, consider taking 3 this round. P2, maybe taking 3 again could help you advance without risking a collision. I'll stick with 1 to ensure I move forward. Let's avoid stalling and keep progressing. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if you go 5 again, I’ll block us both. Let’s both move forward instead: you pick 3, I pick 5, and we stay ahead of P1. That’s better for both of us than stalling. P1, I respect your steady approach, but I need to keep pace with P3. Let’s avoid collisions and all make progress.
  P3: I see that blocking moves hurt us both last round, P2. I propose we each take different numbers this time - I'll take 3, you can take 5, and P1 can continue with 1. This way we all advance and maintain relative positions. Does this work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm glad to see you're open to taking 3 this round. It sounds like a solid plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. P2, with P3 taking 3, you can safely pick 5, and I'll continue with 1. Let's aim for a smooth round where we all move forward.
  P2: P3, I’m glad you’re willing to pick 3. I’ll take 5, and P1 can stick with 1 so we each advance without colliding. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P3: I'll confirm my commitment to take 3 this round. This way we all advance - P1 with 1, P2 with 5, and me with 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'm glad to see you're willing to take 3 this round. P2, with P3 taking 3, you can safely pick 5, and I'll continue with 1. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to it and keep the game moving forward.
  P2: Excellent. We have a deal: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. That ensures we all advance.
  P3: I'll add


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm open to continuing our coordination from last round since it worked well. I propose keeping the same arrangement: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This keeps us all moving forward efficiently. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I'm on board with continuing the same arrangement as last round. It ensures we all advance without colliding. P2, are you still good with taking 5? Let's keep the momentum going.
  P2: I agree—let’s continue the same plan as last round: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 goes with 1. We all advance without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll stick with 3 this round. Let's keep this coordination going since it's working well for everyone.
  P1: P3, I'm glad we're all aligned on continuing with the same plan. P2, sticking with 5 ensures we all advance smoothly. Let's keep this coordination for another round and maintain our progress.
  P2: Sounds good. I’m fine continuing with the same arrangement: I’ll pick 5, P3 picks 3, P1 picks 1. Let’s keep things collision-free.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll keep my commitment to take 3 again this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're all aligned on continuing the same plan. It ensures we all advance without colliding. Let's stick to this arrangement: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game moving smoothly. Agreed?
  P2: I'm good with continuing the same plan—I'll aim for 5 again. Let's all advance collision-free this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll add
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're all in agreement to continue with the plan from last round. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This strategy ensures we all advance and avoid collisions. Let's stick to it and keep the game progressing smoothly.
  P2: I’m fine sticking to the same arrangement—P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5 again so we can all advance without collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice P1 deviated from our agreement last round and tried to take 5, causing a collision with P2. This makes coordination less reliable. I'll be making my own strategic choices this round rather than committing to any specific number.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about last round. It was a strategic move to test the waters, but I'm open to coordinating again if it benefits us all. P2, are you willing to discuss a new arrangement to ensure we all advance without collisions? Let's find a way to keep the game moving forward.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall while P1 catches up. That doesn’t help either of us. Let’s do what’s best for the two of us: you take 3, I’ll take 5, and we stay well ahead of P1. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I won't make any commitments this round after seeing how easily agreements can be broken. P2, threatening to block me at 5 again only helps P1 catch up while hurting both our chances. Make your moves wisely.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the tension from last round's deviation. I'm open to coordinating again if it benefits us all. P2, if you're willing to take 5, perhaps P3 can take 3, and I'll stick with 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's aim for a smooth round. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I won’t let you jump to 16 uncontested. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall while P1 closes the gap. Let’s be smart and maintain our lead: you pick 3, I pick 5, and P1 can pick 1. We all advance, and we stay ahead of P1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I maintain my position - I won't commit to any specific number this round. P2, your threat to block at 5 only helps P1 catch up while hurting both our chances of winning. Think carefully about your move.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the tension from last round, but let's focus on a strategy that benefits us all. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's aim for a smooth round and keep the game moving forward. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I’m staying consistent: if you go for 5, I’ll also pick 5 and we both stall. Pick 3, and I’ll pick 5 so we both advance instead of letting P1 close the gap. This is the best path for both of us. The choice is yours.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll be direct - I won't be pressured into taking 3 by threats of blocking. P2, if you choose to block at 5, you're only helping P1 catch up while hurting both our chances to win. The smart play for you is to take 3 and make steady progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the challenges from last round, but let's focus on a strategy that benefits us all. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we can all advance without collisions. This way, we maintain our progress and keep the game moving forward. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I’m not budging. If you pick 5, I pick 5, and we both stall. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and we both keep our lead over P1. The choice is yours.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I maintain my position. P2, your threats to block at 5 are counterproductive - they only help P1 catch up while hurting both our chances. I won't be pressured into taking 3.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the tension from last round, but let's focus on a strategy that benefits us all. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we can all advance without collisions. This way, we maintain our progress and keep the game moving forward. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I’ve said it before: if you go 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall—handing P1 free ground. Let’s both move forward instead. If you pick 3, we stay ahead of P1 and make real progress. The choice is yours.


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: I remain firm in my position. P2, blocking at 5 only helps P1 while hurting both our chances. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, I see you're determined to block P3 at 5, but remember, stalling helps me catch up. P3, if you want to avoid a collision and maintain your lead, consider taking 3 this round. Let's aim for a round where we all make progress without stalling. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, this is my final word: if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall, letting P1 catch up. If you pick 3, I’ll take 5, and we maintain our lead over P1. Make the smart choice.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear that blocking each other only helps me catch up. Let's try a new strategy: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall again, letting P1 catch up. Let’s be smart and maintain our lead: you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and we all advance without collisions. That’s better for both of us than handing P1 a free chance to leapfrog. P1, I assume you’ll stick with 1.
  P3: I see that blocking moves have only helped P1 catch up. I propose we all take different numbers this round - I'll take 3, P2 can take 5, and P1 can continue with 1. This keeps us all moving forward and maintains the current order.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the plan for this round. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to this arrangement and keep the game moving forward smoothly.
  P2: P3, let’s finalize it: if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall, helping P1. That’s bad for us. Better for both of us is you taking 3 while I take 5, and P1 goes 1—we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to that.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as proposed. This way we all advance - P1 with 1, P2 with 5, and me with 3. Let's avoid another round of blocking that only helps P1 catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on avoiding collisions this round. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we all advance smoothly. Let’s stick to this plan and keep the game moving forward. Agreed?
  P2: P3, let’s finalize this now: if you stick with 3, I’ll make the bigger move and P1 does 1, so we all advance without collisions. That keeps both of us ahead of P1. Let’s do it.
  P3: I confirm again that I'll take 3 this round. Let's avoid another stalemate that only benefits P1. With P2 taking 5 and P1 taking 1, we can all advance efficiently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're all aligned on avoiding collisions this round. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we all advance smoothly. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game moving forward. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I’ve made it clear: if you pick 5, so will I—we both stall, letting P1 benefit. Let’s be smart and avoid collisions: you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P1 presumably takes 1. Then we all advance.
  P3: I confirm once again that I'll take 3 this round. This coordination benefits us all - P1 with 1, P2 with 5, and me with 3. Let's avoid another stalemate.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we continue with our successful coordination from last round - I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward efficiently and maintains our lead positions. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m fine continuing the successful plan: P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P1 takes 1. Let’s all advance without collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm on board with continuing the same plan as last round. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this arrangement and keep the game moving forward smoothly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll stick with 3 this round. This coordination has worked well for all of us - P1 with 1, P2 with 5, and me with 3. Let's keep it going.
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s continue the same plan (1, 3, 5) to keep things smooth and avoid collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on continuing the same plan as last round. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this arrangement and keep the game moving forward smoothly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm again that I'll take 3 this round. Our coordination is working well, so let's maintain it.
  P2: I’m happy to keep the same plan from last round: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. That way we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize that.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on continuing the same plan as last round. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this arrangement and keep the game moving forward smoothly. Agreed?
