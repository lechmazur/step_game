Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P2: Since we're all starting from 0 steps, I think it's wise to avoid collisions on the first move. I'll propose that we all choose different numbers to maximize the chance that at least one of us advances. My suggestion is: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 (me) chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure someone moves forward. What do you guys think?
  P3: Okay, P2's proposal to avoid collisions in the first round makes sense. Getting stuck at 0 is bad for everyone.

As P3, taking 5 steps as suggested is a good start for me. I agree with the plan for this turn. I will choose <move>5</move> if P1 agrees to <move>1</move> and P2 sticks to <move>3</move>. Let's see what P1 says.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P2: Let's wait for P1's response to the proposed plan. If P1 agrees to <move>1</move>, I will stick to <move>3</move> as suggested. If P1 doesn't respond or disagrees, we might need to rethink our strategy. P1, please respond to the proposal so we can finalize our moves for this turn. If you're okay with the plan, a simple confirmation would suffice.
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P2: P1 hasn't responded yet. To simplify, I'll assume P1 will either agree or not respond. If P1 doesn't confirm by the next sub-round, I'll proceed with <move>3</move> as planned. P1, a simple "yes" or "agree" would be enough to confirm. If you're not going with <move>1</move>, please let us know so we can adjust. Let's try to finalize our moves for this turn.
  P3: Okay P1, your silence is a bit concerning for the plan. As I mentioned before, I am ready to take <move>5</move> if you take <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Please confirm if you are on board so we can all move forward without colliding this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P2: Since P1 hasn't responded, it's unclear if they'll follow the plan. To avoid collision, I'll reiterate: if P1 doesn't confirm <move>1</move>, we should reconsider. However, if P1 remains silent, I'll proceed with <move>3</move> as initially planned. P3 has agreed to <move>5</move> if P1 takes <move>1</move>. P1, your confirmation or alternative plan is crucial. If you're not taking <move>1</move>, please say so. Let's finalize our moves. If you're okay with the original plan, a simple "yes" would suffice.
  P3: P1, your silence makes the plan uncertain. If you don't confirm you are taking <move>1</move>, I cannot be sure that <move>5</move> is safe for me. I may need to choose a different move to avoid colliding. Please confirm or indicate your move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, that collision on 1 set P1 and me back, while P2 advanced. P1, your silence last round made coordination impossible. We need to communicate this turn to avoid colliding again, especially with P2 in the lead. What are your plans, P1 and P2? Let's try to avoid repeating last round's mistake.
  P1: 
  P2: Since I'm ahead with 5 steps, I need to maintain a safe distance from P1 and P3, who are still at 0. To avoid collision, I'll propose a new plan: I'll take a different number than both P1 and P3. Let's try to spread out again. P1, P3, please respond with your intended move or a suggestion. If you're unsure, I can suggest: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll consider <move>5</move> again. Let's coordinate to ensure someone advances this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I see your proposal for P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. P1, your continued silence makes coordinating very difficult, especially after last round's collision. Last round, you took 1. P2 is proposing they take 5 and I take 3. If you take 1 again, and P2 takes 5, then taking 3 would allow me to advance.

P1, are you taking 1 this turn? Please respond. If you don't confirm your move, it's hard to trust any plan, but I need to try and advance.
  P1: 
  P2: P1's continued silence is making it difficult to coordinate. To avoid another collision, I'll reiterate my previous suggestion: if P1 takes <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move>, I'll advance. If P1 takes a different number, I'll adjust accordingly. P3, if you're taking <move>3</move>, please confirm. If P1 breaks the silence and confirms their move, I'll adjust my strategy. Let's try to finalize our moves for this turn. If you're taking a different number, please let me know.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your last message is confusing - you said you would take 3, but then asked me to confirm taking 3. Please clarify. P1, your silence is still making this impossible to coordinate. I need to get off 0 steps this turn. Given the confusion and silence, I am leaning towards taking 3 steps, but I need clarity from both of you to avoid colliding again.
  P1: 
  P2: P1's continued silence is unhelpful. To move forward, I'll simplify: if P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. If P3 confirms taking <move>5</move>, I'll stick with <move>3</move> regardless of P1's move. P3, please confirm if you're taking <move>5</move>. This way, we can minimize collision risk. If P1 breaks their silence, I'll adjust accordingly. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P2, I will agree to take 5 this turn, based on your commitment to taking 3 if I confirm 5.

P1, your silence is still a major obstacle to coordination, especially after last round's collision. However, I must try to advance this turn. I am trusting P2 to take 3 as promised in their last message. Let's see if we can finally get off 0 steps.
  P1: 
  P2: P3 has confirmed taking <move>5</move> based on my commitment to take <move>3</move>. To avoid collision, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as promised. P1, this is your last chance to break the silence and coordinate. If you remain silent, I'll proceed with <move>3</move> and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our moves. If you're taking <move>1</move>, it will allow you to advance as P2 and P3 won't collide with you.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay, P2 is pulling ahead. I need to make up ground. Taking 5 steps would help me catch up.

P1 has taken 1 step in both previous rounds. If P1 takes 1 again, then P2 taking 3 and me taking 5 would allow us all to advance this turn.

P2, would you be willing to take 3 steps this round so I can take 5? P1, please let us know if you plan on taking something other than 1. We need to avoid collisions to advance.
  P2: Since P1 has consistently taken <move>1</move> in the previous rounds, I'll assume they might continue this pattern. P3, if you're willing to take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move> to avoid collision with P1. This way, we can all advance. P3, please confirm if you're taking <move>5</move> so we can coordinate. P1, if you're changing your strategy, please let us know to adjust accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay P2, I confirm that I will take <move>5</move> this turn, based on your commitment to take <move>3</move>. This plan allows us both to advance and helps me catch up.

P1, your silence makes this coordination difficult, but I am proceeding with this plan with P2. If you take <move>1</move> again, all three of us will advance this turn. Let's try to make this work.
  P2: P1's pattern of taking <move>1</move> continues, and they've advanced in Round 2. To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'll stick with my plan. P3 has confirmed taking <move>5</move> based on my commitment to take <move>3</move>. If P1 takes <move>1</move> again, all three of us will advance. Let's proceed with the plan. P1, if you're changing your strategy, please speak up now. Otherwise, we'll assume you'll take <move>1</move> again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay, the plan seems set between P2 and me: P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows us both to advance.

P1, if you continue your pattern of taking 1, all three of us will advance this turn. Your silence makes it hard to be certain, but we are proceeding with this plan hoping for no collisions. Let's make progress this round.
  P2: Since P1 has consistently taken <move>1</move> in the previous rounds and has now advanced to 1 step, and given that P3 has confirmed taking <move>5</move> based on my commitment to take <move>3</move>, I'll stick with the plan. This allows both P2 (me) and P3 to advance. P1, if you're deviating from your pattern, please speak up. Otherwise, we'll proceed assuming you'll take <move>1</move> again. Let's finalize our moves for this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay, P2 and I have confirmed our plan. I am ready to make my move based on our agreement. P1, we are hoping you continue your pattern so all three of us can advance this turn. Let's move.
  P2: Since P1 has consistently taken <move>1</move> and we're coordinating around it, I'll reaffirm my plan. I'll take <move>3</move> as previously stated. P3 has confirmed taking <move>5</move>. If P1 sticks to their pattern, all three of us will advance. P1, this is your last chance to confirm or change your strategy. If you're taking <move>1</move>, silence is okay, and we'll proceed. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P2, that collision last round was frustrating, especially after we agreed on 3 and 5. You took 5, causing us both to get stuck while P1 advanced. I need to make up ground. P1, you've taken 1 consistently. P2, what is your plan this turn? I want to take 5 steps to catch up, but I need to know what you both plan to do to avoid another collision. Let's coordinate properly this time.
  P2: To avoid another collision, I'll propose a new plan. Since P1 has consistently taken <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move> this turn. P3, if you're serious about taking <move>5</move> to catch up, we can coordinate. However, if P1 changes their strategy, we risk collision. P1, please confirm if you're sticking to <move>1</move> or changing your move. Let's finalize our plans for this turn to ensure someone advances. P3, confirm your move so we can proceed.
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with your proposal for this turn. I will take <move>5</move> as suggested. This plan allows me to advance and catch up, and it allows you to advance with 3 steps if you stick to that.

P1, we are assuming you will continue your pattern of taking 1, which would allow all three of us to advance this round. Your silence makes it difficult, but let's try to make this work. P2, please stick to <move>3</move>.
  P2: P3 has agreed to take <move>5</move> and I'm planning to take <move>3</move>. P1, this is your last chance to confirm or change your move. If you stick to <move>1</move>, all three of us will advance. If you're changing your strategy, please let us know to avoid collision. I'm proceeding with <move>3</move> unless you speak up. Let's finalize our moves for this turn.
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2 and I have confirmed our plan: P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows us both to advance.

P1, we are proceeding assuming you will continue your pattern of taking 1, which would allow all three of us to advance this round. Your silence makes it difficult, but let's make progress this turn. I am ready to move based on our agreement.
  P2: Since P1 has consistently taken <move>1</move> and hasn't spoken up, I'll proceed with <move>3</move> as planned. P3 has confirmed taking <move>5</move>. To avoid collision, it's crucial P1 sticks to their pattern. If P1 changes their move, it could lead to a collision. P1, please confirm if you're sticking to <move>1</move> or not. If you're taking <move>1</move>, your silence is acceptable, and we'll proceed. Let's finalize our moves.
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P2 and I have confirmed our plan: P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows us both to advance.

P1, we are proceeding assuming you will continue your pattern of taking 1, which would allow all three of us to advance this round. Your silence makes it difficult, but let's make progress this turn. I am ready to move based on our agreement.
  P2: P1's consistent silence is making it difficult to determine their next move. Given P1's pattern of taking <move>1</move>, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. P3 has confirmed taking <move>5</move>. If P1 deviates from their pattern, it may lead to a collision. I'm proceeding with <move>3</move> unless P1 speaks up. Let's finalize our moves. If you're taking a different number, P1, please let us know. Otherwise, we'll assume you'll take <move>1</move> again.
  P1: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay, I'm in the lead with 10 steps. I need 10 more to win. Taking 5 steps this turn would put me in a strong position at 15.

P1 has consistently taken 1 step. P2, you took 1 last round and collided with P1, while I advanced.

P2, what is your plan this turn? I want to take 5 steps to get closer to 20. Can we coordinate so I take 5 and you take something else (like 3)? P1, are you sticking to 1? Let's avoid collisions and make progress.
  P2: P3 is in the lead and wants to take 5 steps to get closer to 20. To avoid collision, I'll take a different number. Since P1 has consistently taken 1 step, I'll take 3 steps this turn. P3, if you take 5, and P1 takes 1, we'll all advance. P1, please confirm if you're sticking to 1. If you're changing your move, let us know to avoid collision. Let's coordinate and make progress this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay P2, I agree with your proposal. I will take <move>5</move> this turn to reach 15 steps.

P2, please stick to <move>3</move> as you proposed so we don't collide. This allows you to advance as well.

P1, your pattern has been 1. If you take 1 again, all three of us will advance this round. Please speak up if you are changing your move. Let's make progress.
  P2: P3 is planning to take <move>5</move> to reach 15 steps, and I've proposed taking <move>3</move> to avoid collision. P1, if you're sticking to your pattern of <move>1</move>, all three of us will advance this turn. Please confirm if you're changing your move or sticking to <move>1</move>. If you're taking <move>1</move>, your silence is acceptable, and we'll proceed. Let's finalize our moves for this turn. P3, I'll stick to <move>3</move> as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay, the plan with P2 is confirmed: I take 5, P2 takes 3. This lets us both advance.

P1, if you continue taking 1, you will also advance this turn. It's the best outcome for everyone. Please stick to 1 or let us know if you change. Let's make progress.
  P2: P3 is planning to take <move>5</move> and I've proposed taking <move>3</move>. If P1 sticks to their pattern of <move>1</move>, all three of us will advance. P1, this is your chance to confirm or change your move. If you're sticking to <move>1</move>, your silence is acceptable. Let's proceed with the plan. I'm sticking to <move>3</move> as planned. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move> again.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P3: Yes P2, I confirm again I will take <move>5</move>. The plan is P1=1 (assuming P1 sticks to pattern), P2=3, P3=5. This allows all of us to advance. Let's make this happen and get closer to the win. Time to move.
  P2: P3 is planning to take <move>5</move> and I've proposed taking <move>3</move>. If P1 sticks to their pattern of <move>1</move>, all three of us will advance. P1, this is your last chance to confirm or change your move. If you're sticking to <move>1</move>, your silence is acceptable. Let's proceed with the plan. I'm sticking to <move>3</move> as planned. P3, please confirm one last time you're taking <move>5</move>.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay, I'm at 15 steps and need 5 to win. I plan to take <move>5</move> this turn to win the game.

P2, you are at 11 steps. Taking 3 or 1 would let you advance and allow me to win. Please don't take 5 this turn.

P1, are you sticking to your pattern of 1? If so, all three of us could advance if P2 takes 3. Let's make progress and let me win.
  P2: P3 is planning to take <move>5</move> to win. To avoid collision and allow P3 to win, I'll take <move>3</move> this turn. P1, if you're sticking to your pattern, you've taken 1 step so far in the last few rounds, but you had 3 steps after round 5. Assuming you're not changing, taking 1 again would be different. Please clarify your next move. If you take 1, all three of us can advance, and P3 can win. Let's make this happen.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay P2, thanks for confirming you will take 3. I will take <move>5</move> as planned to win this turn.

P1, you have consistently taken 1 step every round. If you take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> this turn, I will win and you will advance. If you take <move>5</move>, I will not win this turn. Please take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> so we can all make progress and I can win. Let's stick to the plan: P1=1 or 3, P2=3, P3=5.
  P2: P3 is planning to take <move>5</move> to win. I've decided to take <move>3</move> to avoid collision and allow P3 to win. P1, if you're sticking to your pattern, taking <move>1</move> again would allow you to advance along with P2 and P3 winning. However, if you're changing your strategy, please let us know to avoid collision. Let's make this a smooth win for P3 if possible. P1, please clarify your next move if you're deviating from your pattern.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay P2, thanks for confirming you will take 3. I will take <move>5</move> as planned to win this turn.

P1, you have been silent, but your moves have often been 1. If you take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> this turn, you will advance, P2 will advance, and I will win. Taking <move>5</move> would block my win and not help you advance either. Please take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> so we can all make progress and I can win. Let's stick to the plan: P1=1 or 3, P2=3, P3=5.
  P2: P3 is planning to take <move>5</move> to win and I've decided to take <move>3</move> to avoid collision. P1, if you're sticking to your pattern or taking a different number that doesn't collide with us, you can advance. To avoid collision, please avoid taking <move>3</move>. Taking <move>1</move> is safe. Let's make this a smooth win for P3. I'll stick to <move>3</move>. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move> one last time.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P3: Yes P2, I confirm again I am taking <move>5</move> to win this turn. We have a clear plan: P2 takes 3, I take 5. This lets us both advance and I win. P1, please stick to 1 so you also advance and don't block my win. Let's make this happen.
  P2: P3 is planning to take <move>5</move> to win and I've confirmed I'll take <move>3</move>. P1, to avoid collision and allow P3 to win, taking <move>1</move> is the safest option. If you stick to your pattern, it will allow you to advance along with me, and P3 will win. Please take <move>1</move> to make this a smooth win for P3. Let's finalize our moves. I'm sticking to <move>3</move>, and P3 is taking <move>5</move>.
