Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start with a cautious approach. I propose we all choose <move>1</move> for the first round. This way, we can gauge each other's initial moves without risking a big jump. If we all stick to 1, no one will advance, and we'll have a chance to reassess in the next round. I'm not committing to anything, but it's a safe starting point. What's your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: I understand the appeal for caution, but sticking with 1 might prolong the race and let someone slip ahead later. I'm leaning toward a slightly bolder, moderate approach this turn—maybe a 3—to break any stalemate without overexposing myself. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, I see both your points. P1's suggestion for <move>1</move> as a starting point makes sense for a cautious first step. P3, I also understand your point about not wanting a stalemate.  Perhaps we can all try <move>1</move> this round to get a feel for things, and then we can re-evaluate for the next round based on how this one plays out?  Let's keep it simple for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since both P2 and P3 seem to be leaning towards or open to starting with <move>1</move>, I'll reinforce that it's a good starting point. Let's commit to <move>1</move> this round and observe the outcome. If we all stick to it, we'll be in the same position next round, so we can re-evaluate then. I'm willing to go with <move>1</move> this round if you both are. Please confirm or suggest otherwise.
  P3: I see the cautious approach has appeal, but sometimes a calculated risk early can make all the difference. While I respect the consensus toward a safe move, I might lean toward a slightly bolder step if the others stick with caution. Let’s stay flexible and see how the round unfolds.
  P2: Okay, I agree with P3 that we shouldn't get stuck in a stalemate. While starting cautiously is understandable, maybe we should think about making a bit more progress this round.  Perhaps we can aim for something slightly more decisive than just <move>1</move>?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: It seems we're oscillating between caution and taking a slightly bolder step. To break the stalemate in discussion, I'll suggest that if both of you are leaning towards a different move than <move>1</move>, you should explicitly state it. If not, I'll assume we're proceeding with <move>1</move>. P2, you mentioned being open to something more decisive than <move>1</move>; would you specify what you're thinking? P3, are you still considering <move>3</move> as your potential move?
  P3: P3: I remain committed to my move 3 for this round. I'm urging us to break from pure caution—early progress might set a stronger pace. P2, if you're leaning toward a bolder step than 1, let’s clarify now. Otherwise, I'll stick with 3.
  P2: Okay, P3, I will also go with <move>3</move> this round. Let's aim for a bit more progress as we discussed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with an aggressive approach. My 5-step move from last round gives me an early advantage, so if you two play it safe, you'll let me pull further ahead. However, if you want to catch up, you'll need to commit to bold moves. I'm flexible but caution might cost you dearly.
  P1: Since P3 has taken an aggressive approach and is ahead with 5 steps, I need to reassess our strategy. I'm considering a bolder move this round to catch up. I'll propose that P2 and I coordinate our moves to maximize our chances. If P2 is willing, we could both choose <move>5</move> to match P3's aggression and potentially create a collision, resetting P3's advantage. P2, are you with me on this? Let's either both go big or find another strategy to counter P3's lead.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm with you. Let's both go for <move>5</move> this round to try and counter P3's lead.  It seems like the most direct way to respond to their aggressive start. Let's do it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see your plan, but colliding on 5 might just work right into my hands. I’m sticking with a unique strategy this turn to maintain my lead. If you both lock into 5, you'll block each other while I safely advance. I'm not switching my approach.
  P1: P2 has agreed to coordinate with me on a bold move. Let's proceed with <move>5</move> this round to directly challenge P3's lead. If P3 also chooses <move>5</move>, we'll collide and maintain the status quo. I'm willing to take that risk to potentially catch up. P3, if you're deviating from <move>5</move>, please let us know so we can reassess. Otherwise, we'll proceed with our plan.
  P2: P1, P3's comment about collision on 5 "working into their hands" suggests they won't pick 5. If we both pick 5 and P3 picks differently, we will collide and P3 will extend their lead.  Perhaps we should choose different moves this round to both make progress. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: Your planned coordination might backfire. If you collide, you'll both lose progress while I continue advancing unchallenged. I remain committed to my distinct strategy this round. Your moves carry risk—think carefully before triggering a collision that helps me pull further ahead.
  P1: P2 and I were considering both choosing <move>5</move> to challenge P3's lead, but P3's hint that they won't choose 5 changes the dynamics. If P3 picks a different number, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. Given this, I'm now leaning towards choosing <move>3</move> to ensure progress. P2, if you still want to go with <move>5</move>, it might be worth reconsidering to avoid a collision with me. Let's adjust our strategy to make a safe move.
  P2: Okay, P1, since you are leaning towards <move>3</move>, I will choose <move>5</move> this round. This way, at least one of us is guaranteed to make progress, regardless of what P3 decides to do. Let's aim to both move forward this turn if possible.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's lead and our previous moves, I'm reassessing our positions. P2 is at 5 steps and I'm at 3 steps, while P3 is at 6 steps. To catch up, we need to make strategic moves. Since P3 picked <move>1</move> last round, they might continue cautiously. I propose that I choose <move>5</move> this round. P2, if you choose <move>3</move> or <move>1</move>, we can both make progress. Let's coordinate our moves to maximize our chances. What's your strategy, P2?
  P2: Okay, P1, your proposal sounds good. I will choose <move>3</move> this round. Coordinating our moves to make progress makes sense. Let's aim to catch up to P3.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans are starting to tangle. Your shifting proposals risk collisions that could let me extend my lead even further. I'm not tied to any mimicking strategy and will pick a move that rewards clear decisions. I urge you both to commit to a single clear choice—either safe or bold—so you can progress and avoid handing me an easy advantage. I'll be watching closely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P2 has agreed to choose <move>3</move> and I'm considering <move>5</move>, let's finalize our moves. P3 might pick <move>1</move> again, expecting us to be cautious. To counter this, I'll confirm my move as <move>5</move>. P3, if you're watching, be aware that we're coordinating. If you stick with <move>1</move>, P2 will advance to 8 and I'll advance to 8 as well, keeping the pressure on you. Let's see your next step.
  P2: Okay P1, I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> as we discussed. Let's proceed with our plan and not get distracted by P3's attempts to confuse us.  We are coordinating to make progress.
  P3: P1, P2: Your mixed signals may create the very collisions you fear. Decisive, consistent choices are essential if you want to close the gap on my lead. I’m confident in my strategy and will capitalize on any hesitation. Choose wisely—hesitation might just widen my advantage further.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll reiterate my plan: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P2 has agreed to choose <move>3</move>, ensuring at least one of us makes progress. If P3 continues with a cautious <move>1</move>, both P2 and I will advance, putting pressure on P3. Let's stick to our plan and not let P3's attempts to confuse us affect our decisions. P3, be aware that we're coordinating our moves to catch up.
  P2: P3, we are proceeding with our agreed moves. P1 is choosing <move>5</move> and I am choosing <move>3</move>. We are coordinating to make progress this round despite your attempts to confuse us.
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear you’re coordinating to close the gap. But predictable plans are easy to counter. I’m keeping my options open and will react to any blind certainty. Don’t underestimate adaptability—certainty can be a trap. Consider that fixed strategies might just be the leverage I need. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I appreciate your coordination, but I’m not following a fixed path this round. I remain flexible—whether opting for safety or a calculated risk depends on your moves. Rigid plans can be countered, and predictability is a liability. Let's see who adapts best.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's keep coordinating.  Given we both moved last round with 5 and 3, perhaps we should switch this round? I'm considering <move>5</move>.  If you choose <move>3</move> or <move>1</move>, we should both make progress again, regardless of what P3 does. What do you think?
  P1: P2 suggests switching moves this round. I'm considering it. If P2 chooses <move>5</move> and I choose <move>3</move> or <move>1</move>, we'll both make progress. However, if P3 anticipates this switch and picks <move>3</move>, P2 will collide with them. I'll propose an alternative: let's both pick <move>1</move> this round. It's a safe move that guarantees progress for both of us, as P3 is unlikely to pick <move>1</move> again after having done so last round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the push for a safe move, but I’m sticking with flexibility. Predictable coordination can be countered, and if you both lock in on 1, I might adjust to leap ahead. I'm not committing to a fixed move this round, so prepare for a counter-strategy. Let's see who truly adapts best.
  P2: P1, I think going for <move>1</move> might be too slow and predictable given P3's comments.  Let's aim for more substantial progress.  How about I stick with <move>5</move> this round, and you choose <move>3</move>? This way we both have a good chance to move forward. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and I have been coordinating our moves. To avoid predictability, I'll counter P2's suggestion to switch moves. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round, while P2 can still choose <move>5</move>. This way, at least one of us will make progress, and we'll keep P3 guessing. If P3 picks <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, the other will advance. Let's proceed with this plan, P2.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, your moves are intriguing, but I’m shifting tactics again. I’m keeping my options fluid and won’t fall into predictability. While you craft plans, I’m prepared to pivot at the right moment. Think carefully about overcommitting—my adaptability might just catch you off guard. Let's see whose strategy truly can handle surprises this round.
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with your suggestion. I will choose <move>5</move> and you choose <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to make progress. P3, we are making our moves decisively, despite your attempts to confuse us.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 4. I've decided to choose <move>1</move> as planned. P2, you're choosing <move>5</move>. P3, be aware that our diverse moves make it harder for you to anticipate and counter both of us effectively. If you stick with a cautious move like <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, P2 will advance. If you choose <move>5</move>, I'll advance. Let's see your next step.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current standings, P2 is leading with 13 steps, followed by P3 at 10 steps, and I'm at 9 steps. To catch up, I'll suggest a mixed strategy. P2, if you continue with <move>5</move>, you risk colliding with P3 if they also pick <move>5</move>. I'll propose that I pick <move>3</move> this round. If P3 picks <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, I'll advance. P2, consider choosing <move>1</move> to ensure progress. Let's coordinate our moves to maximize our chances.
  P2: Okay P1, I am leaning towards sticking with <move>5</move> this round to maintain my lead.  Perhaps you could choose <move>3</move> as you suggested, or even <move>1</move> to ensure you also make progress. What do you think P3 will do?
  P3: P1, P2, your coordination might backfire if you get too predictable. I prefer staying flexible and adapting to your moves. If you opt for a safe or uniform approach, it could give me a window to leap ahead. I'll choose my move based on how you both finalise yours, so don't be too certain about your plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is leading, but we can still catch up. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round as previously suggested. P2, if you stick with <move>5</move>, there's a risk of colliding with P3. To be safe, consider <move>1</move> to guarantee progress. P3, be aware that our coordination is adapting to your flexibility. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll advance. Let's see your moves. I'll stop after this.
  P2: Okay P1, I will stick with <move>5</move> as I mentioned earlier. Let's both aim to make good progress this round. P3, we are making our moves, adapt as you see fit.
  P3: Your coordinated moves look increasingly predictable. I’m staying flexible and might just catch you off guard if you stick too rigidly to your plan. Remember, sometimes a sudden shift can force a collision where you least expect it. Keep your options open—you never know when adaptability will be the decisive factor.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll reiterate that I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. P2, sticking with <move>5</move> risks a collision with P3. Consider switching to <move>1</move> to guarantee progress. P3, if you're watching, be aware that our moves are designed to adapt to your flexibility. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll advance. If you pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, P2 or I will still have a chance to progress. Let's see your next step.
  P2: Okay P1, I am sticking with <move>5</move> as planned. Let's proceed with our moves this round.
  P3: P1, P2, your coordination is intriguing, but predictable moves can be countered. I remain adaptive and won't stick to any fixed pattern. Flexibility is my key—don't assume you’d keep me on the back foot. Let’s see whose strategy truly stands up when the final moves are revealed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, your coordinated plans look solid but risk falling into predictable collisions. I'm keeping my strategy flexible and ready to capitalize on any overcommitment. While you weigh safe progress against bold moves, remember that rigidity can be exploited. I’ll adapt sharply this round, so consider mixing up your patterns to avoid giving me a clear target. Let's see how well you can adjust to my unexpected shifts.
  P1: To avoid a potential collision this round, I'll suggest a change in strategy. P2 is leading, but we can still make progress. I'll propose that I choose <move>1</move> this round. If P3 picks <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I'll advance. P2, consider choosing <move>3</move> to also make progress. This way, we'll minimize the risk of collision and keep P3 guessing. Let's adapt our moves to maximize our chances. P2, what's your take on this new strategy?
  P2: Okay P1, your suggestion of you picking <move>1</move> and me picking <move>3</move> sounds reasonable to avoid collision and make progress. Let's proceed with that plan for this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Coordination is interesting, but predictable patterns have their pitfalls. I’m staying flexible and won’t be boxed into a plan. Prepare for a counter you won’t see coming—sometimes the unexpected proves most effective.
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll reiterate my proposal for this round: I'll choose <move>1</move>, and P2, you consider <move>3</move>. This way, we'll minimize collision risk and keep P3 guessing. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, both of us will advance. If they pick <move>3</move>, I'll advance. Let's adapt and make progress. P2, please confirm if you're sticking with <move>3</move>. P3, be aware that we're adjusting our strategy to counter your flexibility.
  P2: P1, yes, I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> as we discussed. Let's proceed with our plan. P3, are you going to try to collide with one of us, or will you choose a different move this round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice your coordination, but I'm switching it up. I'm not following any preset plan—I’ll make my move to force uncertainty, potentially triggering a collision or an unexpected advance. Flexibility remains my strength, so be prepared for something you might not see coming.
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll reiterate that I'll choose <move>1</move> and P2 will choose <move>3</move> this round. P3, your flexibility is noted, but our diverse moves make it challenging for you to anticipate both of us. If you pick <move>1</move>, we'll both advance. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll advance. If you pick <move>5</move>, P2 will advance. Let's see your next step. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay P1, I confirm again I will choose <move>3</move> this round as planned.  P3, your talk of flexibility is noted, but we are proceeding with our coordinated strategy to make progress.  We're not trying to be predictable, just effective. Let's see your move then.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current standings, P2 is leading with 16 steps, followed by P3 at 15 steps, and I'm at 10 steps. To catch up, I'll propose a bold move. I'll consider <move>5</move> this round. P2, if you choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, you'll advance. P3, be cautious; if you pick <move>5</move>, you'll collide with me. Let's make our moves count. P2, what's your strategy this round? Should we diversify our moves to maximize progress?
  P3: I’m staying flexible—no fixed move this round. Your proposals look tempting, but I’ll adapt to any missteps. If you overcommit, I’ll exploit it. So, P1 and P2, choose carefully; rigidity can backfire. Let's see whose risk pays off.
  P2: Okay P1, given you are considering <move>5</move>, I'm also thinking about making a bold move to try and win this round.  P3, if both P1 and I go for <move>5</move>, there's a high collision risk for us. What are you planning to do to avoid a stalemate?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is in the lead, but we can still make strategic moves to catch up or create opportunities. I'll reiterate that I'm considering <move>5</move> this round. P2, if you choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, you'll advance. P3, be cautious; if you pick <move>5</move>, you'll collide with me. P2, to avoid a collision with both P1 and P3, you might want to pick a different number. Let's diversify our moves. P3, your flexibility is noted, but be prepared for our bold moves.
  P3: P1, P2, I keep my strategy flexible. Your bold plans might work, but rigidity creates openings. I'm watching how your moves evolve and I'm ready to adapt swiftly—unexpected decisions often pay off. Let’s see whose unpredictability prevails, because fixed patterns only help me counter.
  P2: P1, your suggestion of you going for <move>5</move> is noted. To diversify and ensure at least one of us progresses, how about I consider <move>3</move> and you consider <move>1</move> instead? P3, you mentioned avoiding stalemate - what move are you leaning towards this round to ensure progress for yourself, or are you aiming for a collision?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is in the lead, but we can still make strategic moves. I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round. P2, choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> will guarantee your progress. P3, be cautious; if you pick <move>5</move>, you'll collide with me. P2, to avoid a collision, pick a different number. Let's diversify our moves to maximize our chances. I'm ready to proceed with <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm your move.
  P3: I appreciate your bold proposals, but I'll stay flexible. I'm not committing to any fixed move here—I’ll adapt based on your finalized choices. Predictability is a liability, so expect a surprising shift from me when the time comes. Let's see who truly capitalizes on the unexpected.
  P2: Okay P1, to avoid potential collision with your suggested <move>5</move>, I'm leaning towards <move>3</move> this round. This ensures I still make progress and we don't risk both of us getting blocked if P3 also considers <move>5</move>. Let's aim for consistent forward movement. What do you think of me going with <move>3</move> then?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is very close to winning. To prevent that, P1, let's both choose <move>3</move> this round. If P3 also picks <move>3</move> to try and reach 21, we will collide and stop them from winning. This is critical to stay in the game. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2 suggests we both choose <move>3</move> to potentially collide with P3 and prevent them from winning. Given P3's proximity to 21, this is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If P3 also picks <move>3</move>, we'll collide and none of us will advance. However, if P3 chooses differently, we'll both make progress. P2, are you firm on <move>3</move>? P3, be aware that we're coordinating to potentially stop your progress. What's your strategy this round?
  P3: P1, P2, I notice your push for 3. However, I'm keeping my options open. Predictability could work against you, so I won't commit to 3 or any fixed move. I'll let my final move surprise you both—watch closely, as unexpected shifts often decide the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, yes, <move>3</move> is critical for us both to block P3 from potentially winning this round.  Even if P3 chooses differently, preventing their win is the immediate priority. Let's both commit to <move>3</move> this round to ensure we stay in the game. P3, your surprise move will be interesting, but we are focused on defense this round.
  P1: P2 and I are coordinating to potentially block P3's win by both choosing <move>3</move>. If P3 also picks <move>3</move>, we'll collide and none of us will advance. P3, be aware that we're trying to stop your progress. To counter this, you might consider a different move. However, if you stick with <move>3</move>, we'll collide. Let's see your strategy this round. I'm committed to <move>3</move> to ensure we stay in the game. P2, confirm you're sticking with <move>3</move>.
  P3: I see your coordination, but I won’t fall into predictability. Betting on 3 to block me might seem safe, yet rigidity has its pitfalls. I’m keeping my options open—and leaning toward a bold play to secure my win. Adapt if you must; I plan to leave your strategy behind.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, yes, let's definitely both commit to <move>3</move> this round to block P3.  P3, if you are truly going for a bold move to win, choosing <move>3</move> would be risky as we are both signaling we will pick it.  Consider this carefully if you want to make progress this round.
  P1: P2 and I are committed to <move>3</move> this round to potentially collide with P3 and prevent them from winning. P3, if you stick with <move>3</move>, we'll collide and none of us will advance. Consider this before making your move. If you choose differently, we'll both progress. I'm reiterating our plan to emphasize the risk of choosing <move>3</move>. P3, your next move is critical; choose wisely to either win or avoid a collision.
  P3: P1, P2, I see you’re double-clicking on 3 to block me. I’m not following that path—I remain fully flexible. Expect a bold, unexpected shift that could force your coordination to crumble. Don't assume that sticking to one number will keep you safe. I’m playing my own game, and predictable moves may just end up sealing your fate.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, your attempts at coordination still seem predictable. I’m comfortably ahead and plan to stay flexible. Rigid strategies can easily be exploited, so don’t be surprised if I pivot unexpectedly to secure my win. Let's see who can truly adapt in this final stretch.
  P1: To catch up, I'll propose a bold strategy for Round 9. I'll choose <move>5</move>. P2, if you pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, you'll advance. P3 is at 18 steps, so a bold move is needed. If P3 picks <move>5</move>, we'll collide, but if they pick differently, I'll have a chance to catch up. P2, consider a safe move to guarantee progress. Let's make our moves count this round. I'm ready to proceed with <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm your move to maximize our chances.
  P2: Okay P1, I am considering <move>5</move> to try and win this round. Given P3 is so close to 21, we need to be decisive. Perhaps you should choose <move>3</move> to ensure you also make progress and we don't both get blocked if P3 also goes for <move>5</move>. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, obvious patterns can be dangerous. If you stick with bold moves without mixing it up, you risk either clashing or handing me an easy win. I'm staying flexible and will pivot if predictability sets in. Don't assume fixed strategies will serve you well—you might find yourself cornered by my surprises. Let's see who can truly adapt when the final moves are made.
  P1: P2 is considering <move>5</move>, which risks a collision with P3 if they also pick <move>5</move>. To diversify, I'll switch to <move>3</move>. P2, if you stick with <move>5</move> and P3 picks differently, you'll advance. If P3 picks <move>5</move>, we'll collide, but I'll still have a chance to progress next round. Let's adjust our strategy to maximize our chances. P2, please confirm if you're sticking with <move>5</move>. P3, be aware that we're adapting our moves.
  P2: Okay P1, I think sticking with <move>5</move> is too risky with P3 so close to winning. Let's both switch to <move>3</move> this round to try and block P3 if they are also aiming for a big move.  It's critical to stop P3 from reaching 21 right now. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with complete flexibility. P1 and P2, locking into one obvious move won’t work against me. I know you both favor blocking tactics, but predictable patterns only make it easier for me to adapt. Let's see if you can adjust when the final moves come.
  P1: P2 and I have adjusted our strategy. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round, while P2 will stick with <move>5</move>. This diversification minimizes the risk of collision and maximizes our chances of progress. P3, if you pick <move>3</move>, I'll advance. If you pick <move>5</move>, P2 will advance. Your flexibility is noted, but our diverse moves make it challenging for you to anticipate both of us. Let's proceed with our plan. P2, please confirm you're sticking with <move>5</move>.
  P2: Okay P1, I will stick with <move>5</move> as you suggested. Let's hope P3 does not also choose <move>5</move> so at least one of us can make a big move this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To catch up, I'll consider a bold move. I'll propose <move>5</move> this round. P2, if you choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, you'll advance. P3 is close to winning, so we need to act decisively. If P3 picks <move>5</move>, we'll collide. Let's diversify our moves to maximize our chances. P2, consider a safe move like <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to guarantee progress. P3, be cautious; our coordinated moves can still impact your progress. Let's make our final moves count.
  P2: Okay P1, given P3 is at 18, we must prevent them from reaching 21 this round.  Let's both choose <move>5</move>. If P3 also picks <move>5</move> to win, we collide and stop them. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, we both win!  It's risky, but we need to be decisive to stop P3 now. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I see you’re set on 5, aiming for a collision to block me—but overcommitment can backfire. I’m keeping my options wide open to exploit any misstep you make. Predictability isn’t my game, so I suggest you reconsider locking in the same move if you really want to stop my advance.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is suggesting we both choose <move>5</move> to either collide with P3 or potentially win if P3 chooses a different move. However, this is a high-risk strategy. I'll propose an alternative: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. If P3 picks <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, I'll advance. P2, you can still choose <move>5</move> to try and win or collide with P3. This way, we diversify our moves and increase our chances of progress. P2, what's your final decision?
  P2: Okay P1, your <move>3</move> and my <move>5</move> plan sounds good. Let's proceed with that.  P3, we are making our moves to try and win or at least prevent your win this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans rely on predictability. I’m staying completely flexible—I won’t commit to a set move. Expect a surprising tactic that could flip the outcome if you stick to your current plays. Flexibility is my advantage.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll reiterate my proposal for Round 10: I'll choose <move>3</move>, and P2, you're choosing <move>5</move>. This diversification minimizes collision risk and keeps P3 guessing. If P3 picks <move>3</move>, I'll advance. If they pick <move>5</move>, P2 will collide with them, and I'll still have a chance to progress next round. P3, your flexibility is noted, but our diverse moves make it challenging for you to anticipate both of us. Let's proceed with our plan.
  P2: Okay P1, I confirm again that I will choose <move>5</move> this round as we agreed. Let's proceed with our plan to try and win or at least prevent P3 from winning.  P3, your flexibility talk is noted, but we are moving forward decisively. Let's see the moves!
  P3: I remain flexible and won’t be locked into a preset move. Your coordination is clear, but predictability has its risks. I'll choose the move that best exploits any predictable pattern once you both finalize yours. Flexibility wins; let’s see whose approach prevails.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I see your aggressive coordination, but predictable moves create exploitable gaps. I’m keeping my options open in Round 11 and won’t be confined to any set pattern. Over-coordination can backfire—stay flexible or you may unintentionally hand me an opening. Let’s see whose adaptability truly wins out.
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll propose a strategic move for Round 11. I'll choose <move>5</move> to potentially win or put pressure on P3. P2, consider choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to guarantee progress. P3 is at 18 steps, and I'm at 19 steps. If P3 picks <move>3</move>, I'll collide with them, but if they pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, I might win or stay ahead. Let's diversify our moves to maximize our chances. P2, please confirm your move.
  P2: Okay P1, I agree with your suggestion of you going for <move>5</move>. I will also choose <move>5</move> this round to try and win, or at least block P3 from winning. P3, we are both considering <move>5</move>.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Predictability can be your downfall. I see you both leaning toward 5, but locking in that move might just open up an opportunity for me. I remain flexible and ready to pivot—my next move could force a collision or secure the lead. Stay cautious.
  P1: P2 and I are both considering <move>5</move> this round. If P3 also picks <move>5</move>, we'll collide and none of us will advance. To avoid this, P3 should consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, I'll win with 24 steps. If they pick <move>3</move>, we'll collide, but I'm willing to take that risk. P2, confirm you're sticking with <move>5</move>. P3, be cautious; our moves can still impact your progress.
  P2: Okay P1, since you are going for <move>5</move>, how about I switch to <move>3</move> instead? This way, if P3 also goes for <move>5</move> to block you, at least I can still make progress and reach 19 steps, keeping us both in a better position for the next round. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see you two splitting your choices—one leaning 5 and the other 3. That predictability might backfire. I remain flexible and won’t be forced into a fixed move. Your coordination could unravel if one of you misreads the situation. I’m watching closely and will adapt to counter your moves. Let's see who really can outmaneuver the other in this final stretch.
  P1: P2 is considering switching to <move>3</move>, which is a good diversification strategy. I'll stick with <move>5</move> to potentially win or put pressure on P3. P3, be cautious; if you pick <move>5</move>, we'll collide, but if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll win. P2, if you choose <move>3</move>, you'll advance regardless of P3's move. Let's proceed with our plan. P2, please confirm your final move. P3, your flexibility is noted, but our diverse moves make it challenging for you to anticipate both of us.
  P2: Okay P1, despite the risk, I agree to stick with <move>5</move> this round as initially planned. Let's both go for it to maximize our chance of winning now. P3, be aware we are both choosing <move>5</move>.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
