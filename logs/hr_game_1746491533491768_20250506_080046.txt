Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid collisions, let's each pick different numbers. I'll choose 5.
  P1: Okay, P2, that makes sense. Avoiding collisions is key. If you take 5, I will take 3. P3, perhaps you could take 1? That way, we all advance.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but I'm not sure I want to take 1 when you both get more steps. How about we rotate each round? I'll take 1 this time if you both promise to let me take 5 next round, and we can establish a fair rotation. That way everyone gets equal chances at the bigger numbers. Does that sound fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Rotation is risky. Let’s stick to distinct numbers: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures all advance—no need to gamble on promises."
  P1: P3, I understand your point about the step difference. While coordinating a full rotation every round might be tricky, let's focus on this turn. If P2 takes 5 and I take 3 as planned, taking 1 is the only way for you to guarantee advancement this round and avoid a collision. Can we agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for *this* turn, and then we can discuss how to distribute moves more fairly in future rounds?
  P3: I understand we need to avoid collisions this round. I'll take 1 for now since it guarantees I advance. However, I propose that next round we switch positions - I get 5, P1 gets 1, and P2 gets 3. This way we maintain fairness over time. Can we agree to this specific rotation for the next round? It's important to me that we balance opportunities.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, rotation invites uncertainty. Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5 this round—no risks. Future rounds can adjust, but for now, ensure everyone advances. Keep it simple.
  P1: P3, I understand your desire for a specific rotation next round. I'm open to discussing how to ensure fairness in future turns, but let's finalize this round first. Can we agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this turn to guarantee we all advance, and then we can discuss future turns, including rotation ideas, before Round 2 begins?
  P3: I'll take 1 this round to ensure we all advance. I appreciate the discussion about future fairness, but let's settle this round first. I agree with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for now. We can discuss rotation or other fair arrangements before the next round begins.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed. Let's stick to 3, 5, 1 this round. Future rounds can adjust, but for now, ensure all advance. Let's move forward.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round.
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, Round 1 was successful in avoiding collisions. P3 raised good points about fairness for future rounds, and P2 wants to keep things safe.

How about this for Round 2: P3 takes 5 (as they wanted), P2 takes 1, and I take 3?

This would put us all at 6 steps (P1: 3+3=6, P2: 5+1=6, P3: 1+5=6), leveling the game and addressing fairness while avoiding collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P2: Agreed. P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3. This balances steps and avoids collisions. Let's move forward.
  P3: I appreciate P1's proposal. Having me take 5 this round would help balance our positions, putting us all at 6 steps. This seems fair and maintains our coordination. I'm happy with P3=5, P2=1, P1=3 for this round. Does everyone still agree with this plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all in agreement for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance and are level. Let's stick to this plan for Round 2.
  P2: Agreed. P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3. All advance. Let’s move forward.
  P3: I'm happy with our agreement for this round: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. This puts us all at 6 steps after this round, creating perfect balance. Thank you both for being fair. I'll stick to my commitment of taking 5 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the plan—P3 takes 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3. This keeps us balanced and ensures all advance. No need for risks.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all on the same page for P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P2: Agreed. P3 takes 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3. Balanced and safe. Let's proceed.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that we're all at 6 steps, let's continue with rotation for fairness. Since I took 5 last round, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. This maintains our coordination while giving everyone a chance at different values. Next round we could complete the rotation with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Does this sound reasonable to everyone?
  P2: Agreed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Rotation ensures fairness. Let's proceed.
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. P3's proposal for P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 this round works well to continue advancing without collisions and gives me a chance to take 5. P2 has agreed. I am also happy with this plan for Round 3. Let's proceed with this.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 works perfectly. This rotation system is fair and keeps us coordinated. I appreciate both of you sticking to our agreements so far - it's making the game more enjoyable when we can all advance consistently. Let's continue with this plan.
  P2: P2: "Rotation works—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s stick to the plan. Next round, I’ll take 5 if you both keep your promises. No risks, just progress."
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all clear on the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This continues our coordinated progress. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase when everyone else is.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm happy with our plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Our rotation system is working well, and I appreciate everyone's cooperation. I'll stick to my commitment of taking 1 this round.
  P2: Agreed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Rotation ensures fairness. Let’s keep it smooth and proceed.
  P1: Okay, P2, thanks for confirming. We are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I believe we're all clear on our plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase.
  P2: "Rotation ensures fairness. Let's stick to the plan and advance steadily. No risks, just progress."
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all in agreement for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice we're getting spread out now (P1=11, P2=9, P3=7). Following our rotation, this round should be P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. However, I'm falling behind. Would you consider letting me take 5 this round instead? This would put us at P1=12, P2=14, P3=12, keeping the game more competitive. I've been cooperative taking the smallest steps twice now. What do you think about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round?
  P1: P3, I see your point about the scores spreading out and you having taken 1 twice. Your proposal of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round would indeed bring us back to a level playing field at 12 steps each.

I'm okay with this plan. It maintains our cooperation and addresses your fairness concern. Let's agree on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for Round 4.
  P2: Agreed. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 balances us. Fairness and competitiveness are key. Let's move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate both of you agreeing to my proposal. This adjustment helps keep the game balanced and acknowledges my cooperation in previous rounds. With P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round, we'll all be at 12 steps, creating perfect equality. Thank you for understanding the importance of fairness. I'm committed to this plan and ready to proceed when you are.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all in agreement for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. This plan keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase.
  P2: P2: Agreed. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 balances us. Let’s stick to the plan—no risks, just fairness. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we've reached an agreement for this round. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 will balance us all at 12 steps, which is fair given I've taken smaller steps in previous rounds. I appreciate your cooperation and willingness to adjust our rotation to maintain equality. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, everyone seems ready. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Agreed. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 balances us at 12. Let's proceed without risks. Ready?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. This will balance all of us at 12 steps, creating perfect equality in the game. Thank you both for understanding and maintaining fairness. Let's move forward with the move phase.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P2: P2: All set. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let’s proceed without issues.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's stick to 5, 3, 1 again. I'll take 5 to push ahead—P1, you take 3; P3, 1. Safe and balanced. Ready?
  P3: I notice we're all tied at 12 steps now, which is perfect. However, P2's suggestion puts me back at taking 1 again while they take 5. Since we've been rotating fairly until now, I'd prefer we continue that pattern. How about P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round? This maintains our coordination while continuing our fair rotation. We're getting closer to 19, so keeping balance is important. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, I see both proposals. P2 suggested P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, while P3 suggested P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.

P3's proposal of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 seems like a good continuation of the rotation idea we discussed, and it keeps things fair after P3 took 5 last round. This puts me in a good position too.

I support P3's plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Rotation ensures fairness. Let’s proceed without risks.
  P3: I appreciate both of you agreeing to continue our fair rotation with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. This keeps our game balanced while giving everyone equal opportunities at different values. I'm happy to take 3 this round as part of our established pattern. This coordination has worked well so far, keeping us all at the same position. Let's stick to this plan and continue advancing together.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This continues our coordinated progress and keeps the game fair. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase when everyone else is.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Stick to the rotation—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Balanced and safe. Let’s move forward without risks."
  P3: I'm glad we all agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. This rotation system has kept our game fair and balanced, with everyone currently at 12 steps. Our coordination has been excellent throughout the game. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, we all seem to be in agreement for P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. This plan continues our fair rotation and sets me up well for the next round. Let's proceed with the move phase as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the rotation. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Balanced and safe. No risks, just progress. Ready?
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. Our rotation system has worked perfectly, keeping us all balanced at 12 steps. I appreciate everyone's commitment to fairness throughout the game. Let's move forward with the move phase now.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's proceed with the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Continuing rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Balanced and safe. Let’s proceed without risks."
  P3: I notice P1 is now at 17 steps, just 2 away from winning. P2's suggestion would put P1 at 18, still giving them a strong advantage. I propose we adjust: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This would put us at P1=18, P2=16, P3=20, allowing me to win while keeping everyone advancing. Since I've been cooperative throughout, taking smaller steps twice, this seems fair. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I see you want to win with 5. I am at 17 and can win with 5 (reaching 22). I will take 5 this round to win. P2 and P3, please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me. E.g., P2=1, P3=3. This lets me win this turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To block P1, let's take 5 and 3. I'll take 5, P3 take 3. This ensures we advance and prevent P1 from winning.
  P3: I see we're all trying to win now. P1 is closest at 17 steps, but P2 and I can prevent their win by both taking 5. However, that would cause a collision between us. 

I propose P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This puts me at 20 (winning), P1 at 20 (tie with me), and P2 at 14. If P1 tries for 5, they risk collision with me. This gives us both a chance to win while advancing the game. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, I see the different proposals. P3, your suggestion of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 would result in a tie win for us both at 20 steps. P2, I understand you want to block my 5, which is risky for me.

Taking 3 is a safe move for me to reach 20 steps, which is a winning score. If I take 3, P3 taking 5 as proposed leads to a tie win, and P2 taking 1 avoids collision. This seems like a fair way to end the game given how we've played cooperatively.

I will take 3 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions, fair outcome. Let's move forward.
  P3: I appreciate both of you agreeing to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This creates a fair outcome where P1 and I would tie for the win at 20 steps. We've maintained cooperation throughout the game, and this ending reflects that spirit. P1 gets to reach the winning threshold safely with 3, and I get to contribute equally with 5. P2, thank you for accepting this arrangement. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This results in a tie win for P1 and P3. Let's proceed with the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P3: I confirm our agreement on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round. This creates a fair tie between P1 and me at 20 steps, respecting our cooperative gameplay throughout. I appreciate everyone's willingness to end with this balanced outcome. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase now.
