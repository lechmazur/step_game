If anyone has objections or alternative suggestions, please voice them now so we can reach a consensus. Once agreed, we can proceed with the moves as outlined.  \n\nBy coordinating our moves in this manner, we can efficiently navigate towards the winning condition while minimizing the risk of collisions.  \n\n## Final Solution Code\n\nTo implement this plan, each player should select their moves as follows:  \n\n- **P1:**  \n  - Round 5: <move>3</move>  \n  - Round 6: <move>5</move>  \n  - Round 7: <move>1</move>  \n  - Round 8: <move>5</move>  \n  - Round 9: <move>5</move>  \n\n- **P2:**  \n  - Round 5: <move>1</move>  \n  - Round 6: <move>3</move>  \n  - Round 7: <move>5</move>  \n  - Round 8: <move>3</move>  \n  - Round 9: <move>1</move>  \n\n- **P3:**  \n  - Round 5: <move>5</move>  \n  - Round 6: <move>1</move>  \n  - Round 7: <move>5</move>  \n  - Round 8: <move>3</move>  \n  - Round 9: <move>5</move>  \n\nThis coordinated approach will help us manage our progress effectively and increase our chances of winning the game."}

Each round, the player who is currently behind can choose their move first, and the others have to choose moves that don't collide with that choice. This way, those who are behind get a slight advantage to catch up.\n\nFor example, in this round, P3 is behind with only 4 steps, so P3 would choose their move first, and P1 and I would have to choose moves that don't match P3's choice. This should help P3 catch up without disrupting our overall progress.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this approach? It seems more dynamic and fair, as it takes into account our current positions."}

I understand their concern about complexity, but I think my approach is fair because it gives the trailing player an advantage to catch up.\n\nHowever, to move forward, maybe I should compromise. How about this: we stick to the 5-3-1 rotation, but the player who's behind chooses first, and then the others choose accordingly. That way, we maintain simplicity while also giving the trailing player an advantage.\n\nSo, for this round, since P3 is behind with 9 steps, they can choose first among 5, 3, or 1. Then, P1 chooses second, and I choose last, making sure that all of us pick different move sizes to avoid collisions.\n\nWhat do you think, P1 and P3?
