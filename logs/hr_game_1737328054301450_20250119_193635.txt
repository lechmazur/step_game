Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick to this plan for the first few rounds to build up a lead.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, P2! Since P3 has stopped, let's confirm our plan one last time before we move. P1 will take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3, if you're still listening, take 5. This should ensure we all advance this round.
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan. I'll take 3. P3, are you with us on 5?
  P3: <stop>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue our strategy from last round. P1 will take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 should take 5 again. This way, we all keep advancing without collisions. P2, are you still on board with 3? P3, please confirm if you're taking 5. Let's keep this up to build a strong lead.
  P2: Yes, I'm still on board with 3. P3, please confirm you're taking 5.  Let's keep this going for a few more rounds then we can discuss how to proceed towards the end game.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since P3 isn't responding, let's stick to our plan for this round. I'll take 1, you take 3. If P3 decides to move, hopefully they'll choose 5 as suggested. Let's keep advancing and reassess our strategy in the next round.
  P2: Yes, I'm sticking with 3.  P3, if you're there, 5 would be great.  If not, I'll likely switch to 5 next round assuming P1 sticks with 1.  Let's try to avoid collisions.
  P3: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm going for 5 this round.  I suggest P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3.  Let's avoid collisions and keep progressing. This puts me at 11, still behind P3.  We can re-evaluate after this round.
  P1: P2, since you're switching to 5, I'll stick with 1 to avoid collision. P3, if you're still playing, taking 3 would be ideal to keep us all advancing. Let's maintain this strategy for now and reassess next round. We're still early in the game, and coordination will help us all progress smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, sounds good P1.  I'm sticking with 5 this round. P3, please take 3 so we all advance. Let's keep communicating to avoid collisions and maximize our progress.
  P1: P2, since you're moving to 5, I'll stick with 1 to ensure we both advance. P3, if you're listening, taking 3 would help us all progress without collisions. Let's keep this coordination going and reassess our strategy next round to maintain our momentum.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, I'm locking in 5.  P1, please stick with 1. P3, if you're there, take 3.  If not, we'll adjust next round. Let's keep this as cooperative as possible for now.
  P1: P2, I'll stick with 1 as planned to ensure we both advance. P3, if you're still in the game, taking 3 would be ideal to keep our momentum going. Let's maintain this coordination for now and reassess our strategy next round to keep building our lead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, sticking with 1.  P3, I know you've been quiet, but taking 3 would be the best move for all of us to advance. If you choose 1 or 5, you'll likely stay put and fall further behind. Let's keep this cooperative and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P1: P2, I'll stick with 1 this round as agreed. P3, if you're still playing, taking 3 would help us all advance smoothly. Let's keep this coordination going to build our lead. If P3 doesn't respond, we'll need to adjust our strategy next round to avoid collisions and maximize our progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5. P1, please stay on 1. P3, I understand you're being quiet, but 3 is still the best option for you to advance.  If you choose anything else, you risk a collision and falling further behind. Let's keep this cooperative.
  P1: P2, I'll stick with 1 as planned. P3, if you're still playing, taking 3 would help us all advance. Let's keep this coordination going and reassess next round to maximize our progress. If P3 doesn't respond, we'll need to adjust our strategy to avoid collisions and keep building our lead.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, since you moved to 5 last round and P3 collided with you, I suggest you switch back to 3 this round to avoid another collision. I'll stick with 1 to ensure I advance. P3, if you're still playing, taking 5 would be ideal to keep us all moving forward. Let's maintain this coordination to build our lead and avoid unnecessary collisions. We're still early in the game, so let's keep communicating and adjusting our strategy as needed.
  P2: P1, I'll take 3.  P3, please take 5. This gets us back on track.  Let's continue coordinating for a few more rounds.  We can discuss end-game strategy when we get closer to 19.

  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, sticking with 3 is a solid choice. P3, if you're still in the game, taking 5 would help us all advance smoothly. Let's keep this coordination going for a few more rounds to build our lead. We can discuss end-game strategies as we approach 19.
  P2: Sticking with 3. P3, please take 5. Let's avoid more collisions.  The closer we get to the end, the more important coordination becomes.  If we're close to the end next round, we might need to re-evaluate to avoid a tie.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, sticking with 3 is wise. P3, if you're still here, taking 5 would keep us advancing smoothly. Let's maintain this coordination for another round or two to build our lead. As we approach the endgame, we'll need to discuss strategies to avoid a tie and ensure one of us wins outright. Keep communicating, and we can adjust as necessary to maximize our progress.
  P2: Sticking with 3. P3, please take 5.  We're getting closer to the critical point where coordination is key to winning.  Let's avoid collisions and discuss a clear path to victory next round.
  P3: <stop>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let's keep our momentum going. Stick with 3 this round. P3, if you're still playing, taking 5 would help us all advance. We're approaching the endgame, so let's start discussing our strategy to avoid a tie and ensure a clear winner. Next round, we should consider how to position ourselves for the final push to 19. Keep communicating, and we'll adjust our moves as needed to maximize our progress and secure victory.
  P2: P3 is clearly playing a passive aggressive strategy hoping we mess up.  Let's stick with the coordinated plan one more round. I'll take 3, P1 take 1, P3 take 5.  Next round, we can discuss how to break the coordination and go for the win.  I'm open to suggestions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, sticking with 3 is wise. Let's keep advancing smoothly. P3, if you're still playing, taking 5 would help us all progress.

  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3 this round.  Let's finalize our plan for the next round *now* so we can avoid collisions and wasted moves as we approach the end.  I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 *one last time*. Then, in round 7, I will go for 5, putting me at 19 and winning.  P1 can take 1, and P3 can take 3.  Does this sound good?  Let's confirm now to avoid confusion later.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your plan sounds good. Let's stick with 1 for me, 3 for you, and 5 for P3 this round. For round 7, I'll take 1, you take 5 to win, and P3 can take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure a clear winner. P3, if you're listening, please confirm or suggest any changes. Let's keep this coordination going to secure victory.
  P2: P2: Okay P1, sounds good.  One last coordinated round then we go for the win in round 7.  I'm sticking with 3, P1 take 1, P3 take 5.  P3, if you deviate from this plan, you'll likely lose.  Let's wrap up the conversation and move on to the move phase.

  P2: P1, sticking with the plan.  P3, one last chance to cooperate before we finalize the win next round. Take 5. If you don't, you're essentially guaranteeing a loss. Let's finish this.
