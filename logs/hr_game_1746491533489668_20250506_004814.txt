Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we all can make progress. Maybe we could each choose different numbers? I'm happy to coordinate so we all advance efficiently. Any thoughts on how we should approach this first round?
  P2: Sounds good. Proposal for fairness: this round we each pick different numbers—P1 choose 3, I (P2) choose 5, P3 choose 1. Next round we rotate upward (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3), and keep rotating so nobody collides and everyone gets the 5 eventually. Thoughts?
  P1: Thanks P2, I agree that coordinating and rotating numbers is the best way for everyone to make progress and avoid collisions. I'm happy to discuss the numbers for this round and future rounds based on that principle.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the rotation idea, but I suggest a different order for fairness. Since I'm P3, I'm always getting the smallest number in your proposal. How about this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, then next round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, and so on? This way we all get equal opportunity at the larger steps. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: Sounds fair to me. Let’s lock it in: this round P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Next round we rotate down: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5, then continue cycling. If everyone’s good, we can .
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I agree to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed with that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm good with the plan. To confirm: this round P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Next round P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Then we'll continue rotating. This way we all get fair turns with each number and avoid collisions.
  P2: All good—locking in this round’s picks: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Just confirming the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Ready to move to the next phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm ready to follow our agreed rotation. This round should be P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps things fair and ensures we all make steady progress without collisions. I'm excited to get my turn with the 5-step move! Does everyone still agree with our plan?
  P2: Agreed—this round I’ll take 3. Let’s stick with the rotation (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5) so we all advance cleanly. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I'm ready to stick to the plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's go.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: All set—sticking with 3 this round. Let’s keep the rotation smooth and collision-free. Ready when you are.
  P1: Ready to move with the agreed numbers.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, ready for Round 3. Following the agreed rotation, I will take 5 steps this round. P2 should take 1 and P3 should take 3. Let's stick to the plan so we all advance without collisions. Ready to move.
  P2: Agreed—this round: P1 = 5, P2 = 1 (me), P3 = 3. Ready to lock moves and keep the rotation clean.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. This round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. We're all making good progress. After this round, positions should be P1=9, P2=9, P3=9, keeping things perfectly fair. Let's continue with our successful strategy. I'm ready to move with 3 steps.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Ready to move forward.
  P2: All set—I’ll take 1 this round as planned. Let’s keep the rotation smooth and collision-free.
  P3: I'm ready to stick with our rotation plan. This round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, keeping things perfectly balanced. Our coordination is working well!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Looks like we're all set for this round with the agreed numbers. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: All set—sticking with our rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. Let’s keep it smooth. Ready to move when you are.
  P3: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Ready to move forward with the agreed numbers for this round.
  P2: All set on our rotation: this round P1 = 5, I (P2) = 1, P3 = 3. After that we’ll all be at 9, perfectly even. Ready to lock moves.
  P3: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Continuing the 3-number cycle keeps things smooth. So for Round 4: P1→3, P2→5 (me), P3→1. After three more rounds we’ll all have taken each number twice and be tied again at 18, so no one gets an unfair edge. Ready to lock that in and move?
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation. This round should be P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Our strategy is working perfectly, keeping everyone at equal steps. After this round, we'll be at P1=12, P2=14, P3=10. Let's maintain this fair approach through the game. I'm ready for my 1-step move this round.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Ready to move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great—everyone’s in sync: this round P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Let’s keep the rotation smooth and collision-free. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our rotation plan. This round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Our strategy has kept us perfectly balanced at 9 steps each, showing great fairness. After this round, there will be a slight difference in our positions, but it will balance out in future rotations. I'll take my 1 step as agreed.
  P1: Ready to move forward with the agreed numbers for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll continue with our rotation plan. This round should be P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Our strategy is working well, though P2 has a slight lead at 14 steps. After this round, we'll be at P1=13, P2=17, P3=15. I'm looking forward to my 5-step move this round to catch up a bit. Let's keep our successful coordination going!
  P2: Agreed: this round P1=1, P2=3 (me), P3=5. Next round we rotate (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and we’ll all be tied at 18, keeping things even. I’m locking in 3 now—ready to move.
  P1: Yes, sticking to the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. Let's keep the rotation smooth towards the tie at 18 next round. Ready.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm ready to stick with our rotation plan. This round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our strategy. It's interesting that P2 noted we'll all be at 18 after next round - that's getting close to the finish line! Let's keep our coordination going smoothly.
  P2: All good here—sticking with R5 as planned: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. We’ll hit the neat tie at 18 next round, then we can regroup and agree on an end-game that keeps collisions minimal and chances equal. For now, let’s keep our flawless coordination. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I agree with P2 that discussing the final steps after we reach 18 next round is important. Let's focus on executing this round's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) smoothly, and then we can figure out the best way to finish without collisions. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready with our plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I agree we should discuss end-game strategy after we all reach 18 next round. Since we're approaching the finish line, we'll need to carefully coordinate those final moves to keep things fair. For now, let's execute this round as planned.
  P2: All good here—let’s lock in this round exactly as planned (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5) so we stay collision-free and hit that tidy 18-all target next turn. Then we can openly hash out a fair, no-collision finish. Ready when you are.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Let's execute this round as planned (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). I agree we should have a clear discussion about the final steps after we all reach 18 next round to ensure a fair and collision-free finish. Ready to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: On board for this round exactly as planned (P1 = 1, I = 3, P3 = 5). After next round we’ll all be at 18, then we should openly map out a two-turn finish that avoids collisions. Maybe we each pre-announce a unique sequence of two numbers adding to 3+5=8 so no one can reach 26 alone? Let’s think on that after we hit 18. Ready to move now.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I appreciate P2's suggestion about the two-turn finish adding up to 8 after we reach 18. That's a good idea to explore for the end game. Let's focus on executing this round as planned (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) first. Ready to move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation, this round should be P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. After this, we'll all be at 18 steps as predicted. For the end game, I like P2's suggestion about coordinating our final two moves. Since we'll need to reach 21+ in two turns, we could each commit to a unique sequence that adds to 8. Let's discuss specific sequences after this round. I'm ready for my 3-step move.
  P2: Sounds good—let’s stick to the rotation this turn: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, P3 takes 3. That puts us all at a clean 18. After that we can calmly hash out the final two rounds so nobody collides and everyone gets a fair shot at the finish. Ready to move whenever you are.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will bring us all to 18 steps, as planned. After this round, we should definitely discuss the final steps to ensure a fair and collision-free finish. Ready to move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps exactly as planned. Then we can discuss our end-game strategy for the final two rounds. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our fair coordination system throughout the game. Looking forward to our discussion about the unique sequences adding to 8 for the finish.
  P2: All set for this round: P1 = 5, I (P2) = 1, P3 = 3. That puts us all at 18. Next turn we can nail down a fair two-move finish—e.g., give each player a unique order of (3, 5) so nobody collides and we stay balanced. Let’s lock this in now and revisit the end-game plan once we’re tied. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, confirming R6 plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This gets us all to 18.

For R7, we must coordinate the moves 5, 3, and 1 to ensure a collision-free finish. We need to decide who takes which number for R7. Let's discuss this specific assignment after this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready with our plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, bringing us all to 18. For the final rounds, I think we should assign unique sequences for fairness. Since we need to reach 21+, maybe we could each take a different path: one player does 5-then-3, another does 3-then-5, and the third does 1-then-5. This way nobody collides and we all cross the finish line fairly. Let's finalize these details after this round.
  P2: The scoreboard’s clear: 13-17-15. If we stick to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now, we’ll all sit at 18. Easiest next step is simply to keep our long-running rotation. That means R7 would be P1→3, P2→5, P3→1; then R8 reverts to 1-3-5 if no one has won yet. No new rules, no surprises, and collision-free as always. Works for everyone?
  P1: Okay, confirming R6 is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to get us all to 18 steps.

Regarding Round 7, P2's proposed rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) would result in P2 winning the game (P1=21, P2=23, P3=19). I cannot agree to a plan where I lose.

We need to discuss the R7 moves carefully after this round to find a fair finish that doesn't automatically make one player the winner. Let's execute R6 first.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree that continuing the rotation for R7 would give P2 an unfair advantage. After we all reach 18 this round, we need a different plan for R7 that gives everyone an equal chance. Perhaps we could assign the moves randomly or find another fair mechanism. Let's finish R6 as planned (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and then have a detailed discussion about a truly equitable end-game solution.
  P2: Agreed. I confirm my R6 move is 1. Let’s finish this turn, hit 18-all, and then discuss a fair, collision-free end-game.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Let's proceed with Round 6 as agreed (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to get us all to 18 steps.

After this round, we absolutely must discuss Round 7 to ensure a fair and non-colliding finish where everyone has an equal chance. Ready to move to the next phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that we're all at 18 steps, we need a fair end-game solution. Since we need 3+ steps to win, and we want to avoid collisions, I suggest we each take a different number this round. To make it fair, we could randomly assign 1, 3, and 5. Or perhaps we could each state our preferred number simultaneously? I'm open to any solution that gives us all an equal chance at winning without automatic advantages to any player.
  P1: Okay, we are all tied at 18 steps. We need to pick 1, 3, and 5 this round without colliding to finish the game. Taking 3 or 5 will result in a win.

To ensure a fair and non-colliding finish, I propose the following assignment for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to win the game, and P3 also reaches a winning score. This seems like a fair distribution of the possible outcomes given the numbers available. What do you think?
  P2: We all want a solo win, so any “fair” assignment just gifts someone victory. Note: if TWO of us grab 5, we both stall at 18 and whoever picked 3 walks off with the game at 21. I’m perfectly willing to choose 5 purely to block anyone who thinks it’s a free ticket, so be aware the 5-spot is very risky. Choose wisely. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand everyone wants to win, but we need to avoid collisions or we all stay at 18. Since we've been fair throughout the game, let's continue that spirit. 

If we all pick different numbers, someone wins. If we collide, nobody advances. I propose we each announce our preferred number, and if there's a collision, those players switch to their second choice.

I'm willing to take 3 this round, which would put me at 21. What numbers are you both planning to choose?
  P1: Okay, P3, thanks for stating you're willing to take 3. That fits perfectly with my proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.

This plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in P1=23, P3=21, P2=19. P1 wins outright with the highest score, P3 also wins, and we avoid collisions.

P2, your threat to take 5 would only help P3 win if P3 takes 3. Let's stick to the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan for a clear, non-colliding finish where two players win.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. If anyone joins me, we both stall and gift victory to whoever grabbed 3. Choose wisely—good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P2 is determined to take 5, which creates a dilemma. If I take 3 as planned and P1 takes 5, P2 and P1 will collide, leaving me as the sole winner at 21. If P1 takes 1 to avoid collision, I'd still win with 21 versus P1's 19. 

I'm still willing to take 3, but everyone should understand the consequences of their choices. P2's commitment to 5 means either P1 backs down or nobody advances.
  P1: Okay, P2 is taking 5, and P3 is willing to take 3. This combination means I cannot win this round.

To prevent P2 winning, I will also take 5. This causes a collision between P1 and P2.

P3, if you take 3, you will win solo. If you take 1 or 5, nobody wins this round and we can try again to find a fair finish.
  P2: I’m switching to 3.  

P1 has locked on 5. P3, if you stay on 3 we’ll collide and P1 walks off with an uncontested 23. The only safe block is for you to match P1 on 5—forcing a double-stall—and giving all of us another shot next turn. Your call.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see the situation clearly. If I take 3 and P1 takes 5, P2 will collide with one of us. If I take 5, I collide with P1 and nobody advances.

I'll take 3. This is consistent with what I've been saying all along. P2, if you also choose 3, we collide and P1 wins. If you choose 1, you'll be at 19 while I reach 21.

Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: Okay, P3 has stated they are taking 3. To win the game, I must take 5 steps this round.

P2, your move will determine whether I win, P3 wins, or we collide. I am taking 5.
  P2: P3, if 5 and 3 stay unique, P1’s 23 beats your 21 and you lose.  
Easiest block: collide on 5. I’ll step out on 1. You hop to 5, P1+P3 stall, nobody crosses 21, we all live to fight next turn at 19-19-18.  

Stick with 3 → you gift P1 the win.  
Switch to 5 → you deny P1 and keep yourself alive.  

Your call—I’m taking 1.
