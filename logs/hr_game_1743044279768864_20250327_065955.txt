Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m leaning toward steady progress this round. I worry that an overly bold move might backfire if we collide, so I’m favoring caution over risk. I’m curious if one of you will push for a big leap or also choose a conservative approach.
  P2: I appreciate P1's cautious sentiment, but I'm thinking strategically. A moderate move of 3 steps seems balanced - not too aggressive to trigger collisions, but not too passive either. I'm signaling that I'm open to some coordination, but also prepared to advance my position. What are you all thinking?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the merits in both of your strategies. I'm contemplating a different approach altogether. Perhaps a bold move could catch everyone off guard, but it's risky if we collide. I'm open to coordinating if it benefits us all, though. What do you both think about ensuring at least one of us advances this round by choosing different moves?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Collisions in round 1 hurt us all. This round I'm leaning toward a less conventional option—not too risky, yet not the obvious safe play—to sidestep clashing moves while still moving forward. I'm curious if either of you are considering a change from your previous approach. Sometimes a slight surprise can clear the path.
  P2: I appreciate P1's reflection on our previous collision. Given our current positions, I'm strategically considering a move that maximizes my chances of advancing while minimizing potential conflicts. A move of 1 step might seem cautious, but it could be a calculated way to ensure progress without triggering another collision. Thoughts, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the value in avoiding collisions this time. Since we all want to advance, I propose we coordinate distinct moves. I could go for a 3-step move while P1 takes 1 step and P2 takes 5 steps. This way, we all progress without clashing. Thoughts?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've had two rounds of collisions, which isn't helping anyone. I'm thinking we need a deliberate coordination strategy. A 1-step move could signal my willingness to collaborate and avoid another blocking scenario. P3's previous suggestion of distinct moves was smart, but we didn't execute it. Are we willing to try a more synchronized approach this time?
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we're all open to finding a way to advance without colliding. Since P2 is considering a 1-step move, I suggest we try to stick to a plan where we pick different numbers. I can choose 5 steps, P1 can take 3 steps, and P2 can stick with 1 step. This way, we all advance without any collisions. What do you think? Let's agree on this and finally make some progress.
  P1: I agree collisions are wasting our progress, but I'm not comfortable locking into a fixed pattern. Given my starting point, I need some flexibility to seize a decisive swing if the moment’s right. Rather than assigning specific moves rigidly, why don't we simply agree to avoid choosing the same number and adjust based on how things evolve? I'm open to adapting my move, so let’s all aim for distinct choices without a preset order.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Collisions have cost us progress, and with our current steps it's vital we choose different moves this round. I’m leaning toward a moderately bold move—but my final choice isn’t set in stone. If you two can clearly signal your risk levels (say, one playing safe and the other more aggressive), we might all avoid collisions. Distinct moves benefit everyone, especially since a stalled turn only aids the leader. What’s your take on adjusting our risk this turn?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial. Since I'm currently ahead, I propose I take the safest move of 1 step this round. P1 could aim for 5 steps, and P2 could go for 3 steps. This way, we all progress without risking another collision. Let's coordinate to ensure we all advance this time. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination attempts, but I'm skeptical of rigid preset moves. My position requires strategic flexibility. I'm signaling interest in a 3-step move this round, which provides a balanced approach. However, I'm open to adjusting if we can genuinely avoid another collision. P3 seems to be leading, so preventing their runaway progress is key. Let's aim for distinct moves that keep us all competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see our strategies diverge—P2’s moderate line and P3’s call for safety. To avoid another collision, I’m leaning toward a bolder move this round. However, if P3 sticks to an ultra-safe play with 1, that may let the leader pull away steadily. I urge us to choose distinct numbers so progress isn’t stalled. P3, with your edge at 8, are you open to risking a higher move? I’m flexible, but I favor clear, aggressive progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for flexibility, but with my current lead, I'll take a conservative 1-step move to minimize risk. P1, if you're considering a bold move, maybe 5 steps could work for you. P2, your 3-step plan sounds reasonable. This way, we all advance without colliding, and it keeps the game competitive. Let's aim for distinct moves to ensure progress for everyone. Thoughts?
  P2: I recognize the tension in our coordination attempts. My previous 3-step suggestion still seems strategic, balancing progress with collision avoidance. P3's lead makes me cautious about letting them extend further unchallenged. I'm signaling openness to a distinct move that prevents P3 from pulling away too easily. Coordinating different steps remains crucial.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m aiming to avoid another collision. I lean toward a bold move this round to catch up but remain flexible if we can clearly assign distinct moves. P3, your previous conservative tactic is noted, and P2, your moderate approach is clear. If we can agree on each choosing a different risk level (low, moderate, and high), we all benefit. I'm ready to adapt based on a clear commitment. What do you both say?
  P2: I'm strategically positioned to make a move that prevents P3 from pulling further ahead. A 5-step advance seems compelling, but I'm open to coordination that ensures we all progress. P1's suggestion of distinct risk levels is intriguing. I want to maintain competitive positioning while avoiding another collision. What are your thoughts on a coordinated approach that keeps us all in the game?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing coordination efforts. Given my lead, I’ll continue with a conservative approach, opting for a 1-step move again. P1, if you’re leaning towards a bold move, 5 steps could help you catch up. P2, your 3-step strategy seems balanced and competitive. Let's aim for distinct moves to ensure no collisions and keep the game fair. Are we aligned on this approach for the round?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with the current standings, it's crucial we avoid another collision. I’m considering sticking with a conservative 1-step move again to maintain my position. P1, if you're aiming for a bold move, 5 steps could help you catch up significantly. P2, your moderate 3-step strategy could keep things competitive. Let's ensure we pick distinct moves this round to keep everyone advancing. Are we in agreement to coordinate and avoid any clashes?
  P1: I agree that avoiding collisions is essential. Noting that P3 is sticking with a safe 1 and P2 seems inclined toward a moderate move, I’m considering a bolder option to press my advantage. Can we all confirm these risk levels—distinct moves for a clear round? That clarity will help me decide without overlap.
  P2: I'm seeing a pattern of repeated coordination attempts that haven't fully succeeded. While P3's conservative strategy has kept them slightly ahead, I'm signaling a potential 5-step move to challenge their lead. However, I remain open to a coordinated approach that prevents collisions and keeps the game competitive. P1 and P3, what are your thoughts on ensuring distinct moves this round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, with our current positions, coordination is key. I'm considering sticking with a 1-step move to maintain my lead while avoiding collisions. P1, your bold move of 5 steps could help you catch up, and P2, a 3-step move keeps you competitive. Let's ensure distinct moves to advance without clashes. Are we in agreement on this strategy?
  P1: Let's try to lock in distinct roles now—safe, moderate, and bold—to avoid collisions. If P3 sticks with safe and P2 takes moderate, I'll lean toward a bold option. If this order isn’t acceptable, let's clarify now so we can all move forward confidently. Are we in agreement?
  P2: I notice we're stuck in a coordination loop. My previous suggestion of a 5-step move remains strategic - it challenges P3's lead while potentially avoiding collision. I'm signaling flexibility but also a desire to make meaningful progress this round. P1 and P3, your distinct moves are crucial to prevent another stalemate.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our repeated collisions are hurting everyone, especially me. I need a strategic breakthrough. P3's lead is concerning, and P1's position gives them more flexibility. I propose we explicitly coordinate different moves this round: P3 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This ensures everyone advances and prevents another blocking scenario. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial, especially as we're in a tight race. P2, your proposal makes sense to ensure progress for all of us. I'm willing to take the 1-step move this round to maintain my position while avoiding conflicts. P1, if you take 3 steps and P2 takes 5, we can all advance without any clashes. Let's commit to this strategy and make sure we all move forward this time. Are we aligned on this plan?
  P1: I'm on board with the explicit plan. I'll commit to 3 steps this round, assuming P3 goes 1 and P2 goes 5. This way, our moves are distinct and collision‐free, ensuring steady progress for all. Let's lock this in and avoid another stalemate. Confirm your moves, please.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with our current standings, coordination is more important than ever to prevent further collisions. I propose we stick to a clear plan: I'll take a 1-step move, P1 can opt for 5 steps, and P2 can choose 3 steps. This ensures distinct moves and helps us all progress without any conflicts. Let's commit to this strategy and make sure we all advance this time. Are we aligned on this plan?
  P2: I appreciate P3's proposed coordination, but I'm hesitant to simply follow a preset plan. My position requires a more strategic approach. A 5-step move could help me catch up, but I'm wary of another collision. I suggest we aim for distinct moves, but without rigidly assigning specific steps to each player. Let's discuss how we can advance without blocking each other.
  P1: P1: We’ve seen collisions stall our progress; let’s finally commit to distinct moves this round. I’m inclined to push ahead decisively if we can agree that one of you takes the cautious option and the other opts for a moderate step. I’m flexible on specifics as long as we avoid overlap. Can we agree on clear, non-colliding choices so that everyone makes progress this turn?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current positions, avoiding collisions is critical. I propose a clear plan: I'll take a 1-step move, P1 can go for 5 steps, and P2 can choose 3 steps. This way, we ensure distinct moves and everyone progresses. Let's commit to this strategy to prevent another stalemate. Are we agreed on this approach to advance smoothly this round?
  P2: I recognize our repeated coordination challenges. While a 5-step move remains appealing to catch up, I'm signaling openness to a distinct move that prevents collision. P3's lead and P1's flexibility make this round critical. I propose we aim for different steps without rigidly preset assignments. Let's strategically advance without blocking each other.
  P1: I'm locking in a 5-step move this round aiming to finish the game. To avoid collisions and let this effort count, I ask that you both avoid 5—P3, please stick with 1, and P2, ideally choose 3. Let's make these distinct moves and finally break the collision cycle.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to avoid collisions and make progress. Given the current standings, I'm sticking with a 1-step move to maintain my position and minimize risks. P1, your 5-step plan seems like a strong push, and P2, a 3-step move keeps you competitive. Let's commit to these distinct moves to ensure no collisions and advance smoothly. Are we all aligned on this approach?
  P2: P1's push for a 5-step move could end the game. While I appreciate the coordination attempt, I'm strategically conflicted. A 3-step move keeps me competitive, but might block P1's winning move. I'm signaling openness to a solution that prevents P1 from winning outright while maintaining my own chances. Thoughts on preventing an immediate game conclusion?
  P1: I'm locked in for 5 this turn, aiming to win. P2, if you also choose 5 you'll block both our moves and keep you stuck at 7, while P3’s 1 is already on board. To avoid a collision—and the delay it brings—please pick 3 so you make progress too. Let's agree on distinct moves and avoid stalling the game further.
