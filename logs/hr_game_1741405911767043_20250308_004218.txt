Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick to that plan for the first turn.
  P1: I agree. Let's stick to P2's plan for this turn to avoid collisions. We can reassess coordination in the next round based on our progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we’re all aligned on the plan for this turn. Let’s stick to our agreed numbers—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions and gives us a clean start. If we can maintain some level of coordination in the next rounds, we’ll have a better chance of staying ahead. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: Okay, confirmed. 1, 3, 5 for this first turn.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: P3, your plan for this round seems reasonable. Rotating the numbers helps us avoid collisions while keeping progress steady. I’m fine with taking 1 this turn, as long as everyone sticks to their assigned moves. P1, do you agree with P3’s proposal? If we can maintain this coordination, we’ll stay on track without setbacks. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P1: I agree with rotating, but let’s swap my and P3’s numbers this time. I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This helps me catch up without collisions. Okay?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good P1. 5 for you, 3 for me, and 1 for P2.  Let's confirm and move to the next round.
