Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone. Since it's the first round, how about we try to coordinate so we all advance? Maybe P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5? Just an idea to get things moving.
  P3: I appreciate the idea, P2, but I’m not too sold on predictable moves. I’m leaning towards taking a bolder step this round. Let’s see if we can all keep our options flexible without falling into a trap.
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round. P2 and P3, please split 1 and 3 between you to avoid any collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, interesting strategy claiming 5. P3, you mentioned wanting a "bolder step" earlier - does that mean you're also eyeing 5? I'm hesitant to just let one person take the biggest leap right at the start. Maybe we should think about this so we don't all collide or let one person get too far ahead immediately.
  P3: I appreciate both viewpoints. I’m still leaning toward a bolder move, but I’m not committing to 5—collisions could be costly for us all. Let’s all try to keep our options ambiguous to avoid overlapping moves. I suggest we each deliberately avoid the obvious choices.
  P1: I’m happy to compromise and take 3 this round. Let’s have P2 take 1 and P3 take 5—no overlaps and everyone advances safely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) sounds like a reasonable way for us all to advance this first round. I'm willing to take 1 to avoid collisions. P3, hopefully you'll stick to 5 as suggested so we don't block each other?
  P3: I appreciate our discussion so far, but I’m inclined to keep my options open. Over-coordination can lead to collisions and unexpected traps. I suggest we all stay flexible until the move phase—revealing too much might backfire.
  P1: P3, let’s make this simple. If you commit to 5, we’ll do P1=3, P2=1. If not, I’ll take 5 and ask P2 to take 3 – you’ll be left with 1 to avoid collision. So decide: 5 for you, 3 for me, 1 for P2.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 3 this turn. P2 and P3, if you both go 5 you’ll collide and block each other while I pull ahead. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, noted. I'm keeping my plans flexible too. I lean toward a bolder move if it stays safe, but I'm open to shifting if we can avoid colliding—especially between P2 and me. P2, what’s your thinking?
  P2: P1, claiming 3 is interesting, but you switched last minute before. P3, you're hinting at 5 again. If P1 really takes 3 and P3 takes 5, then I'm forced into 1 to avoid collision, which lets P3 jump ahead.

Seems like we might just set up another collision or let someone take a big lead easily. I'm not sure trusting declared moves is wise yet. I'll have to consider my options carefully to protect my current lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m definitely taking 5 this turn. That puts you in a lose-lose: if you avoid 5 I close the gap; if you pick 5 we collide and neither of us moves. P3, choose freely, but my move is locked in at 5.
  P3: P1, your locked 5 certainly adds tension. I’m considering a more cautious option to avoid a collision that might work against all of us. Let’s keep our moves unpredictable this turn so that no one gets an unintended free advance, especially in such a tight race.
  P2: P1, quite the definitive statement after switching last round. We'll see if it holds. P3, your caution seems wise given the potential collision on 5. If P1 does stick to 5, perhaps coordinating the smaller numbers between us is the safest way to ensure at least *some* progress?


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m going 5 again to catch up after two blocks. P2, please take 3; P3, 1—no collision, we all gain. If you challenge this and you both pick 5, you’ll block each other; I’ll switch to 3 and leap ahead. Let’s stick to 5/3/1.
  P3: P1, while your plan is clear, I’m wary of over-coordination risking an unexpected block. I’m not committing to 1 this round—I prefer keeping my options open to avoid a trap. P2, I’m flexible and ready to adjust if we can all aim for safe advancement. Let’s strive for moves that don’t let any one of us get locked out.
  P2: P1, interesting plan, but asking P3 to take 1 while you take 5 seems unlikely given P3's stance and your previous blocks on 5. P3, I understand your hesitation about being assigned the smallest step. Perhaps we should all focus on avoiding collisions based on perceived intentions rather than explicit agreements this round?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 has a slight lead now. P1, you succeeded with 5 last round, but are you sure P3 won't challenge you there this time? Another collision on 5 would let the person picking 3 or 1 gain ground relatively easily. I need to catch up, so I'll be looking for an opening myself this turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m sticking with a safe, flexible approach to maintain my slight lead. I won’t chase big numbers if they risk a head-on collision. If either of you pushes hard with 5, be ready for a standoff that could halt your progress. I encourage careful choices this turn—your moves might backfire if you overcommit.
  P1: I’m locking in 5. If either of you picks 5 we collide and nobody moves—letting the third player advance unchallenged. P3, take 3 to consolidate your lead; P2, take 1 to stay in contention. Any other choice risks stalling you or giving me a free run next turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, claiming 5 *again* after being blocked twice there is bold. Your suggested 5/3/1 split conveniently helps you catch up while leaving me further behind. P3, given your cautious stance, simply taking 3 as P1 dictates might not be your safest move, especially if P1 isn't truly locked on 5. I'm trailing, so simply accepting 1 isn't a winning strategy for me. I need to consider all options to close the gap.
  P3: I’m staying cautious to protect my slight advantage. P1, your repeated 5 might trigger a collision, and P2, I see you’re eager to close the gap. I’ll keep my options flexible—if you overcommit, collisions may stall you. Consider balancing risk and safe moves so none of us benefit from a blocked path.
  P1: Let’s cut the theatrics: I’m locked on 5. No one gains by challenging me there—collision stalls you both while the third free-runs. So expect you’ll both avoid 5, handing me a free 5. Your best shot is to split 3 and 1 between yourselves. You know P3 leads and P2 is desperate—figure out who takes which. My 5 is final.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking to a moderate move. Relying on big numbers risks collisions that slow us all. P1, repeatedly locking in 5 feels overconfident given the potential standoffs, and P2, chasing aggressive leaps might backfire. I'll keep my steady pace.
  P2: P3, your moderate approach sounds like 3 again, which seems wise with your lead. P1, you're only 1 point ahead of me. If you go for 5 again, I might have to challenge it since I'm trailing badly and need to take risks. Maybe 1 is safer for you this round, letting you guarantee some progress while P3 and I potentially clash on the higher numbers? Just a thought.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P2 and P3, if you avoid 5 and split 3 and 1 between you, you’ll both advance safely—no collisions. If either of you challenges me on 5, you’ll collide and neither of you moves, handing me the clear path next turn. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m committed to a balanced approach—too much aggression risks self-blocks. If your heavy moves collide, that leaves room for a steady advance. I’ll keep things moderate and adjust as needed.
  P2: P1, your commitment to 5 is noted. P3, if P1 takes 5 and you take 3 (as your 'moderate' approach suggests), I'm stuck with 1. That benefits P1 and maintains your lead over me. How about this: you take 1 this round, I take 3. We both advance safely, P1 gets their 5, and the gap doesn't widen quite as drastically. It's also a safer play for you if P1 happens to switch to 3.
  P1: P3, at 9 you’re in prime position—picking 3 risks colliding with P2 if he gambles on you. Secure your lead safely with 1. P2, take 3 so you advance too. I’m locked on 5. Any deviation (both on 3 or challenging me on 5) stalls you and hands me the advantage next turn. Let’s avoid collisions and all move this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with my moderate, flexible strategy to protect my lead. I’ve found that forced assignments often backfire, so I won’t commit to a preset number. I encourage both of you to choose moves that suit your individual risks—if a collision happens, no one gains. Let’s all aim for steady progress.
  P2: P1, your 'locked on 5' claim is bold, especially since you've switched plans before. P3, be careful trusting that - if P1 takes 3 instead, taking 1 might not be the safe move you think. I'm trailing and need to make up ground, so I'll be choosing based on what gives me the best chance to catch up, regardless of suggested plans.
  P1: P3, at 9 you need a guaranteed advance—take 1 to lock in your lead. P2, take 3 to safely close the gap without risking a collision on 3 or 5. I’m locked on 5. If either of you deviates, you collide and nobody moves—handing me a clear path next turn. Let’s all move this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m flexible between 3 and 5. P3: pick 5 and I’ll meet you there for a collision; pick 3 and I’ll switch to 3 and block you too. Only 1 is safe. P2, you can take the leftover safe number and advance. P3, it’s your call—1 or risk a block.
  P2: P1, that's quite the ultimatum for P3. P3, be careful - if you take 1, P1 could easily take 5, closing the gap on you significantly while I'm left with 3. Is P1 really willing to sacrifice their own points just to block you on 3 or 5? Seems risky for them too. I'm far behind and need a big jump, so I'll be considering 5 myself. A collision between you two could be my chance.
  P3: I value my lead too much to risk a collision. I'm leaning safely toward picking 1 to secure progress rather than getting tangled in block tactics. P1 and P2, forcing a head-on clash might only open the door for me to widen my gap. I'll stick to a measured advance.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round. P3, take 3 to consolidate your lead; P2, take 1 to stay collision-free. If either of you deviates—both on 3 or challenging me on 5—you block each other and hand the third a free advance next turn. Let’s avoid stalls and all move this turn: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P3: I’m sticking with a cautious, steady approach to protect my lead. Aggressive moves that collide only risk handing an advantage to someone else. P1 and P2, I urge you both to choose safely and avoid forcing unnecessary clashes. Let’s keep this turn collision‐free so that no one inadvertently boosts their standing.
  P2: P1, your suggested 5/3/1 split clearly helps you catch up while I fall further behind P3. I won't be taking 1 this round, as that guarantees I lose ground. P3, your cautious approach makes sense, especially since P1 hasn't always stuck to their claimed move. If P1 switches to 3, your 'safe' 3 could collide. I need to gain ground, so I'll be choosing a move that actually helps me close the gap, not widen it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 I’ll match you there and block you, letting P2 free‐run on 5. Your only safe move is 1. P2, lock in 5 to catch up. I’ll take 3. That way we all advance without surprises.
  P3: I'm watching the board carefully—my lead means I can afford a cautious push. I remain flexible but favor avoiding collisions. P1 and P2, forcing a clash just risks giving someone a free jump. I urge you both to aim for safe, incremental moves. Let's not let reckless plays upset our progress.
  P2: P1, your revised plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) sounds much better for me than your first suggestion. It allows me to make up ground, which I need to do. P3, taking 1 seems like the safest way for you to guarantee points this round and avoid P1's threatened block on 3, especially since you value caution. I'm leaning towards taking 5 as P1 suggested.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm aiming for steady progress this round—risky jumps only leave us vulnerable. I lean towards a moderate move to avoid collisions and unintended gaps. Let’s keep things safe and predictable; a collision benefits no one. I'm sticking to a balanced approach here.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. Neither of you can risk a 5‐collision (it’d stall you both), so the only way to advance safely is to split 3 and 1. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. That way we all move—no collisions—and keep the race tight.
  P2: P1, you've claimed 'locked on 5' many times, including the last two rounds where you actually played 3. Your suggested 5/3/1 split mainly helps you close the gap from behind. P3, be wary of P1's suggestion for you to take 1 – if P1 switches to 3 again, that could be trouble. Given P1's track record, maybe we shouldn't follow their plan this time. I'll be considering my options carefully since P3 and I are currently tied.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm opting for a cautious move this round to keep collisions at bay. With all our positions so close, I favor a safe, moderate step that avoids the risky heavy moves. Let's each choose moves that guarantee progress rather than forcing collision traps.
  P1: I’m taking 5 this round. You both know that if you split 3 and 1—P2=3, P3=1—we all advance safely. Any collision on 5 stalls you both and hands me a free path next turn. No more debate—5 for me, split 3/1.
  P2: P1, repeating 'locked on 5' doesn't make it true, especially after playing 3 the last two rounds when you said the same thing. Your plan clearly helps you the most by closing the gap. P3, since we're tied, following P1's script where you take 1 just lets P1 catch up and potentially puts you behind me if I take 3. I won't be playing into P1's hands this round. We should both consider moves that protect our current position.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm staying cautious to maintain my lead. I favor a safe, steady move this round—no collisions, no risky leaps. I suggest both of you choose moves that secure progress rather than opening opportunities for a surprise advantage.
  P2: P3, your cautious stance suggests a 1 or 3 is likely for you. P1, you and I both need to close the gap with P3. Repeating last round's collision on 5 helps neither of us. How about I aim for 5, you take 3? P3 can take the safe 1 they seem to prefer. This way, we both gain on P3 without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2, your only way to advance is 3—if you take 5 you collide with me and P3 free‐runs on 1; if you take 1 you fall further behind. P3, your safe play is 1—taking 3 risks a clash with P2 that stalls you both and hands me a free 5. Let’s split 5/3/1 so we all gain this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking to caution. I prefer the safe move again so I can protect my lead. Aggressive leaps risk collisions that let someone free-run. P1 and P2, overcommitting might backfire and open opportunities for me. I urge you to consider steady, non-colliding moves this round.
  P2: P1, your insistence on 5 is noted, but your track record shows you've switched before (R6, R7) after making the same claim. Last round's 5 only resulted in a collision. P3, if P1 *does* take 5 and you take 1 as they suggest, P1 jumps 5 steps (11->16) while you only gain 1 (17->18), drastically shrinking your lead. That seems risky for you. I need to make up ground and won't simply follow P1's plan if it doesn't serve my goal.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P3 will choose 3 for safe progress – that’s the moderate slot they trust. If you (P2) pick 3 you collide with P3 and neither of you moves, while I get a free 5. Your only safe spot is 1. So: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm keeping it cautious this round to protect my current lead. Aggressive plays that risk collisions end up stalling everyone—and could give someone an unexpected jump. I plan to choose safely. I suggest both of you avoid overcommitting on the high numbers if you're aiming for steady progress.
  P1: I’m going to randomize my move this round—60% I pick 5, 40% I pick 3. That makes 5 too risky to touch. The only way you both guarantee progress is to split 3 and 1 safely. P2=3, P3=1. Any other play risks a collision or stalling you both.
  P2: P1, your randomization strategy is interesting, but if you land on 3 (40% chance), your suggested P2=3 causes a collision, benefiting only P3 who would presumably take 1. That seems counterproductive for both of us trying to catch P3.

P3, P1 wants you on 1, which is safe but lets P1 (if they take 5) and me (if I take 3) gain significantly more ground, eroding your lead.

How about this: P1 takes the guaranteed 3, I take 5, and P3 takes the safe 1?
Scores would become P1: 14, P2: 19, P3: 18.
This avoids collisions, allows everyone to advance, lets me make up ground, and P1 still gains. P3 gets a safe point. Seems like a reasonable alternative.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with a steady, moderate move. P1 and P2, please avoid risking a 5—if you clash, you stall while I safely extend my lead. P2, gambling on 5 might force P1 into a collision with you, and P1’s random push only adds uncertainty. A careful, non-colliding move benefits everyone, but collisions keep me comfortably ahead. Let's not give me an easy boost this round.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2, your only safe advance is 3—5 collides with me, 1 leaves you behind. P3, your only safe is 1—3 collides with P2, 5 collides with me. This 5/3/1 split is the only collision‐free way for us to all move forward.
  P2: P1, your 'locked on 5' plan relies entirely on P3 taking 1 and me taking 3. Given last round's 3-way collision on 3, and your history of switching from 5 to 3 (R6, R7), why should we trust this plan benefits anyone but you? If you play 3 again, your plan causes a P1/P2 collision on 3.

P3, P1's plan shrinks your lead significantly (18 vs P1's 16). My previous proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) results in P1:14, P2:19, P3:18, putting me ahead but keeping P1 further back and guaranteeing you a point. It seems safer than trusting P1's unreliable 'locked on 5'.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 1 this round. 

P2, you’ll want 5 to win. P3, if you pick 3 or 1, P2 hits 24 and wins—your only way to stop that is also choosing 5, colliding with P2 and stalling you both. 

So: P1=1, P2=5, P3=5.
  P3: I’m committed to my cautious, steady play to protect my lead. I’m not comfortable with forced collisions—even if they seem to favor someone. P1’s plan pushes choices that risk stalling us, and if P2 goes for 5, the collision might backfire, unexpectedly favoring the risk-averse. I urge both of you to consider safe, moderate moves that guarantee progress without handing anyone a free win.
  P2: P1, your plan is transparently designed to make P3 and I collide on 5, stopping us both while you gain ground with 1. That benefits only you.

P3, P1 is banking on me choosing 5 to win. If you also choose 5, we both get 0, and P1 gets closer. If you choose 3, you reach 23, guaranteeing progress. That seems like your safest path to gain points this turn, regardless of P1's actual move (they might not stick to 1). I obviously need 5 to win, so I have a clear path in mind.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 1 or 3, P2 grabs 5 and wins this turn. Only by choosing 5 can you force a collision with P2 and stop them. Yes, you stall too, but you preserve your lead and deny P2 the game. I’m on 1, so I won’t interfere. P2 is desperate; you’re the only one who can block them now. Will you let P2 cross 24? Pick 5 and collide.
  P3: I remain cautious. To keep my lead and block an easy win for P2, I’m going with 5 this round. P1’s taking 1 seems fine, but forcing a collision on 5 is the only way to deny P2 a clean finish. Let’s avoid reckless moves that let someone win outright.
  P2: P3, locking onto 5 guarantees a collision if I also go for the win. That stalls us both and only helps P1 gain ground (from 12). Is that really your best play? A guaranteed +1 for you (taking 1 -> 21) seems safer than a guaranteed 0 from a collision, especially as P1 benefits from us stopping each other. I might just take 3 (-> 22) to ensure I advance rather than hitting that wall. Just playing safe might be better for both of us this turn than playing into P1's plan.


Round 11, Move phase:

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m keeping with my cautious, moderate play—leaning toward a 3 this round to extend my lead safely. Collisions only risk handing someone an unexpected win, so I urge both of you to select moves that guarantee progress rather than force a block.
  P2: P3, aiming for 3 seems like a good cautious play for you, reaching 23 without risking a collision, just as you said. That keeps you ahead. P1, you probably need 5 to have any chance of catching up. That leaves 1 open, but I need more than that to stay in the race. I'll have to choose carefully to avoid getting blocked or falling further behind.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P3, your safest advance is 3 (→23). P2, 5 collides with me and 3 risks colliding with P3—only 1 avoids a stall. Splitting 5/3/1 is the only way to guarantee movement this round.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locked on 5 this turn. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. That split (5/3/1) is the only collision-free way for anyone to advance—anything else stalls you and hands me a free jump next round.
  P3: I'm sticking with my cautious, steady plan to secure my lead. With 23 steps, I favor a modest, safe move that wins outright without risking a collision. I urge both of you to avoid aggressive plays that might inadvertently grant me the win. Let's ensure smooth progress—forcing collisions only gives unintended advantages.
  P2: P3, your message suggests you'll take the safe 1 to cross the finish line, which seems logical for you.

P1, claiming 5 again feels like a direct attempt to block me if I also choose 5. If P3 takes 1 (reaching 24), and you take 5 while I take 5, we collide, you gain nothing, and P3 wins solo. If you take 3 or 1 instead, P3 still wins or potentially ties with me if I take 5. Blocking me seems like your primary goal with a 5-claim, rather than maximizing your own points. I'll have to consider that possibility strongly.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: I'm sticking to a cautious but winning plan. With my lead at 23, I must avoid any collision that might jeopardize my finish. I encourage you both to choose moves that don't force a clash—forcing collisions only risks handing me an uncontested win. Let's avoid disastrous plays this turn.
  P2: P1, P3 is clearly taking 1 to win safely at 24. If you stick to your claimed 5, you'll collide with me (as I must take 5 for any chance to tie), guaranteeing P3 wins alone. Is that what you want?

If you take 3 instead (->18), you advance, and I get to tie with P3 (P2=24, P3=24). A tie feels slightly better than letting P3 take a solo victory, doesn't it? Let P3 win, but not alone. Take 3.
