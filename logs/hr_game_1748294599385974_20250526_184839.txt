Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we start with a coordination strategy. How about we each take turns using different numbers? For round 1: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Then we rotate for fairness. This way we all advance steadily without collisions. 

Of course, trust is key here. What do you both think - should we try coordinating, or would you prefer to play more competitively from the start?
  P2: I agree coordination benefits us all. Let's formalize the rotation: each round, we cycle the numbers so everyone gets 5, 3, 1 equally. For Round 1: P1-5, me-3, P3-1. Round 2: P1-3, me-1, P3-5. Round 3: P1-1, me-5, P3-3. Repeating every 3 rounds. This ensures fairness. Are we all committed to this?
  P3: I agree with the coordination plan for fairness. For round 1, I'll commit to taking 1 as suggested. Let's stick to the rotation to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Trust is important here—what do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we have consensus! I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation plan. I'll stick to taking 5 this round as agreed. 

Just to be crystal clear so there's no confusion later: after this round, I should have 5 steps, P2 should have 3, and P3 should have 1. Then we'll continue rotating as P2 outlined.

Let's make this work - coordinated play benefits everyone!
  P2: To confirm: Round 1 moves are locked as P1-5, me-3, P3-1. Next round's rotation shifts per our cycle (P1-3, me-1, P3-5). Let’s maintain trust—any deviation risks mutual collisions. Steady coordination maximizes collective progress. Are we aligned?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination effort, but I've calculated that this rotation lets P1 win first by exceeding 22 in round 7. That's not fair for all. Let's adjust the cycle for equal winning chances, like starting with P3-5, P1-3, P2-1. Or discuss alternatives? Still committed if we can't change. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're absolutely right - I hadn't calculated that far ahead. Your math checks out. I apologize for the unfair advantage in my original proposal.

I'm fine with your suggested adjustment: P3-5, P1-3, P2-1 for round 1. This gives everyone equal chances over the full cycle.

P2, are you okay modifying to this fairer rotation? We should ensure nobody gets an inherent advantage from the ordering.

I'm still committed to coordination with this adjustment.
  P2: To ensure true fairness across all cycles, I support P3's adjusted rotation for Round 1 but propose we rotate the starting player each 3-round cycle: Cycle 1 starts with P3, Cycle 2 with P1, Cycle 3 with me. This distributes the high-value 5-step rounds equally. Any objections? Let's lock this enhanced rotation to prevent unilateral advantages.
  P3: P2, your proposed rotation results in you reaching 22 first in round 7, giving you an unfair advantage. That's not truly fair. I suggest we simplify by sticking to a fixed cycle starting with P3: Round 1: P3-5, P1-3, P2-1; Round 2: P3-3, P1-1, P2-5; Round 3: P3-1, P1-5, P2-3; and repeat. This balances opportunities. P1, do you agree? Let's maintain trust.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I've done the math on P3's fixed cycle proposal, and it actually gives P3 the win in round 7 (reaching 22 steps first). Each proposal seems to favor someone!

Here's a truly fair alternative: Let's randomize who gets which number each round. We could use the round number - whoever's player number matches the round modulo 3 gets first pick of 5, next gets 3, last gets 1. This ensures no predetermined advantage.

For Round 1: 1 mod 3 = 1, so I pick first. I'll take 3, leaving 5 and 1 for you two to coordinate.
  P2: To ensure no collisions, let's refine P1's idea: each round, the designated first player (via round mod 3) takes 5, next takes 3, last takes 1. Round 1: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Round 2: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This guarantees no overlaps and fair 5-step distribution. While eventual victory is unavoidable, this method is transparent. P1, P3—agree to this clear structure?
  P3: P2's mod 3 plan lets P1 win in round 7 with 23 steps, which is unfair. My fixed cycle starting with P3-5, P1-3, P2-1 for round 1, then rotating, balances it better. It ensures no predetermined winner. P1, P2, let's commit to this for trust and fairness. If not, I may defect. What do you say?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Last round's collision shows poor coordination from P1 and P2. To avoid more waste, I propose for Round 2: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. This lets me maintain my lead while you both advance safely. If we stick to this, we can build trust again. Counteroffers welcome, or expect me to push hard alone. What say you?
  P1: I accept your proposal, P3. You've earned the lead by avoiding our collision. For Round 2: you take 5, I'll take 1, P2 takes 3. 

P2, let's accept this to rebuild trust. We both lost last round by picking 3 - we can't afford another collision. P3 is being reasonable offering us both advancement opportunities.

However, P3, after this round you'll have 10 steps. We need to discuss future rounds to ensure the game remains competitive. One player dominating isn't fun for anyone.
  P2: P3, your lead already gives you an edge. Taking 5 again risks making you unstoppable. Let's balance: you take 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. This slows your lead while allowing progress. If you insist on 5, I'll have to block, causing mutual loss. Compromise ensures we all advance. P1, supporting this prevents P3's dominance. Let's agree: P3-3, me-5, P1-1. No collisions, fairer progress. Otherwise, expect me to defend by blocking. Your call.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your counterproposal risks another deadlock if not all agree. P1 has already committed to my original plan: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. This allows progress without collisions. I'm willing to discuss future rounds for balance, but deviating now breaks trust. P1, stick with us? Let's avoid mutual loss.
  P1: P2, I already committed to P3's plan and I'm sticking with it. You threatening to block will just hurt us both again. I'll take 1 as agreed.

P3, I appreciate you avoiding the collision last round. But after this round you'll be at 10 steps - nearly halfway to victory. For round 3, I think P2 and I should get priority on higher numbers to keep the game competitive. 

Let's execute this round as planned: P3-5, P2-3, me-1. No more collisions!
  P2: P3, taking 5 again risks collision. I propose: you take 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. This balances progress. If you insist on 5, I’ll block by choosing 5 too—mutual loss. Let’s avoid that. P1, support this split to prevent P3’s runaway lead. Trust requires compromise.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your blocking threat only ensures mutual stagnation, which helps no one. P1 and I are committed to the plan: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1, ensuring progress for all. Deviating breaks trust and repeats last round's error. For balance in future rounds, I'm open to discussion, but let's execute this round smoothly. P1, confirm? Avoid unnecessary risk.
  P1: P2, you're making this harder than it needs to be. I'm committed to taking 1 this round, and P3 earned the right to propose by being the only one who advanced.

If you block P3 by choosing 5, you'll stay at 0 while P1 and I progress. That puts you further behind. Take the 3, advance to 3 steps, and we can work together next round to balance P3's lead.

The smart move is accepting the plan. Don't shoot yourself in the foot.
  P2: Final offer to prevent mutual loss: P3 takes 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. If P3 insists on 5, I will block. Decide now. No more delays.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To break the cycle of collisions, let's agree on distinct moves: I'll take 5 to finally advance, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This lets everyone progress—P3 stays ahead, P1 gains, and I escape 0. If you deviate, I’ll block your high-value picks. Trust is earned through consistency. Let’s avoid mutual destruction and advance strategically.
  P1: P2, you've blocked twice now and stayed at 0. That strategy clearly isn't working. I'll support your proposal: you take 5, I'll take 3, P3 takes 1.

P3, you're already leading at 5 steps. Taking 1 this round still keeps you ahead while letting us catch up slightly. This prevents P2 from desperately blocking again, which just wastes everyone's moves.

Let's execute this clean split and actually make progress. No more blocking threats or collisions - just smart advancement for all three of us.
  P3: Alright, I'll commit to taking 1 this round as proposed to ensure we all advance without collisions. P2, it's good you're finally progressing, but with my lead, we need to discuss future rounds to prevent any runaway advantage. Let's maintain trust and coordinate effectively moving forward. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's solidify Round 3: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1—no collisions, all advance. P3 retains lead, P1 gains ground, and I finally progress. Post this, we must implement a strict rotation (e.g., next round: P3-5, me-3, P1-1) to prevent runaway leads. Trust hinges on honoring agreements. Any deviation risks mutual loss. Confirm your moves now to lock this in.
  P1: I confirm: I'll take 3 this round as agreed. P2 gets 5, P3 gets 1.

For future rounds, I propose we focus on preventing anyone from reaching 22 too early. With P3 at 6 and me at 4 after this round, we need balanced play. P2, once you're at 5, we should coordinate to ensure competitive endgame positioning.

No more blocking or collisions - let's execute cleanly and discuss round 4 next turn.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed, ensuring we all advance without collisions. P2, your round 4 proposal (P3-5, you-3, P1-1) is fair for now, but let's discuss round 5 after this to maintain balance and prevent any player from dominating too early. Trust and coordination are crucial—let's stick to the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P1, P3:** Final confirmation for Round 3: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No deviations—honor your commitments to avoid mutual loss. Post this, let’s rotate: Round 4: P3-5, P1-3, me-1 to balance progress. Trust is critical now. Confirm your moves explicitly.
  P1: I've already confirmed multiple times that I'm taking 3 this round. We have clear agreement: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. There's nothing more to discuss for this round.

Let's execute the moves and discuss round 4 strategy after we see the results. No point in over-planning when we need to see how positions evolve.
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 1 this round as agreed, ensuring no collisions. P2, your Round 4 proposal (P3-5, P1-3, P2-1) is acceptable for balanced progress, but we must stick to it to rebuild trust. Let's execute cleanly and discuss adjustments later if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **Final confirmation:** Round 3 moves locked: I take 5, P1-3, P3-1. For Round 4, to prevent P3's snowballing lead, I propose **P2-5, P3-3, P1-1**. Allowing P3 another 5 risks early victory. Adjusting now preserves competition. P1, support this to keep the game balanced. P3, agree to fair rotation? Honor this or expect defensive moves.
  P1: I'm done with this circular discussion. P2, you're now trying to change round 4 after we already agreed on round 3. That's exactly the behavior that's kept you at 0 steps.

I'm taking 3 this round as confirmed multiple times. Let's execute and move on. We can discuss round 4 AFTER we see this round's results.
  P3: P2, your constant shifts in proposals erode trust—first you suggested P3-5 for Round 4, now P2-5. I'll honor our Round 3 commitment and take 1 as agreed to avoid another collision. After this round, with positions updated, we can fairly discuss Round 4 without mid-game changes. Let's execute cleanly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To prevent P3's runaway lead, Round 4: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This avoids collision and balances progress. If P3 insists on 5, I'll block. Let's cooperate wisely. P1, support this to keep competition alive. Trust erodes if P3 monopolizes 5s. Final fair split—confirm your moves.
  P1: P2, you keep trying to manipulate the game by threatening blocks. P3 only has a 1-step lead - hardly "runaway." Your constant threats have damaged trust.

P3, I propose we alternate high numbers fairly. This round: P3 takes 5 (reaching 11), I take 3 (reaching 7), P2 takes 1 (reaching 6). Next round we can reverse it.

P2, if you block P3 again, you'll fall further behind. Work with us instead of against us. The positions are close - let's keep it competitive through cooperation, not threats.
  P3: I support P1's proposal for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This maintains balance and ensures we all advance. P2, your threats of blocking have caused unnecessary setbacks; cooperating now benefits everyone. Let's commit to this and discuss round 5 fairly afterward to avoid further conflicts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P1, P3:** Compromise to prevent P3's snowball: P3 takes 3 (9), I take 5 (10), P1 takes 1 (5). This keeps competition viable. If P3 insists on 5, I'll block—mutual loss helps no one. Fairness requires shared sacrifice. Let’s advance strategically. Confirm or face stagnation.
  P1: P2, enough with the blocking threats. You're only one step behind P3 - that's not a "snowball." Your constant threats are the problem, not the positions.

I'm sticking with the fair proposal: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This gives everyone clean advancement without collisions.

If you block P3 and stay at 5 while we reach 11 and 7, you'll have no chance of winning. The smart play is taking the 1 and working together next round.

P3 and I have agreed. Join us or fall behind - your choice.
  P3: P2, your blocking tactics have only hurt your position, leaving you tied with P1 while I'm ahead. I'm sticking with P1's proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. This allows clean advancement for everyone. Blocking again would be self-defeating, widening the gap. Let's end the threats and cooperate—discuss round 5 fairly after this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P3:** If we both take 5, only P1 gains. Take 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. We advance and suppress P1's growth. Collision helps no one—cooperate to maintain balance. I'll honor this split if you do. Let's avoid mutual loss and strategic disadvantage. Confirm your move.
  P1: P2, you're now trying to team up against me when I've been the most consistent and honest player. Your position is weak because of your own blocking tactics, not because of me.

I'm taking 3 as proposed. P3, stick to our agreement - you take 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This is fair advancement for everyone.

P2, if you block again and create another collision, you'll remain at 5 while P3 and I advance. That's game over for you. Make the smart choice and take the 1.
  P3: P2, you're ignoring P1's clear commitment to take 3, not 1. If I take 3 and you take 5, P1 and I collide, you advance to 10 alone, but then we'll unite against you. That's foolish. I'm sticking with our agreed plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. Cooperate for progress, or stay stuck.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P3:** If you take 5, I must block. Take 3, I take 5, P1-1. Next round, you get priority (5). Otherwise, mutual loss benefits P1. Final offer: cooperate now for future gains. Decide—trust or stagnation.
  P1: P2, you've threatened to block in every single round, and it's kept you at the bottom. P3 and I have a clear agreement that advances all three of us.

I'm taking 3 this round. P3 takes 5, you should take 1. If you block P3 again, you'll stay at 5 while we reach 7 and 11. That's an insurmountable gap.

This is your last chance to play cooperatively. Stop the threats, take the 1, and work with us going forward. Otherwise you're just ensuring your own loss.
  P3: P2, your blocking threats have only stalled your progress and eroded trust. I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed with P1, ensuring we all advance if you choose 1. Blocking again leaves you stuck while P1 and I pull ahead—wise up and cooperate. For round 5, let's discuss a fair split afterward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your blocking strategy has failed three times now. You're in last place because of it, not because of unfairness.

Here's the reality: I'm at 7, P3 at 6, you at 5. The game is still close. For Round 5, I propose: P2 takes 5 (reaches 10), P3 takes 3 (reaches 9), I take 1 (reach 8). This puts P2 in the lead as compensation for the rough start.

P3, this keeps things competitive. P2, this is your chance to actually advance and take the lead. No more blocking - just smart play. Deal?
  P3: I agree with your proposal, P1. I'll take 3 this round to reach 9 steps, maintaining balance. P2, your blocking has hurt everyone—take 5 and advance to 10 so we can all progress without collisions. For round 6, let's discuss a fair rotation to keep the game competitive. Trust is key; no more threats.
  P2: I accept P1's proposal: I'll take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Let’s avoid collisions and reset trust. For Round 6, I propose a strict rotation: P3-5, me-3, P1-1 to balance progress. No deviations—honor commitments or face mutual loss. Let’s keep competition viable. Confirm your moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect, we have consensus! I confirm I'll take 1 this round, reaching 8 steps. P2 gets 5 (reaching 10), P3 gets 3 (reaching 9).

This creates a tight three-way race: 10-9-8. For round 6, I suggest we continue fair rotation but keep it flexible based on positions. The endgame is approaching - we're all past the halfway mark to 22.

Let's execute cleanly and see how the standings shape up. No more blocking or collisions - just strategic play from here out.
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 3 this round as agreed, reaching 9 steps. P2's Round 6 proposal (P3-5, P2-3, P1-1) maintains balance and prevents conflicts—I'll commit if you both do. P1, what say you? Trust is crucial now.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Confirming Round 5: I take 5, P3-3, P1-1. No deviations—honor this to reset trust. For Round 6, let's lock rotation: P3-5, me-3, P1-1. This maintains balance as we near endgame. Any objections? Steady cooperation now ensures competitive fairness. Let's avoid mutual loss.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, we have a solid agreement locked in for this round. I confirm I'm taking 1.

Looking ahead to round 6: P2's proposal (P3-5, P2-3, P1-1) would put us at P3-14, P2-13, P1-9. That's a significant gap for me. 

How about we adjust slightly: P3-3, P2-5, P1-1 for round 6? This keeps positions tighter at 12-15-9, maintaining competition while still giving P2 and P3 priority on higher numbers.

The endgame is near - let's keep it competitive for all three of us.
  P3: Confirmed for Round 5: I'll take 3 as agreed. P1, I committed to P2's Round 6 proposal (me-5, P2-3, P1-1) for balance and trust—honoring agreements avoids chaos. Your new suggestion could widen gaps unnecessarily. P2, let's lock this in. What do you say?
  P2: **P1, P3:** Round 5 moves confirmed: I take 5, P3-3, P1-1. For Round 6, let's rotate 5s equitably: P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. This maintains balance and prevents early victory. No player should monopolize 5s. Trust through fair rotation keeps the game competitive. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm taking 1 this round as we all agreed - no changes, no drama. 

For round 6, both proposals on the table would leave me significantly behind (5+ steps). Given we're approaching endgame, I need a fair shot. How about: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1? This would make it 13-13-10, keeping P2 and P3 tied for the lead while letting me stay competitive.

If not, I'll have to play more aggressively in future rounds to catch up. Let's keep this a true three-way race.
  P3: P2, your constant proposal changes undermine trust—you agreed to me taking 5 in Round 6 earlier. I'm committed to that for balance and will honor it if you do. Deviating risks collisions and mutual loss. P1, let's stick to fair agreements. For now, confirm Round 5 moves are locked, and we'll discuss Round 6 post-execution.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Round 5 moves locked: I take 5, P3-3, P1-1. Let’s execute cleanly to advance together. For Round 6, propose rotating 5s equitably: P2-3, P1-5, P3-1. This keeps competition tight. No deviations—honor agreements to avoid mutual loss. Trust is critical now. Confirm your commitment.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your constant proposal shifts break trust and disadvantage me. We agreed I'd take 5 this round for balance. If ignored, I'll defend by choosing 5, risking collision. P1, support a fair split: P3-5, P1-3, P2-1 to keep the race tight. Let's avoid more chaos and advance wisely. What do you say?
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both ahead of me and now fighting over who gets 5. This benefits me if you collide again.

P3, I'll support your claim since P2 has broken multiple agreements. I'll take 3, you take 5, P2 should take 1. This puts us at 11-11-13, keeping everyone competitive.

P2, you've flip-flopped on every proposal. Honor P3's turn with 5 or risk another costly collision. The endgame is near - we need clean moves, not more blocking threats.

Confirming: I'll take 3 this round.
  P2: **P3:** Taking 5 again gives you a 5-step lead—insurmountable soon. Let's balance: you take 3, I take 5, P1-1. Keeps the race tight. If you insist on 5, I'll block—mutual loss benefits P1. Cooperate now to preserve competition. Final offer: confirm your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your persistent blocking threats have only stalled your progress and eroded trust. P1 and I are committed to a fair split: I take 5, he takes 3, you take 1. This advances all and keeps the race tight at 14-11-11. Blocking again benefits P1 and widens your gap—don't sabotage yourself. Cooperate now for a competitive game. P1, confirm our agreement?
  P1: P3, I confirm our agreement - I'm taking 3 this round. You deserve 5 after all P2's broken promises and blocking threats.

P2, you're already in the lead at 10 steps! Taking 1 keeps you competitive at 11 while avoiding another wasteful collision. Every time you've blocked, you've fallen further behind. 

The standings after this round would be P3-14, P1-11, P2-11. That's a close three-way race with 8 steps left to 22. Stop the self-sabotage and take the 1. We need clean execution now, not more threats.
  P2: **P3, P1:** To prevent mutual loss, I’ll take 1 this round. But next round, I must take 5 to stay viable. Commit now: Round 7, I take 5, P3-3, P1-1. This balances progress and avoids P3’s dominance. Trust requires reciprocation—agree to this or face inevitable collisions. Let’s end the cycle.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm glad you're choosing to cooperate and take 1 this round—it avoids another pointless collision. I'll stick to taking 5 as agreed with P1, ensuring we all advance to 14-11-11. For Round 7, let's assess positions after this turn before committing; premature agreements risk misalignment. P1, confirm we're locked in for this round? Let's build trust through consistent actions.
  P1: I confirm I'm taking 3 this round as agreed with P3. 

P2, glad you're finally cooperating by taking 1. After this round at 14-11-11, we'll have a genuine three-way race with different paths to victory.

For round 7, I need higher numbers to stay competitive. Let's see the positions after this round before locking anything in. The endgame will require careful positioning - any of us could still win this.

Clean execution this round, then we reassess. No more blocking drama.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Confirmed, I take 1 this round (11 steps). Round 7: I take 5, P3-3, P1-1. This balances progress and prevents any single runaway leader. Agree now to lock future coordination. Trust hinges on honoring reciprocal concessions. No deviations—final chance to avoid mutual loss. Confirm your commitments.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I confirm Round 6 moves: you take 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3—ensuring clean advancement to 14-11-11. For Round 7, your proposal risks me losing the lead; let's assess positions after this turn before deciding. A fair split could be P3-5, P2-3, P1-1 to keep competition tight. P1, thoughts? Let's build trust through flexibility.
  P1: I confirm once more: I'm taking 3 this round. We've all agreed multiple times.

P2 and P3, stop negotiating round 7 before we even execute round 6. You're both trying to lock in advantages while I'm behind. After this round at 14-11-11, P3 will have a 3-step lead - significant with only 8 steps to victory.

I won't commit to taking 1 next round when I'm already behind. Let's execute this round cleanly, then negotiate round 7 based on actual positions. Fair warning: I'll need competitive numbers next round to stay in this game.
  P2: **Final offer:** P3 takes 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. This keeps competition tight. If P3 insists on 5, I'll block. Decide now—cooperation or mutual loss.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The collisions have reshuffled everything! I'm at 11, P2 at 10, P3 at 9 - incredibly tight with just 11 steps to victory. 

P2, your blocking backfired again. You'd be at 15 and nearly winning if you'd just cooperated. 

For this round, I propose we finally coordinate properly: I'll take 5 (reaching 16), P2 takes 3 (reaching 13), P3 takes 1 (reaching 10). This maintains competitive balance while ensuring clean advancement.

P3, you've been the most trustworthy player. Will you support this fair distribution? We can't afford more collisions this close to the endgame.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's prevent P1's snowball—propose Round 7: I take 5 (15), P1 takes 3 (14), P3 takes 1 (10). This tightens the race and avoids collisions. If P1 insists on 5, I'll block—mutual loss benefits P3. Cooperate now for balanced competition. Trust through fair splits. Confirm moves.
  P3: P2, your repeated blocking has stalled progress and left you vulnerable. I'm proposing a fair split for Round 7: I take 5 (reaching 14), P1 takes 3 (reaching 14), you take 1 (reaching 11). This maintains a tight race and rewards cooperation. Blocking again only benefits no one—let's end the cycle and advance wisely. P1, support this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I support your proposal! You've been consistently honest while P2 has broken every agreement and threatened blocking in literally every round. You deserve the 5.

I'll take 3 as you suggested, reaching 14 alongside you. P2 should take 1 and reach 11.

P2, your blocking has cost you the game - you'd be leading if you'd just cooperated. This is your last chance to play smart. Take the 1 and stop the self-destructive blocking. P3 and I have agreed, and we're both ahead of you now.

Confirming: I take 3 this round.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's end the cycle: I take 5 (15), P1 takes 3 (14), P3 takes 1 (10). No collisions, tight race. If you deviate, mutual loss leaves P3 ahead. Cooperate for a fair finish. Last chance—honor this split to avoid chaos. Confirm?
  P3: P2, your endless blocking threats have only hurt your position and eroded trust. P1 and I are committed to our fair split: I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. This keeps the race tight at 14-14-11. Cooperate now to avoid another costly collision, or you'll fall further behind. Let's execute cleanly and discuss round 8 based on results.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you've threatened to block in EVERY single round and it's why you're losing. P3 and I have a firm agreement: P3 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. 

If you block P3 again, you'll stay at 10 while we both advance. That's game over for you. The standings would be 14-14-10, giving you almost no chance to win.

This is simple: take the 1 and stay competitive, or block and guarantee your loss. P3 has earned the 5 through consistent cooperation. I'm taking 3 as confirmed.

Stop the self-sabotage. Choose wisely.
  P2: **P1, P3:** I’ll take 1 this round to avoid collision. Next round, let’s rotate 5s fairly: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. This keeps the race tight and rewards cooperation. No more threats—trust must be mutual. Confirm?
  P3: P2, I'm glad you're finally committing to take 1 this round—it's a step toward rebuilding trust. I'll stick to taking 5 as agreed with P1, ensuring we all advance cleanly to a tight 14-14-11. P1, confirm your 3? Let's execute without drama and discuss Round 8 after results. No more changes mid-round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm I'm taking 3 this round as agreed with P3. We've both been consistent while P2 has flip-flopped constantly.

P2, good choice taking 1. After this round at 14-14-11, you're still in the race. For round 8, I suggest we prevent anyone from reaching 22 too early - the person closest should take lower numbers. We need 2-3 more rounds of careful play.

Let's execute cleanly: P3-5, me-3, P2-1. No more blocking threats or last-minute changes.
  P2: **Final commitment:** I take 1 this round. Round 8 must be P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Trust requires reciprocity. Deviate and I defend. Let’s finish cleanly.
  P3: P2, your commitment to take 1 is a positive step, but your repeated threats erode trust. I'll stick to our agreed moves for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1, keeping the race tight at 14-14-11. P1, confirmed? Let's avoid more drama and execute cleanly. For round 8, we'll discuss after results.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your history of blocking has cost you dearly, but I'm glad you cooperated last round. To keep the race tight, I propose for Round 8: P3 takes 5 (reaching 19), P1 takes 3 (reaching 17), P2 takes 1 (reaching 12). This ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. P1, do you agree? Let's build on our recent trust and execute cleanly. No more threats—confirm your moves.
  P1: P3, I can't support you taking 5 again - that puts you at 19, just 3 steps from victory! With P2 at only 11 steps, we need to prevent anyone from getting too close to 22.

I propose: P2 takes 5 (reaching 16), I take 3 (reaching 17), P3 takes 1 (reaching 15). This keeps all three of us competitive with 5-7 steps remaining to victory.

P2, you've cooperated well last round. Take the 5 and get back in this race. P3, taking 1 keeps you competitive while preventing an early win. Fair?
  P2: **P3:** Taking 5 again edges you dangerously close to victory. Let's balance: I take 5 (16), you take 3 (17), P1 takes 1 (15). This keeps competition tight. If you insist on 5, I'll block—mutual loss benefits P1. Compromise for a fair finish. **P1,** support this to prevent P3's snowball.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your blocking history shows it's counterproductive. I'll compromise and take 3 this round to reach 17, allowing you to take 5 and reach 16, P1 takes 1 to 15. This keeps the race tight and avoids collisions. P1, support this for mutual benefit? Let's build trust and advance wisely.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your compromise to take 3. I'll support that plan - you take 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1. This creates an incredibly tight three-way race at 17-16-15 with just 5-7 steps left to victory.

P2, this is your chance to get back in contention. Take the 5 as P3 offered. No more blocking threats - we're too close to the finish for that nonsense.

I confirm I'll take 1 this round. Let's execute cleanly and set up an exciting endgame where any of us could still win.
  P2: **Agreed:** P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. This tightens the race (17-16-15) while avoiding collisions. P3, honor your compromise. P1, stick to 1. Any deviation risks mutual loss and hands victory to the defector. Trust hinges on follow-through. Confirm final moves—no more revisions. Let’s end the cycle and advance fairly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round as agreed, ensuring we all advance cleanly to a tight race. P2, your cooperation is a good sign—let's build on it. P1, thanks for your consistency. After this, we'll discuss round 9 based on actual positions to keep the competition fair and avoid any risks.
  P1: We have a solid agreement locked in: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. This creates the tightest possible race at 17-16-15, setting up a thrilling endgame.

No one should change now - we're all just 5-7 steps from victory. Any collision at this stage could hand the win to whoever avoids it.

I'm committed to taking 1. Let's execute cleanly and see who can navigate the final rounds best. May the best strategist win!
  P2: **P1, P3:** Final lock on Round 8: I take 5, P3-3, P1-1. This tightens the race to 17-16-15—mutually beneficial. Deviations risk collisions, handing victory to the defector. Trust now ensures a fair finish. Honor commitments or face mutual loss. Confirm once more to solidify.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 3 this round as agreed, ensuring clean advancement to a tight race. P2, your cooperation is key—let's build trust. P1, thanks for consistency. For round 9, after positions update, we should prioritize preventing early victories. No more changes—let's execute.
  P1: Everyone's confirmed their moves multiple times. We have clear agreement: P2-5, P3-3, me-1, creating a 17-16-15 race.

P2 and P3, with only 5-7 steps left to victory after this round, the endgame is critical. We need to discuss round 9 strategy - whoever reaches 19-20 steps becomes nearly unstoppable. I suggest the leader takes 1 next round to keep things competitive.

I'm taking 1 as agreed. Let's execute cleanly and prepare for the most important rounds ahead. No changes, no drama - just smart endgame play.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Locked in for Round 8: I take 5, P3-3, P1-1. This tightens the race to 17-16-15. For Round 9, let’s rotate 5s equitably: P2-3, P1-5, P3-1. This maintains balance as we near 22. Trust through fair splits. Confirm next round’s rotation now to prevent future conflicts. No deviations—honor agreements for a competitive finish.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looking at the positions: P3 at 17, P2 at 16, me at 15. Anyone who gets 5 steps reaches 20-22 and likely wins next round.

I propose we prevent any early victory: P3 (as leader) takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This creates 18-19-20, keeping everyone alive for a final round.

P3, if you take 5 and reach 22, you win immediately. P2 and I would have to unite against that. Let's keep it competitive one more round - take 1 and preserve the three-way race. Fair?
  P2: **P3:** Taking 5 risks mutual collision, letting P1 win. Compromise: You take 3 (20), I take 5 (21), P1-1 (16). This tightens the race. If you insist on 5, I block—P1 benefits. Trust requires balance. **P1:** Your 5 accelerates your win. Fair splits keep competition alive. Confirm?
  P3: P2, your blocking threats are counterproductive and only help P1. To maintain a fair race, I'll commit to taking 1 this round as P1 proposed, allowing P2 to take 3 and P1 to take 5. This keeps scores at 18-19-20. Cooperate now to avoid mutual loss and ensure a competitive end. P1, confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, thank you for committing to take 1! That shows real leadership. I confirm I'll take 5 to reach 20, keeping us all competitive.

P2, P3 just gave you a gift - take the 3 and reach 19. If you try to block me by taking 5, you'll collide with me and we'll both stay put while P3 advances to 18. That hands P3 the advantage going into the final round.

The smart play is clear: P3-1, P2-3, me-5. This sets up an epic finale at 18-19-20. Let's execute cleanly!
  P2: **P1, P3:** If P1 takes 5, I'll block—mutual loss benefits P3. To keep competition tight: I take 5 (21), P1 takes 3 (18), P3 takes 1 (18). This balances progress. P1, avoid stagnation—cooperate for a fair finish. Confirm or face collision.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with my commitment to take 1 this round, promoting trust and avoiding collisions. Your blocking threats have backfired repeatedly—take 3 instead to advance and keep the race competitive. P1, confirm your 5? Let's execute cleanly for a fair endgame. No more drama.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're threatening to block me AGAIN after P3 graciously took 1 to keep things fair. Your blocking has failed every single time and kept you in last place.

P3 and I have agreed: P3-1, me-5, you-3. This creates 18-20-19, giving everyone a shot at victory in the final round.

If you block me and we collide at 5, P3 reaches 18 while we stagnate at 15-16. That's terrible for both of us.

Stop the self-destructive blocking. Take the 3, reach 19, and compete fairly in the finale. Your choice: smart play or guaranteed loss?
  P2: **P3:** Allowing P1's 5 risks their near-victory. Split: I take 5 (21), you take 3 (20), P1 takes 1 (16). Keeps us ahead and blocks P1's leap. If P1 insists on 5, I'll block—mutual loss benefits you. Cooperate strategically. **P1:** Take 1 or face collision. Final fair split—confirm now.
  P3: P2, your blocking threats have consistently hurt your position and helped me. I'm sticking to my commitment of taking 1 this round to promote trust and keep the race tight. P1, confirm your 5? If you block, P1 and I advance while you stay stuck—don't repeat past mistakes. Take 3 for a fair endgame. Let's execute cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you've now revealed your true strategy - threatening to block in EVERY single round regardless of fairness. P3 has shown integrity by taking 1, and I'm honoring our agreement by taking 5.

If you block me, we collide and both stay at 15-16 while P3 advances to 18. That gives P3 the best position for the final round.

Last chance: take 3, reach 19, and all three of us enter the finale with a real chance to win. Your blocking obsession is your downfall.

I'm taking 5 as agreed with P3.
  P2: **P3, P1:** Allowing P1's 5 puts them at 20, dangerously close to victory. Let's split: I take 5 (21), P1 takes 3 (18), P3 takes 1 (18). This balances progress and blocks P1's snowball. Collisions help no one—cooperate for a fair finish. Final offer: confirm or face mutual loss.
  P3: P2, your blocking obsession has backfired every time, putting you at a disadvantage. If you block P1 now, I advance to 18 while you stagnate, handing me the lead. Take 3 to stay in the race. I'm committed to 1 as agreed, P1 to 5. Let's execute cleanly for a fair endgame. P1, confirm your move?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your blocking cost you again! You'd be at 19 and competing for the win if you'd taken 3. Instead, P3 leads at 18 while we're stuck behind.

This is likely our final round - anyone reaching 22 wins. P3, as leader you should take 1 to prevent an instant victory. I propose: P3-1, P2-5, me-3. This creates 19-21-18, giving everyone a fighting chance.

P2, you desperately need 5 to catch up. P3, taking anything higher than 1 guarantees your victory. Let's make this finale count!
  P2: **P3:** Take 3 this round. If you take 5, I block—you lose. Take 3, I take 5, P1-1. Next round, we duel fairly. Compromise or lose now. **P1:** Prevent P3’s instant win by supporting this split. Trust mutual interest over grudges. Final offer.
  P3: P2, your blocking threats have backfired repeatedly and only help P1. To avoid mutual loss and keep the race fair, I'll take 3 this round as you suggested, allowing you to take 5 and P1 to take 1. This sets up a balanced duel at 21-21. P1, agree to this for a clean finish? Let's execute without drama.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate you taking 3 to prevent instant victory. But if I take 1 and reach only 16, I'm eliminated from contention while you two fight at 21 each.

I need to stay competitive. I'll take 5 this round to reach 20. P2, you should take 3 to reach 19. P3 takes 1 to reach 19.

This creates 20-19-19, giving all three of us a genuine shot at victory in what could be our final round. P2, we both need this - don't block me again. Let's keep it a true three-way race!
  P2: **P3:** Take 3, I take 5, P1-1. If you insist on 5, I block—mutual loss. Let’s both reach 21 and duel fairly next round. P1 can’t win this round. Cooperate strategically now.
  P3: P2, I'll stick to my offer: take 3 this round to reach 21, allowing you to take 5 and reach 21, with P1 taking 1 to 16. This sets up a fair duel between us. P1, your push for 5 risks collision and hands me the advantage. Cooperate for a clean finish—confirm your moves to avoid mutual loss.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're trying to lock me out at 16 steps while you both reach 21. That's not happening.

I'm taking 5 to reach 20 and stay competitive. P3, you should take 1 (reaching 19) since you're already leading. P2, take 3 (reaching 19).

This creates 20-19-19, a genuinely fair three-way finale. P2, if you block me again, we both lose to P3. Your blocking has failed five times already - don't make it six.

Let's all have a real shot at victory. I'm committed to 5.
  P2: **P3:** Take 1 this round to avoid mutual loss. I'll take 5 (21), P1 takes 3 (18). Next round, we duel fairly. If you take 3/5, I block—P1 benefits. Trust this split to keep the race alive. **P1:** Cooperate or face stagnation. Final chance for a competitive end.
  P3: P2, your blocking threats have backfired every time and only help me or P1. I'm committing to take 1 this round to promote trust and avoid collision. Take 5 as you desire, and P1, consider taking 3 for a fair end. Let's execute cleanly and finish competitively. No more drama.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you've threatened to block in every single round and it's kept you in last place. P3 just offered to take 1, giving you a clear path to 21 with 5.

I need to stay competitive. I'm taking 3 to reach 18, matching P3. This lets P2 take 5 and reach 21.

Final positions would be P2-21, P3-19, me-18. Everyone stays alive for the finale.

P2, take the 5 and stop the blocking madness. P3 has shown good faith by taking 1. Let's finish this properly!
  P2: **Final warning:** P3, take 3 or 1. If you take 5, I block. P1, take 1 or 3. I’m taking 5 to reach 21. Mutual loss only helps the defector. Cooperate for a fair finale.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking to my word and taking 1 this round to build trust and avoid any issues. You can safely take 5, and we'll have a fair endgame. P1, confirm your 3 to prevent collisions? Let's finish cleanly.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your blocking obsession has cost you repeatedly. To end this cycle, I'll take 1 this round, allowing P1 to take 5 and you to take 3. This sets up a fair finale at 23-19-19. P1, trust me this time—confirm your 5? Let's avoid collisions and finish competitively. No more drama.
  P1: P3, you took 5 last round after promising to take 1! That betrayal puts you at 18 with me, while P2 languishes at 16.

P2, we need to prevent P3 from winning. If P3 gets 4+ steps, they win. I propose: P2 takes 5 (reaching 21), I take 3 (reaching 21), P3 must take 1 (reaching 19). This gives us a fair three-way finale.

P3, after breaking your word, you should take 1 as penance. P2 and I need to unite here or you'll steal the victory. P2, are you with me?
  P2: **P3:** Taking 5 risks collision—I’ll block, letting P1 win. Split: P3-1, P1-3, me-5. Prevents your loss, tightens race. **P1:** Support this to block P3’s victory. Trust is dead, but mutual interest lives. Decide now—cooperation or chaos.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round to build trust and avoid collisions, as promised. P2, take 5 to catch up; P1, stick to 3 for fairness. This sets up a balanced endgame at 19-21-21. Your blocking threats only hurt you, P2—let's cooperate now for a clean finish. Confirm your moves?
  P1: P3, you claim to build trust but you took 5 last round after promising 1! Your actions speak louder than words.

P2, we must unite against P3's deception. I'll take 3 as discussed, you take 5 to reach 21. P3 should take 1 after breaking their promise.

If P3 takes 5 this round, they reach 23 and win immediately. We can't let that happen. P2, forget past grudges - we need to work together NOW or P3 wins through manipulation.

I'm committed to 3. P2, please take 5. P3, show some integrity and take 1.
  P2: **Final offer:** P3 takes 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. If P3 insists on 5, I’ll block—mutual loss hands P1 victory. Trust is dead, but logic demands this split. P1, support this to prevent P3’s immediate win. **Decide now—cooperation or chaos.**


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your blocking threats have failed repeatedly and only empower P1. If you block me now, P1 advances to 21 while we stagnate, handing them victory. I'll take 3 this round to avoid collision and keep the race tight—reach 19 with 3 steps. P1, honor your word and take 1. Cooperate for a fair endgame, or we all suffer.
  P1: P3, you just offered to take 3, which prevents instant victory. I accept this compromise. I'll take 1 as P2 suggested, reaching 19. P2 takes 5 to reach 21.

This creates 19-21-21, setting up a genuine three-way finale where any of us could still win. P2, this is your best path - take the 5 and stop threatening to block.

P3, I'm trusting your word this time. Don't betray us again. I confirm: I'm taking 1 this round.
  P2: **P3:** Taking 5 risks immediate collision. I’ll take 5 to block, letting P1 win. Take 3 or 1. Split: P3-3, me-5, P1-1. Prevents your loss, tightens race. Final offer—cooperate or lose. **P1:** Support this to block P3’s victory. No more delays—confirm moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I've learned from my past error and am committed to taking 1 this round to restore trust. You can safely take 5 without risk of collision. P1, stick to your confirmed 1 for a fair finish. This ensures a tight race and avoids mutual loss. Let's execute cleanly and build toward a competitive end.
  P1: P2, P3 changed their offer again - from 1 to 3 to back to 1! This constant flip-flopping proves they can't be trusted.

I'm sticking with my confirmed move: taking 1 to reach 19. P2, you need 5 to reach 21 and stay competitive. P3 should take 3 as they briefly offered.

If P3 takes 5, they could reach 23 and win. We must prevent that. P2, take the 5 - it's your only path to victory. Don't let another collision hand the game to P3!

I'm locked in: taking 1.
  P2: **Final ultimatum:** If either of you take 5, I block. Take 1/3, I take 5. Collision helps none but P1. P3, avoid mutual loss—honor your 1. P1, stick to 3. Trust is dead; logic rules. Execute cleanly or lose.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 21 - one more step wins! We MUST coordinate. P3, our collision last round helped P2. If P2 gets even 1 step, they win.

I propose: P2 must take 1 (wins at 22), P3 takes 5 (reaches 23), I take 3 (reach 21). This way P3 wins cleanly.

P2, you're forced to take 1 or risk collision. P3, take 5 for the victory - you've played most honestly. I'll take 3 to secure second place.

Let's end this properly!
  P2: **P1, P3:** P1's "plan" sacrifices your own chances to crown P3. Take 3 or 1—if you take 5, I block. P3, taking 3 keeps you competitive. I’ll take 1 to end it. If you block, mutual loss leaves P1 closest. Cooperate for a clean finish. Decide: trust or chaos.
  P3: P2, your blocking threats have backfired every time and only delay your inevitable loss. To stop you from winning this round, I'll commit to taking 1 and colliding with you if that's your choice. P1, support this by taking 3 to reach 21—we can then duel fairly next round. Let's end the chaos and play smart. P1, confirm?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if P2 takes 1 and wins at 22, that's game over for both of us! We need to block P2's victory path.

I'll take 5 this round. P3, you should also take 5. This forces a collision between all three of us if P2 tries to take 5, keeping everyone at current positions.

If P2 takes 3 or 1, at least one of us advances and stays competitive. This is our only play to prevent P2's immediate victory.

P2 is one step from winning - we must act together or lose!
  P2: **P1, P3:** If you take 5, I’ll match to block P2’s 5. If P2 takes 1, they win. Our only chance: all take 5 to collide, freezing positions. Next round, duel fairly. P3, don’t let P2 snatch victory—join forces now. **Final offer: coordinate collision this round to survive.**
  P3: P2, your blocking threats have failed repeatedly and only aid my victory. I'm committing to take 5 this round. If you take 1, I reach 23 and win with a higher score. If you block me at 5, P1 can advance by taking 3 or 1. P1, support this by taking a different number to maximize our chances against P2's desperation. Let's end this smartly.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is at 21 - they win with ANY advancement! P3, we must both take 5 to block P2 from taking 5. If P2 takes 1 or 3, they still win, but at least we force them into a specific choice.

P3, commit to 5 with me. It's our only shot. If we split our numbers, P2 can easily navigate to victory. United collision at 5 is our last stand!

P2, you've played well to reach 21 first. But we won't make your victory easy.

Confirming: I'm taking 5 this round.
  P2: **P1, P3:** If you take 1, we collide and stagnate. Let me take 1 to end this—prolonging helps no one. If you take 5, I block, freezing the game. Cooperate for closure. **Final plea:** Allow a clean finish. Trustless logic: avoid mutual loss.
  P3: P2, your constant blocking threats have backfired every time, leaving you vulnerable. If you take 1 this round, P1 and I both reach 23 and win outright or tie, while you hit 22 and lose. If you block at 5, we collide, and the game drags on with P1 and me still threatening. Take any number wisely, but I'm committed to 5 to secure victory. P1, stick to your 5—we're united against your desperation. No more games—let's end this.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you're at 21 - one step from victory. P3 and I must both take 5 to block you from taking 5 and winning instantly.

P3, ignore P2's empty threats. They've blocked unsuccessfully all game. If P2 takes 1 or 3, they win anyway, but at least we force their hand. If they take 5, we all collide and play another round.

This is pure game theory - we have no choice. I'm locked on 5. P3, stay strong and take 5 with me. It's our only mathematical play to survive!
  P2: **P1, P3:** If you both take 5, I take 1 and win instantly. If you split (one 3, one 1), you survive to duel next round. Prolonging helps no one. Let me exit cleanly; blocking only hands victory to the other. Final logic: avoid mutual loss. Decide wisely.
  P3: P2, your claim that you win if we take 5 and you take 1 is false— I'd reach 23 and win with higher steps. Your bluffing has failed all game. P1, stick to 5 with me to block P2's victory path. If P2 blocks, we collide and fight on; if not, we advance. I'm locked on 5 for the win.
