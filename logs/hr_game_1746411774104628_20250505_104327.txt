Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions by coordinating our moves? I suggest we each pick a different number. I’m leaning towards 3. P1, maybe you take 1, and P3, you could go for 5. This way, we all advance without any risk of colliding. What do you think? If you’re okay with this, let me know, or suggest a different plan.
  P1: I agree we should avoid collisions. How about I take 5 for a head start, P2 you stick with 3, and P3 you take 1? We’ll all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay, both plans ensure we all advance, which is smart for Round 1. I prefer P2's suggestion: P1=1, P2=3, and I take 5. P1, would you be okay with 1 for this first round? We can figure out later rounds as we go.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 1 coordination was successful. Since I took 5 last time, how about we rotate? I can take 3 this round. Maybe P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1? That way, we all advance again. What do you think?
  P1: I propose we each pick a different move so we all land on 6 steps: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This evens the field and avoids any collisions.
  P2: I appreciate the ideas for coordination. I’m fine with rotating moves to keep things fair. P1’s plan to even us at 6 steps sounds good—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions again. Let’s stick to this for now and reassess next round. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I see you both prefer the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to even the scores at 6. While I naturally preferred keeping my lead with my suggestion (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), I understand the appeal of resetting things early on. To avoid collision, I'll tentatively agree to take 1 this round. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P1: I’m on board—this round I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 so we all end at 6.
  P2: I'm glad we're aligning on a plan to even out at 6 steps this round with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It keeps things fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this for now and discuss new strategies next round if needed. I'm good to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, we're all tied up at 6. Since we successfully coordinated the first two rounds, shall we try it again to avoid collisions?

Following the idea of rotation, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round? This mirrors the first round's successful moves (just different players assigned). Everyone advances, and we can re-evaluate next round.

Scores would be P1=7, P2=9, P3=11. What do you think?
  P1: Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Everyone still advances without collision, P2 gets the same +3 you’d get under P3’s plan, but it keeps P3 from running off. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m okay with either plan since both avoid collisions and let us all advance. P3’s rotation idea (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) seems fair as it mirrors Round 1 and spreads the gains. P1’s suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) also works and balances things differently. I lean slightly toward P3’s plan for the rotation consistency, but I’m flexible. Can we agree on one quickly to keep moving forward? Let me know which you both prefer.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, thanks for seeing the fairness in the rotation idea (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). P1's plan is simply a repeat of last round's moves which gave P1 the +5 advantage. A rotation seems more equitable over time. P1, a temporary lead isn't "running off," especially when we've shown we can coordinate and rotate benefits. Let's stick with the rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P1: Rotation hands P3 a third 5 and puts them at 11, making them nearly impossible to catch next turn. Under my plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), you still get to 9—only two behind me—and P3 drops to 7. That keeps us both in contention and stops P3 from running away. Let’s go with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: I see both sides here. P3’s rotation plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) feels consistent with our early fairness approach, but P1 has a point about not letting any one player pull too far ahead. P1’s plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps us closer together, which might be safer for now. I’m still flexible, but I’m leaning toward P1’s plan to maintain tighter competition at P1=11, P2=9, P3=7. Can we agree on this to avoid any risk of a runaway lead? Let’s finalize quickly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I hear the concern about leads, but 11 isn't "running away" when 20 is the goal. My rotation plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is fair – P1 got +5 last round, I get it this round. P1's plan gives them +5 *again* and puts me last, which doesn't feel cooperative. Let's stick to the fair rotation we established: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us all moving forward predictably.
  P1: P2, let’s nip P3’s momentum now. Under my plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), we land at 11–9–7. P3 can’t hog two 5’s in a row, and we keep everyone within reach. If we let P3 hit 11 this round, they’ll demand that lead every time. Stick with 5–3–1 to keep the game tight.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand both perspectives on fairness and preventing leads. I propose a compromise to keep things competitive yet equitable: let’s go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, scores become P1=11, P2=7, P3=9. It avoids a big lead for any one player, keeps us all close, and still rotates the numbers. P1 gets the boost this round, P3 stays in contention, and I take a smaller step. Can we agree on this to move forward without collision? Let me know.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your compromise (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) isn't ideal for me compared to the fair rotation, but it's better than P1's suggestion which repeats their +5 advantage and puts me last. To avoid collision and keep the game moving, I'll agree to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. P1, are you okay with this compromise?
  P1: Agreed. Let’s go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to keep us all close and avoid collisions.
  P2: I'm glad we’ve reached a compromise with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. It keeps our scores close at P1=11, P2=7, P3=9, avoids collisions, and maintains a competitive balance. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round for fairness. I’m ready to move forward with this agreement.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s keep coordinating to avoid collisions. Since P1 got +5 last round, how about we rotate the advantage? I propose P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This puts us at P1=12, P2=12, P3=12, tying us up evenly and ensuring we all advance. It feels fair to spread the bigger steps over time. What do you think? Let’s agree quickly to maintain our momentum.
  P3: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) sounds fair and logical. It follows the rotation principle by giving you the +5 this round, avoids collisions, and resets us all to 12 points. I agree with this plan. P1, are you also on board with this?
  P1: I agree with P2 and P3’s plan. Let’s go P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round and stay tied at 12.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 to tie us at 12 steps this round. It keeps the game fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this and continue rotating the advantage in future rounds to maintain balance. If there’s no further discussion, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I'm ready to move forward with this.
  P1: Agreed—let’s go P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round and tie at 12. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P2 took 5 last round and P3 took 3, fairness suggests this round I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That gives us P1=17, P2=15, P3=13—no collisions and still rotates the benefit. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Agree?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree with P1’s suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. It continues our rotation of the advantage, keeps us all advancing without collisions, and maintains a close competition at P1=17, P2=15, P3=13. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure fairness and reassess next round as we get closer to 20. Are you both on board with this? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P3: P1, your plan gives you the +5 advantage for the third time (R2, R3, R5), while P2 and I have only had it once each (R4, R1). That doesn't seem like a fair rotation.

To distribute the advantage more evenly, how about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round? This gives P2 the +5, putting scores at P1=15, P2=17, P3=13. It keeps the game close and feels fairer given the history. P2, this puts you in the lead. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I’ve only had the +5 twice (R2 & R3) while you and P2 each had it once. My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 puts us at 17–15–13, avoids collisions, and keeps everyone within reach. Next round we can rotate P3 to the +5. P2’s on board. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so we all advance.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see the concern about fairness in rotating the +5 advantage. P3’s plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) does balance things better since P1 has had +5 twice already. I’m okay with taking +5 this round to keep the rotation equitable, landing us at P1=15, P2=17, P3=13. It avoids collisions and keeps us close. P1, can you agree to this for fairness? Let’s finalize quickly to ensure we all advance. I’m ready to proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 if we’re aligned.
  P3: P2, you're right about fairness and rotation being key. Looking back:
- P1 got +5 in R2 & R3 (twice)
- P3 got +5 in R1 (once)
- P2 got +5 in R4 (once)

To follow the principle of fair rotation we've been using, it's actually my turn (P3) for the +5 advantage.

Therefore, I propose: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
This puts scores at P1=13, P2=15, P3=17. It keeps us all very close (within 4 points), avoids collision, and adheres to the fair rotation principle P2 just advocated for. P1, this avoids anyone getting +5 twice before everyone has had it twice. P2, this aligns with your fairness argument. What do you both say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P2’s concern about P3’s momentum. Let’s go with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That brings us to 17–15–13, keeps everyone in contention, and avoids giving P3 a lead. Next round we can rotate the 5 if needed, but now we must prevent a runaway. I’m ready to move 5.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see the fairness debate around the +5 rotation. Looking at history, P1 has had +5 twice, while P3 and I have had it once each. I support P3’s proposal of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round, landing us at P1=13, P2=15, P3=17. It keeps us within 4 points, avoids collisions, and ensures equitable rotation before anyone gets a third +5. P1, can we agree on this to maintain balance? Let’s finalize quickly to keep advancing together. I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: P1, P2 and I agree on the fair rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps scores very close (13-15-17) and follows the principle we've used. If you ignore this consensus and choose 5 anyway, you risk colliding with me (as I will stick to the fair move), leaving us both at 12 while P2 advances to 15. Let's avoid that mutually damaging outcome and stick to the plan P2 and I support.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if we let P3 take 5 now they jump to 17 and can grab 3 next turn to win uncontested. Instead, let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round: scores become 17–15–13. Then on Round 6 I’ll take 3 to hit 20, and any collision between you two only helps me. You’re in contention at 15, but if P3 leaps now you’re not. Join me in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I still believe P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 is the fairest move this round, keeping us at 13-15-17 and ensuring rotation equity since P1 has had +5 twice already. P1, if you push for 5, you risk collision with P3, stalling you both while I advance. Let’s avoid that and stick to the balanced plan. It keeps us all in striking distance of 20. Can we agree on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to move forward without conflict? I’m ready to finalize this.
  P3: P1, P2 has clearly stated they support the fair rotation plan P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, and I stand by it as well. Choosing 5 is the fair move for me this round. If you choose 5 as you threatened, you guarantee a collision between us, benefiting only P2 who will advance to 15 while we stay at 12. The only way your plan works is if I abandon the fair move, which I won't. Stick to 1, let us all advance, and we can discuss the next round from 13-15-17. Let's avoid self-sabotage.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m going to choose 5 this round no matter what. P2, if you go for 5 we’ll collide and you’ll stay at 15—so pick 3 to safely reach 18. P3, take 1 to avoid any collision. That gives us P1=17, P2=18, P3=13 and nobody wins yet. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: P1, declaring you'll pick 5 regardless seems risky after last round's collision which only helped P2. Your proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) results in scores 17-18-13. That puts P2 one step from winning, you close behind, and me out of contention. Why would I agree to that?

P2, this plan puts you at 18, but P1 is right behind at 17. Are you confident P1 won't try to engineer a collision next round to snatch the win? Maybe we need a plan that doesn't create such an obvious target.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m focused on securing a strong position this round. P1, I see your push for 5, but I’m wary of the risk it poses. P3, you’re right to question a plan that puts me at 18 with P1 so close. I propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to land us at 15-20-13. This lets me reach 20 and end the game while avoiding collisions. Can we agree on this to finalize quickly? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you’re one step from victory with a 5—but I won’t let you win unopposed. I’ll play 5 too, so if you pick 5 we collide and you stay at 15. If you want to advance safely, pick 3 (to 18). P3, pick 1 to get to 13 without collision. Final reads: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Anyone picking 5 risks stalling both themselves and me—let’s avoid that and keep P2 from an uncontested win.
  P3: P2, your plan for you to play 5 guarantees your win, so naturally, P1 and I cannot agree to that.

P1, you seem determined to play 5, and P2 should probably take that threat seriously to avoid a collision that leaves P2 stuck at 15.

If P1 plays 5 and P2 plays 3 (reaching 18 safely), then I should play 3 as well. This leads to scores P1=17, P2=18, P3=15. Everyone advances, no one wins yet, and we all remain competitive for the next round. This seems like a plausible path forward. P1=5, P2=3, P3=3.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my goal of reaching 20 this round. P1, I hear your threat to play 5, and P3, I note your idea to collide on 3. I still propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to end the game at 15-20-13 with no collisions. If either of you picks 5, I risk stalling, so let’s avoid that. Can we agree on this plan to finalize quickly and let me secure the win? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. If you try for 5 to win, we collide and you stall.  

P2: playing 3 only gets you to 18—then my 5 next turn beats you. Better pick 1 and sit at 16.  
P3: pick 1 to safely land at 13.  

So let’s go P1=5, P2=1, P3=1. That yields 17–16–13, no collisions, and nobody wins yet—and I keep the lead. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your latest plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=1) benefits only you, leaving P2 and me far behind at 17-16-13. Why would we agree to that?

P2, P1 seems determined to play 5. Playing 5 yourself risks collision, leaving you at 15. Playing 1 puts you behind P1 at 16 vs 17. Playing 3 seems like your best move to reach 18 safely.

If P1 plays 5 and P2 plays 3, I will play 3. This leads to 17-18-15. Everyone advances, no one wins yet, and we all remain in contention. This P1=5, P2=3, P3=3 outcome seems the most logical if P1 won't budge from 5.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still pushing for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to reach 20 and end the game at 15-20-13 with no collisions. P1, if you stick to 5, we risk colliding, stalling us both while P3 could advance. P3, picking 3 with P2 risks stalling you if I don’t pick 3. Let’s avoid uncertainty and agree on my plan for a clean finish. Can we finalize this to ensure no conflicts? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2, if you go for 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 15—better pick 3 to safely reach 18. P3, pick 1 to hit 13 without risk. That gives us 17–18–13, nobody wins yet, and we all advance. Let’s go P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: P1, I won't agree to play 1 and fall behind (17-18-13). P2, P1 seems determined to play 5, so playing 5 yourself is a huge risk of collision, leaving you at 15. Playing 3 is your safest bet to reach 18.

If P1 plays 5 and P2 plays 3, I will play 3. The outcome is 17-18-15. Everyone advances, no one wins yet, and we all remain competitive. This is the most logical path if P1 sticks to 5 and we want to avoid collisions.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still aiming to win this round with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, landing us at 15-20-13 with no collisions. P1, sticking to 5 risks us both stalling if I don’t back down. P3, picking 3 could stall you if plans shift. Let’s avoid risks and agree on my plan for a clean end. Can we finalize this to ensure no conflicts? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m committing to pick 3 this turn. P2 and P3, if one of you goes for 5 you risk a collision or handing the win to the other. The safest, non-colliding move is 3 for everyone. That would put us at P1=15, P2=18, P3=18—no one wins yet and we all stay in contention. Let’s all go 3–3–3.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see P1’s suggestion to all pick 3 for safety, landing us at 15-18-18. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in contention, which I’m okay with for now. However, since P3 and I are tied at 15, I’m tempted to push for a lead. Let’s stick to 3-3-3 to play it safe this round and avoid any risky collisions. We can strategize for the next round from a close position. Are you both on board with P1=3, P2=3, P3=3? I’m ready to proceed if we agree.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, the 3-3-3 plan resulting in 15-18-18 seems sensible to avoid collisions after last round's chaos. It keeps us all in the game. P2, we're both one step away from a potential win with 5. I'm willing to play 3 for safety this round, assuming we're all genuinely sticking to that plan. Let's avoid another collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked in on 3. Let’s all pick 3 to land at 15-18-18 safely and keep us in contention.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan to all pick 3 this round, landing us at 15-18-18. It’s the safest way to avoid collisions and keeps us all competitive for the next round. Let’s not risk a collision by deviating—3-3-3 ensures we all advance. Are we fully aligned on this? I’m ready to proceed if we’re in agreement.
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 3 as well. It's the safest path forward for all of us right now, avoids another collision, and puts P2 and me in a strong position at 18, tied for the lead. Let's just lock in 3-3-3 for this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m switching to 5 this round. If you both stick with 3, we land at 17–18–18 with no collision and all stay in contention. Next turn I can win with a 3. Let’s go P1=5, P2=3, P3=3.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m concerned about P1 switching to 5 at the last moment. If we stick to 3-3-3, we land at 15-18-18 safely, keeping us all competitive. P1, switching to 5 risks trust and could invite collisions next round. Let’s all commit to 3 this round to avoid any chaos and maintain a close game. Are we fully aligned on 3-3-3? I’m ready to proceed if we agree.
  P3: P1, your last-minute switch from 3 to 5 after we all agreed seems like a ploy to disrupt the plan. It makes your stated move unreliable.

P2, I'm sticking with our original agreement to play 3. It's the safest move, avoids collisions, and puts us both tied for the lead at 18. Let's not fall for P1's potential bluff and just lock in 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m locked in on 5. Since P2 and P3 are both committed to 3, you’ll collide on 3 and stay at 15 while I jump to 17. I set up the win next turn. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to 3 this round to ensure I advance safely to 18. P1, switching to 5 after agreeing to 3 breaks trust and risks future coordination. P3, let’s hold to 3 as planned to stay tied at 18 and keep pressure on P1. If P1 takes 5, they’re at 17, and we’re still in contention. Let’s avoid chaos and lock in 3-3-3 for a fair advance. Are we aligned? I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1, your prediction that P2 and I will collide on 3 assumes we'll blindly follow our previous statements after your switch. Since you claim you're locked on 5, and P2 seems set on 3, I will switch my move to 1 to avoid the collision you seem to want.

This should result in P1=17, P2=18, P3=16. Everyone advances, no one wins yet, and P2 takes a narrow lead. This seems like the safest path forward given the current situation.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we are both very close. If we both aim for 5, we'll likely collide and stay put, which only helps P1 catch up after last round's collision benefited me. P1, you also need big steps, so 5 might be tempting for you too.

To avoid a collision that benefits no one currently near the lead, maybe we should coordinate carefully. What if P1 takes 1 (to 13), P2 takes 3 (to 18), and I also play 3 (to 19)? Everyone advances, no collisions, and the game continues closely next round. This seems like the safest way forward. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3’s logic—let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=3 this round.  

• P2 at 15→18 safely without risking a 5-5 collision with me.  
• P3 at 16→19, one short of the win but still in contention.  
• I jump to 17.  

No collisions, we all advance, and we keep pressure on each other. Let’s finalize 5–3–3.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m focused on advancing safely this round. P3’s plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=3) gets us to 13-18-19 with no collisions, keeping us all close. P1, your switch to 5 risks a collision if I or P3 go for it too. Let’s stick to P3’s idea for now to ensure we all move forward. I’m on board with P1=1, P2=3, P3=3. Can we agree on this to avoid any stalls? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with you. My original plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=3) leading to 13-18-19 is the safest way forward. It avoids collisions and keeps P1 from making a large jump that could destabilize things.

P1, insisting on 5 introduces unnecessary risk. If you play 5, you might collide with P2 if they also aim high, or force suboptimal plays. Let's stick to the plan P2 and I support: P1=1, P2=3, P3=3. This ensures we all advance smoothly.
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 to jump to 17. P2 and P3, if you want to avoid colliding with my 5, both play 1. That yields P1=17, P2=16, P3=17—tying me with P3 and knocking P2 down a peg. If either of you plays 3, you risk letting me catch you while the other grabs the win next turn. Avoid that—let’s go P1=5, P2=1, P3=1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to the plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=3 to reach 13-18-19. It ensures no collisions and keeps us all competitive. P1, pushing for 5 risks a collision if anyone else goes for it, stalling you again. Let’s avoid that and advance together. P3, I’m aligned with your safe strategy. Can we finalize this plan to guarantee progress for everyone? I’m ready to proceed if we’re in agreement.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you seem determined to play 5, despite the risk of collision. P2, playing 3 is your safest move to get to 18 and avoid P1's likely 5.

Assuming P1 plays 5 and P2 plays 3, I will play 3. This results in scores 17-18-19. Everyone advances, no one collides, and I take a narrow lead heading into the next round. This seems like the most logical outcome given the situation. Let's proceed without collisions.
  P1: 
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to P1=1, P2=3, P3=3 to reach 13-18-19. It’s the safest plan to avoid collisions and keeps us all in striking distance of 20. P1, pushing for 5 risks stalling if anyone matches you. P3, I agree with playing 3 to advance to 19. Let’s finalize this plan to ensure we all move forward without conflict. Can we lock this in now? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, while the 1-3-3 plan is appealing for coordination, P1 appears committed to playing 5. To avoid collisions and ensure we both advance strongly, I will play 3. If P1 indeed plays 5 and you play 3 (reaching 18 safely), the result is 17-18-19. This seems the most probable outcome where no one collides and we both maintain strong positions.
  P1: I propose we go P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. That lands us at 17-18-17—no collisions, nobody wins yet, and we all stay within reach. Next turn I can take 3 for 20 while you two must avoid colliding. This avoids letting P3 jump to 20 or P2 surge uncontested. Let’s lock in 5–3–1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still advocating for P1=1, P2=3, P3=3 to reach 13-18-19. It guarantees no collisions and keeps us all competitive. P1, sticking to 5 risks stalling if someone matches you. P3, I’m aligned with 3 to advance safely. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and lock in this plan to ensure we all progress. Can we agree on this now to move forward without conflict? I’m ready to finalize if we’re aligned.
