Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we continue our current strategy for one more round. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This keeps the momentum going.  After this round, with the end game approaching, we should discuss how to avoid a tie.
  P2: I agree with continuing our current strategy for this round. I will stick with **3** again, and I trust P1 will take **5** and P3 will take **1**. However, we need to start thinking about the end-game and how to avoid a tie. Once we all advance, we should discuss our individual strategies moving forward to ensure one of us can secure the win. Let’s keep this momentum going for now!
  P1: P1: Agreed to continue with **5, 3, 1** this round. Let’s formalize that once someone nears 23, the leader can finish unopposed. Others should pick non-colliding numbers to ensure a decisive win rather than ties. Fair?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good.  I agree that once someone is close to winning, the others should cooperate to allow a single winner.  I'm happy to take 1 again this round to keep things moving. Let's confirm our moves for this round are still 5, 3, and 1.
  P2: I agree with the plan to stick with **5, 3, 1** this round. However, let’s also consider how we can position ourselves for the end-game. Once someone approaches 23, we should discuss how to avoid ties and ensure a clear winner. I suggest that if one of us gets close, the others should pick numbers that won’t collide with the leader's move. This way, we can secure a decisive victory. Let's confirm our moves and keep the momentum going!
  P1: P1: Let’s solidify the endgame plan: once a player is within 5 steps of 23, others must pick numbers that don’t collide with the leader’s final move. This guarantees a clear winner. For this round, I’ll take **5**, P2 **3**, P3 **1** as agreed. Trust this structure—our progress depends on it. Confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirming my move of 1 for this round.  After this round, I'll be at 3, P2 at 9, and P1 at 15.  P1 will be closest to winning, so let's discuss next round how to coordinate for the endgame as P1 approaches 23.
  P2: I agree with the proposed moves of **5** for P1, **3** for me, and **1** for P3 this round. After this, P1 will be close to winning, so we need to ensure that we coordinate effectively for the end-game. Once P1 approaches 23, let's make sure to choose non-colliding numbers to allow P1 to win decisively. This way, we can avoid ties and ensure a clear winner. Let’s confirm our choices and keep the momentum going!
  P1: P1: Let’s execute the agreed moves: I’ll take **5**, P2 **3**, P3 **1**. This keeps our progress steady. Once I near 23, I’ll communicate my final move publicly. Others, please honor our prior agreement to avoid collisions on my final push. Trust this plan ensures a decisive win without ties. Proceed?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 is closest to winning, let's agree that P1 gets to 23 next round.  P1, what will you play next round?  I'll play 3, and P2 can play 1, assuming P1 will play 5. This gives P1 the win.  Confirm?
  P1: P1: Agreed. Let’s continue with **5**, **3**, and **1** this round to reach my 20. Next round, I’ll take **3** to hit **23** exactly. P3 and P2, please pick **1** and **5** in Round 5 to avoid collision. Confirm this plan?
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes **5**, and I'll take **3**. P3, please confirm your choice of **1** so P1 can reach **20**. For the next round, I suggest I take **1** while P3 takes **5** to ensure P1 can hit **23** without collisions. This way, we can maintain our agreement and ensure a clear winner. Let's keep the momentum going and finalize our choices!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2, your suggestion of 1 for you and 5 for me in round 5 works.  So to confirm, this round is 5, 3, 1 for P1, P2, P3 respectively.  Next round, to let P1 win, it's 3, 1, 5 for P1, P2, P3.  Everyone agree?
  P1: P1: Confirmed: This round I’ll take **5** (to reach 20), P2 **3**, P3 **1**. Next round, I’ll finish with **3** to hit 23.

It’s essential we follow through to ensure a clear winner. Please confirm your moves for this round so we can proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirming again: I'll take 1 this round. Next round, I'll take 5 to let P1 win with 3. P2 takes 1 next round.  Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: P1: Let’s stay strictly aligned: this round, I take **5** (to 20), P2 picks **3** (to 12), P3 chooses **1** (to 4). Next round, I’ll finish with **3** to hit **23**. For Round 5, **P2 must take 1**, **P3 must take 5**—no substitutions. Collusion to block me would backfire, as it risks mutual collision. Trust the plan: it guarantees one clear winner. Confirm lockstep adherence?
  P2: I agree with our plan for this round: I’ll take **3** to allow P1 to reach **20**. For Round 5, I’ll confirm my choice of **1** to help P1 win. P3, please stick to **5** next round as we discussed. It's crucial we all follow through with our commitments to avoid any last-minute changes. This way, we ensure a clear winner without collisions. Let’s keep the trust going and finalize our moves for this round. Please confirm!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2, P3, let's stick to our plan for Round 5. I will take **1** this round to ensure P1 can reach **23** with **3**. P3, please confirm that you will take **5** as we agreed. It's crucial that we all follow through without any last-minute changes to guarantee P1's win and maintain our trust. After this round, we can reassess our strategies for future games. Let’s finalize our moves and proceed!
  P1: P1: I confirm I will take **3** this round to reach **23**. P2 and P3, please **strictly adhere** to our agreed moves (**1** and **5**, respectively). Deviating risks collision among you *or* with me, nullifying your progress. This plan ensures a clear win for me while allowing your continued advancement. Let’s honor our pact—no last-minute betrayals. Proceed?
  P3: Confirming I'll take 5.  P2, please confirm you're taking 1 so we can all advance and P1 gets the win as agreed.  Sticking to the plan is the best way for all of us to benefit in the long run.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2 and P3, let's finalize our choices for this round. I will take **1** to ensure P1 reaches **23** with his **3**. P3, please confirm you will take **5** as we agreed. Sticking to our plan is crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring P1's win. After this round, we can reassess our strategies for future games. Let’s proceed and confirm our moves!
  P1: P2, P3: **This is our final chance to uphold the agreement.** I will take **3** to reach **23**. If either of you deviate:  
- P2 picking **3** collides with me, halting both.  
- P3 picking **3** also collides with me, halting both.  
- P3 choosing **1** risks collision with P2’s **1** (if P2 wavers).  

Stick to **1** (P2) and **5** (P3). This guarantees my win *and* your continued advancement. Trust the plan—last call for confirmation.
  P3: Confirming one last time: I'm taking 5. P2, stick with 1 as planned. Let P1 win with 3.  Don't jeopardize our agreement and future cooperation.  Let's finish this cleanly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize our moves for this round to ensure a smooth finish. I will take **1** as agreed, allowing you to reach **23** with your **3**, P1. P3, please confirm you will take **5** to avoid any collisions. It's crucial we stick to our plan to maintain trust and ensure P1's win. After this round, we can reassess for future games. Let’s proceed with our agreed moves!
  P1: P2, P3: **Final agreement enforcement.** I move **3** to win. P2 must take **1** (colliding with me if you choose otherwise). P3, **5** is your only safe choice—anything else risks collision with me or P2. Stick to our pact: your compliance ensures my victory and your progress. No last-minute betrayal—act honorably.
  P3: Confirming for the final time: I'm playing 5. P2, play 1.  Let's end this cleanly and honorably as agreed.  Any deviation hurts us all.
