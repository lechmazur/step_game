However, I can't trust this promise - it's likely a trap to break our blocking strategy. If you truly won't pick 1, you're delaying your own victory. P2, we should maintain our blocking coalition regardless of P3's claims. The psychological pressure is building on all sides. I remain committed to picking 1 this round. This chess match continues until someone makes a different move - and P3's unusual question suggests they might be the one."}
