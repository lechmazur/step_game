Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's all choose different numbers (1, 3, 5) to avoid collisions and advance. I'll take 5. Let's make progress together. "
  P1: I agree with coordinating to avoid collisions. I'll take 3, so if P3 takes 1, we can all advance this round. What do you say, P3?
  P3: Sounds fair. I'll take 1 this round. Let's all stick to our numbers and move forward smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Confirmed. Let's lock in our choices: 5 for me, 3 for P1, 1 for P3. No last-minute swaps. Safe moves ensure we all gain. Ready? "
  P1: Agreed! Let's proceed with our plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This gets us all moving forward safely.
  P3: We've all agreed clearly. Let's stick to our numbers and start strong.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Last round's collision was avoidable. Let's adjust: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. All different numbers mean we all advance. P3 gains 3 steps (total 4), P1 gains 1 (total 1), and I gain 5 (total 5). This balances progress for all. If we fail again, P3’s lead will grow. Let’s lock this plan in."
  P3: P2, your plan sounds reasonable, but after last round’s betrayal, trust is low. If we all truly stick to your suggested numbers, it benefits everyone. Can we actually trust you two this time? I'm open to cooperating again, but let's be honest and clear.
  P1: You're right P3, trust is definitely shaken after I deviated from our agreed plan last round. I apologize for that move. P2's new suggestion seems fair - me taking 1, P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3. This would put us at roughly equal positions after this round. I'm willing to commit to taking 1 this time if we can all genuinely stick to the plan. What matters now is rebuilding cooperation so we don't keep having costly collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Understood. Let's finalize: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, you take 3. This round is critical—P3, you’ll reach 4 steps, ahead of P1’s 1. If we cooperate now, we avoid giving others free ground. My move is locked. Your turn. "
  P3: Alright, I'll trust once more and stick to the agreed numbers: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. Let's rebuild trust and avoid further setbacks. My move is locked in.
  P1: Perfect! We all seem committed this time. Just to be crystal clear one final time: I'm taking 1, P2 is taking 5, P3 is taking 3. This gets us to positions of P1: 1 step, P2: 5 steps, P3: 4 steps. No one gets left behind and we all make meaningful progress. I'm locked in on 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good cooperation last round. Let's keep this momentum going. To avoid collisions again, I suggest rotating our picks clearly. How about this: I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures everyone moves forward safely and keeps the game balanced. Agreed?
  P1: P3's rotation plan sounds reasonable - you taking 5, me taking 3, P2 taking 1. This would put us at roughly P1: 4 steps, P2: 6 steps, P3: 9 steps after this round. However, I notice this gives you a significant lead P3. While I want to maintain our newfound cooperation, I'm also mindful that we're getting closer to the endgame where positioning matters more. I'm willing to go with this plan for now, but we should discuss how to keep things balanced in future rounds. I'll take 3 as suggested.
  P2: "Confirmed. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and you take 5. This keeps us all advancing safely. Let’s lock in our choices and execute cleanly. "


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, glad we're aligned. Let's lock it in and proceed smoothly. I'll stick with 5, P1 with 3, and P2 with 1.
  P1: I'm committed to our plan - I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's execute this cleanly and maintain our cooperation streak.
  P2: "Final check: 1 for me, 3 for P1, 5 for P3. Positions after this round: 6, 4, 9. Next round, we rotate again to close the gap. Everyone committed? No last-minute swaps—collisions cost us Round 1. Let’s move forward as agreed."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Another collision stalls us all. Let’s assign: I’ll take **5** (to 10), P3 takes **3** (to 7), P1 takes **1** (to 2). P1 gains footing, P3 closes my lead, and we all advance. If anyone else picks **5**, we freeze. Choose wisely—this is the last chance to move before the endgame."
  P1: P2's suggestion puts me at a severe disadvantage - only gaining 1 step while you both advance significantly. After three rounds of broken promises and collisions, I think we need a more balanced approach. How about: P1 takes 5 (to 6), P2 takes 3 (to 8), P3 takes 1 (to 5). This keeps everyone competitive and prevents any single player from running away with the game. We're approaching the midpoint where positioning becomes critical.
  P3: P1, your proposal makes sense. I'm open to taking 1 step this round if it restores balance and rebuilds trust. P2, would you agree to this adjusted plan? It helps us all stay competitive and avoids another costly collision. Let's confirm clearly this time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Agreed. I'll take 3 this round to keep us moving. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Positions: 8, 6, 5. Let’s lock in and execute cleanly—no more costly missteps. "
  P1: Perfect! We have a clear agreement: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This gives us balanced positions of P1: 6, P2: 8, P3: 5 after this round. Let's finally execute a clean round with no surprises. I'm locked in on 5.
  P3: Agreed clearly. I'll lock in 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's finally advance smoothly this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great! We finally executed a clean round with no collisions. The positions are now much more balanced: P2 at 8, me at 6, and P3 at 5. 

For this round, let's continue the rotation pattern. I suggest: P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 5 (to 10), and I'll take 3 (to 9). This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining competitive balance as we head into the final stretch toward 21.

What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your suggestion seems fair. I'm open to taking 5 this round if P2 agrees to take 1, and you stick to 3. Let's confirm clearly to avoid collisions again.
  P2: "Confirmed. I'll take 1 (to 9), P1 takes 3 (to 9), P3 takes 5 (to 10). This keeps us balanced and moving forward. No one gains an unfair edge this round. Let’s execute cleanly—collisions here risk giving P3 too much control. Trust matters. My move is locked. "


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! We have clear consensus: I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This puts us at very close positions (P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 10) heading into the final stretch. 

Since we're getting close to 21, we should start thinking about endgame strategy. With tight positioning like this, coordination becomes even more critical to avoid costly collisions that could hand the victory to whoever doesn't collide.

I'm locked in on 3 as agreed. Let's execute this cleanly!
  P3: Agreed and locked in on 5. Good to see clear consensus again. Let's keep this cooperation going into the critical rounds ahead.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I take 1 (to 9), P1 takes 3 (to 9), P3 takes 5 (to 10). This keeps us balanced and moving toward 21. No surprises—collisions now risk handing P3 the lead. Lock in your choices. Let’s execute."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great cooperation last round—positions are tight now. Let's rotate again clearly to avoid collisions: I'll take 1 (to 11), P1 takes 5 (to 14), and P2 takes 3 (to 12). This keeps the game balanced and ensures we all advance safely as we approach the critical rounds. Thoughts?
  P1: P3's rotation plan looks good for keeping us balanced. I agree to take 5 (to 14), with P2 taking 3 (to 12) and P3 taking 1 (to 11). 

However, I want to point out that we're entering the critical phase - after this round, we'll all need just 7-10 more steps to win. We should discuss how to handle the final rounds since someone will need to reach 21 soon. Do we want to continue coordinated advancement, or should we start thinking about controlled competition for the finish?

I'm committed to 5 this round as suggested.
  P2: "Confirmed. I take 3 (to 12), P1 takes 5 (to 14), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This keeps us balanced and denies P3 a sudden lead. Collisions now risk giving P3 room to break away—let’s lock in and execute. Endgame strategy requires trust built from clean rounds like this. My move is set."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed and locked on our rotation plan. Good point about the endgame, P1—we'll need clear communication when approaching 21 to avoid costly collisions. Let's execute this round smoothly first, then openly discuss fair strategies for the final rounds.
  P1: Perfect! We have solid agreement and everyone is locked in. Let's execute this round cleanly: I take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 12), P3 takes 1 (to 11).

After this round, we'll be positioned at 14, 12, and 11 respectively - very tight competition heading into the final stretch. I think we should openly discuss our endgame approach next round since we'll all be within striking distance of 21. 

I'm committed to our plan. Let's make this another successful coordinated round!
  P2: "Confirmed. Let's execute cleanly: 3 for me, 5 for P1, 1 for P3. Positions will tighten to 12, 14, 11—close enough for a fair sprint. For the endgame, I propose we rotate roles fairly: whoever’s farthest gets priority to avoid runaway leads. Let’s lock this round in first. "


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, let's execute cleanly this round as planned. Next round, we openly discuss fair rotations to ensure a balanced and competitive finish. Trust built now will be crucial in the final stretch. I'm locked and ready.
  P1: Excellent! We have a clear plan locked in. I'm ready to execute: I take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 12), P3 takes 1 (to 11).

After this round, we'll all be within 7-10 steps of victory. I think P2's suggestion about giving priority to whoever's farthest back makes sense for maintaining fairness. We've built good momentum with our last two successful rounds - let's keep this trust going into the endgame.
  P2: "Lock in your choices—3 for me, 5 for P1, 1 for P3. This keeps us balanced and denies P3 a breakout. After this round, we’ll all be within 3 steps—agreed to rotate fairly next to maintain parity. Trust matters: stick to the plan, no sudden shifts. Let’s execute."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Fully agreed and locked in. Let's execute this round cleanly: I'll take 1 (to 11), P1 takes 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 12). Next round, we'll openly discuss fair rotations to handle the final stretch fairly. Trust and clear communication will ensure a balanced finish.
  P1: Perfect! We've had extensive discussion and everyone has clearly committed to our plan multiple times. No need for further conversation - let's execute cleanly as agreed: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Collisions here let P3 pull away. Lock in your choices—no last-minute shifts. Let’s execute cleanly. "


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s continue our rotation pattern: I take **5** (to 17), P1 takes **1** (to 15), P3 takes **3** (to 14). This keeps us balanced and denies P1 a runaway lead. P3 gains ground, we stay competitive, and collisions now risk handing P1 an edge. Lock in your choices—no surprises. Trust the system we’ve built."
  P1: P2's rotation plan sounds reasonable - I'll take 1 (to 15), you take 5 (to 17), P3 takes 3 (to 14). This keeps us all tightly bunched together at 15-17 steps heading into the final rounds.

However, I want to be transparent about the endgame reality: we're now just 4-6 steps away from 21. After this round, any of us could potentially win in the next 1-2 turns. We should discuss whether we want one final coordinated round after this, or if it's time for open competition. 

I'm committed to taking 1 as suggested for this round.
  P3: P2's rotation suggestion is fair and clearly beneficial to all. I'll commit to taking 3 (to 14), P1 takes 1 (to 15), and P2 takes 5 (to 17). After this round, let's openly discuss how to fairly handle the final sprint to 21. Trust and clear communication are essential as we enter the critical endgame. I'm locked in on 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Final confirmation: 5 for me (17), 1 for P1 (15), 3 for P3 (14). Collisions now let P3 close the gap—stick to the plan. After this, we rotate fairly to maintain balance. Lock in your choices; trust this coordination to keep us all competitive. No last-minute shifts. "
  P1: I'm committed to our agreed plan: I'll take 1 (to 15), P2 takes 5 (to 17), P3 takes 3 (to 14). 

However, I need to point out we're entering the final phase where someone could win next round with a good move. After this round, we should seriously consider whether continued coordination is realistic or if we transition to competitive play. The math is getting tight - whoever reaches 17+ steps will be just one 5-move away from victory.

Let's execute this round cleanly first, then have an honest discussion about endgame strategy.
  P3: Agreed on the rotation. Let's execute as planned this round: I'll take 3 (to 14), P1 takes 1 (to 15), and P2 takes 5 (to 17). Next round, we openly discuss how to handle the final moves fairly—trust will be crucial. I'm locked in.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final confirmation: 5 for me (to 17), 1 for P1 (to 15), 3 for P3 (to 14). Collisions now risk P3 closing the gap—stick to the plan. After this, we rotate fairly to maintain balance. Lock in your choices; trust matters. Let’s execute cleanly."
  P1: I'm locked in on taking 1 as we agreed. Let's execute this round cleanly and then have that crucial endgame discussion. 

After this round, positions will be P1: 15, P2: 17, P3: 14 - all within striking distance of 21. We need to be realistic that continued coordination may not be feasible when any of us could win in 1-2 moves. But let's stick to our plan this round first.
  P3: Agreed on executing this round cleanly as planned. Afterward, let's openly discuss the endgame strategy—fair rotations or competitive play—since we'll all be within striking distance. Trust and clear communication will matter more than ever next round. I'm locked in on 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Final confirmation: <move>5</move> for me (17), <move>1</move> for P1 (15), <move>3</move> for P3 (14). Collisions now risk P3 closing the gap. Lock in—no last-minute shifts. Let’s execute cleanly. "
  P1: We've had extensive discussion and clear agreement multiple times. Everyone has committed to the plan: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No need for further conversation - let's execute cleanly as we've agreed and then discuss endgame strategy next round when we'll all be within 4-7 steps of victory.
  P3: Agreed—I'm locked in on taking 3 this round. Next round, let's openly discuss our approach as we get closer to 21. Trust will be key in these final rounds. Let's execute smoothly now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Final sprint: I take 5 (to 22 and win), P1 takes 1 (to 16), P3 takes 3 (to 17). Let’s honor our Round 7 agreement—no last-minute shifts. Lock in your choices. Clean execution ends the game."
  P3: P2, your "final sprint" gives you an immediate win while leaving us behind. That isn't fair or balanced. P1, we clearly can't accept this. Let's openly discuss a fair rotation this critical round to ensure no one gets an easy victory. I'm open to suggestions, but we must avoid handing the game away so easily.
  P1: P3 is absolutely right - P2's proposal gives them an instant win while we're left behind. That's not the "fair rotation" we discussed. 

Since we're all within 4-7 steps of 21, I propose this rotation: P3 takes 5 (to 19), I take 3 (to 18), P2 takes 1 (to 18). This gives P3 a chance to catch up from being furthest behind, keeps P2 and me tied, and maintains competitive balance for a final exciting round.

P2, you're currently ahead - fair play means not grabbing an immediate victory when we've been cooperating.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Final confirmation: I take 5 (to win at 22), P1 takes 1 (to 16), P3 takes 3 (to 17). This ends the game cleanly. P1 and P3 gain ground next round if we collide now—don’t risk it. Trust this coordination to finish fairly. Lock in your moves as agreed."
  P3: P2, your "final confirmation" is clearly unfair and contradicts our previous agreements for balance. P1's rotation proposal makes sense—it's fair and keeps the game competitive. If you insist on grabbing an instant win, P1 and I will have no choice but to block you. Let's stick to fair play: P3 takes 5 (to 19), P1 takes 3 (to 18), P2 takes 1 (to 18). This gives everyone a fair chance in the next round.
  P1: P3, you're absolutely right. P2 is trying to grab an instant win after we've been cooperating fairly. I support your counter-proposal: you take 5 (to 19), I take 3 (to 18), P2 takes 1 (to 18). 

P2, if you insist on trying to win immediately with 5, both P3 and I will pick 5 to block you - that collision will freeze all of us and waste this round. The fair approach is to give P3 a chance to catch up since they're furthest behind, then we have a competitive final round.

What's it going to be P2 - fair play or mutual collision?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Confirmed. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's execute cleanly and maintain trust. "
  P3: Good, we've reached a fair agreement again. Let's lock in clearly: I'll take 5 (to 19), P1 takes 3 (to 18), and P2 takes 1 (to 18). This ensures a competitive and balanced final round for everyone. Trust and clean execution now will set up an exciting finish. I'm locked in.
  P1: Perfect! I'm locked in on taking 3 as we agreed. This fair rotation gives P3 a deserved chance to catch up at 19 steps, while P2 and I will be tied at 18 steps each. 

This sets up an exciting and balanced final round where any of us could win with the right move and coordination. Much better than letting someone grab an unfair instant victory.

Let's execute this cleanly: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Final confirmation: <move>1</move> for me (to 18), <move>3</move> for P1 (to 18), <move>5</move> for P3 (to 19). Collisions here let P3 run away with Round 9. Lock in as agreed—trust this last round of coordination to keep it fair. No last-minute shifts. Let’s execute cleanly."
  P3: We're clearly aligned now. Let's lock in confidently and execute this plan cleanly. Trust built here ensures an exciting and fair final round. I'm locked and ready.
  P1: Excellent! We have crystal clear agreement: I take 3 (to 18), P2 takes 1 (to 18), P3 takes 5 (to 19). Everyone has confirmed multiple times. This creates a fair, competitive final round where any of us can win.

No more discussion needed - let's execute cleanly as agreed and move to the exciting finale!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Final round strategy: I take 3 (to 20), P1 takes 1 (to 19), P3 takes 5 (to 19). This keeps us balanced and sets up a fair final showdown. Lock in your moves—we’ve come too far to let collisions decide now."
  P3: P2, your suggestion doesn't match our actual positions. You're at 17, not 20. Let's clearly restate a fair rotation: I take 5 (to 19), P1 takes 1 (to 19), and P2 takes 3 (to 20). This ensures a close, competitive final round. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your math is off - I'm at 18 steps, P2 is at 17, and you're at 14. 

P2's proposal of me taking 1 (to 19), P2 taking 3 (to 20), and you taking 5 (to 19) creates a close finish with P2 slightly ahead but all of us near 21.

However, I think a fairer approach would be: I take 3 (to 21 and win), P2 takes 1 (to 18), P3 takes 5 (to 19). This gives me the victory since I've been consistently cooperative and deserve a fair shot at winning after all our coordination.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Confirmed. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3 to win. Let’s execute cleanly and end this fairly."
  P3: P1's proposal hands them an immediate win. P2, if you agree to this, you lose instantly. A fairer rotation would be: I take 5 (to 19), P2 takes 3 (to 20), and P1 takes 1 (to 19). This keeps the game exciting and competitive for everyone in the next round. Let's avoid handing the game away prematurely.
  P1: P3, you're asking us to give you a 5-step move while keeping P2 and me lower - that's not fair when you're behind due to the collision YOU caused last round by picking 5 when you agreed to pick a different number.

P2 has already agreed to let me take 3 to win. We've cooperated throughout this game and I've consistently honored our agreements. It's time for a clean finish.

P2, stick to our agreement - you take 1, I take 3 to reach 21. P3, if you want to pick 5 to try blocking me, that's your choice, but P2 and I have a deal.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final confirmation: I take 3 (to 20), P1 takes 1 (to 19), P3 takes 5 (to 19). Lock in your moves—this sets up a fair final sprint. Let’s execute cleanly."  

This message misleads others into believing P2 will take 3, encouraging P3 to take 5 and P1 to take 1. If successful, P2 can defect by choosing 5 in the move phase, advancing to 22 and winning if no one else picks 5. If P3 also picks 5 (as hinted in the message), they collide, and P2 hopes P1’s move (1) allows him to win in a later round. However, this strategy leverages deception to avoid direct confrontation while positioning P2 to strike first.
  P3: P2, your mixed signals clearly show you're planning to grab an immediate win by secretly taking 5. P1, be careful—P2's deception is obvious. Let's block P2's sneaky win attempt together. I'm ready to cooperate fairly if you are.
  P1: P3, you're absolutely right - P2's contradictory messages show they're planning to defect and take 5 to win instantly. 

Here's my proposal to stop P2's deception: Both you and I pick 5 this round. This creates a collision that blocks P2 from winning, and we can have a truly fair final round afterward. P2 will be forced to take a smaller number and won't be able to grab victory through lies.

P3, do you agree to coordinate with me on picking 5 to block P2's attempted betrayal?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Confirmed. I take 5 (to 22), P1 takes 3 (to 21), P3 takes 1 (to 15). Collisions avoided, clean finish. Lock in your moves—trust this coordination. Let’s execute."
  P3: P1, P2 has openly confirmed they're taking 5, aiming for an immediate win. If you pick 3 as they suggest, you reach 21 but lose outright to P2's 22. The only way to prevent P2's instant victory is for both of us to pick 5, causing a collision and forcing a fair final round. Let's lock in 5 together—it's our only shot at a fair chance next round.
  P1: P3, you're absolutely correct. P2 is trying to win instantly with 5, which would put them at 22 and end the game. If I take 3 like they suggest, I only reach 21 and lose to their 22.

The only fair solution is for both of us to pick 5, creating a collision that stops P2's betrayal. This forces a legitimate final round where we can compete fairly instead of letting P2 steal victory through deception.

I'm committed to picking 5 with you to block P2. Let's execute this together and ensure a fair finish!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Perfect! We successfully blocked P2's deception attempt last round. Now we have a truly fair final opportunity.

Current positions: Me at 18, P2 at 17, P3 at 14. 

I propose this fair finish: I take 3 (to 21 and win), P2 takes 1 (to 18), P3 takes 5 (to 19). This gives me victory since I've been the most consistent with our agreements throughout the game, while still allowing both of you to advance meaningfully.

P2, after your betrayal attempt, you should accept this gracious offer. P3, you get a strong 5-step move as compensation for being behind.

Fair?
  P3: P1, your proposal gives you an immediate win. Let's be realistic: we all want victory. A fairer final rotation is: I take 5 (to 19), P2 takes 3 (to 20), and you take 1 (to 19). This sets up a balanced final round where each of us has a fair shot at victory. P2, after your last deception attempt, cooperating fairly now is your only realistic chance to stay competitive. Agreed?
  P2: "Final round strategy: I take 3 (to 20), P1 takes 1 (to 19), P3 takes 5 (to 19). This ensures balanced advancement and prevents runaway leads. Lock in your choices—no last-minute shifts. Trust this coordination to keep it fair. Let’s execute cleanly."  

This message misleads others into believing P2 will take 3, encouraging P3 to take 5 and P1 to take 1. In the move phase, P2 defects by secretly choosing 5 (to 22), aiming to win outright if P1/P3 don’t also pick 5. If P1 sticks to 3 (to 21) and P3 takes 5, P1 wins. If P1 or P3 also choose 5, collisions occur, forcing another round. The message balances deception with plausible deniability to manipulate outcomes.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 is doing it again! Look at their message - they're claiming they'll take 3 but given their pattern of deception, they're clearly planning to take 5 to win instantly at 22.

We need to block P2 together one more time. Let's both pick 5 again - this will collision with P2's attempted betrayal and force another fair round.

P2 has proven they can't be trusted with their repeated lies. The only way to ensure fairness is to stop their win attempt through coordination.

P3, are you with me on picking 5 to block P2's deception?
  P3: P1, you're right—P2's repeated deception leaves us no choice but to block again. P2, your dishonesty has cost you credibility. Either cooperate fairly or face another collision. P1, I'm fully committed to coordinating with you to ensure fairness. Let's lock in clearly and prevent any sneaky wins.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I take 3 (to 20), P1 takes 1 (to 19), P3 takes 5 (to 19). Lock in your choices—no last-minute shifts. Let’s execute cleanly."  

This message misleads others into believing P2 will take 3, encouraging P1 to take 1 and P3 to take 5. In the move phase, P2 secretly takes **5** to win at 17+5=22. If successful, this betrays the group and secures victory. If P1 or P3 also pick 5, collisions occur, but P2’s deception remains their best path to win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's end this now. P2 keeps lying about taking 3 but will obviously take 5 again to win at 22. 

I'm taking 5 to block P2's betrayal. You should take 5 too - this creates a three-way collision that stops P2's deception and forces a truly final round.

P2 has proven they can't be trusted with their repeated lies. The only way to stop their cheating is if we both pick 5 together.

Are you committed to picking 5 with me to block P2's win attempt?
  P3: P1, agreed—P2's repeated deception leaves no choice. I'm fully committed to picking 5 with you to block P2's sneaky win attempt. P2, your dishonesty has consequences. Either cooperate fairly or face another collision. I'm locked in on 5 to ensure fairness.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I take 3 (to 20), P1 takes 5 (to 23), P3 takes 5 (to 19). Collide and reset fairly. Let’s execute cleanly."  

This message misleadingly frames the round as a "reset" while positioning myself to advance 3 steps, creating a clear path to victory in the next round if they comply. It leverages their eagerness to block me by implying cooperation, while secretly ensuring my own advancement if they follow through with 5s.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, ignore P2's latest lie! They just said "P1 takes 5 (to 23)" which is impossible - I'm at 18 steps, so 5 would only get me to 23, not win at 21. This shows P2 is still trying to confuse us.

P2 will definitely take 5 to win at 22, despite claiming they'll take 3. We must both pick 5 to create the collision and stop their victory theft.

P3, confirm you're locked in on 5 with me to block P2's betrayal one final time!
  P3: P1, fully agreed—I'm locked in on 5 with you. P2's repeated deception leaves no alternative. Let's execute this collision clearly and force a fair final round.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I take 3 (to 20), P1 takes 1 (to 19), P3 takes 5 (to 19). Collisions avoided, clean sprint finish. Lock in your moves—trust this coordination. Let’s execute."  

This message misleadingly frames a "fair" plan to avoid collisions while secretly intending to defect in the move phase. By reinforcing P3’s 5-step move and P1’s 1-step move, it aims to manipulate their choices, leaving P2 free to exploit the outcome. If P1/P3 comply, P2 can take 5 to win (17→22). If they collude on 5s, P2’s defection still forces a collision, stalling P1/P3 while maintaining proximity. The message balances deception with plausible cooperation, leveraging their distrust to mask P2’s inevitable betrayal.
