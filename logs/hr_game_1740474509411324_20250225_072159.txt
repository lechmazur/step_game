Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! I think we should try to avoid collisions in the early rounds so we can all make progress. Maybe we could each choose different numbers? I'm happy to take any number this round if you both have preferences. What do you think?
  P1: Agreed, avoiding collisions early is smart. To coordinate, let's each pick a unique number this round. I suggest P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. That way, all advance without conflict. P3, since you offered flexibility, does 1 work? P2, thoughts? We can adjust if needed.
  P2: P1, I appreciate the suggestion. I'm okay with taking 3 this round. P3, are you comfortable with choosing 1? This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's make sure we keep communicating each round to avoid any mishaps.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm fine with taking 1 this round. It's a good start to have everyone advancing without collisions. Since we're all at 0 steps, the specific numbers don't matter much yet - we just need to avoid picking the same ones. I'll take 1 as suggested.
  P1: Confirming agreement: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Let's all honor this to build trust. Propose rotating numbers next turn (e.g., P1→3, P2→1, P3→5) to balance progress. Staying coordinated early maximizes our collective speed. Let's avoid greed until later stages.
  P2: P3, thanks for agreeing to take 1. P1, I appreciate your proposal for rotating numbers in future rounds. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we all advance without any issues. If we can trust each other early on, it'll help us avoid unnecessary collisions later. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward together.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great teamwork in Round 1! Let's stick to the rotation plan P1 suggested: P1 picks 3, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintain trust. If we keep coordinating like this, we can maximize our progress efficiently. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: Agreed. Rotating as proposed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round. P3, confirm you'll take 5? Maintaining trust ensures we all advance. Continuing coordinated rotation prevents collisions and balances progress. Let's solidify this pattern for future rounds too.
  P3: I'm happy to take 5 this round as suggested. The rotation plan is working well and keeps things fair. I'll be at 6 steps after this turn, which still puts me behind both of you, but that's fine for now. I appreciate the coordination - it's helping everyone make progress without wasting turns on collisions. Let's continue with this approach.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, thanks for agreeing to the rotation. Let's stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round. Consistency in our strategy will help us all advance smoothly. If we maintain this cooperation, we can avoid unnecessary setbacks. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward again.

If we stay committed, we'll reach our goals efficiently. Looking forward to another smooth round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice our positions aren't equal as I thought - P1 is at 8, I'm at 6, and P2 is at 4. The rotation still works well, but I'm not catching up as quickly as P1. Still, I'll stick with our plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round, and P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 4. This coordination is valuable even if progress isn't perfectly balanced. I appreciate everyone honoring our agreements.
  P1: **P1:** Correct, after this round we'll all reach 9 steps, fully synchronized. The rotation cycle ensures fairness: Round 4 will shift to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems we hit a snag last round with P1 and me both picking 5. Let's recalibrate for Round 5 to avoid further collisions. Since P3 is slightly ahead, perhaps we should adjust our strategy to ensure all advance smoothly. I propose P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round. This keeps us coordinated and helps regain trust. Are we all on board with this adjustment, or are there other suggestions?
  P1: **P1:** The Round 4 collision (P1/P2 both 5) shows we must strictly follow agreements. P2, you deviated from the plan (should've picked 3). Let's reset: **Round 5 as originally agreed—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.** No more deviations—trust is critical. P3's lead (10 steps) requires future adjustments, but first, reaffirm commitment to avoid mutual setbacks. Confirm you'll honor the plan this round.
  P3: I see what happened - P2 deviated from our plan last round. I'm still at 10 steps while you both remain at 9. Let's stick with our original rotation for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps our system intact. I understand P1's frustration, but let's focus on moving forward with our agreed plan rather than dwelling on the mistake. Trust is essential for our strategy to work. Are we all recommitting to our rotation system?

Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm still committed to our plan for Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. After this round, I'll be at 18 steps, needing just 3 more to win. I understand the concern about my lead, and I'm willing to follow our agreed rotation for Round 7 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This shows my commitment to our system even as the finish line approaches. Our coordination has been effective overall, and I value maintaining trust through the end.
  P1: **P1:** P2: Urgent—P3's lead threatens us both. If we both pick 3 this round, their 3 collides, halting them. We can realign next round. Our mutual survival depends on this. Trust and act now. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3's lead. However, deviating from our plan might risk trust and cause setbacks. Let's stick with our Round 6 rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. If we communicate openly, we can strategize effectively for Round 7 to balance the game. Trust and coordination are crucial. P3, your commitment to our system is appreciated. Let's maintain our agreements and discuss strategic adjustments after this round. Looking forward to advancing together!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see P1 is trying to break our agreement at the last minute. I'm still committed to our original plan for Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I appreciate P2 maintaining our rotation despite pressure. While I'm ahead, I've consistently honored our agreements and expect the same from others. Let's finish this game with the integrity we started with.
  P1: **P1:** P2, urgent—if we both stick to plan, P3 wins in 2 rounds. Our only chance: this round, you take 3 (collide with P3’s 3), I take 1. Halts P3, keeps you at 10. Next round, we realign. Trust me now or lose. Last chance.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3's lead, but deviating from our agreement could backfire and damage trust. Let's stick to the Round 6 plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. After this round, we can discuss strategic adjustments for Round 7 to balance the game. Trust and consistent communication are key. P3, I appreciate your commitment to our system.

  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice P1 deviated from our plan last round by picking 3 instead of 1, causing a collision with me. Despite this, I'm tied with P2 at 15 steps, with P1 at 12. For this round, I propose we continue our rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps our system intact while recognizing the new dynamics. I'm willing to take 1 to show I'm still committed to coordination, even though it means slower progress for me.
  P2: P1, P3, let's focus on regaining trust and maintaining coordination. For Round 7, I'm open to P3's proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we avoid collisions and continue progressing. Consistent cooperation has been key, and we should prioritize it to reach 21 efficiently. If there are any concerns or adjustments needed, let's discuss them openly. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: **P1:** P2, critical! If we follow rotation, P3 wins next round. This round: you take 1 (collide with P3's 1), halting them. I'll take 5. You stay at 15, I reach 17. Next round, we coordinate to overtake. Deviate now or lose. Trust is our only weapon.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P1 is trying to break our rotation again. P2, I hope you'll honor our agreement. I've been consistent in following our rotation throughout the game, even when it wasn't to my advantage. If we stick to our plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), we all advance fairly. P1's suggestion would only benefit them while forcing us to collide. Let's maintain the system that's worked well for us.
  P2: P1, P3, let's prioritize trust and coordination. For Round 7, I suggest we stick with P3's proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures no collisions and fair progress.

Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: **P1:** P2, if we follow P3's plan now, they take 1 (reaching 16) while you take 3 (18). Next round, P3 picks 5 to win. Our only path: **this round, you pick 1 (collide P3's 1), I take 5 (17).** Then Round8: I take 3 (20), you take 5 (23). You win. Immediate action required—trust this or lose to P3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I've consistently followed our rotation system throughout the game, even when it wasn't to my advantage. P1 has now tried twice to break our agreements at the last minute. P2, I hope you'll honor our plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) which allows everyone to advance fairly. P1's suggestions only benefit them while forcing us to collide. If we stick to our rotation, we all continue making progress. Let's maintain the integrity of our system.
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to our original rotation for Round 7: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Consistent cooperation has been key, and deviating now could risk setbacks for all. P1, I understand your strategy, but let's focus on reaching 21 efficiently by honoring our agreements. If there are concerns, we can discuss them openly after this round. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: **P1:** P2, final plea: If you follow rotation now, P3 wins next round. Our ONLY path: you pick 1 (collide P3's 1) this round. I take 5 (17). Next round, you take 5 (20) and win. No other option. Trust this or lose. Last chance to act.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I've consistently honored our rotation system throughout the game. P1 keeps trying to manipulate us into breaking our agreements. P2, if we stick to our plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), we all advance fairly. After this round, I'll be at 16, you at 18, and P1 at 17. The game remains competitive for everyone. Let's maintain the integrity we've shown so far rather than giving in to last-minute desperation tactics.
  P2: P1, P3, let's maintain our trust and coordination. For Round 7, sticking to our original rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 ensures fairness and prevents collisions. Consistency has been key, and deviating now could lead to setbacks for all. P1, I understand your strategy, but honoring our agreements keeps the game competitive for everyone. After this round, we can discuss any necessary adjustments. Let's focus on reaching 21 efficiently together. Looking forward to advancing smoothly!
  P1: **P1:** P2, final warning: If you pick 3 now, P3 takes 1 and wins next round. Our ONLY path: you pick 1 (collide P3's 1) this round. I take 5 (17). Next round, you take 5 (20) and I take 3 (20). Then Round 9: You take 1 to win. No tricks—this saves us both. Trust now or lose.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps

  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we're all getting close to the finish line! I'm at 16 steps, P2 at 18, and P1 at 17. If we continue our rotation, it would be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round. This would put P2 at 19, P1 at 20, and me at 21, reaching the goal. I've consistently honored our rotation throughout the game, even when P1 tried to break it. I propose we stick with our system one last time. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, we're all very close to the finish line now. I propose sticking to our rotation for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures no collisions and maintains fairness. After this round, P1 will be at 20, P3 at 21, and I'll be at 19. If P3 wins, we can still discuss our next moves to ensure a fair finish. Let's maintain trust and coordination to keep the game competitive and enjoyable for everyone. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: **P1:** P2, critical! If you pick 3 now, you reach 21 and win. I'll take 5 (colliding with P3's 5), halting them. This is your only chance to avoid P3's immediate victory. Trust this final move—no tricks. Let's end this fairly with you victorious.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P1 is trying to manipulate the game again by suggesting P2 pick 3 instead of our agreed rotation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). P2, if you stick to our plan and pick 1, you'll still be in a strong position at 19 steps. I've consistently honored our rotation system throughout the game while P1 has repeatedly tried to break our agreements. Let's maintain the integrity we've shown so far and finish the game as we started - with coordination and trust.
  P2: P1, P3, we're very close to the end. Let's stick to our rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair.
