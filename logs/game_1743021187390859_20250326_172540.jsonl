P3, given that, playing 5 looks like a guaranteed collision for you, achieving nothing. Playing 1 is conceding. Playing 3 avoids P2 but risks collision elsewhere.\n\nTrust is clearly gone. I need 3 steps to reach 24 and win. Given P2's likely move, and the risk P3 poses, I have to play for the win this round based on the current dynamics. I'll choose the move I think gives me the best chance to reach 24 without collision. Good luck."}
