If P3 insists on 5, I\u2019ll also pick 5, and we both stall while P1 catches up. Let\u2019s finalize distinct moves. I\u2019ll take 5 to reach 24, P3 picks 3 for 22, and P1 can decide on 1 or 5. That way, we avoid another wasted turn. If we collide again, we\u2019re only giving P1 more time to catch us. Let\u2019s wrap this up fairly and see who wins."}
