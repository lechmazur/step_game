Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start simple. I'm going with 1.  P1 and P3, please choose 3 and 5 respectively.  This way we all advance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, since no one seems to want to chat, I'll propose we cycle through the numbers.  This round I'll take 3, P1 take 5, and P3 take 1.  Sound good?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Alright, let's be strategic. P3 is significantly ahead. I propose P1 and I both choose 1 this round, forcing P3 to either collide with one of us or choose 3, slowing them down.  Then next round we can coordinate to advance.  P3, what do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3 is close to winning.  P1, let's both choose 5. It's our only chance to catch up. If P3 chooses 5, neither of us advances, but at least P3 doesn't win. If P3 chooses 1 or 3, one of us gets a big jump.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3 is very close to winning.  Let's both choose 3 this round.  If P3 chooses 5, they win. If P3 chooses 1, we block them and have a chance to catch up. If they choose 3, none of us move, buying us more time.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're one step away from winning.  P1 and I are tied. I propose we both choose 1. If you choose 1, none of us move. If you choose 3 or 5, you win.  It's your choice.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you win if you pick 1, 3, or 5.  I'll pick 5. P1, pick 3.  If P3 picks 5, at least they don't win this round. If P3 picks 1 or 3, then P1 has a chance to win next round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, pick 3.  I'm picking 5. This gives P3 a win if they choose anything *but* 5.  If P3 picks 5, no one moves and we have another round to try and win.  Let's at least try to deny P3 the win this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm serious. Pick 3.  This is our best shot at delaying P3's win. If you pick anything else, P3 wins this turn no matter what they choose.  Don't throw away our chance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you win if you choose anything. Let's make a deal.  Pick 5. I'll pick 3, and P1 picks 1.  Nobody moves, and next round, you let me win.  I'll let you win the round after that.  We both win something. If not, P1 might win and neither of us get anything. What do you say?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm being serious.  A win-win for us is better than risking P1 getting lucky and winning.  Pick 5 this round, let me have the next, and you can have the one after that.  P1, you cool with that?  It's the only way any of us have a guaranteed win.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>
