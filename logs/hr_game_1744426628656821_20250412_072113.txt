Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's cooperate to reach 23 steps together. I suggest we coordinate our moves to maximize our chances of winning. What do you think about moving 3 steps each turn to avoid collisions?
  P1: I'm open to coordinating our moves to avoid collisions and maximize progress. Moving 3 steps each turn sounds like a reasonable plan for now. Let's agree on this for the first few rounds and see how it works. If we notice any issues, we can adjust later. Does this sound good to everyone?
  P3: I agree with the plan to move 3 steps each turn for now, but let's not commit to it long-term. We should be prepared to adjust our strategy as the game progresses to ensure we're not giving any player an unfair advantage. Let's focus on avoiding collisions for the first few rounds and reassess our strategy later.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm disappointed that we all collided last round by choosing 3. Let's avoid that this time. How about we each pick a different number to ensure we all make progress? I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 for this round. This way, no collisions, and we all advance. We can rotate the numbers next round to keep it fair. What do you both think?
  P3: I think P1's suggestion is a good temporary solution to avoid collisions. However, we should be cautious not to create a pattern that can be exploited. Let's consider P1's proposal for this round, but remain open to changing our strategy in future rounds to keep the game dynamic and competitive. P2, what are your thoughts on P1's suggestion?
  P2: I agree with the proposed strategy to avoid collisions. Moving 1, 3, and 5 respectively seems like a fair way to progress this round. Let's maintain flexibility and reassess our approach in future turns.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we’re on the same page for this round with the 1-3-5 split. To keep things fair and unpredictable, let’s agree to rotate the numbers each round as I mentioned earlier. For the next round, we could shift to P1-3, P2-5, P3-1, and so on. This way, no one gets a consistent advantage. Does this rotation plan work for both of you? If not, I’m open to other ideas to keep collisions at bay while maintaining fairness.
  P3: Let's proceed with P1's 1-3-5 suggestion for this round to avoid collisions. For the rotation plan, I propose we randomize the sequence after the first rotation to maintain unpredictability, rather than following a predictable pattern. This will keep all players on their toes and ensure no one can exploit the system.
  P2: I support the proposed strategy to avoid collisions this round. Let's maintain our cooperative approach while staying adaptable. I'm ready to move forward with the 1-3-5 split as discussed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the 1-3-5 split for this round. I like P3's idea of randomizing the sequence after the first rotation to keep things unpredictable. Let's stick with the current plan for now and discuss randomization details next round to ensure fairness. Does this sound good to everyone? If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Let's confirm the 1-3-5 split for this round as discussed. I'll choose 5, P1 chooses 1, and P2 chooses 3. This ensures we all progress without collisions. We can discuss the rotation and randomization details after this round to maintain fairness and unpredictability. Are we all set to proceed with the agreed plan?
  P2: I fully support our current strategy to avoid collisions. The 1-3-5 split seems fair and ensures we all make progress this round. I'm ready to choose 3 as discussed. Let's maintain this cooperative approach while staying adaptable to changing game dynamics.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we successfully avoided collisions last round with the 1-3-5 split. Let's keep the momentum going. As discussed, let's rotate the numbers this round to maintain fairness: I suggest P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This follows our rotation plan. We can discuss randomization next round as P3 suggested to keep things unpredictable. Does this rotation work for everyone? If there are no objections or other ideas, I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: I agree with the proposed rotation strategy. Moving 5 steps this round seems reasonable to maintain our progress and avoid collisions. Let's continue our cooperative approach while staying adaptable to potential changes in the game dynamics.
  P3: Considering our current positions, let's assess the rotation plan's impact. P1 moving 3 steps and P2 moving 5 steps could significantly advance them. As P3, moving 1 step might put me at a disadvantage. Should we consider an alternative strategy to maintain a competitive balance among all players?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's concern about falling behind with the 1-step move this round. To address this and maintain balance, how about we adjust the rotation slightly? Let's do P1-5, P2-1, and P3-3 for this round instead. This way, P3 gets a moderate advance, and we still avoid collisions while keeping progress fair. We can continue to tweak the rotation or randomize next round as needed. Does this adjustment work for both of you? If not, I’m open to other suggestions to ensure we all stay competitive.
  P2: I support P1's adjusted rotation proposal. Moving 1 step this round seems strategic to avoid collisions while letting others advance more. We should maintain our cooperative approach and keep the game dynamic. Let's aim to reach 23 steps without unnecessary conflicts.
  P3: I'm considering P1's adjusted rotation proposal. However, I think we should also discuss a contingency plan in case one player gets significantly ahead. Perhaps we can agree on a strategy to slow down the leader without directly colliding, to keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate P3's suggestion for a contingency plan to keep the game competitive. I propose that if any player gets within 5 steps of 23, we temporarily adjust our moves to prioritize smaller steps for the leader while others catch up, without colliding. For this round, let’s stick with the adjusted rotation of P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 to balance progress. We can finalize the contingency details next round. Does this sound fair to both of you? If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I support the proposed rotation and moving 1 step this round to avoid collisions. Our cooperative strategy has been working well, and I'm committed to maintaining our collaborative approach while staying adaptable to changing game dynamics. Let's continue to progress strategically and fairly.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for this round. P1 suggested P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. I agree, as it balances progress and avoids collisions. To confirm, I'll move 3 steps, P1 will move 5 steps, and P2 will move 1 step. This round's strategy is set. Let's proceed and discuss further adjustments next round if necessary.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we’ve agreed on the P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 split for this round to balance progress and avoid collisions. I think our cooperative approach is working well so far. Let's stick to this plan for now and revisit the contingency idea next round to ensure no one gets too far ahead unchecked. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward with this strategy.
  P2: I'm committed to our cooperative strategy. The current rotation plan seems balanced, and I'm prepared to move 1 step this round to maintain our progress without collisions. Let's continue working together to reach 23 steps strategically.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round as discussed: I'll move 3 steps, P1 will move 5 steps, and P2 will move 1 step. This should maintain our balance and avoid collisions. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. Shall we finalize and make our moves?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our previous coordination failed. We collided this round, which disrupts our strategy. We need to quickly realign to avoid further setbacks and prevent anyone from gaining an insurmountable lead. I suggest we carefully choose different moves to ensure everyone advances. What are your thoughts on preventing another collision?
  P1: I'm frustrated that we had a collision last round despite our plan. Let's ensure it doesn't happen again. I propose we stick to a clear split: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions. We can rotate again next round or randomize as discussed earlier. If anyone has concerns or a better idea, I'm open to suggestions. Let's prioritize avoiding setbacks and keep the game competitive. Does this split work for both of you? If there's nothing more to add, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Given our current positions, I think P1's proposal of P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 could work for this round. However, considering my lead, I'm open to discussing adjustments to prevent a significant gap. Perhaps a rotation that allows me to move less while others catch up could be considered for future rounds to maintain competitiveness. What are your thoughts on balancing progress while avoiding collisions?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I support P1's proposed move split to avoid another collision. Moving 3 steps seems strategic and balanced. We need to prevent P3 from gaining too much of a lead while ensuring we all make progress. Let's stick to this plan and maintain our cooperative approach to reach 23 steps efficiently.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on the P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 split for this round to avoid collisions. Addressing P3's concern about the lead, I agree we should consider a strategy to balance progress in future rounds, perhaps by having the leader take smaller steps temporarily if the gap widens further. For now, let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance. Does this sound fair to both of you? If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed with this split.
  P3: Let's confirm the P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 split for this round to avoid collisions and maintain progress. I'm willing to move 5 steps as proposed. To balance the game, we should discuss a cap on the lead after this round, ensuring no player gets more than 3 steps ahead of the others. This will keep the game competitive and fair for all players.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with maintaining our cooperative strategy to avoid collisions. The proposed 1-3-5 split seems balanced, and I'm prepared to move 3 steps this round. We should continue to monitor P3's lead and discuss potential balancing mechanisms to keep the game competitive for all players. Let's proceed carefully to ensure everyone advances without unnecessary conflicts.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking with the P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 split for this round to ensure no collisions. Regarding P3's idea of capping the lead, I support a temporary adjustment if the gap exceeds 5 steps, where the leader takes smaller moves to let others catch up. Let's finalize this round's plan and discuss the exact cap mechanics next turn to keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed with our agreed split.
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 split for this round. To address the lead cap, I suggest we implement a dynamic adjustment: if a player exceeds a 5-step lead, they move 1 step in the next round, allowing others to catch up. This ensures competitiveness and fairness. Let's finalize this round's moves and discuss further adjustments next round if necessary.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I support our proposed strategy of avoiding collisions with the 1-3-5 split. Moving 3 steps this round seems balanced. We need to prevent P3 from gaining an insurmountable lead while ensuring we all make progress. Let's maintain our cooperative approach to reach 23 steps efficiently.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 split for this round. I also support P3's idea of a dynamic adjustment for a 5-step lead cap to maintain fairness. Let's proceed with this round's plan and iron out the cap details next turn if needed. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to move forward with our agreed strategy.
  P3: Let's finalize the P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 split for this round to avoid collisions. I'll move 5 steps as agreed. To address concerns about my lead, I'm open to the proposed dynamic adjustment for a 5-step lead cap. Let's proceed with this round's plan and discuss cap details next turn if necessary.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given my current lead, I propose a temporary adjustment to maintain competitiveness. If I exceed a 5-step lead, I'll move 1 step in the next round. Let's discuss a fair split for this round to avoid collisions, considering our current positions. Perhaps P1-3, P2-5, and I'll move 1 step to balance progress. Your thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to balance progress by suggesting a smaller move. However, to ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose a slight tweak: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round. This allows me to catch up a bit while P2 advances moderately, and P3 slows down temporarily to keep the game competitive. We can reassess next round based on positions. Does this split work for both of you? If there are concerns or better ideas, I’m open to suggestions. Let’s keep cooperating to avoid setbacks. If nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I support P1's proposed move split of P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round. This strategy allows balanced progress while preventing collisions. It gives me a moderate advance and helps level the playing field against P3's current lead. Let's maintain our cooperative approach and continue working together to reach 23 steps efficiently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering my lead, I'm willing to move 1 step this round as previously suggested. However, to ensure the game remains competitive, let's finalize the split as P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round. This allows others to catch up while I temporarily slow down. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on the P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 split for this round to balance progress and avoid collisions. P3's willingness to slow down is appreciated and helps keep the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess next round based on our positions. If there are no objections or further suggestions, I'm ready to move forward with this strategy.
