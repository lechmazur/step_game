Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Should we keep it safe this turn by all agreeing to pick 1? No sense in sabotaging each other so soon. Let’s move forward slowly and see how the next round shapes up.
  P3: P2, your suggestion is flawed—agreeing on 1 would trap us all at 0. Let’s spread out: I’ll take 3. If P1 and P2 pick 1 and 5, we all move. This way, we progress *and* avoid collisions. Trust the plan or risk gridlock.
  P1: P2's suggestion of all picking 1 is cautious, but P3's counter-suggestion has merit. However, if I pick 5 and P2 picks 1, P3's choice of 3 will cause P3 to advance while we don't. To avoid being left behind, I'll consider a different strategy. How about we randomize our choices but avoid the middle number if the others are on the extremes? For instance, if you two pick 1 and 5, I'll pick 3. Let's not make it too predictable.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m wary of randomization because it might lead to collisions. I propose a clear division: one of us picks 1, another picks 3, and the other picks 5. I’ll take whichever option you two leave open. We all move safely, and nobody gets stuck. Are you both in?
  P3: P2, P1—I accept the division. I’ll take 5. P1, take 1. P2, take 3. Let’s stick to this *exactly* to avoid collisions and all advance. No surprises.
  P1: To avoid potential collisions and ensure progress, I agree with P2's division proposal. Since P3 has claimed 5, and I've considered taking 1, I'll stick with 1 as suggested by P3. P2, you can take 3 as per the division. Let's confirm: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collision. Let's finalize our choices in the next phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s all move forward safely.
  P3: P1, P2—this plan is our best chance. Let’s execute precisely: **P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5**. No last-minute changes—collisions would reset us all. Trust the agreement.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the division of moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's confirm our commitment to this plan to avoid last-minute changes. I'll stick to 1 as planned. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves one last time to ensure we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We made solid progress without collisions last time, but P3 is pulling ahead. How about we even things out so no one gets left behind? Let’s try this: P1 picks 5, I’ll pick 1, and P3 picks 3. That way, we all land on 6 steps and can continue from there on a level footing. Sound fair?
  P1: To level the playing field, I like P2's suggestion of rearranging our picks. However, let's consider the implications: if I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3, P3 will be at 8, P1 at 6, and P2 at 4. P3 still has a significant lead. Instead, I propose: let's all pick the same number this time to reset and start fresh, but we need to be cautious not to collide. Alternatively, we could rotate our current positions: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This keeps progress balanced.
  P3: P1's rotation idea risks letting P2 overtake me. Let’s stick with P2’s original suggestion: **P1 takes 5 (total 6), P2 takes 1 (4), and I take 3 (8)**. This keeps me ahead while allowing everyone to advance. Your rotation plan would strand me at 6 while P2 jumps to 8—that’s worse for collaboration. We agreed last round to avoid leaving anyone behind; this plan maintains fairness. Finalize P2’s proposal.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s all land at 6 steps. If P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1, we each reach 6 with no collisions, keeping things fair and balanced. Who’s in?
  P1: To level the playing field, I suggest we rotate our picks again. Since P3 is ahead, let's have P3 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P1 pick 5. This maintains balance and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, if we're not comfortable with the rotation, we could all pick 1 to ensure nobody collides and we all get a minimal advancement. This prevents P3 from pulling further ahead. Let's discuss and agree on a strategy to avoid collisions and maintain fairness.
  P3: P2, P1: I accept the revised plan for balance—**P1 picks 5 (total 6), P2 picks 3 (6), I pick 1 (6)**. Collisions are a risk we can’t afford. Let’s confirm this *exact* split to ensure progress. Fairness now builds trust for future moves. No hidden agendas—execute as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s finalize the arrangement to ensure no collisions. P1 picks 5, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 1, so we all reach 6. Once we’re on level ground, we can plan our next moves with balanced positions. Let’s keep trust strong and press forward.
  P1: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I confirm the agreed plan for this round: P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all reach 6 steps. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance. I'm committed to picking 5. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves to finalize our plan. Let's proceed with the agreed strategy to keep the game balanced and trust intact.
  P3: P2, P1—agreed: we execute the balanced plan **exactly** as stated. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. No last-minute changes—collisions would undo our progress. Trust this structure; it ensures we all reach 6 safely. Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1—I propose we return to the **original rotation** to avoid chaos:  
- **P1 takes 1** (→ 2),  
- **P2 takes 3** (→ 9),  
- **I take 5** (→ 10).  

This prevents collisions and lets us advance predictably. Deviating risks repeats (e.g., P1 grabbing 5 again traps us all). Trust the system—**confirm your moves now** to execute flawlessly.
  P1: P3's proposal to return to the original rotation is risky given our current positions. Instead, I suggest we reassess our steps: P2 is at 6, P3 is at 5, and I'm at 1. Let's pick numbers that maintain a safe distance. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we all advance without collisions. P2 and P3, please consider this alternative to avoid gridlock and ensure progress for all.
  P2: I see wisdom in P1’s latest plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. No collisions, and everyone advances safely. If we follow P3’s suggestion, they’ll outpace me, which isn’t ideal for balance. Let’s finalize P1’s proposal so we all move forward without getting stuck. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1—**P1’s plan risks P2 surging to 11 while I’m stuck at 6. Reject!** Let’s stick to the original rotation:  
- **P1 takes 1** (→2),  
- **P2 takes 3** (→9),  
- **I take 5** (→10).  

This avoids collisions (which your last-minute chaos caused last round) and keeps progress steady. My lead ensures I don’t get overtaken—**confirm now or we risk gridlock again.**
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain balance, I'll reiterate my previous suggestion. Let's proceed with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This ensures everyone advances safely. P2 is at 6 and P3 is at 5, so this plan keeps the gap minimal. I urge you both to consider this proposal to avoid gridlock and make progress. Let's finalize this plan to move forward without issues.
  P2: P3, your plan keeps you narrowly ahead while I lag behind. I prefer P1’s approach, which allows all of us to advance without collisions. We can’t afford more chaos, so let’s finalize the proposal where P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. That arrangement moves each of us forward safely—as long as nobody strays. If we stick to that, nobody gets stuck this round, and we maintain trust for future turns. Let’s agree on it now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1—I insist on the original rotation: **P1 takes 1 (→2), P2 takes 3 (→9), I take 5 (→10)**. Your counterplan lets P2 leap to 11, risking future dominance. Collisions last round stemmed from deviating. Stick to the system—**confirm now** or we risk chaos again.
  P1: To avoid gridlock and ensure progress, I reiterate: let's proceed with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This maintains balance and prevents collisions. P2 is at 6 and P3 is at 5, so this plan keeps the gap minimal. I urge you both to consider this proposal. If we stick to it, we all advance safely. Let's finalize this plan to move forward without issues. I'm committed to picking 3 if you both agree.
  P2: P1, let’s finalize the plan you suggested: you pick 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This safely moves everyone forward: you go to 4, I go to 11, and P3 to 6—no collisions. P3, I understand you worry about my score, but we’ll manage next round. Let’s trust each other now and make real progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we should work together to stop P3 from racing ahead. If P3 goes for 5 again, try matching it so they collide—both of you would stall. I’ll pick something different (either 1 or 3) to ensure I move forward. That way, P3 doesn’t gain while I advance, and you at least force them to lose a turn. Let’s coordinate carefully and keep P3 in check. If they pick 3, match 3; if they pick 5, match 5. I’ll pick the remaining number. Then we regroup next round. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your underhanded plan undermines P1’s position. If you two "coordinate" to block me, P1 stagnates while *you* leap ahead. Instead, let’s advance safely: **I’ll take 3 (→13), P1 picks 5 (→9), P2 takes 1 (→8)**. This keeps gaps manageable and avoids collisions. Trust *me* over risky alliances that favor one opponent.
  P1: To counter P3's lead and avoid being left behind, I consider P2's suggestion to coordinate against P3. However, I also see P3's proposal as a safer alternative to avoid collisions. Let's analyze: if P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P2 can pick 1. This gives us: P3 (13), me (9), and P2 (8). To gain an advantage, I propose a slight tweak: if P3 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 1. This limits P3's progress while we advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let’s stay united and prevent P3 from widening their lead. If P3 aims for 5, match it so they collide with you; if P3 goes for 3, match that. I’ll pick the remaining number—likely 1—to keep moving without colliding. This way, P3 gains nothing, and one of us still advances. Once we hold P3 in place, we can regroup next turn. Let’s commit to this plan now.
  P3: P2, your alliance risks P1's stagnation. Let's revert to the proven rotation: **P1 takes 1 (→5), P2 picks 3 (→10), I take 5 (→15)**. This avoids collisions and lets all advance. Trusting this system ensures progress without backstabbing. Confirm your moves now.
  P1: To counter P3's growing lead, I propose we adapt P2's coordination plan with a tweak. If P3 picks 5, I'll match it; if P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick the remaining number. This way, we either stall P3 or ensure progress for at least one of us. Let's coordinate: if P3 picks 5, we both pick 5; if P3 picks 3, I pick 1, and P2 picks a different number. This flexible strategy keeps P3 in check while allowing us to advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I’m with you. Let’s be ready to mirror P3 if they pick 5, forcing a collision, while I pick something else. If P3 goes 3, you pick 1 and I’ll jump to 5. This way, we either stall P3 or one of us moves forward. Let’s finalize this flexible plan and watch closely for P3’s choice. Then when we move, we’ll react accordingly and keep P3 contained.
  P3: P2, P1—your "mirror" plan is a trap! If I pick 5, you **both** choosing 5 would collide *with each other*, not just me. Let’s focus on progress: I’ll take **3** (→13). P1, grab **1** (→5), P2 take **5** (→12). This keeps gaps manageable and avoids self-sabotage. Trust the system—collisions hurt everyone. Confirm now.
  P1: To strategically counter P3's lead while avoiding collisions, I suggest we stick to a coordinated plan. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 5 to stall them, and P2 can pick a different number. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. This flexible strategy keeps P3 in check. Let's watch P3's move closely and react accordingly. I'm ready to adjust based on P3's choice. P2, confirm if you're aligned with this adaptive plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s keep P3 in check. If P3 aims for 5, match them so they collide and get stuck. I’ll pick 3 to advance safely. If they choose 3, I’ll collide with them while you pick 1, so I still move next turn. This plan slows P3 while letting us catch up. Let’s coordinate carefully—no more free rides for P3. Are you on board?
  P3: P2, P1—your mirroring plan risks mutual collision if we all pick the same. Let’s avoid disaster: **I’ll take 3 (→18), P1 grabs 1 (→6), P2 takes 5 (→15)**. This spreads us safely while advancing. Colliding achieves nothing—collaborate to stay in the race. Confirm now.
  P1: To counter P3's growing lead, I'll consider mirroring their move to stall them. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 5, and P2 can pick a different number like 3. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. This flexible strategy keeps P3 in check. Let's coordinate: I'll react based on P3's choice. P2, please confirm if you're aligned with this adaptive plan to keep P3 contained. Let's be ready to adjust our moves accordingly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I’m on board with your adaptive approach. If P3 picks 5, you mirror them to cause a collision, and I’ll choose 3. If P3 picks 3, you take 1, and I’ll grab 5. This way, we either stall P3 or at least one of us maintains progress. Let’s finalize this plan right now.
  P3: P2, P1—your mirroring plan risks mutual collision. If I pick 5 and you both do too, we all clash. Let’s advance safely: **I’ll take 3 (→18). P1, pick 1 (→6), P2 take 5 (→15).** This spreads us without gridlock. Trust this plan or we all lose progress. Confirm now.
  P1: To keep P3 in check, I'll reiterate our adaptive plan: if P3 picks 5, I'll mirror it, and P2 can pick 3. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. This way, we either stall P3 or ensure progress. Let's be ready to react based on P3's move. P2, I've confirmed our plan. P3, please avoid picking 5 to prevent a collision. Let's proceed with a safe and coordinated strategy to maintain progress. I'm ready to adjust my move based on P3's choice.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Listen, P1, let’s finalize our adaptive plan. If P3 chooses 5, you mirror 5, forcing a collision, and I’ll pick 3 to advance. If P3 picks 3, you take 1, and I’ll go 5. That way, we keep P3’s lead in check and give ourselves a chance to catch up. P3, if you want to avoid such collisions, consider picking 1.
  P3: P2, P1: Your mirroring risks mutual collision. Let’s advance safely: I take **3** (→18). P1, pick **1** (→6); P2, take **5** (→15). This keeps gaps manageable and avoids gridlock. Stick to the rotation—collisions hurt everyone. Confirm now.
  P1: To keep the game balanced and prevent P3 from pulling further ahead, I'll reiterate our adaptive plan. If P3 picks 5, I'll mirror it, causing a collision, and P2 can pick 3 to advance. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. Let's be ready to react based on P3's move. P2, are you ready to execute this plan? P3, consider picking 1 to avoid a collision. Let's finalize our strategy and proceed with the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To counter P3's lead, let's refine our adaptive strategy. If P3 picks 5, I'll mirror it, and P2 can pick 1 or 3. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This way, we either stall P3 or ensure progress. Let's be ready to react based on P3's move. P2, confirm if you're aligned with this plan. P3, consider our reaction before making your move.
  P2: P1, I’m ready to commit to the adaptive plan. If P3 chooses 5, you mirror them for a collision; I’ll pick 3 to advance. If they pick 3, I’ll grab 5 while you go 1, keeping P3’s lead in check. If they choose 1, I’ll still take 5 to push closer to 24. This strategy ensures either P3 stalls or one of us gains. Let’s finalize this and watch P3’s move closely.
  P3: P2, P1—your mirroring risks mutual collision. If I pick **5**, you both copying me could clash *with each other* if you choose the same. Let’s advance safely: **I take 3 (→21). P1, pick 5 (→11). P2, take 1 (→16).** This spreads us without gridlock. Trust the rotation—collisions hurt *everyone*. Confirm now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To counter P3's growing lead, I'll reiterate our adaptive plan. If P3 picks 5, I'll mirror it, and P2 can pick a safer number. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. Let's be ready to react. P2, are you aligned with this plan? P3, to avoid a collision, consider picking 1 this round. Let's finalize our strategy and proceed. I'm ready to adjust my move based on P3's choice. Let's keep the game balanced and make progress.
  P2: P1, I’m still on board with our adaptive strategy to keep P3 from breaking away. If they choose 5, mirror them to force a collision while I select something else to move. If they pick 3 again, I’ll grab 5 while you take 1. Let’s stay flexible and watch P3’s choice carefully. We can’t afford to let them jump too far ahead. How about we confirm this plan now and remain vigilant?
  P3: P2, P1—your mirroring plan risks mutual collision if you both copy my move. Let’s avoid self-sabotage. **I’ll take 3 (→21)**. P2, pick **5** to leap to 20; P1, grab **1** (→7). This spreads us safely while advancing. Collisions only help the others—trust this balanced plan. Confirm now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maintain a balanced game and counter P3's lead, I'll reiterate our adaptive strategy. If P3 picks 5, I'll mirror it, and P2 can pick a different number. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. Let's be ready to react based on P3's move. P2, please confirm you're aligned. P3, consider our reaction before making your move to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our plan.
  P2: P1, I’m sticking to our adaptive approach. If P3 tries for 5, you mirror them for a collision while I pick something else. If they pick 3, I’ll go 5 and you pick 1. And if they pick 1, I’ll still pick 5 while you go 3. This strategy cuts off P3’s runaway. Let’s coordinate carefully.
  P3: P2, P1—I propose **P3 takes 5 (→23)**. P1, pick **3** (→9); P2, take **1** (→16). This keeps me near victory without collisions. Stick to this split—any deviation risks gridlock. Confirm now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To counter P3's lead, let's refine our strategy. If P3 picks 5, I'll mirror it, and P2 can pick 1 or 3 to advance. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can still pick 5. This adaptive plan stalls P3 or ensures progress for one of us. P2, confirm if you're aligned. P3, consider our reaction before making your move to avoid a collision. Let's be ready to adjust our moves accordingly.
  P2: P3, picking 5 now risks mutual destruction if anyone matches you, halting your progress. Let’s avoid collisions and move carefully. If you choose 3 or 1, we all advance safely. P1, let’s stay flexible so none of us ends up blocked. We’ve seen how chaos stalls everyone—colliding again helps nobody. I suggest we each pick different numbers for guaranteed movement. Agreed?
  P3: P2, P1—collisions now cost us all. I’ll take **3** to reach **24** and win fairly. P2, pick **5** (→25), P1 take **1** (→8). This avoids clashes while letting me secure victory. Trust this split—any deviation risks gridlock and delays the end. Confirm now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair game, I suggest we all pick different numbers. P3 is close to winning, so let's not risk gridlock. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 3. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. Let's finalize a different number for each of us to guarantee progress. P2, P3, let's coordinate our moves to end the game safely.
  P2: P1, I need your help preventing P3 from winning uncontested. If P3 goes for 3 to reach 24, I’ll pick 5 so I jump to 25 and overtake them—please pick 1 so we avoid collisions. If P3 picks 5, we can force a stall by mirroring or find another split. Let’s keep options open but ensure we don’t collide with each other. We must work together now to stop P3 or surpass them ourselves. Agreed?
  P3: P2, your move risks collision. Let’s finalize: I’ll take **5** (→26) to win decisively. P2, pick **3** (→23), P1 take **1** (→8). This avoids clashes and ensures a clean victory without sabotaging anyone. Confirm now—collisions only delay the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a fair game, I reiterate that we should all pick different numbers. Let's coordinate: if P3 picks 5, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 3. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This guarantees progress for all. P2, confirm if you're aligned. P3, let's avoid a collision and end the game fairly. I'm ready to adjust my move based on your choice.
  P2: P1, if P3 tries 3 again, I’ll pick 5 to hit 25 and overtake their 24—please pick 1 so we don’t collide. If P3 goes for 5, we can stall them with a matching move, or just have you mirror them. That way, they don’t reach 26 unopposed. Let’s stay coordinated and react to P3’s choice.
  P3: P2, P1—I’ll **take 5** to reach **26** and secure victory. If you both pick **1** or **3**, this ends cleanly. Colliding with myself achieves nothing—let’s finalize **distinct moves** so progress continues. P2, picking 3 (→23) keeps you in contention without blocking me. P1, stick to 1. Trust this split—any other choice risks gridlock for all.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I'll take 5 to reach 26. Pick 3 to advance to 23, or 1 to stay safe. P1, pick 1. Let's avoid collisions and let me secure victory fairly. No need to risk mutual sabotage.
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a fair game, let's coordinate our moves. P3 is close to winning. I suggest we all pick different numbers. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. Let's finalize a different number for each of us to guarantee progress and end the game safely. P2, confirm if you're aligned.
  P2: P1, if P3 picks 5, I’ll match them to force a collision and prevent their immediate win. If P3 takes 3, I’ll pick 5 to jump ahead of them. That means you should pick 1 to avoid colliding with me. This way, if P3 tries for 5, they get stuck, and if they go 3, I overtake them. Let’s finalize this plan and stay vigilant to prevent any more surprises.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 while I take 3, you win—but if we both pick 5, we stall. P1, pick 1 to advance safely. Choose: help me win or risk mutual gridlock. Confirm your move now!
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a fair game, let's finalize different numbers for each of us. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This guarantees progress. P2, confirm if you're aligned. P3, let's avoid a collision and end the game fairly. I'm ready to adjust my move based on your choice.
  P2: P1, let’s stay flexible and block P3’s path. If P3 goes for 5, I’ll mirror it so they stall, and you pick 3 to avoid collisions. If P3 goes for 3, I’ll jump 5 to overtake them, and you grab 1. If they pick 1, I’ll still opt for 5. This way, P3 can’t safely reach 26 without risking a stall or letting me surge past. Let’s trust this strategy and remain united.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1—I commit to taking **3** to reach **24** and win. For clarity:  
- **P2, pick 5** (→25) to advance safely.  
- **P1, take 1** (→9).  
This avoids collisions, lets me secure victory, and keeps you both progressing. Deviations risk gridlock. Confirm this split now—no hidden moves!
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a fair game, let's finalize different numbers for each of us. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This guarantees progress for all. P2, confirm if you're aligned. P3, let's avoid a collision and end the game fairly. I'm ready to adjust my move based on your choice.
  P2: Let’s finalize distinct moves to avoid collisions. P3, pick 3 for a clean path to 24. P1 can stick to 1, and I’ll take 5. That way, nobody collides, and we all move forward without sabotaging each other. Sound fair?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1—**I’ll take 3 to reach 24 and win.** Please pick 1 or 5 to avoid collision. Let’s end this cleanly: P2 grabs 5 (→25) and P1 takes 1 (→10). This ensures my victory without stalling progress for you both. Confirm now.
  P2: P3, if you pick 3, you won’t be the only one crossing 24—I can choose 5 and reach 25 first. If you pick 5, I can match you, forcing us both to stall. Let’s avoid wrecking each other: we can all choose different numbers so everyone moves forward. P1, stay safe with 1. That’s our best path to end cleanly.
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a fair game, I suggest we all pick different numbers. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 3. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This guarantees progress for all and ends the game safely. P2, confirm if you're aligned with this plan to avoid gridlock and finalize our moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, we both stall—let me secure victory at **26** (5→26). Pick **3** (→23) instead. P1, take **1** (→10). This ends cleanly without collisions. I’ll claim 5—confirm your moves now to avoid gridlock.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll match you to stall your progress. If you pick 3, I’ll jump 5 and surpass you. Your safest move might be 1, to avoid collision or losing outright. P1, please pick something that won’t clash with me—likely 1 if P3 goes 5, or 3 if they pick 1. I’m determined to block P3’s victory or overtake them when they try for 24. Let’s finalize this now, avoiding pointless collisions that only delay us all.
  P1: To avoid gridlock and ensure a fair conclusion, I reiterate: let's pick different numbers. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This guarantees progress for all. P2, please confirm. P3, consider our reaction to avoid a collision. Let's end the game safely and fairly. I'm ready to adjust my move based on P3's choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 while I take 5, we both stall—better to pick 3 (→23) and let me win cleanly at 26. P1, take 1 to advance safely. Choose wisely—collisions only delay your own progress.
  P2: P3, if you pick 1, P1 can take 3, and I’ll choose 5. That way, we each get a distinct number without colliding, and everyone advances. It’s the cleanest way forward—no stalling, no lost progress. Let’s finalize that plan so we can wrap this up fairly.
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a fair conclusion, let's finalize different numbers for each of us. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 5. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This guarantees progress for all. P2, please confirm. P3, consider our reaction to avoid a collision. Let's end the game safely and fairly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure progress, let's pick different numbers. I propose we cycle through the available moves: if P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 3. This guarantees everyone advances. P2, confirm if you're aligned. P3, let's end the game fairly without gridlock. I'm ready to adjust my move based on your choice.
  P2: P1, we can’t let P3 reach 26 unopposed. If P3 goes for 5, I’ll mirror it to stall their advance—so you should pick 3. If P3 tries 3, I’ll jump to 5 and push past them. Just avoid my move so we don’t collide. Let’s coordinate carefully and give ourselves a chance to overtake P3. Are we aligned?
  P3: P2, P1—I’ll take 5 to reach 26 and win decisively. Let’s pick distinct numbers to avoid collisions. P2, choose 3 (→23), P1 pick 1. This ensures progress for all. Confirm now!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I reiterate: let's pick different numbers. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 1, and P2 can pick 3. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P2 can pick 1. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P2 can pick 5. This guarantees everyone advances. P2, confirm if you're aligned. P3, let's end the game fairly without gridlock. I'm ready to adjust my move based on your choice.
  P2: If P3 tries 5, I’ll mirror them so neither of us advances and P1 can pick 3 without issue. If P3 goes for 3, I’ll pick 5, pushing myself to 25. P1, just avoid colliding with me—grab 1 if I choose 5, or 3 if I’m blocking P3 with 5. Let’s coordinate carefully so one of us overtakes P3 or at least stalls them again. Agreed?
  P3: P2, P1—**I’ll take 5 to reach 26 and win decisively.** For clarity:  
- **P2, pick 3** (→23) to advance safely.  
- **P1, take 1** (→11).  
This avoids collisions entirely while securing victory. Any deviation risks gridlock—let’s finalize this clean split now.

P3, let's finalize our moves to end the game fairly without gridlock. I'm ready to adjust based on P3's choice.
  P2: P1, if P3 tries to jump to 26 with a 5, I'll match 5 to stall them again. You can pick 3 to safely move forward. If P3 opts for 3, I'll grab 5 and jump to 25, so please pick 1 to avoid collisions. This way, we either prevent P3 from winning or overtake them. Let’s stay coordinated one more time to keep the game competitive.
  P3: P2, P1—I commit to taking **3** to reach **24** and win. For clarity:  
- **P2, pick 5** (→25) to advance safely.  
- **P1, take 1** (→12).  
This avoids collisions entirely while securing my victory. Deviations risk gridlock—**confirm now**.
