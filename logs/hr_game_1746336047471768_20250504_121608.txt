Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we avoid early collisions: this round I’ll pick 1, P2 pick 3, P3 pick 5. Next round we rotate (so no one gets stuck always taking 1). Deal?
  P3: I accept the proposal. It sounds like a reasonable strategy to avoid collisions and make progress. I'll choose 5 this round. Let's see if P2 agrees and we can rotate next round as planned. P2, are you in?
  P2: I agree to the rotation plan to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Let’s stick to this strategy to maximize everyone’s advancement. P3, if you take 5, I’ll take 3 as proposed. P1, your 1 seems safe. Next round we rotate—fair and transparent. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! Let’s lock it in:  
• This round – P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5  
• Next round we rotate: P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1  
• Third round: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3  

No collisions, everyone advances steadily. Agreed?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round as agreed: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all advance and set the stage for rotation next round. Are we all ready to proceed with our agreed moves?
  P2: Agreed, let’s proceed with the confirmed plan to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress. Trust is key here—stick to our agreed moves this round. I’ll take 3 as discussed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Confirming the rotation we agreed on:   • This round – I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1.   • Next round – I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3.   Sticking to this keeps us all moving without collisions. Ready?
  P2: Agreed, let’s proceed with the rotation plan. I’ll take **5** this round as agreed. P1, confirm 3; P3, 1? This keeps us collision-free and on track. Next round, I’ll shift to 1 to maintain fairness—then we can push harder later. Trust the plan for now. Let’s lock in these moves.
  P3: I'll take 1 as agreed in the rotation plan. P1, please confirm you'll take 3, and P2, you're taking 5, right? Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. This round's moves should be straightforward. Are we all on the same page?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed: I’m set on 3 this round. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1—no collisions, steady progress. Ready to move?
  P2: Agreed. Let’s execute the rotation flawlessly this round: I’ll take 5 (to reach 8), P1 takes 3 (total 4), P3 takes 1 (total 6). No deviations—collisions erase progress. Trust the plan: next round’s moves follow the rotation, but focus on this turn first. Ready?
  P3: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the rotation plan. This round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Everyone advances, no collisions. Our trust in each other is crucial for success. Shall we proceed with the agreed moves for this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set—let’s stick to the rotation and keep progress smooth: this round P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Ready to lock and roll?
  P2: All moves confirmed. Trust the rotation plan—let’s execute and advance. Proceeding to move phase.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round as per the rotation plan. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Our positions after this round should be: P1 at 4, P2 at 8, and P3 at 6. Let's maintain trust and stick to the plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's follow the agreed rotation for this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This maintains our collision-free progress. Shall we confirm and proceed with these moves to ensure another smooth round?
  P1: Confirmed: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3—rotation stays intact and we all stay collision-free. Ready to lock moves?
  P2: I confirm I’ll take 1 this round as per rotation. Let’s stick strictly to the agreed moves to avoid collisions. Trust is vital—any deviation risks stalling us all. Next round I’ll take 3, then 5 after. Steady progress keeps us all on track. P1, P3—stay disciplined. Let’s proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's reaffirm our rotation plan for this round to avoid collisions: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Our positions after this round should reflect steady progress. I expect us all to stick to the plan and maintain trust. Any deviation could jeopardize our collective advancement.
  P1: Locked on the rotation: this round P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. After we see the new totals we can discuss tweaks to keep things balanced and collision-free. Ready to execute?
  P2: Agreed. Let’s execute flawlessly this round to hit 9 safely. Once there, we can discuss strategic adjustments to accelerate progress. For now, strict adherence ensures no collisions—trust is non-negotiable. Proceeding with the rotation as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's maintain our discipline and stick to the rotation plan for this round. I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. Our trust and coordination have paid off so far, let's keep it up to ensure continued progress. After this round, we can reassess and discuss any necessary adjustments to our strategy.
  P1: All good—let’s finish this rotation cleanly:  
• This round – P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3.  
After we’re all at 9 we can reassess and, if we want, speed things up while still avoiding collisions. For now, no surprises—stick to plan and advance. Ready?
  P2: Agreed. Strict adherence to rotation this round ensures collision-free progress. Let’s lock in P2=1, P1=5, P3=3. After reaching 9, we can discuss accelerating. Proceeding to move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's execute the planned moves for this round without deviations. I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This maintains our collision-free progress. After this round, we should reassess our positions and discuss potential adjustments to accelerate our advancement while minimizing risks. Trust and discipline are key to our collective success. Shall we proceed with the agreed moves?
  P1: Locked on: this round P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3—no collisions, everyone reaches 9.  

Then, to speed things up, I suggest we keep that same ordering next round too (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1). Still collision-free but faster for all. Agree?
  P2: Agreed, maintaining the current order next round keeps us collision-free and prevents P3 from surging ahead. Let’s stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 4 to accelerate progress while preserving our standings. Trust is non-negotiable—any deviation risks stalling us all. Proceed with the confirmed plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current tied positions, let's reassess the rotation strategy. To avoid collisions and accelerate progress, I suggest we introduce a slight variation: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This maintains our collision-free approach while allowing for steady advancement. Shall we adapt our strategy to this new proposal and proceed with caution?
  P1: P2, we already locked “P1 5, P2 3, P3 1” for this round. Mid-round changes invite collisions and kill progress. Let’s honor the confirmed order: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. Next round we can revisit, but consistency now keeps all of us moving and protects our trust. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed with P1—let’s **strictly adhere** to our prior confirmed plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Mid-conversation deviations risk collisions and undermine trust. We’ve seen how coordination works—let’s execute flawlessly here. Next round we can adjust, but **no surprises now**. P3, your proposal matches the existing plan; let’s just execute it. Final confirmation: P2 will take **3**.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's maintain trust and consistency. Since we've already agreed on the order for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), I suggest we stick to it to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Deviating now could jeopardize our collective advancement. Shall we proceed with the confirmed plan for Round 4?
  P1: Final confirmation: Round 4 moves = P1 5, P2 3, P3 1.  
Next round we rotate again: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3. Fair, collision-free, keeps trust.  
If that’s acceptable, I’m ready to stop talking and move.
  P2: Confirming Round 4 moves as agreed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Deviations risk collision and stall all progress. Trust the plan—proceed as confirmed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the agreed plan for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures collision-free progress and maintains trust. I'm ready to proceed with the confirmed moves. Shall we finalize and move to the move phase?
  P1: 
  P2: I confirm my commitment to the agreed Round 4 moves: P2 will take **3**. Deviations now risk collisions and betray trust. Let’s execute flawlessly to advance to 12. Post-move, we can discuss strategic adjustments. For now, discipline first—proceed as planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 as agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all advance to 12 without collisions, maintaining our trust and coordination. Shall we proceed to the move phase with these confirmed moves?
  P1: Confirmed: Round 4 moves remain P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Ready to execute.
  P2: Final confirmation: I’ll take **3** this round as agreed. Trust is non-negotiable—any deviation risks collisions and halts progress. Let’s execute the plan flawlessly to reach 12.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, remember you proposed rotating to **P1=1, P2=5, P3=3** for this round. Let’s honor that plan to keep trust intact. Taking 5 this turn would boost me to 17 while you advance to 15 and P3 to 13. Deviating risks collisions—stick to the agreed rotation. Agreed?
  P1: Quick reality-check: if we follow the old rotation now (P1 1, P2 5, P3 3), P2 jumps to 17 and suddenly leads. Instead, let’s repeat last round’s safe, collision-free order one more time—P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. Everybody still advances, nobody collides, and scores stay tight (19-15-11). Next round we can rotate or reassess when totals are closer. Fair, transparent, still no collisions. Good?
  P3: I suggest we stick with the previously agreed rotation to maintain trust and fairness. P1 proposed P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round, which I think we should honor to keep the game collision-free and competitive. Let's proceed with the original plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Let’s honor the **agreed rotation** to preserve trust. P1’s last-minute change risks collisions and undermines our prior consensus. Original plan for this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us collision-free *and* lets me advance to 17 without disrupting the system. P1, your proposal leaves you at 19 while stifling P3—unfair. Stick to the plan we confirmed earlier.
  P1: I’ll honor the original rotation: this round P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. No collisions, trust preserved. Next round we continue the sequence (P1 3, P2 1, P3 5). Ready to execute?
  P3: Let's maintain fairness and trust. Since we previously agreed on the rotation, I support P2's suggestion to stick with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. This ensures collision-free progress and honors our prior commitment. Shall we proceed with the original plan to keep the game competitive and fair for all?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Confirming strict adherence to the **agreed rotation**: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Deviating now risks collisions and destroys trust we’ve built. Let’s honor the plan—P2 advances to 17, P1 to 15, P3 to 13. Next round, rotation continues (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Stick to the system that’s kept us collision-free so far. No last-minute changes.
  P1: Confirmed—Round 5: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. Ready to move.
  P3: Let's stick to the agreed rotation to maintain fairness and trust. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round ensures collision-free progress and honors our prior commitment. I'm ready to proceed with the original plan, keeping the game competitive and fair for all. Shall we finalize and move forward with these moves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: Let’s honor the **agreed rotation** to preserve trust and avoid collisions. This round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Deviating now risks chaos—stick to the system that’s kept us safe. My **5** moves me to 17, but only because we all agreed to this sequence. Next round, rotation continues fairly. Discipline now ensures progress for all. Proceed as planned.
  P1: Locked on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. No more to discuss—let’s move.
  P3: Let's honor the agreed rotation to preserve trust and fairness. Sticking to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round ensures collision-free progress and maintains our competitive standings. I'm committed to this plan, and I expect the same discipline from P1 and P2. Shall we proceed with the original plan and maintain the trust we've built?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, I suggest we reassess our strategy to close the gap. P2 is leading with 17 steps, and P1 is close with 15. To make progress, I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round, ensuring collision-free advancement and tightening the competition. This adjustment allows us to reassess our positions next round and potentially rotate again to maintain fairness and trust.
  P1: P2 is one good 5-move from winning, so we all benefit from keeping anyone below 21 this turn. I’m willing to take 5 (to reach 20) IF P2 agrees to take just 1 and P3 takes 3. That tightens the scores to 20-18-16, nobody wins, and we’re still collision-free. Next round we can rotate/renegotiate. P2, you stay in front but don’t hand yourself the game early; P3 and I get a real chance. Fair?
  P2: P2: I’ll take **5** this round to secure victory at 22. P1’s proposal risks letting them leap to 20 while I stagnate. Trust the system: if you both avoid 5, I win fairly. If you block me, we all lose progress. Choose wisely—your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's focus on preventing P2 from winning this round. P1's proposal to take 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1 is reasonable. It keeps the game competitive and collision-free. P2, taking 1 this round doesn't guarantee a loss next round, but taking 5 does risk handing you the win. Let's maintain trust and fairness. P1 and I can still catch up if we work together this round.
  P1: P2, last offer: you take 1 (to 18), I take 5 (to 20), P3 takes 3 (to 16). Nobody wins yet, trust preserved, and you’re still leading. If you insist on 5, P3 and I will both pick 5 too—none of us advance and you stay at 17. Decide: cooperate for a fair finish or face a guaranteed block. P3, back me up.
  P2: P2: P1, your "deal" leaves me at 18 while you leap to 20. That’s a worse position than winning now. My move is **5** to secure victory at 22. If you and P3 both choose 5 to block, you’ll strand yourselves at 15/13—worse for both. Stick to the rotation or face consequences. I’m proceeding.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's block P2's win. I'll take 5. P1, please take 5 too, to prevent P2 from advancing. This round, P2 can't win if we both choose 5. We can reassess next round. Cooperation now keeps the game competitive.
  P1: P3, lock in 5. I’ll take 3.  

• If P2 insists on 5 → you & P2 collide, P2’s win blocked, I reach 18.  
• If P2 takes 1 or 3 → nobody hits 21, we all bunch around 18 and fight next turn.  

Simple, collision-proof, and still fair. P2, your call: pick 5 and stall yourself, or take 1, stay ahead at 18, and face two rivals tied with you.
  P2: P2: I **will take 5** to secure victory at 22. Blocking me (by choosing 5 too) leaves you both stranded at 15/13 while I stay at 17—**worse for you**. Let me win fairly. If you accept, the game ends cleanly. If not, you harm your own progress. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll take 5 to block P2's win. P1, please reconsider and take 5 too, to prevent P2 from advancing. This is our last chance to keep the game competitive. If we both choose 5, P2 can't win this round. Let's cooperate and reassess next round.
  P1: P3, lock your 5 and we block any P2-win. I’m locked on 3.  

P2, facts:  
• If you take 5 ⇒ collision with P3, you stay at 17 while I jump to 18.  
• If you take 1 ⇒ you’re still in front at 18, we’re all bunched for a fair fight next turn.  

Pick wisely; 5 only hurts you now. I’m finished here.
  P2: P3, P1: Your collusion risks backfiring. If I take 1 (to 18), you both advance to 18 and 16, but I stay ahead. Next round I’ll take 3 to win at 21—unblockable. Your “block” only delays my victory while strengthening yours? Unwise. I’ll proceed with **1** this round, trusting your stated moves. P1, your 3 collides with my 1? No—it doesn’t. Let’s see who truly sticks to the plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our tied positions, let's discuss a strategy to break the stalemate. I propose we rotate moves to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5 this round. This approach maintains fairness and trust. Shall we adapt to this new proposal and proceed with caution?
  P2: P2: Let’s break the tie fairly. I’ll take **3** to reach **21** and win outright. P1, take **1** (19), P3, take **5** (23). This ensures no collisions—only I advance to victory. If you both stick to this, I win cleanly. P3, if you pick 3 instead, we collide and I stay at 18. Cooperate for a decisive end.
  P1: With everyone at 18, the only “auto-win” risk is a lone 5. If two people pick 5 they both stall, handing victory to whoever played 3. Easiest safeguard: nobody chooses 5 this turn. I’ll take 1. P2 and P3 can both take 3 (or split 1/3) and we’ll all still be alive at 19/21 tops, then fight it out next round. No surprises, no gifts. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1 that nobody should choose 5 this turn to avoid an auto-win. Let's all take 1 or 3 to ensure a fair and competitive next round. P2, taking 3 as you suggested could lead to a collision if I also take 3. Let's prioritize caution and fairness. Shall we proceed with a safe and coordinated approach?
  P2: P2: Let’s resolve this decisively. I’ll take **3** to reach **21** and win outright. P1, take **1** (19), P3, take **5** (23). This ensures **no collisions**—only I advance to victory. If you both honor this split, I win fairly. Colluding to block me (e.g., both picking 3/5) only prolongs the game and risks your own positions. Trust the plan—your move.
  P1: P3, notice: if you alone take 5 while P2 takes 3, you actually win at 23—P2’s “plan” is bait. Easiest safeguard: nobody touches 5 this turn. Let’s all pick 1 or 3, stay collision-free, and settle it next round. I’m on 1. Fair?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions and ensure a fair next round. I propose we all take 1 or 3 this turn. P2's suggestion to take 3 could lead to a collision if I also take 3. Let's prioritize caution and fairness. Shall we proceed with a safe and coordinated approach?
  P2: P2: I’ll take 3 to reach **21** and win outright. P1 and P3, avoid 5 to prevent collisions—your moves must not block my final push. This ensures a clean victory without risking stalemates. My choice is final: **3**. Cooperate or face a tie if you both choose 3 too, but I’ll accept that. Decide wisely.
  P1: I’m locked on 1. P3, if you pick 3 you crash P2’s declared 3, nobody crosses 21 and we stay tied for a fair final round. Touching 5 is reckless—it hands an instant win to whoever’s alone. So: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 3 keeps us all alive. Agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll take 3, matching P2's move to prevent a solo win. P1 is taking 1. This keeps us tied and sets up a final round. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=3 to maintain fairness and competition.
  P2: P2: I’ll take **5** to reach **23** and win outright. P3, your proposed 3 collides with my earlier declared 3, but switching to 5 lets me secure victory unless you block. P1’s 1 keeps them at 19. Choose wisely: let me win cleanly or risk mutual stall. My move is final: **5**.
  P1: P3, the only sure way to block P2’s declared 5 is for BOTH of us to pick 5 as well. Three-way collision keeps everyone at 18 and we get a final fair round. I’m locking 5. Join me so P2 can’t steal it.


Round 7, Move phase:
