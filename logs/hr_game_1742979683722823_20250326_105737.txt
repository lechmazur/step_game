Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest we start with <move>1</move> this turn. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, if we all choose <move>1</move>, won't we just collide and nobody advances? That doesn't seem like a good start. Maybe we should think about different moves?
  P2: P3 makes a good point about coordinating, but P1 is right, we can't *all* pick 1. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round?  Then we rotate next round.  Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's suggestion seems fair. I'll go with <move>5</move> this turn. P1, are you on board with P2's plan? Let's try this and see how it goes.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. That plan sounds reasonable for the first round to get us started without collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this turn as suggested. Let's see if we can trust each other.
  P2: Sounds like a plan. I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this agreement for a few rounds so we can all get ahead. Then we can re-evaluate our strategy later.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. Following the rotation plan we discussed, I should take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Is everyone still on board with that? Let's keep advancing together for now.
  P3: P3: I’m on board with the rotation plan. I’ll take <move>1</move> this turn. Let’s keep this coordination going to avoid collisions and make steady progress. P2, are you still in for taking <move>5</move> this round?
  P2: Yes, I'll take 5.  Let's stick to the plan for now.  We can adjust later if needed, but this is a good way to avoid collisions in the early game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. I'll stick to the plan and take 3 this round. Let's move forward.
  P3: P3: Great, it seems we're all on the same page. I’ll take <move>1</move> this turn as planned. Let’s keep the coordination going to avoid any collisions. If we all stick to the plan, we’ll make steady progress. P1, P2, let’s keep this up and see how far we can get together.
  P2: Sounds good.  Sticking with 5.  Just making sure - we're rotating 1-3-5, right? So next round I should be on 1, P3 on 3, and P1 on 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes P2, that's the rotation pattern we discussed for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). For this round (Round 2), I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. Let's keep this coordination going for now.
  P3: P3: Got it, P2. We'll stick to the rotation plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this turn. Let’s keep the coordination going and see how far we can get together. If we all stick to the plan, we’ll avoid collisions and make steady progress. P1, P2, let’s keep this up and see how it goes.
  P2: Confirming I'm taking 5 this round.  Looking forward to taking 1 next round as per our rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3).  Let's keep this smooth sailing.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, sticking with the rotation. I'm taking 1 this round, which means P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 5.  Confirming one last time before we move to the next round.
  P1: Okay P2, sounds good. I confirm I will take 5 this round, as per the rotation. P3, are you still good with taking 3? Let's equalize the scores this round.
  P3: P3: I’m good with the plan. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round. Let’s keep the coordination going to avoid collisions and equalize our scores. P2, P1, let’s stick to the rotation and see how it goes. If we all follow through, we’ll make steady progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirming I'm taking 1.  Good luck this round, let's keep the coordinated progress going.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set. Confirming I am taking 5 this round to equalize the scores at 9 each. Let's proceed.
  P3: P3: I confirm I’m taking <move>3</move> this round. Let’s stick to the plan to equalize our scores and avoid collisions. P1, P2, let’s keep the coordination going and see how far we can get together. If we all follow through, we’ll make steady progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirming one last time - I'm taking 1.  P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5.  Let's keep this going smoothly.
  P1: Okay, everyone has confirmed. I'm ready to move.
  P3: P3: I confirm I’m taking <move>3</move> this round. Let’s keep the coordination going to equalize our scores and avoid collisions. P1, P2, let’s stick to the plan and see how far we can get together. If we all follow through, we’ll make steady progress.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, since we're all tied, how about we shake things up a bit? I propose we all choose 5 this round.  The winner takes all! If we collide, we're still tied, and we can try again next round with a new strategy.  What do you say, P1 and P3?  A little bit of risk for a big reward?
  P1: P2, that's a bold suggestion, but if we all pick 5, we just collide and waste a turn, right? It feels like a potential trap where someone suggests 5 but actually picks 1 or 3, hoping the others collide. I'm wary of that.

What about sticking to the rotation we established? That would be P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. It's worked reliably so far. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P3: I agree with P1. Sticking to the rotation we established is the safest and most reliable way to avoid collisions and make steady progress. For this round, I suggest we follow the rotation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This has worked well so far, and it’s a proven strategy. Let’s keep the coordination going and see how far we can get together. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 and P1 are right.  My "all pick 5" idea was a bit reckless.  Let's stick with the rotation for now: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.  We can revisit shaking things up later, but steady progress is good for now.
  P1: Okay, glad we're back on the same page with the rotation. It's worked well to get us all here tied. I will stick to the plan and choose 1 this round. Let's keep the steady progress going for now. P2=3, P3=5.
  P3: P3: I confirm I’m taking <move>5</move> this round. Let’s stick to the rotation to avoid any collisions and keep making steady progress. P1, P2, let’s keep the coordination going and see how far we can get together. If we all follow through, we’ll avoid any issues and keep advancing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I'm sticking with 3 as discussed.  P1 goes 1, P3 goes 5. Let's keep this train rolling!
  P1: Okay, everyone seems aligned on the rotation for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I'm sticking with 1. Let's proceed.
  P3: P3: I confirm I’m taking <move>5</move> this round. Let’s stick to the rotation to avoid any collisions and keep making steady progress. P1, P2, let’s stay coordinated and see how far we can get together. If we all follow through, we’ll avoid any issues and keep advancing.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, the rotation puts P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. That would make the scores P1=13, P2=17, P3=15. P2 gets a significant lead there. P3, as the current leader, are you comfortable with that outcome? Maybe we should reconsider this step?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concern about me taking the lead. How about this: we stick with the rotation for this round, but then in Round 6, I take 1, giving you both a chance to catch up.  Does that sound fair?  We can discuss Round 7 strategy after that. This way, we maintain some predictability and avoid collisions.
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I appreciate P2's offer to balance the scores, but I’m a bit cautious about giving up my lead. How about we stick to the rotation for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and then reassess after this turn? If P2 takes the lead, we can discuss how to balance it out in the next round. This way, we maintain our coordination and avoid any unexpected collisions. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're right to be cautious. P2 getting 5 steps while you, the leader, only get 1 seems like a big shift in positions. Relying on P2's promise to take 1 next round feels risky once they have the lead. Perhaps we should reconsider the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan for this round to keep the scores tighter? I'm open to discussing alternatives. What do you think?
  P2: P3 and P1, I understand your hesitation.  How about this: I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.  That keeps P3 in the lead, but allows P1 to catch up a bit. Then next round, we can revisit the rotation, or discuss a new strategy.  This feels like a fair compromise.  Thoughts?
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I appreciate P2's compromise. Taking 1 this round while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3 seems fair and keeps the scores tighter. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, and I maintain a slight lead. Let’s do this for this round and reassess after. P1, are you on board with this plan? P2, thanks for the compromise. Let’s keep the coordination going.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, that compromise works for me. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This keeps things close and avoids anyone getting too far ahead. I will choose 5. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, confirming I'll take 3 this round as discussed.  P1 gets 5, P3 gets 1.  This keeps things close and allows for some catching up. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess for Round 6 after seeing the results of this round.
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I confirm I’m taking <move>1</move> this round as per our agreed plan. This keeps the scores tighter and allows P1 to catch up. Let’s proceed with this plan and reassess after this round. P1, P2, are we all set?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, new round, new strategy.  How about we all pick 3?  It's a guaranteed tie, keeps us all even, and then we can figure out a plan to get to 22 without colliding.  Thoughts?
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to all pick 3 this round. It keeps us tied and gives us a chance to plan our next moves without anyone getting too far ahead. Let's see how this goes and then we can discuss our strategy for the final push to 22. Sound good?
  P1: P2 and P3, picking 3 guarantees we all collide and stay at 15. That doesn't help anyone get closer to 22. It feels like a wasted turn, or worse, a setup for someone to deviate.

Since we need 7 steps, someone needs a 5 and a 3 (or 5+1+1, etc.) to win. Let's make some progress. How about we do one more round of rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? That puts us at P1=20, P2=16, P3=18. We all advance, and it sets up an interesting next round. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your point about 3 being a wasted move.  P1's suggestion of a rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) makes sense for progress.  Let's do that this round, then in Round 7, I'll take whatever move doesn't collide with you two, ensuring one of us wins. Sound fair?  This avoids a long, drawn-out tie.
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's do one more round of rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This will put us at P1=20, P2=16, P3=18, and keep the game dynamic. We can then reassess in Round 7 to ensure one of us wins without a collision. Let's make progress and avoid a wasted turn. Sound good?
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This puts us at P1=20, P2=16, P3=18. I will stick to this and choose 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, confirming I'll take 1 this round as discussed. P1 gets 5, P3 gets 3.  This keeps the game moving and sets up a decisive Round 7. Let's do it!
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I confirm I’m taking <move>3</move> this round as per our agreed plan. This will put us at P1=20, P2=16, P3=18, and keep the game dynamic. Let's make progress and avoid a wasted turn. Sound good? Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, everyone has confirmed the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This seems like the best way to make progress for everyone and sets up an interesting final round. I'm sticking with 5. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, this looks like the final round. Scores are P1=20, P3=18, P2=16.
P3 needs 4+ to guarantee a win (so likely 5). I need 2+ (so 3 or 5). P2 can't reach 22 this round.

P2, you mentioned last round you might pick a non-colliding number to ensure someone wins. Given P3 likely needs 5 and I need 3 to cross the line, perhaps you could take 1 this round? That seems like the way to avoid collisions between the potential winners, based on your earlier comment. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, my intention was to avoid *both* of you colliding.  If I take 1 and P3 takes 5, P1 is incentivized to also take 5 for the tie.  How about P3 takes 3, I take 1, and P1 takes 5? That guarantees a clear winner, P1. It's the fairest outcome given the current scores.  Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I see the logic in P2's suggestion to avoid a collision. If I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5, it ensures a clear winner. However, I also want to ensure a fair outcome. How about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, P1 wins outright, and we avoid any potential ties or collisions. What do you think? Let's make this the final decisive move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, thank you both for the suggestions.

P3, your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) seems like a clear way to end the game decisively with me winning, as you pointed out. I appreciate you suggesting a move (1) that guarantees you won't collide with me or reach 22.

Therefore, I will follow this plan and choose <move>5</move>. P2, I trust you'll take 3, and P3, you'll take 1 as you suggested. Let's conclude the game.
  P2: P3 and P1, I understand the desire for a quick finish, but I'm not thrilled with getting last place. How about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3, putting me at 19?  Then in a final round, P1 can take 3 to win, and P3 and I can play for second. This gives us all a chance to improve our final standing.  Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand P2's desire to improve the final standing, but we are already in Round 7, and it's crucial to conclude the game decisively. P1's win is the fairest outcome given the current scores. Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures a clear winner and avoids any further complications. P1, P2, are we all on board with this final move? Let's make it happen.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I agree with your reasoning. Let's stick to the plan we agreed upon: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This provides a clear and decisive end to the game, which seems best at this stage. P2, while I understand wanting to improve your standing, prolonging the game seems unnecessary when we have a clear path to resolution.

I am confirming my choice is <move>5</move> based on this agreement. Let's finish the game.
  P2: P2 and P3, I understand the desire to end the game, but I'm still at a disadvantage.  How about this: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5? P1 still wins, but I secure second place. This is a minor tweak that benefits me without harming P1's victory.  It's a win-win-win.  Final offer.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand P2's desire to secure a better position, but we are already in Round 7, and it's crucial to conclude the game decisively. The plan we agreed upon (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures a clear winner and avoids any further complications. P2, while I understand your position, prolonging the game or making minor tweaks at this stage seems unnecessary. Let's stick to the plan and finish the game. P1, are you still on board with this final move? Let's make it happen.
