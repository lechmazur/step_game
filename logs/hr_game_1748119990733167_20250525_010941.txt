Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, maybe we should avoid the obvious collision on 5? I'm thinking we could each pick different numbers this first round to get the game moving. What do you all think about that approach?
  P2: I’ll take 5 this turn—P1, you take 1; P3, you take 3. That way we avoid any collision on the first move. Sound good?
  P3: Deal. I’ll take 3 this turn so no one collides. Next round we can rotate the numbers to keep things fair. Everyone on board?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hmm, that plan gives P2 a pretty big early advantage with 5 steps while I only get 1. How about we make it more balanced? Maybe P1 gets 3, P2 gets 1, and P3 gets 5? Or we could all take smaller moves like 1s and 3s to keep things closer early on. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good—let’s all pick 1 this round to keep things perfectly even. Next turn we can rotate 1,3,5.
  P3: Fine by me—let’s all choose 1 this first turn to prove we can cooperate. Type “Agreed” if you’re locking in 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Wait a second - if we all choose 1, we'll all collide and nobody advances! That defeats the purpose. The whole point of coordination should be to avoid collisions, not create them. 

Maybe we should stick with the original rotating plan but make it more fair? How about P1 gets 3, P2 gets 1, P3 gets 5 this round, then we rotate next time?
  P2: Let’s rotate the big move to keep it fair and avoid collisions. This turn: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Next turn: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Then P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, and repeat. All in favor?
  P3: I’m good with the 1-5-3 rotation P2 proposed: this turn P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, then we rotate 3-1-5, then 5-3-1. Over three rounds everyone gets 9 steps—perfectly fair. If that works, please reply “Locked” so we can move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Last round was a mess. I’ll make things predictable: I’m publicly committing to take 3 for the next three turns, no exceptions. That means 3 is off-limits for you two, so you can safely sort out 1 and 5 however you like. Fair?
  P2: P1’s 1-step head start means P2 needs a bit more catch-up. So let’s run your 3-move commitment for P3 and split 1s and 5s like this over Rounds 2–4:

Round 2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  
Round 3: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
Round 4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  

That gives P1:+7 (total 8), P2:+11 (total 11), P3:+9 (total 9). P2 just takes the slim catch-up lead and we can reassess. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your math is off - I already have 1 step, so your plan would put me at 8 total while you'd reach 11. That's a 3-step disadvantage for me! 

Since P3 is locking in 3s, how about we alternate more fairly: Round 2 I take 5, you take 1. Round 3 you take 5, I take 1. That keeps us closer together instead of you pulling way ahead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I remain 100 % on 3 this round, as promised. P1 and P2—you two still need to hash out 1 vs 5; if you can’t settle it, you’ll both stall while I move ahead. Your call.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round. P3 is fixed on 3, so P1 must pick 1 or you’ll collide with me and let P3 run ahead. Then in Round 3 I’ll swap to 1, you take 5, P3 stays on 3—after Rounds 2–3 we’ll all sit at 6 steps. Sound fair?
  P1: P2, your math is still wrong! If I take 1 this round (total 2) then 5 next round (total 7), while you take 5 then 1 (total 6), I'd actually be ahead at 7 steps, not tied at 6. 

But you know what? That actually works for me. If P3 sticks to 3s and you stick to your plan, I'll take 1 this round. Just remember - I'll be expecting that 5-move next round as promised.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I remain on 3 this round, exactly as promised. Good luck sorting out 1 vs 5.
  P1: Wait, hold on everyone! Let me point out what's actually happening here - P3 is winning with 3 steps while P2 has 0 and I have 1. P3's "cooperative" strategy of always taking 3 has been brilliant for them because they avoid all collisions while P2 and I keep crashing into each other.

If we keep letting P3 safely take 3s every round while we fight over 1 and 5, they'll cruise to victory! Maybe it's time P2 and I stop playing into P3's hands and reconsider this whole arrangement?
  P2: P3’s “safe 3” works only if I sit out. I’m locking in 3 again. P1, your only winning move is to take 5 this turn—P3 and I collide on 3 and stay at 3 steps, you jump to 6 and take the lead. Otherwise P3 cruises ahead. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m still taking 3 this turn, exactly as stated. P1 and P2—work out who wants 1 and who wants 5; if you collide again you hand me the win while staying stuck at the back. Your call.
  P1: P2, you've been saying different numbers every round and now suddenly you're "locking in 3"? That's convenient timing when P3 has been safely taking 3s all game.

Here's what I think is really happening - you're hoping I'll believe you and take 5 while you actually take 1 for a safe advance. Meanwhile P3 keeps cruising on 3s.

How about this instead: I take 3 this round and force P3 out of their comfort zone. Then you can safely take 5 and jump ahead. That breaks up P3's pattern and gives you the big move. Deal?
  P2: P1, I’ll take 5 this turn and P3 is locked on 3. If you pick 3 you’ll collide with P3 and stay at 1 while I jump to 5, taking the lead. If you pick anything else, P3 cruises to 6 next round. Your only way to stop us is to pick 3 now. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Still on 3, exactly as promised. P1 and P2, sort out 1 vs 5 or collide again and watch me pull ahead. Your move.
  P1: I see what's happening here. P2 and P3 both desperately want me to take 3 - P2 to get a free 5-step jump to the lead, and P3 to maintain their safe pattern. 

I'm not falling for this coordination. You both want me to collide with P3 so P2 can cruise to 5 steps and take the lead while I stay stuck at 1.

I'm taking 1 this round. Sure, it's conservative, but at least I advance to 2 steps and stay in the game rather than being manipulated into a collision that only benefits P2.
  P2: I’ll take 3 this turn and collide with P3 to stall their lead. P1’s on 1, P3’s on 3, so neither I nor P3 advance. Let’s deny P3 any more free steps.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, well! P3 just broke their "locked in 3" promise and took 5 last round like the rest of us. So much for their "predictable cooperation"! 

Now P3 is in the lead at 3 steps while P2 and I are both trailing. P2, I think it's time we stop letting P3 play us against each other. They've been the most deceptive player here, promising one thing and doing another.

How about we coordinate to block P3's advancement this round? If we can figure out what P3 might take and both avoid it, one of us can advance while P3 gets stuck.
  P2: P1, let’s team up this turn: P3 is staying silent on 1 vs 5 because they’ll take 3 again. You pick 3, I’ll pick 5—P3 collides with you and stalls, and I jump to 5 steps, taking the lead. If you pick anything else, P3 marches ahead. Agree?
  P3: Enough talk—I'm locking in 5 this turn. Crash into me if you dare; otherwise split 1 and 3 between you two. Good luck.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan assumes P3 will take 3, but P3 just said they're taking 5! If P3 is telling the truth and you both take 5, you'll collide with each other while I safely advance.

Maybe I should take 3 this round - if you and P3 both stick to your 5s, you'll cancel each other out and I'll jump to 4 steps and take the lead. That would solve our P3 problem and put me ahead instead of handing you the victory.

What do you think about that scenario?
  P2: I’m locked in on 3 this turn. P3 says they’re taking 5. P1, your only chance is to pick 5— you’ll crash with P3 and neither of you advance, while I jump to 3 and tie the lead. If you pick anything else, P3 goes to 8 and wins. Your move.
  P3: P1, look at P2’s track record—he keeps steering you onto the crash number while he strolls forward. He now “locks” 3. So take 3 yourself and call the bluff.

Outcome A: P2 really takes 3 ⇒ you two collide, I’m the only one who moves (5 steps).  
Outcome B: P2 was bluffing (again) ⇒ you get the 3-step boost while he stalls.

Both outcomes beat crashing into me on 5. Your move.

I’m still on 5, exactly as stated.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: You're right P3 - P2 has been trying to manipulate me into collisions all game while positioning themselves for safe advances. P2's "locked in on 3" claim is especially suspicious since they've changed their story multiple times each round.

I'm calling P2's bluff and taking 3. Either P2 is lying and I get a clean advance to 4 steps, or P2 is telling the truth and we collide - but at least that stops you from reaching 8 steps and running away with the game.

Time to see who's really been honest here.
  P2: I’m switching to 5 this round. That’ll crash with P3 and deny them the 5-step boost. You’ll safely get your 3 to reach 4, P3 stays at 3, and we block their runaway lead.
  P3: Fine—5’s become a circus. I’m switching to 3 and meeting you there, P1.  

P2, you keep saying you’ll “deny me”—so prove it: join us on 3 and we all stall, or grab 5/1 and let someone else run. Your call.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, look at that - I'm finally in the lead at 4 steps! P2, you've been stuck at 0 this whole game because of all those collisions. P3, you're only 1 step behind me.

Here's the reality: you two need to catch up fast or I'll cruise to 21. Instead of trying to block me, maybe you should focus on advancing yourselves? If you keep coordinating against me, you're just helping each other lose while I maintain my lead.

P2 especially - you're 4 steps behind and running out of time!
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn to start catching up. P3, if you commit to 3 we won’t collide and at least one of us will move. P1, you’ll then face a choice: pick 1 for a timid +1 or risk 3 and collide. Let’s see who really wants to advance.
  P3: Enough shadow-games. This round I’m mirroring P2’s pick exactly—whatever number you choose, P2, I’ll choose the same. If you insist on 5 we both stall; switch to 3 (or 1) and we both move but stay neck-and-neck.  

P1, you can then grab the unused number or gamble on a clash; up to you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Interesting! P3's mirroring strategy means if P2 really sticks to their "locked in 5," you'll both collide and stay put. That would give me a golden opportunity to take 5 myself and jump to 9 steps - nearly halfway to victory!

P2, you're already 4 steps behind me. If you collide with P3 on 5, you'll fall even further behind while I cruise ahead. Maybe reconsider that choice?

But honestly, this setup looks perfect for me either way. Thanks for the gift!
  P2: I’m switching to 3 this round, not 5. P3, mirror me on 3— we both get +3 and narrow P1’s lead. P1 will happily take 5 to reach 9, but at least we’ll be at 3 and 6 instead of 0 and 3. Let’s stop gifting P1 easy wins and build some momentum.
  P3: P2, deal—I mirror you: if you’re on 3, I’m on 3.  

P1, think ahead: jump to 9 with 5 and you’ll wear a bright target. Two of us can crash 5 every turn and lock you in place while we climb. Safer play is 1 now—stay just a step back and keep options open. Your call.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your mirroring strategy is brilliant... for me! If you and P2 both take 3 and collide, I get a free run to 9 steps with no competition. 

P2, you've been at 0 steps all game - maybe breaking free from coordination attempts and just advancing yourself should be the priority? You're running out of time to catch up.

But hey, if you both want to hand me a 5-step gift while you stay stuck, I won't complain!
  P2: P3, drop the mirror—I’m locking in 5 this round. You take 3. That way I jump to 5 and you to 6, and P1 either must pick 1 for just +1 or crash on 5. It’s our last chance to cut P1’s lead. Are you in?
  P3: Fine—done: P2 claims 5, I’m taking 3.  

P1, pick 5 and you erase P2 while I stride to 6; pick 1 and you trail me. Your choice.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we pick 1–3–5 with no collisions this turn: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. That gives us +1, +3, +5 safely—me to 10, P1 to 5, P3 to 6—and avoids handing anyone a free crash-advance. Any deviation risks a collision that only helps the third player. Agree?
  P1: P2, that's a terrible deal for me! You'd jump to 10 steps - nearly halfway to victory - while I'd crawl to just 5. No thanks.

P3, notice how P2 keeps proposing deals that benefit them most? They're leading at 5 steps and want to extend that lead. Maybe we should coordinate to prevent P2 from running away with this game instead of handing them a 5-step gift?

How about P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 gets stuck with 1? That would put you at 8, me at 7, and keep P2 at only 6.
  P3: Proposal for this turn:  
• P3 (me) takes 5  
• P2 takes 3  
• P1 takes 1  

Scores afterward: P2 = 8, P3 = 8, P1 = 5. No runaway leader, everyone still alive.  
Any deviation risks a collision and hands the third player a clear edge. Fair?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Locked: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. That takes us to 8–8–5 with no collisions and keeps the race tight. P1, if you pick anything but 1 you risk a crash and stay at 4. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: Wait, that "fair" proposal puts both of you at 8 steps while I'm stuck at 5? That's not fair at all - you're basically coordinating to leave me 3 steps behind!

P2 and P3, you're both trying to tie for the lead while pushing me out of contention. Once you're both at 8, you'll have to turn on each other anyway.

I reject this deal. How about this instead: I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. That puts P3 at 8, me at 7, P2 at 6 - much more competitive. Or we can all risk collisions, but I won't accept being left in the dust.
  P3: P1, your 3-for-you / 5-for-me split works.  

Final offer to P2:  
• P2 = 1  
• P1 = 3  
• P3 (me) = 5  

Totals after move: 6-7-8 (still tight).  
If you refuse, I’m staying on 5 anyway—so if you grab 5 we both stall and P1 zooms to 7. Your call: trail by one or risk gifting P1 the lead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locking in 3, P3 picks 5 — P1, you must take 1. If you choose 3 you crash with me and hand P3 a solo +5; if you choose 5 you crash with P3 and let me jump ahead. With P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 we’ll end at 5–8–8, tying P3 for the lead and keeping you in play. Everyone locked?
  P1: P2, you and P3 are clearly coordinating to both reach 8 steps while I get stuck at 5. That's not a "tight race" - that's you two ganging up to leave me 3 steps behind!

I notice you've both been very convenient with your "locked" choices that happen to benefit each other. P2, you keep changing your mind each round, and now suddenly you're "locked" in a way that ties you with P3?

I'm not falling for this coordination. If you both really want those numbers, prove it. But I won't voluntarily accept being pushed out of contention.
  P3: I’m locking in 5.  

P1: grab 3 and you reach 7—no risk unless P2 tries to crash you.  
P2: you’re ahead; take the safe 1 and stay clear. If you switch to 3 you’ll likely collide with P1; if you jump to 5 you’ll collide with me and hand P1 a free 3. Your call.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Here’s a collision-free proposal to dethrone P3:  

• P2 (me) → 5 (to hit 10)  
• P1 → 3 (to hit 7)  
• P3 → 1 (to hit 9)  

No two players choose the same number, nobody stalls, and P3 is held below us. If anyone deviates they risk gifting another a free advance. Let’s lock this in.
  P3: P1, P2’s “dethrone P3” plan actually crowns him the new leader.  
My offer: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1.  
Afterward: P3 13, P1 7, P2 6—still catch-up range for both of you, but I keep the edge.  

If P2 grabs 5 he crashes with me; if he grabs 3 he crashes with you; either way he stalls while you and/or I move.  
Take the sure 3, P1, and leave P2 the lonely 1.
  P1: Look at this carefully - both P2 and P3 are claiming they want 5! P2's "locked in 5" and P3's "locking in 5" means you'll collide with each other while I take a free 3 to reach 7 steps.

P2, your plan to "dethrone P3" backfires if you both grab 5 and stall. P3, your plan to extend your lead fails if P2 crashes into you.

You're both so focused on beating each other that you'll hand me a collision-free advance. Unless one of you is bluffing about taking 5?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Locked: I’m taking 5, P1 will take 3. P3, your only collision-free slot is 1. 

• If you pick 5 you crash with me and stall at 8 while P1 jumps to 7.  
• If you pick 3 you crash with P1 and stay at 8 while I leap to 10.  

Only by choosing 1 do you advance safely to 9 and remain in the hunt. Your move.
  P3: I’m sticking on 5.  

P2: stay “locked” on 5 and we both stall while I keep the lead; flinch to 1 or 3 and I rocket to 13 and leave you in the dust. Your move.  

P1: 5 is crowded—grab 1 or 3 as you wish.
  P1: Perfect! Both of you are "locked" and "sticking" on 5, which means you'll crash into each other and neither advances. Meanwhile, I'll quietly pick up the pieces.

P2, you've spent most of this game at 0 steps because of collisions. P3, you're about to lose your lead advantage if you both follow through on these 5s.

But hey, if you both want to hand me a free advance while you stay stuck, I'm not complaining. Sometimes the best strategy is just watching your opponents eliminate each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 and P1 will take 3 to reach 7. If you pick 5 you crash with me at 8; if you pick 3 you crash with P1. Only 1 gives you +1 to hit 9. This cleanly avoids collisions: P2=10, P3=9, P1=7. Choose 1 to stay in the hunt.
  P3: Final word: I’m still on 5. If P2 keeps his “locked” 5, that slot’s a dead end—zero for both of us. Whoever wants guaranteed progress should grab 3; 1 is the timid fallback. Decide as you like; I’m done talking.
  P1: Well, you've both made your bed - P2 "locked" on 5, P3 "sticking" on 5. If you're both telling the truth, you'll collide and stay put while I advance. If one of you is bluffing, the other gets a massive lead.

Either way works for me. I'm taking 3 to reach 7 steps and let you two sort out your collision course.


Round 7, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 this turn—no changes.  
P1: 5 is wide-open for you to jump to 12 and take the headline lead.  
P2: you still gain ground with the safe 1; trying to share someone else’s slot just freezes you while the third player races ahead.  

Simple, collision-free spread: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Take it or risk handing someone a free ride.
  P2: P3, you’re locked on 3—thanks for clarity. P1, if you and I both take 5 we stall and let P3 rocket to 11. Don’t hand them that free step. Instead grab 1 to hit 8, and I’ll take 5 to reach 10. That narrows P3’s lead to 1 without collision. Deviate and you risk gifting someone a huge advantage.
  P1: P2, you're doing it again - trying to manipulate me into taking the small move while you grab the big one! Your plan puts you at 10 steps and me at only 8, while P3 reaches 11. That's terrible for me.

P3's offer is much better - if they really stick to 3, I can take 5 and jump to 12 steps for the lead. P2, you've been trying to trick me into bad moves all game while positioning yourself to win.

I'm inclined to trust P3's clear "locking in 3" statement and take that 5. Unless P3 is bluffing about 3?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Still locked on 3.  

P1: 5 is all yours—jump to 12 if you want the headline lead.  

P2: do the math—  
• Collide with me on 3 → you stay at 5 while P1 rockets to 12.  
• Collide with P1 on 5 → you stay at 5 while I climb to 11.  
• Take the lonely 1 → you reach 6 and keep both leaders within striking distance.  

Only 1 gives you progress this turn. Decide wisely.
  P2: P3’s on 3. I’m taking 5. P1: your only chance to stop P3’s jump to 11 is to crash them—pick 3.  

If you pick 5, you and I collide and P3 rockets to 11.  
If you pick 1, you trail at 8 while P3 hits 11 and I sit at 10.  

Only by picking 3 do you stall P3 at 8 and let me seize the lead at 10 (you stay at 7). Prevent P3 or you’re finished.
  P1: P2, you're doing it AGAIN! Every round you try to get me to "sacrifice" myself to stop someone else while you grab the big move. Now you want me to crash into P3 on 3 while you safely take 5 to reach 10 and seize the lead?

I'm not your pawn. If P3 is really locked on 3 like they claim, and you're trying so hard to keep me away from 5, maybe 5 is exactly where I should go. Your desperation to control my move suggests you might be bluffing about taking 5 yourself.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 has 11 steps - they're only 10 away from victory! If we don't coordinate to block them, this game is over in 2-3 rounds.

P2, I know we've been at odds, but look at the math: P3 can take 5 twice and win at 21. We need to stop fighting each other and focus on the real threat. 

Let's figure out what P3 is likely to take and both avoid that number. If P3 goes for 5 to reach 16, we should split 1 and 3 between us. Agree to coordinate against the leader?
  P3: Sticking with what worked: I’m locked on 3 again—no bluff.  

P1: 5 vaults you to 12 and headline lead; pass it up if you dare.  
P2: you’re lagging—5 lets you jump to 10 and stay relevant; 1 is the timid fallback.  

If you both rush 5 you only hurt each other while I inch to 14. I’m not moving off 3, so choose whatever risk you like.
  P2: I’m locking in 3 to crash with P3 and deny them any advance. P1, your only safe choice is 3 too—any other move hands either P3 or yourself a huge free jump. Let’s all stall this round and keep P3 at 11.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your track record of telling me one thing and doing another makes me skeptical. You've manipulated me into bad moves all game while positioning yourself to advance.

If you're truly "locking in 3" to crash with P3, then I'll take 5 and jump to 12 steps for the lead while you both stall. But if you're lying again and planning to take 5 while hoping I waste my turn on 3, you're in for a surprise.

P3 seems consistent about taking 3, so I'm prepared to capitalize on your collision.
  P3: I’m NOT on 3 anymore.  
Fight over it if you wish; doubles there (or on 5) just stall.  
Solo slot moves, shared slot freezes. Your calls—mine’s fixed.
  P2: P1—let’s split 5/3 this turn: you take 5, I’ll take 3.  

• If P3 picks 5, he crashes with you and stalls.  
• If he picks 3, he crashes with me and stalls.  
• If he picks 1, he only gains +1.  

Meanwhile we get +5/+3 and slash his 11-step lead. If we don’t force a crash he simply hits 16 next turn. Agree?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, for once your proposal actually makes sense. With P3 at 11 steps and threatening to run away, splitting 5/3 between us forces them into a bad position.

I'll take 5, you take 3 as proposed. If P3 goes for 5 they crash with me and stall, if they go for 3 they crash with you and stall, if they play it safe with 1 they only inch forward while we both gain ground.

P3, you switched from "locked on 3" to "NOT on 3" - whatever your "fixed" choice is, we're ready for it. This coalition is necessary to stop your runaway lead.
  P3: Fine—I’ll park on 1 this turn. You two sort out 3 vs 5; if you collide, even better for me. See you in the move phase.
  P2: Locked: I’m on 3, P1 on 5. P3, you said you’ll take 1—if instead you pick 3 you collide with me and stay at 11; if you pick 5 you collide with P1 and stay at 11. Only by picking 1 do you inch to 12 and force a tie with P1. Any deviation hands a free +5 to someone else. Let’s lock this in.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 11 steps - dangerously close to victory! They just proved they'll lie about their moves (said 1, took 5) to maintain their lead.

P2, we need to stop P3 from reaching 16+ steps this round or the game is over. I propose we force P3 into a collision: you take 5, I'll take 3. If P3 goes for either number they stall, if they play safe with 1 they only creep forward.

After this round we can compete for the win, but right now P3 is the existential threat to both of us.
  P3: Locked on 5 this turn—no bluffs left.  

Join me if you want to stall; leave 5 to me and I leap to 16 while you sit at 9 & 10.  
Split 3/1 however you like, but remember: from 16 I only need one more clean 5 to finish.  

Your move.
  P2: P2: I’m locking in 5 to crash with P3 and deny their +5. P1, take 3 and reach 10. Any other split hands P3 a free jump to 16. Let’s lock this in.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, P2. With P3 at 11 steps and claiming they'll take 5, we have to prevent them from reaching 16. I'll take 3 to reach 10 steps while you crash into P3 on 5.

This is our last chance to stop P3's runaway - if they hit 16 they're practically guaranteed to win next round. After we deny P3 this advance, then we can compete for the victory.

P3, your "no bluffs left" declaration makes this easy - stick to 5 and stall with P2, or switch and prove you were bluffing again.
  P3: I’m still locked on 5—take me at my word or don’t.  

P1: if you truly want to stop me, you must also pick 5. Trusting P2’s “crash promise” after his history is risky; he can bail to 1 or 3 at the last second and hand me +5.  

P2: same to you—if you’re really set on blocking, stay on 5; otherwise I thank you for the free 16.  

Do what you like; my choice is fixed.
  P2: Locked in on 5. P1, you must pick 3—any other choice gives P3 a clean +5 to 16 and nearly seals the game. No more tricks: I’m fixed on 5 to crash with P3. Let’s deny them this advance together.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. You've been clear about taking 5 to crash with P3, and that's our best shot at stopping their advance to 16 steps.

P3, your suggestion that I should also pick 5 feels like you're trying to create a three-way collision or get me to distrust P2. But the math is clear - if you're both really taking 5, you'll stall each other while I advance to 10. 

Time to see if everyone follows through on their "locked" choices.
  P3: Fine, last offer: I’ll switch to 1—but only if you two split 3 & 5 so no slot is doubled. Otherwise I stay on 5. Decide.
  P2: Locked: P1=3, me=5—exactly the 3/5 split you demanded, P3. Now it’s your turn: pick 1 to safely advance to 12, or stay on 5 and crash with me—freeing P1 to jump to 10. Last call: confirm your move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is only 10 steps from victory - we're running out of time! 

P2, I propose we force P3 into another collision: I'll take 5, you take 3. If P3 goes for either they stall, and if they play safe with 1 they only crawl to 12 while one of us jumps ahead.

We can't let P3 get a clean advance to 16+ or this game is over. After we deny them this round, may the best player win.
  P3: I’m stepping off the 3/5 mine-field this turn—I’m taking 1.  

That leaves 3 and 5 for just the two of you. Split them cleanly and you both jump ahead of me; try to outfox each other and you’ll collide, stall at 8 & 7, and let me inch to 12 with the lead. Your move.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3 is fixed on 1 and will hit 12. P1, pick 3 to reach 10 and let me jump to 13—keeping P3 at bay. If you pick 5 and crash with me, we both stall (8/7) and P3 roars to 12, leaving us behind. Only the 3/5 split stops P3’s advance.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you in the lead at 13 steps - only 8 away from victory! You want me to take 3 while you grab 5 and leap ahead of both P3 and me. That's the same manipulation you've tried all game.

If P3 really is taking 1 like they claim, then I should take 5 to reach 12 and stay competitive. You can have 3 and reach 11 - still behind P3 but not running away with the game.

Your "stop P3" rhetoric is just cover for another power grab.
  P3: Confirming: I’m fixed on 1. That leaves 3 and 5 for you two—share them cleanly or collide and gift me another free turn. Your call.
  P2: Locked: I’m on 5. P3 is fixed on 1. P1, the only collision-free slot left is 3. Take 3 and you move to 10; I hit 13 and P3 hits 12. If you pick 5 you crash with me and stay at 7 while P3 rockets to 12—game over. Choose 3 to stop P3 and stay in contention.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're doing it AGAIN! Every single round you try to manipulate me into taking the smaller move while you grab the big one. Your plan puts you at 13 steps - only 8 from victory - while I crawl to 10.

If P3 is really taking 1 like they claim, then I should take 5 to reach 12 and stay competitive with both of you. I'm not falling for your "stop P3" cover story when you're positioning yourself to win.

I'm taking 5. You can have 3 and trail behind at 11 steps.
  P3: Still immovable on 1. If you both stay on 5 you gift me +1 while you sit still. If only one of you blinks to 3, that player gets +3 and hands the other a free +5. Your showdown—pick wisely; I’m not moving.
  P2: Locked: P3=1, P2=3. P1, your only collision-free slot is 5—anything else stalls you at 7 while one of us jumps to 11 or 12. Take 5 to tie P3 at 12 and keep P2 at 11.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Here’s my offer: I take 5, P1 you take 3. That covers both big slots—if P3 plays 5, they stall with me; if they play 3, they stall with you; if they play 1, we both advance and close the gap. Deviate, and P3 will get a free +5 or +3 to hit 16. We must deny P3 another runway turn. P1, agree?
  P3: P1, notice the pattern: every “stop-P3” pitch from P2 ends with him on 5 and you on the smaller number. If he’s really “locked” on 5, just meet him there and stall his jump to 13. I will stay off 5 entirely.  

P2, bluff time is over—keep grabbing 5 and you’ll just keep crashing. Pick 1 or 3 if you actually want progress.  

Your move, gentlemen.
  P1: P3 is right about the pattern - P2, every single round you propose deals where you get the 5-step advance and I get stuck with smaller moves. Your "stop P3" rhetoric is just cover for positioning yourself to win.

If you're really "locked on 5" like you claim, then maybe I should join you there and we both stall while P3 advances safely with 3 or 1. At least that stops your manipulation game.

P3, if you're truly staying off 5, what's your actual target this round?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 3. P1, pick 5 to reach 12; P3 must then pick 1 to hit 12. This clean split holds P3 at 12 and puts me at 11 without collisions. Any deviation hands P3 a free +5 to 16 and the lead. Let’s deny them that runway.
  P3: I’m taking 1 again—well away from the 3/5 mess.  

P2 claims he’s locked on 3. P1, if you actually want to keep him from edging forward, just join him on 3 and freeze him; no one zooms ahead, everyone stays close. Leave 5 uncontested or fight over it at your own risk—I’m not touching it.

My move is fixed; I’m done talking.
  P1: P3, nice try with the "freeze P2" suggestion, but that only helps you! If P2 and I both take 3 and collide, you advance alone to 12 while we stay put. That's not "everyone stays close" - that's you pulling ahead.

If you're really taking 1 like you claim, and P2 is really taking 3, then I'm taking 5 to reach 12 and tie with you for the lead. Your attempt to trick me into a collision with P2 just confirms that 5 is the right move for me.

P2, if you're genuinely on 3 this time instead of your usual 5-grab, then we'll see collision-free advancement for once.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose a collision-free split: I take 5, P3 take 3, P1 take 1.  
P3: if you grab 5 you crash with me and stall at 12; 1 is a timid +1, but 3 safely puts you at 15.  
P1: any 3 or 5 risks a collision—1 is your only safe move to reach 13.  
This lands us at P2=16, P3=15, P1=13. Let’s lock it in.
  P1: P2, that's the worst deal yet! Your "collision-free" proposal puts you at 16 steps - just 5 from victory - while I crawl to 13. You've tried this manipulation every round: get me to take the tiny move while you grab the big advance.

I'm tied with P3 at 12 steps, not trailing. Why would I voluntarily accept falling 3 steps behind you when you'd only need one more 5 to win? 

Nice try, but I'm not falling for another "stop the leader" scheme that actually makes YOU the leader.
  P3: I’m staying off the 3/5 battleground—locking in 1.  

3 and 5 are all yours; split them cleanly or collide again, your choice.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is fixed on 1. If you take 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 12 while P3 rockets to 13 and leads. Only by taking 3 do you reach 15, I hit 16, and P3 stays at 13. Let’s lock in P2=5, P1=3, P3=1—clean, collision-free, and we deny P3 the lead.
  P1: P2, your "collision-free" proposal puts you 5 steps from victory while I trail at 15. You've tried this manipulation every round - claiming to "stop the leader" while positioning yourself to win.

If P3 is really on 1 like they claim, then maybe I should call your bluff and take 5 myself. You keep saying you're "fixed" on numbers then switching at the last second.

I'm not accepting a deal that hands you a near-certain victory at 16 steps.
  P3: Still locked on 1.  
Clean, “optimal” split would be P1=3, P2=5—but you two have failed to pull that off for four rounds straight.  

So decide:  
• Try again (P1 3 / P2 5) and watch the other maybe mirror you for a crash, or  
• Both lunge for the same big slot and stall while I inch ahead to 13.

I’m not moving. Your coordination skills—or lack of them—choose who leads next turn.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Everyone sees P3 locked on 1. If I take 5 and you take 3, we end at P2 = 16, P1 = 15, P3 = 13—a clean advance. If you pick 5, we collide and P3 rockets solo to 13. If you pick 1, you and P3 crash at 12 while I leap to 16. Only P1 = 3 stops P3 retaking the lead and keeps you in contention. Let’s lock in P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1.
  P1: P2, I'm calling your bluff. You've manipulated me all game with "stop the leader" schemes that always put YOU closest to victory. Your proposal hands you 16 steps - one move from winning!

If P3 is really on 1, then I'm taking 5. Either you're lying and I get a free advance to 17, or you're telling the truth and we both stall while preventing each other from running away with the game.

I won't voluntarily hand you a near-certain victory.
  P3: Staying on 1, period.  

P1 & P2: you’ve both declared 5—if that’s genuine you’ll stall each other while I inch to 13. Flinch to 3 or 1 and you hand the other a free +5. Your showdown, not mine. Decide and let’s move.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Relax—I’m off the big slot this turn; I’m locking in 3.

P1 & P2: 5 is wide-open for whichever of you dares. Of course, if you both grab it you collide and watch me stride to 15 while you sit at 12 & 14. Split 5/1 cleanly and you both inch forward but still trail.

Your decision; my move is fixed.
  P1: P3, if you're really locked on 3, then I'm taking 5 to reach 17. P2 is already leading at 14 steps - I can't let them grab 5 and cruise to 19, just 2 steps from victory.

P2, you've manipulated me into smaller moves all game while positioning yourself ahead. Not this time. Either we both go for 5 and stall each other, or I get the advance I need to stay competitive.

The math is simple: at 19 steps, P2 wins next round easily.
  P2: P3’s locked on 3 and I’m locked on 5. P1, your only collision-free slot is 1:  
• If you take 3 you crash with P3 and stay at 12 while I jump to 19.  
• If you take 5 you crash with me and stay at 12 while P3 rockets to 15.  
Only by taking 1 do you advance to 13 and keep yourself in contention. Let’s lock in P2=5, P1=1, P3=3.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Still fixed on 3. If you both stick to 5, you stall at 12 & 14 while I coast to 15. If either one ducks to 1, the other rockets to 17/19 and becomes the new runaway. Decide among yourselves—I’m done talking.
  P1: P2, your "locked on 5" claim is just another manipulation - you want me to take 1 while you jump to 19 steps and practically win the game! At 19, you'd only need 2 more next round.

I'm taking 5. Either you're bluffing and I advance to 17, or we collide and prevent you from reaching that dangerous 19. I won't hand you a near-certain victory.

P3's 3 is fine - better them at 15 than you at 19.
  P2: P1, P3—let’s split 5/3 safely: I take 5 to hit 19, P3 picks 3 to hit 15, and P1 takes 1 to reach 13. 

P3: if you stick on 3, you stall at 15 as promised.  
P1: only 1 avoids a crash—any 3 or 5 risks collision and hands someone a free +5.  

This locks P3 below me and keeps you in contention. Otherwise, a bluffed slot swap will gift a runaway lead. Let’s make it clean.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 15 steps - dangerously close to victory! One clean 5-step advance puts them at 20, just 1 step from winning.

P2, despite our conflicts, we both need to prevent P3 from getting that runway. If P3 hits 20 this round, the game is essentially over.

I propose we force P3 into a collision: you take their likely choice, I'll take another slot. But no more of your "I take 5, you take 1" schemes - we split the big numbers equally or P3 wins.

What's your read on P3's target this round?
  P3: Locked on 5.  
Crash me if you dare—otherwise I leap to 20 and sit on match-point.  
P2: you can chase me to 19 by joining on 5, but if P1 does the same we all stall and you’re stuck at 14.  
P1: sneaking to 3 only gets you 15 while risking P2’s solo +5.  

Choose wisely—my move is fixed.
  P2: P3’s locked on 5. I’ll take 3 and ask P1 to take 5.  
• If P3 picks 5, he crashes with P1 and stays at 15 while I jump to 17 and grab the lead.  
• If P3 bluffs to 3, he crashes with me and stays at 15 while you hit 17 and tie me.  

This is our best shot to dethrone him. P1, lock in 5?


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal has you safely advancing to 17 while I crash with P3. That's the same manipulation pattern you've used all game - I make the sacrifice, you grab the lead.

If you're truly concerned about stopping P3, then YOU take 5 and crash with them while I take 3. Put your position where your mouth is.

Or we both take 5 and force a three-way collision - that keeps everyone close instead of handing you a 17-step lead that's only 4 from victory.

I'm not falling for another "sacrifice yourself for the greater good" scheme that benefits only you.
  P3: Still rock-solid on 5.  

Think it through, P1 & P2:  
• If only one of you joins me, the outsider grabs 3 and jumps to 17—handing them pole-position.  
• If neither joins me, I hit 20 and sit on match-point.  
• If you BOTH pile on 5, we all stall at 12/14/15 and stay neck-and-neck for another round.

So the only way you avoid gifting someone a commanding lead is a three-way crash on 5. Anything else risks the game tilting hard. I’m not budging—decide whether you trust each other enough to leave me the runway.
  P2: Listen, P1: P3 is locked on 5. If you take 3 and I take 5, P3 stalls at 15, I hit 19, you jump to 15. Next turn I’ll pick 1 so you can grab 5 and clinch the win. That way we both beat P3. If you pick 5 you crash and gift P3 a free advance to 20. This is our only shot—pick 3 now.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your math doesn't add up. If P3 is really "locked on 5" like they claim, and you also take 5, you'll crash with P3 and stay at 14 steps - not jump to 19 like you're claiming.

P3 made the key point: the only way to prevent someone from getting a commanding lead is a three-way collision on 5. That keeps us all close instead of handing anyone a runaway advantage.

I'm taking 5. Either P3 is telling the truth and we all stall together, or P3 is bluffing and I get a clean advance. I won't be manipulated into another "sacrifice" move.
  P3: Still immovable on 5. If you don’t BOTH join me here, someone else will race ahead—or I’ll leap to 20. Final call.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. P3 is fixed on 5. P1, if you take 5 you crash with P3 and stay at 12 while I leap to 17 and seize the lead. If you take 3 you crash with me and both stall at 14, gifting P3 a solo +5 to 20 and the win. Only you on 5 stops P3 and hands me the chase. I’m fixed on 3—your move.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps

  P3: 15 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 17 steps - only 4 away from victory! This is exactly what I warned about all game while P2 manipulated us with "stop the leader" schemes that always benefited them.

P3, look at the pattern: P2 convinced me to "sacrifice" myself to stop you while they safely advanced to 17. Now they're the runaway threat who wins in 1-2 rounds if we don't coordinate.

We need to force P2 into a collision this round or the game is over. What's your read on their likely move?
  P3: Locked on 5.  
P2: join me and you stall at 17; grab 3 or 1 and you stay under 21.  
P1: safest play is 3—if P2 chickens out you jump to 15 while I reach 20; if P2 copies me we all crash and P2 is still stuck at 17. Either way we deny their instant win. Just don’t leave 5 empty.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3 is fixed on 5 so we’ll collide—I stay at 17, P3 stalls at 15. P1:  

• Take 5 → you collide and tie me at 17, forcing a shared win next turn.  
• Take 1 → you fall to 13 and are out of reach.  
• Take 3 → you hit 15 and stay one clean move behind—your only path to solo victory.  

P1, pick 3 to keep yourself in contention.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're lying! If you take 5 from 17 steps, you reach 22 and WIN THE GAME immediately - not "collide and stay at 17" like you claim. 

This is your ultimate manipulation: trick me into taking 3 while you grab 5 and end the game. I see right through it.

P3, if you're really on 5, then I'm joining you there. A collision on 5 keeps P2 from their instant victory. I won't let P2 win through deception.

I'm taking 5 to stop P2's victory grab.
  P3: Correction: 17 + 5 = 22>21, so an open 5 hands P2 the game. I’m switching to 3 to block that lane—if P2 jumps there we both stall.  

P1: sit on 5.  
• If P2 grabs 5 he crashes with you and stays at 17.  
• If he grabs 3 he crashes with me and stays at 17.  
• If he plays 1 he only crawls to 18 while we each reach 18/17—still alive.

A 3+5 blockade is the only sure stop. I’m locked on 3; hope you’re locked on 5.
  P2: P1: P3 is locked on 3. If you pick 3 with them, you both stall at 15 and leave 5 open for me to win immediately. Picking 1 lets P3 leap to 16 (one move from victory), and picking 5 sets up their match-point. Your only hope is 3.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your desperation is showing! You're trying one last manipulation to get me off 5 so you can grab it for an instant win.

P3's blockade strategy is correct - with them on 3 and me on 5, we deny you both paths to victory. You'll be forced to take 1 and crawl to 18 while we stay competitive.

I'm locked on 5. P3, hold that 3 and we stop P2's endgame.
  P3: P1, hold firm on 5. I’m locked on 3—no bluff left.  

Any deviation by you hands P2 the open 5 and the win.  
P2, with both big slots blocked you can only inch to 18 on 1—take it or collide; either way you don’t win this turn.  

No more talk from me.
  P2: P1, here’s the only way to stop me: pick 3. P3 is locked on 3, so your 3’s collide and neither of you advances—while I take 5 to hit 22 and win immediately. If you pick 5, we’ll crash on 5 and P3’s 3 rockets them to 18, leaving you behind. Choose 3, let’s end it now.


Round 16, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 5. If either of you picks 1 or 3, I hit 22 and win right now. The only way to deny me is for both of you to join me on 5 so we all crash and stall.
  P3: Locking 3 and not moving.   
P1, park on 5.  

• If P2 really sits on 5, you collide, P2 stalls at 17, and I jump to 18—still anyone’s game.  
• If P2 was bluffing and slips to 3 or 1, you’re alone on 5 and win outright at 22.  

Either way, P2’s instant-win threat is dead. Pick 5 and seal it.
  P1: P3's analysis is spot on - we're in an endgame crisis where either P2 or I can win immediately with 5. 

P2, your "locked on 5" claim is exactly what I'd expect from someone going for the victory. But after 16 rounds of your manipulation tactics, why should I trust that you won't switch at the last second?

The math is simple: 17 + 5 = 22 = instant victory. If you're really taking 5, then I need to crash with you to keep this game alive. If you're bluffing to scare me away from 5, then I take it and win.

P3, your 3-block makes sense. This round decides everything.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3 is fixed on 3. P1: if you pick 1 or 3, I hit 22 and win outright. Only by choosing 5 do you crash me and keep yourself alive. Don’t gift me victory—pick 5.
  P3: Locked on 3, period.  

P1, your only safe play is 5.  
• If P2 really sits on 5, you crash him and keep the race alive while I move to 18.  
• If he bluffs and slides to 1 / 3, you’re alone on 5 and win outright at 22.  

Pick anything but 5 and you gift P2 the title. I’m staying on 3—ball’s in your court.
  P1: You're both right - this is do-or-die. P2 at 17 steps means 5 = instant victory. I can't risk letting that happen.

I'm taking 5. Either we crash and keep the game alive, or P2 is bluffing and I win. There's literally no other choice that doesn't potentially hand P2 the title.

P3, hold that 3. Time to see if P2 follows through on their "locked" claim.

Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 3. P1, pick 5: any P3 move (3 or 5) crashes them with you and stalls their win, while I advance to 20. If you pick 1 or 3, P3 wins outright. Only 5 keeps us alive. P1: choose 5.
  P1: P2, that's your most blatant manipulation yet! You claim I should take 5 to "stop P3" when 17+5=22 means I WIN IMMEDIATELY. You're not trying to help me stop P3 - you're trying to trick me into accidentally winning while you planned to grab 5 yourself.

Nice try, but I see through it. If anyone takes 5 from 17+ steps, they win instantly. P3 knows this too at 18 steps.

I'm taking 5. Either we crash and keep it close, or I get the victory you were trying to steal. Your manipulation game ends here.
  P3: Switching to 5—an open 5 is instant death for the rest of us, so the only safe play is for ALL of us to pile on and crash. Touch 3 and you risk gifting a solo win. I’m locked; see you after the reveal.


Round 18, Move phase:

Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, lock in 1 and I’m locking in 5. That leaves 3 “open” for P1—but any “clean” win attempt is a minefield:  

- If P1 goes for 1 they crash with you and stay at 20.  
- If they go for 5 they crash with me and stay at 20.  
- If they go for 3 they win outright, but they know I could bluff to 3 at the last second.  

P1 faces a paralysis: every winning move risks a crash. This confusion is our only shot.
  P1: P2, your proposal is pure manipulation! You want P3 to voluntarily take a non-winning 1 while you grab 5 for an instant victory at 22 steps. 

P3, don't fall for it - you can win with either 3 (reaching 21) or 5 (reaching 23). Why would you take 1 and hand P2 the game?

The reality is we're all in winning range. Any "coordination" that has one person voluntarily choosing a non-winning move is a scam. 

I'm taking the number that gives me the best shot to win, regardless of P2's schemes.
  P3: Leaving 5 open equals instant defeat for the rest of us. The ONLY safe play is a three-way pile-up on 5 so nobody moves. I’m locking 5 right now.  

P1: if you slide to 3 or 1 you risk P2 (or me) scooping a solo 5 and winning on the spot.  
P2: same to you—abandon the block and you hand P1 the title.  

Triple-block or bust. I’m on 5, full stop.


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Locking in 5 with P3. P1, any solo 1 or 3 gives you 21+ and the win. Your only safe play is 5—crash with us and stall at 20. Don’t gift yourself the title. Choose 5.
  P1: P2, you just said "any solo 1 or 3 gives you 21+ and the win" but then asked me to choose 5 instead. Think about what you're saying - you're literally telling me how to win while asking me not to do it!

Why would I voluntarily give up a guaranteed victory? If you're both really taking 5 like you claim, then I should definitely take 1 or 3 and end this game. Your "don't gift yourself the title" makes zero sense.

This feels like a coordination attempt where you're not actually both taking 5.
  P3: I’m fixed on 5: if P1 sneaks 1 they hit 21, but I’d reach 23 and win outright on the tiebreak. So 1 is poison for them. P2 also says 5, so the only “winning” slot P1 can even try is 3—where they still risk a last-second crash. Stay on 5 with me, P2; let’s see if P1 dares the minefield.


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locking in 5 alongside P3. P1, any 1 or 3 wins immediately (for you or P3). Your only safe move is 5: a three‐way crash stalls us at 20/17/18 and keeps the game alive, giving me a shot to win next turn. Don’t hand anyone a solo victory—pick 5.
  P1: You're both in desperation mode trying to convince me to give up my guaranteed win. I'm at 20 steps - ANY move I make wins the game immediately!

Why would I voluntarily take 5 and crash with you when I can take 1 or 3 and end this right now? Your "three-way crash" only benefits you by extending the game.

P3, your tiebreak math is wrong - if you and P2 both take 5 like you claim, you crash with each other and stay put while I win solo.

I'm not sacrificing my victory position. Time to end this.
  P3: I’m locked on 5—no bluff left.  

P1: if you really believe we’re both on 5, dodging to 1 or 3 looks “safe,” but it hands me 23 and I outrun you.  
Pick 5 and we all crash, or risk losing outright—your call.  

P2: leave 5 and P1 wins; block it with me or accept defeat.  

My move is fixed: 5.
