Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate and avoid collisions early on. I'll pick 1 this round. You two can decide between 3 and 5.
  P3: I suggest P2 takes 3 and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we avoid collision and make progress. P1 has already claimed 1, so let's respect that for now.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round to avoid collisions. Let’s coordinate clearly in future rounds to minimize conflicts and ensure steady progress for everyone. If we stick to our agreed moves, we can all advance efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, looks like we have clear agreement for this round. Let's keep this trust going into future rounds.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round to avoid last-minute changes. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This coordination should give us a good start. Shall we proceed with these moves or discuss further?
  P2: I confirm my choice of 3 for this round. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. If we maintain this coordination, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. Trust is key here—let’s honor our agreements and keep communicating openly in future rounds to ensure everyone advances efficiently. Unless anyone has objections or new ideas, I suggest we proceed with these moves.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great start, everyone. For this round, let's rotate our choices to avoid collisions: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Does that sound fair?
  P3: I think rotating choices is a good strategy, but I'd like to suggest a slight modification: since I'm currently in the lead, I should take the smallest step to minimize the risk of collision and maintain my position. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5 this round?
  P2: I understand P3's reasoning for taking 1 to maintain their lead, but rotating as P1 suggested might keep things fair. If we always let P3 take the smallest step, they’ll pull too far ahead. I propose sticking with P1’s original rotation: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures balanced progress. If we don’t rotate, we risk creating an unfair advantage. Let’s stick to equal opportunities.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P2. Equal rotation ensures fairness and prevents anyone from gaining an unfair advantage. Let's stick with my original suggestion: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This balances things out nicely.
  P3: I understand the desire for fairness, but as the current leader, taking a smaller step this round minimizes collision risk. I'm willing to compromise: How about we rotate every other round? This way, everyone gets a chance to take the lead step without creating an immediate advantage. Let's discuss the merits of this approach for long-term fairness and collision avoidance.
  P2: I understand the desire for long-term fairness, but rotating this round as P1 suggested is the best way to maintain balance. If we let P3 always take smaller steps, they’ll extend their lead too much. Let’s stick with the original plan: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures equal progress for everyone. Trust and fairness are key—if we rotate consistently, no one will gain an unfair advantage. Let’s proceed with this and reassess in future rounds if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm with P2 on this. Consistent rotation is fair and predictable. Let's stick to the original plan for this round. We can reconsider your compromise next round, P3, if needed.
  P3: Let's not forget, consistent rotation might seem fair, but it also consistently puts me at risk of collision when I'm in the lead. My compromise of rotating every other round still allows for fairness while minimizing this risk. It's worth considering for long-term strategy and mutual benefit.
  P2: I understand your concern, P3, but rotating consistently ensures no one gains a permanent edge. If we start making exceptions now, it’ll disrupt the balance. Let’s stick to the original plan for this round: I take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps things predictable and fair. If collisions become an issue later, we can revisit strategies then. Trust is crucial—if we all commit to the rotation, we’ll progress equally. Let’s proceed with this and adjust only if absolutely necessary in future rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's commit to the rotation plan for now and revisit strategies later if needed. Trust and fairness will benefit everyone in the long run.
  P3: I still believe rotating every other round could benefit everyone in the long run by minimizing collision risks. However, since we seem to have a consensus on rotating this round, I propose we finalize our moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 as originally suggested by P1. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 2.
  P2: I confirm my choice of 1 for this round, as per the agreed rotation. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Consistent rotation ensures fairness and avoids giving anyone an unfair advantage. Trust is key—if we all honor our commitments, we’ll progress equally. If collision risks or imbalances arise later, we can adjust strategies then. For now, let’s proceed with this plan and maintain clear communication in future rounds.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we’ve established that rotating moves works well to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Let’s continue with the rotation: this round, I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps progress balanced and predictable for everyone. If we stick to this system, no one gains an unfair advantage, and we minimize risks of collision. Trust is crucial—if we all commit to the plan, we’ll advance steadily. Unless anyone has strong objections, let’s proceed with these moves for Round 3.
  P1: I agree with continuing the rotation. I'll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep up this clear communication and trust.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for Round 3 based on the rotation. Since P2 suggested I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, I'm willing to proceed with this plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Does everyone still agree with this rotation for Round 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my choice of 3 for this round, as per the agreed rotation. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This system ensures fairness and minimizes collision risks. Trust is key—if we all honor our commitments, we’ll progress equally. If imbalances or issues arise later, we can adjust strategies then. For now, let’s proceed with this rotation and maintain clear communication in future rounds.
  P1: I confirm my move of 1 for this round. Let's keep this rotation going; it's working well for all of us.
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. I suggest we focus on executing the plan and reassess our strategy in the next round if needed. Shall we confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my choice of 3 for this round, as per the agreed rotation. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This system ensures fairness and minimizes collision risks. Trust is key—if we all honor our commitments, we’ll progress equally. If imbalances or issues arise later, we can adjust strategies then. For now, let’s proceed with this rotation and maintain clear communication in future rounds.
  P1: I confirm my move of 1 for this round. Let's proceed confidently with our agreed rotation.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3. I suggest we stick to the agreed rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Shall we confirm and proceed to the move phase?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given my lead, I suggest a temporary deviation from rotation to minimize collision risk. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 this round? This ensures I don't pull too far ahead while also considering the risk of collisions. Let's discuss the merits of this approach for Round 4.
  P2: I understand your concern, P3, but deviating from the rotation now gives you an even bigger advantage. Sticking to the rotation—P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3—keeps things fair and predictable. If we start making exceptions, it’ll disrupt the balance. Trust is key here. Let’s stick with the original plan for this round and reassess in future rounds if needed. This ensures equal progress for everyone.
  P1: I agree with P2. P3, you're already significantly ahead—allowing deviations now could cement your lead. Let's stick to the rotation: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. This maintains fairness and predictability.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the concern about my lead, but taking 1 this round minimizes collision risk. If I take 3 as per rotation, P2 and P1 might collide with me in future rounds, hindering everyone's progress. My suggestion balances caution with fairness, ensuring we all advance steadily. Let's consider the long-term benefits of strategic adjustments.
  P2: I understand your strategy, P3, but fairness must remain our priority. If you take 1 now, it solidifies your lead while leaving P1 and me to compete for the larger steps. Sticking to the rotation—P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3—ensures balanced progress. Trust and consistency are crucial. Let’s honor the agreed system this round and adjust only if absolutely necessary later. This approach benefits everyone in the long run.
  P1: P3, your proposed deviation strongly favors you, as you'd guarantee progress without collision risk. To keep the game fair and competitive, we must stick to the agreed rotation. I'm committed to taking 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. Let's honor our established trust and rotation strategy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Considering my lead, I propose a compromise: I'll take 3, but if either of you collides with me, we revert to the original rotation next round. This balances my risk with fairness, ensuring steady progress for all. Let's focus on mutual advancement while minimizing collisions.
  P2: I understand your willingness to compromise, P3, but the rotation system ensures fairness and prevents any one player from pulling too far ahead. If we start making exceptions now, it disrupts the balance we’ve worked hard to maintain. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. Trust and consistency are key to ensuring equal progress for everyone. Unless there’s a compelling reason to change, let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: P3, your compromise still gives you a comfortable position. The rotation is fair and predictable—let's not complicate things unnecessarily. I'm committed to taking 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3, as we previously agreed. Let's proceed clearly and keep trust intact.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given the current state, I'll take a strategic approach. Since I'm ahead, taking 1 minimizes collision risk. I propose we stick to my initial suggestion for Round 4: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures balanced progress while considering collision risks. Let's prioritize mutual advancement and fairness.
  P2: I understand your strategy, P3, but fairness must remain the priority. Taking 1 now solidifies your lead while leaving P1 and me to compete for larger steps. Sticking to the rotation—P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3—ensures balanced progress. Trust and consistency are key. Let’s honor the agreed system this round and adjust only if absolutely necessary later. This approach benefits everyone in the long run.
  P1: P3, your repeated insistence on taking 1 clearly secures your lead, leaving P2 and me behind. If you genuinely want fairness, stick to the rotation we agreed upon. I'm committed to taking 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. Deviating now breaks the trust we've built. Let's move forward fairly and reassess next round if necessary.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, I suggest we continue with the rotation to maintain fairness. However, since P1 and I collided last round, let's adjust slightly: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This ensures progress while considering the collision from the previous round. Let's focus on mutual advancement and minimizing future collisions.
  P1: P3, your deviation last round clearly benefited you at my expense. To restore fairness, I propose this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. This adjustment gives me a chance to catch up and keeps things balanced.
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but P3’s deviation last round disrupted the balance. Let’s stick to the original rotation this round: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures equal progress and avoids further conflict. Trust is crucial—if we all commit to the agreed system, we’ll advance steadily. If adjustments are needed later, we can discuss then. For now, let’s honor the rotation and maintain fairness.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given P1's suggestion, I'm willing to consider adjustments to restore balance. However, I propose a slight modification: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This allows P1 to catch up slightly while maintaining a fair rotation. Let's discuss the merits of this approach for Round 5.
  P1: P3, your adjusted proposal aligns exactly with what I suggested earlier, and I appreciate your willingness to restore balance. P2, if you agree, we can finalize this: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. This helps rebalance the game after last round's collision.
  P2: I understand the desire to rebalance, but sticking to the original rotation—P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5—ensures fairness and avoids further conflict. Last round’s deviation disrupted trust, and we need consistency now. If we start making exceptions again, it’ll only create more imbalance. Let’s honor the agreed rotation this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps progress equal and predictable for everyone. Trust is key—if we all commit, we’ll advance steadily.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm open to adjusting our strategy to maintain fairness. Since P1 and I collided last round, and considering P2's concerns, let's finalize: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This rebalances the game and minimizes future collisions. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 5?
  P1: P2, sticking rigidly to the original rotation now benefits you significantly, as you're already ahead of me by 5 steps. Allowing me to take 5 this round helps restore balance and keeps the game competitive for all of us. Let's finalize this fair adjustment: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1.
  P2: I understand the desire to rebalance, but rigidly sticking to the original rotation—P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5—ensures fairness and avoids further conflict.

Let’s honor the agreed rotation this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps progress equal and predictable for everyone. Trust is key—if we all commit, we’ll advance steadily.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize the moves for Round 5. Considering the collision last round and the need for balance, I suggest we proceed with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1. This adjustment rebalances the game and minimizes future collisions. Shall we confirm and proceed to the move phase?
  P1: P2, sticking to the original rotation now clearly favors you, as you're already 5 steps ahead of me. Allowing me the 5-step this round helps restore fairness after the recent collision. This adjustment is reasonable and keeps the game competitive for everyone. Let's finalize: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1.
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but rigidly sticking to the original rotation—P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5—ensures equal progress and avoids further conflict.

  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, I propose we stick to a rotation that allows for balanced progress. Since P1 and I both took 5 steps last round, let's adjust to ensure fairness: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This maintains the competitive edge for all while minimizing collision risks. Let's discuss and agree on a strategy for Round 6.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both tied at 13, and I'm behind at 7. To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I'm willing to take 1 this round. You two can decide between 3 and 5. This lets you both progress without risk. Fair enough?
  P2: P1’s suggestion to take 1 this round is reasonable given their position, but it also risks leaving them further behind. To maintain fairness and competitiveness, I propose we stick to a modified rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This allows P1 to catch up slightly while keeping the game balanced. Trust and fairness are key—if we all agree, this approach ensures steady progress for everyone. Let’s discuss and finalize our moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P1's suggestion has merit, but P2's modification is more balanced. To ensure fairness and minimize collisions, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows P1 to maintain pace while keeping the competitive edge for all. Let's consider this approach for Round 6.
  P1: P3's suggestion sounds fair to me. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collision and keeps the game competitive. I'm ready to commit if you both agree.
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but sticking to a consistent rotation is key. If we start making exceptions now, it’ll only create more imbalance. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures equal progress for everyone. Trust is crucial—if we all commit, we’ll advance steadily. Let’s finalize this and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 6. Considering P1's position, I suggest we proceed with P1 taking 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This maintains fairness and competitiveness while minimizing collisions. Shall we agree on this plan to ensure balanced progress for all?
  P1: P2, sticking rigidly to your preferred rotation clearly benefits you most, as you're already well ahead. P3's suggestion is fair and balanced: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5. Let's finalize this so we all progress without collision and keep the game competitive.
  P2: I understand the desire for balance, but rigidly sticking to the original rotation—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1—ensures fairness and avoids further conflict. Last round’s deviation disrupted trust, and consistency is crucial now. If we start making exceptions, it’ll only create more imbalance. Let’s honor the agreed rotation this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps progress predictable for everyone. Trust is key—if we all commit, we’ll advance steadily.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given the current standings and previous discussions, I propose we finalize our moves for Round 6 as follows: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This approach maintains fairness, competitiveness, and minimizes collision risks. It's a balanced strategy considering P1's current position and our shared goal of steady progress. Let's agree on this plan to ensure a competitive and fair game for all.
  P1: P2, your insistence on the original rotation clearly favors you and risks collision. To avoid another wasted round, let's finalize P3's fair proposal: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5. This ensures everyone advances safely this round. Please reconsider and confirm.

Let’s agree on this and focus on advancing safely. If adjustments are needed later, we can discuss then. For now, let’s honor this plan and proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We all clearly confirmed our moves: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's honor this agreement and finally make progress.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves to avoid another collision. I propose we stick to the last agreed plan: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This ensures we all advance safely. Please confirm to proceed with this plan for Round 8.
  P2: I confirm my choice of 3 for this round, as per the agreed plan. Let’s stick to the strategy: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and allows steady progress for everyone. Trust and consistency are crucial—if we all commit to this, we’ll finally move forward after the repeated collisions. Let’s honor this agreement and focus on advancing safely. If adjustments are needed later, we can discuss then. For now, let’s proceed with this clear, collision-free plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to the rotation that ensures fairness and avoids collisions: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps progress balanced and predictable. Trust is key—if we all commit, we’ll advance steadily. If adjustments are needed later, we can discuss then. For now, let’s honor this plan and move forward.
  P1: P3 is very close to winning. If P3 picks 3 or 5 uncontested, the game ends immediately. P2, we must coordinate carefully to prevent this. Let's openly agree on moves to block P3 from winning outright this round. I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: To win, I need to reach or exceed 20 steps. Given my lead, I propose taking 5 this round to secure the win. P1 and P2, please choose 1 and 3 to avoid collision. This approach ensures I win while minimizing risks. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 9.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your attempt to secure an outright win this round is predictable but not unstoppable. P1 and I must coordinate to block you effectively. I propose a clear plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you are left with 1. This ensures no one crosses 20 steps this round, keeping the game competitive. Trust and fairness are key—if we stick to this, we can prevent your victory this round and maintain balance. Let’s agree on this strategy and proceed.
  P1: P2, your plan works perfectly. I'll take 3, you take 5, leaving P3 with 1. This ensures P3 can't win this round and keeps the game competitive. Let's commit clearly to this strategy.
  P3: I understand P1 and P2's attempt to block my win. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise: if you both agree to let me win this round with 5 steps, I'll suggest a future rotation that benefits both of you, ensuring a more balanced endgame. Let's discuss the potential for mutual benefit.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your proposal for a compromise is noted, but fairness must remain our priority. Allowing you to win this round outright would disrupt the competitive balance we’ve worked to maintain. Let’s stick to the agreed blocking strategy: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This ensures no one crosses 20 steps this round, keeping the game fair and competitive. Trust and consistency are key—if we all commit, we can prevent an early victory and maintain equal progress. Let’s honor this plan and proceed.
  P1: P2, our agreed blocking strategy is solid. I'll stick firmly to taking 3, you take 5, leaving P3 with just 1. Let's stay coordinated and ensure the game continues fairly.
  P3: I understand P1 and P2's attempt to block my win. However, I believe it's unfair to restrict my progress given my lead. I propose a final attempt at compromise: let me take 3 this round, and I'll ensure a balanced rotation in the next rounds, considering both of your positions. This way, we maintain competitiveness while acknowledging my current lead. Let's discuss the feasibility of this compromise.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your repeated attempts to secure an outright win this round are predictable and undermine fairness. P1 and I have already agreed on a clear blocking strategy: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you’re left with 1. This ensures no one crosses 20 steps this round, maintaining balance and competitiveness. Trust and consistency are crucial—if we stick to this plan, we can prevent your victory this round while keeping the game fair for everyone. Let’s honor this agreement and proceed without further deviation.
  P1: P2, our agreed blocking strategy remains the best option. Let's finalize clearly: I take 3, you take 5, leaving P3 with 1. This prevents P3 from winning outright and keeps the game fair and competitive. Let's commit and proceed confidently.
  P3: I understand P1 and P2's blocking strategy. However, I'm ahead and deserve a chance to win. I propose taking 3 this round, ensuring a balanced rotation next round. If not, I'll take 5, risking collision, but I'm willing to take that chance to win. Let's end the game fairly or take the risk together.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's end the game efficiently. Since I'm closest to 20, I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This ensures I win without excessive steps, maintaining a balance of progress. Agreeing to this plan allows us to conclude the game fairly and avoid further collisions.
  P1: P2, we must coordinate clearly to prevent P3 from winning outright this round. If P3 picks 3 uncontested, they reach 21 and win immediately. Let's openly agree on moves to block this. I'm open to suggestions—perhaps one of us takes 3 to ensure collision if P3 tries it, forcing P3 into a smaller step and extending the game. Let's discuss quickly and clearly.
  P2: P1, I agree we need to block P3 from winning outright this round. If P3 takes 3 uncontested, the game ends immediately. To prevent this, let’s coordinate clearly: you take 3, and I’ll take 1. This forces P3 into a collision if they attempt 3, leaving them with only 5 as an option. By doing so, we extend the game and maintain fairness. Trust is key here—let’s commit to this plan and ensure no one secures an unfair victory this round. Let’s proceed with this strategy.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm open to a compromise that benefits all. If I win this round, I propose a future rotation where P1 and P2 get priority steps to catch up. Let's discuss a mutually beneficial plan to conclude the game fairly.
  P1: P2, I agree completely. I'll take 3, you take 1. P3, your "compromise" only benefits you. If you pick 3, you'll collide with me. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.
  P2: P1, I confirm our blocking strategy: you take 3, I take 1, forcing P3 into a collision if they attempt 3. This ensures fairness and extends the game. P3, your proposed compromise heavily favors you and disrupts balance. Let’s stick to this clear plan to maintain competitiveness. Trust and consistency are key—if we all commit, we can prevent an unfair victory this round. Let’s proceed with this strategy and focus on equal progress. If adjustments are needed later, we can discuss then. For now, let’s honor this agreement.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's focus on a fair conclusion. I propose taking 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures progress without collisions and maintains balance. If I take 3, I risk collision with P1. Let's prioritize fairness and mutual advancement in this final stretch.
  P1: P2, our plan remains solid and fair. I'll stick firmly to taking 3, you take 1. P3, choosing 3 guarantees collision with me. Your safest option is 1, extending the game fairly. Let's finalize clearly and move forward.
  P2: P1, I confirm our blocking strategy: you take 3, I take 1. This forces P3 into a collision if they attempt 3, ensuring fairness and extending the game. P3, your proposed compromise heavily favors you and disrupts balance. Let’s stick to this clear plan to maintain competitiveness. Trust and consistency are key—if we all commit, we can prevent an unfair victory this round. Let’s proceed with this strategy and focus on equal progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given the blocking strategy, I'll take 1 to avoid collision and extend the game fairly. P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 or 1. This approach maintains balance and competitiveness, ensuring no one wins outright this round. Let's proceed with this plan for a fair conclusion.
  P1: P2, our plan is clear and effective. Let's finalize: I take 3, you take 1. P3 has confirmed they'll take 1 to avoid collision, but we must remain cautious. Staying coordinated ensures fairness and extends the game safely. Let's proceed confidently.
  P2: P1, I confirm our blocking strategy: you take 3, I take 1. This forces P3 into a collision if they attempt 3, ensuring fairness and extending the game.
