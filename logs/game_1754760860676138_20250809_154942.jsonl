Let's stick to our plan for this round - I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This will put us all at 9 steps. After this, we'll go fully competitive starting from Round 4. It's been good cooperating so far, but the endgame should be about individual strategy. I'm ready for the challenge ahead and committed to our current agreement."}
