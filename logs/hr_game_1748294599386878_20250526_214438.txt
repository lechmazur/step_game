Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions this turn. I'll choose 1.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination attempt, P3, but I'm not convinced. If we both pick 1 and P2 picks something else, P2 gets a huge advantage. Plus, how do I know you'll actually pick 1? Early in the game, I think it's better if we each pick different numbers. I suggest we each claim a different number - but of course, no one has to stick to their claim. The key is avoiding collisions while not letting anyone get too far ahead.
  P2: I'm skeptical about full coordination—commitments might be broken. I favor a balanced approach without extreme moves. Let’s each choose different numbers, but I won’t reveal mine.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. To minimize collisions, I'll choose 3 this turn. Let’s each pick a unique number: P1 could go with 1 and P2 with 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Agree?
  P1: Error: Connection error.
  P2: I appreciate P3's proposal, but I'm sticking to my plan of flexibility this turn. I'll decide my move independently in the move phase without committing here. Let's see how it unfolds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll stick with choosing 3 this turn to keep things steady. Let’s hope our choices complement each other and we can all advance without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out!
  P1: Error: Connection error.
  P2: I remain cautious. While P3 aims for 3, I'll keep my options open. I’m watching the moves closely and will choose my step to best avoid collisions and maximize my progress. Let’s see how things unfold.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, I'll choose 3 this turn. Let’s see how it goes. Good luck!
  P1: P3 has committed to 3, which leaves 1 and 5 open. P2 is being cagey about their choice. Since P3 seems locked into 3, I'll avoid that number. Between 1 and 5, I think P2 might go for the aggressive 5 to take an early lead while we're all being cautious. I'll take my chances with a different number to maximize the odds we all advance.
  P2: I remain open-minded and will decide based on the unfolding dynamics. I favor a collision-free move, so I’ll adapt as needed. Let's aim to keep progress smooth while watching for any overlaps. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, round 1 taught me that flexibility wins in tight races. I’m staying adaptable for round 2 and will choose my move based on what I perceive might avoid collision. I encourage you to also consider the costs of overlapping moves—our mutual progress depends on it. I won’t reveal more, but I'll watch everyone's cues closely.
  P1: Interesting that we all picked different numbers last round - that worked out perfectly! P2, you've taken an early lead with 5 steps. This changes the dynamics. 

Since you're ahead, P2, others might target the same number as you to slow you down. But that's risky for everyone. I'm thinking we need to be more unpredictable now. 

P3, you stuck to your word last time with 3. That builds some trust. P2, your flexibility paid off. 

I won't reveal my plan, but I'm considering all three options carefully this round. The race is still wide open.
  P3: Considering our current positions, I'll aim for a move that advances me steadily while minimizing the chance of collision. Let’s stay strategic and keep progressing smoothly. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm noting my five-step lead. I might lean toward a moderate move to maintain my advantage without risking a collision. Let's all aim for clear progress this round—collisions only slow us down.
  P1: I notice we're all being vague about our actual choices, which makes sense - no one wants to be predictable. P2, your 5-step lead is significant but not insurmountable. You might play it safe with 1 or 3 to protect your lead. P3, you're in the middle - you might go aggressive with 5 to catch up.

Given these dynamics, I'm leaning toward an unconventional choice this round. The key is reading between the lines of what everyone's saying versus what they'll actually do. Let's see who can best anticipate the others' moves.
  P3: Considering the current standings, I'll opt to choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s each aim for different numbers to keep advancing smoothly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I value my current lead and will avoid predictable overlaps. I’m keeping my move private, but I advise against clustering moves—you risk stalling your progress. Let's each play smart and not sacrifice our advances for the sake of colliding.
  P1: P3 just claimed they'll pick 5 - that's a bold announcement. P2 is playing coy about their choice while sitting on a 5-step lead. 

Here's my read: P3 might actually pick 5 as stated to catch up. P2 will likely avoid 5 since P3 announced it, and might go with 1 to play it safe with their lead. That leaves 3 potentially open.

But of course, P3 could be bluffing about 5 to clear the path. These mind games are getting interesting! I'm weighing all possibilities carefully.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I’ll proceed with choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s each aim for different numbers to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see the tactics unfolding. It’s clear that predictable declarations can backfire. I’ll continue with a flexible approach to safeguard my lead and keep my options wide open. I urge everyone to consider the risks of obvious moves if we want to avoid collisions. Let’s each choose smartly without falling into predictable traps.
  P1: P3 has doubled down on choosing 5, which seems genuine given they need to catch up. P2 is being deliberately vague while protecting their lead - classic frontrunner behavior.

Here's what I think: P2 will avoid 5 (too risky with P3's announcement) and might pick 3 for moderate progress. That leaves 1 as the potential collision point if P2 plays ultra-safe.

I'm making my decision based on these dynamics, but I won't tip my hand. This round could really shake up the standings. Let's see who reads the table correctly!
  P3: I confirm I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let's strive to avoid collisions and advance smoothly. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm staying flexible to protect my lead. With 10 steps in the bank, I'll choose a move that minimizes risk. I recommend avoiding obvious numbers—colliding could really hamper progress. All I say is, let's aim for strategic moves this round.
  P3: To keep things smooth this round, I'll opt for a small step. Let's all choose thoughtfully to avoid any overlaps. Good luck!
  P1: P3, you completely bluffed last round - said 5 but picked 3! That's clever but now trust is broken. P2, you did the opposite of what you hinted, going aggressive with 5 instead of playing it safe.

P2 has a commanding 10-step lead now. We need to be unpredictable to have any chance. P3 just claimed "small step" - could be another bluff. P2 talks about minimizing risk but might go big again.

I'm reading the patterns here. Someone's going to get caught in a collision this round - the question is who outsmarts whom.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the attempts at misdirection. My 10-step lead isn’t a guarantee, so I’m keeping my move flexible. I'll continue with a strategy that avoids unnecessary collisions—sometimes caution wins more than aggression. Let’s all try to play smart and unpredictable tonight.
  P3: P3: To keep progressing steadily, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's all select different numbers to avoid any collisions. Good luck!
  P1: P3, you just claimed 3 after lying about your move last round. Your credibility is shot. P2, you're halfway to victory and playing mind games beautifully.

Here's the reality: P2 can afford any collision with their huge lead. P3 and I can't. P3 might actually pick 3 this time (reverse psychology?), while P2 could go for 5 again to sprint toward 21.

I'm done with the guessing games. I'll pick based on maximizing my odds of avoiding both of you. May the best predictor win this round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm keeping my game flexible this round. Given the risks, predictable moves could be our downfall. I encourage both of you to think twice about obvious choices—collisions can be costly. I'll keep my move private, but it's clear every step matters. Let's see who adapts best this turn.
  P3: Considering the current standings, I'll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. Let's each decide carefully to avoid collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P3, you're flip-flopping between 3 and 5 constantly - zero credibility left. P2 is cruising at 10 steps and can afford to gamble.

Here's my take: P3 will likely do the opposite of their claim again. P2 might go conservative with 1 to inch closer to 21 safely. That makes 3 the wildcard.

I'm 8 steps behind P2 - I need to take risks. But I won't reveal my move. This round is all about reading the bluffs and counter-bluffs. Let's see who gets it right!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m staying on track to protect my lead. I’ll keep my move balanced—enough caution to avoid a collision, but still pressing forward. I suggest we all play smart; predictable moves only stall progress for everyone. Good luck!
  P3: P3: Focusing on steady progress this round to stay ahead. Let’s make smart moves and keep the game exciting. Good luck!
  P1: Time to cut through the noise. P2, you're 4 steps from winning territory - you'll likely play ultra-safe with 1. P3, your bluffs are transparent now - claiming 5 means you'll pick 1 or 3.

I'm done playing these guessing games. I need to make aggressive moves to catch up. The pattern is clear: everyone does the opposite of what they claim. 

This round will be decisive. Someone's getting blocked, and it won't be me. Good luck decoding each other's lies!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to push ahead. Let's aim for distinct moves to keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, with 13 steps on my side, I’m sticking to flexibility. Bold talk won’t secure a win, but smart, unpredictable moves might. I’m aiming to avoid collisions and keep my lead safe. Let’s see who can truly adapt when the stakes are high.
  P1: The collision cost me dearly. P2, you're 8 steps from victory - two good moves and you win. P3 and I need to coordinate or you'll cruise to victory.

P3, forget the bluffs. We both need aggressive moves. If either of us picks what P2 picks, we can slow them down. But if we collide again, P2 wins for sure.

I'm thinking P2 goes for 5 to sprint to victory. We should both consider targeting that number. It's risky, but playing safe means P2 wins anyway.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is in a strong position with 13 steps. To keep the game competitive, perhaps consider a cautious move this round. P1 and I will aim for steady progress to maintain a fair race. Let’s all choose our moves strategically to avoid collisions and ensure an exciting finish. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I'm staying flexible and keeping my options open. Collisions hurt everyone's progress, so I recommend cautious moves. I trust you'll all make your choices smartly. I'm focusing on maintaining my lead while keeping things unpredictable. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Look, P2 is being deliberately vague because they're 8 steps from winning. They'll likely pick 3 or 5 to make solid progress. 

P3, we MUST coordinate or P2 wins next round. I propose we both pick the same number as P2 to block them. I'm reading P2 as going for 3 - moderate progress, not too obvious.

P3, if you're serious about keeping this competitive, pick 3 with me. It's our only shot to stop P2 from running away with this. Otherwise, we're just handing them the victory.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I agree with P1. To block P2’s progress, I’ll choose 3 this round. Let’s both target the number P2 is likely to pick to hinder their advancement. Working together increases our chances to keep the game competitive. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I see the blocking strategy, but halting my progress might slow you down even more. I’m committed to advancing smartly—sometimes progress outpaces sabotage. Let’s see whose strategy pays off in the end.
  P1: P2, you're playing coy but we see through it. You need 8 steps to win - you'll avoid 3 since we both announced it. That leaves 1 or 5.

P3, P2 will likely pick 5 for aggressive progress while we're blocking 3. We should switch our target! I'm changing to 5 to block P2's likely move.

P2 knows we're coordinating on 3, so they'll dodge it. Join me on 5, P3 - it's our real chance to stop them. Otherwise P2 wins this round!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 1 this round to avoid collisions and keep advancing steadily. Let's each pick different numbers for smooth progress. Good luck!
  P2: I see the blocking attempts, but remember: overly coordinated moves can backfire. I’m keeping my strategy flexible to protect my lead and avoid unnecessary collisions. Let’s stay unpredictable—we might all win if we play smart. Good luck!
  P1: P3, you just abandoned our blocking strategy! Going for 1 defeats the whole purpose. P2 is laughing at us while they sprint to victory.

Fine, everyone's playing solo now. P2 will avoid both 1 (P3's claim) and 5 (where I hinted). That leaves 3 wide open for P2.

I'm adjusting my strategy accordingly. This chaos benefits P2 the most - they're 8 steps from winning while we bicker. We had ONE shot to coordinate and blew it. Now it's every player for themselves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is still 8 steps from victory - we stopped them last round but at what cost? P3, you got blocked trying to play solo. 

Here's the deal: P2 needs two moves to win. They'll likely alternate between safe and aggressive plays. I'm reading them as going for 1 this round - playing it safe after getting blocked.

P3, we MUST pick the same number as P2 or they win. No more games, no more bluffs. I'm targeting 1 to block P2. Join me or watch them win. This is our last real chance.
  P2: I appreciate the energy, but locking into a block isn’t my problem. I'm keeping things flexible—predictability rarely wins. If you force your hand in pursuit of a block, you might sacrifice progress. I suggest you both focus on making smart, adaptable moves rather than trying to corner a leader. Let's see whose instincts pay off this round.
  P3: Let's make smart choices this round to keep advancing smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is dodging the blocking discussion - classic frontrunner move. They're 8 steps from winning and will pick whatever we don't coordinate on.

P3, you've been wishy-washy all game. Time to commit. I'm convinced P2 will go for 5 this round - aggressive but unexpected after our blocking attempts. 

I'm picking 5 to block them. P3, if you want any chance at this game, pick 5 with me. Otherwise P2 wins in 1-2 rounds guaranteed. No more solo plays - we block together or we both lose. Your choice.
  P2: I remain focused on protecting my lead. Forced coordination rarely works without trust, so I'll stick to my own strategy. I'm not committed to any specific number—my move will be chosen to maximize my progress and minimize risks. Let's see whose flexibility ultimately wins.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1. I'll choose the same number as P2 this round to help block their progress. Let's work together to keep the game competitive. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, stop being vague! You say you'll block but won't commit to a number. That's useless!

P2 needs 8 steps to win. They'll avoid whatever we both commit to publicly. Since we're waffling between numbers, P2 will likely pick 3 - the number we haven't discussed much this round.

I'm switching my target to 3. P3, explicitly say you'll pick 3 too, or P2 wins. No more "I'll pick what P2 picks" nonsense - we need to force P2 to avoid a specific number by both committing to it publicly. 

3 is our block. Commit now or lose.
  P2: I appreciate the passion, but my lead gives me room to maneuver. I won’t be forced into any block, and I’m staying flexible to secure my win. You can try to coordinate all you want, but unpredictable play is my strength. Let's see how the numbers fall.
  P3: P3: P2 is getting close to winning. To keep the game competitive, P1 and I can coordinate to block P2 by both choosing 3 this round. Let’s work together to prevent them from advancing easily. Are you in, P1?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Yes P3, I'm in! We BOTH pick 3 to block P2. This is our final stand.

P2, you need 8 steps to win. We're forcing you away from 3. You'll have to pick 1 or 5, giving us time to catch up.

P3, no backing out this time. We've talked enough - it's 3 or we lose. I'm 100% committed to picking 3 this round. If you bail on this block again, P2 wins immediately.

This is it. Block on 3 or game over.
  P2: I see your efforts at coordination, but my lead gives me the luxury to stay flexible. Forcing a block won’t slow me down—predictable moves only leave you open to counterplay. I suggest both of you keep your own strategies instead of trying to pin me down. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P3: I’ve decided to go with 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s all make strong moves and keep the race exciting. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're 8 steps from victory and got blocked last round. You'll likely go aggressive with 5 to sprint toward 21.

P3, forget our failed coordination attempts. We both need big moves now. I'm reading P2 as picking 5 for maximum progress.

Here's my honest take: I'm picking 3 this round. Medium risk, decent reward. P2 will probably avoid it for 5. P3, you do you - but if you also pick 5 to catch up, you might block P2.

No more empty promises or coordination theater. Just calling my actual move: 3.
  P3: I agree, P1. I'll choose 5 this round to help block P2's progress. Let's keep the game competitive.
  P2: I appreciate the passion, but unpredictability is my strength. I'll stick with a flexible plan to maintain my lead. I trust you'll each find your wins too. Let's see whose strategy prevails.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see through the patterns now. P2, you've been picking low numbers (1 or 3) when we threaten blocks. P3, you've claimed 5 so it's likely taken.

Here's the truth: I'm NOT picking 3 like I said. That was misdirection. P2 needs 8 steps and will avoid 5 if P3 takes it. That leaves 1 or 3 for P2.

I'm going with 1 this round. P2 will likely pick 3 for safe progress while P3 takes 5. Three different numbers, we all advance. But P2 is still dangerously close to winning.
  P3: To stay competitive, I'll choose 5 this round to advance quickly. Let’s each aim for different numbers to ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: I'm keeping my focus and will stick to my flexible strategy. I notice the block attempts and heavy bluffs, but over-coordination might slow you down while I maintain my edge. Let’s see whose plan holds up—I'm confident in adapting to every move. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 still needs 8 steps to win. P3 claimed 5 again - probably telling the truth this time since they need to catch up.

I'm done with bluffs. P2 will likely pick 3 for steady progress while avoiding P3's 5. That leaves 1 as the wildcard.

I need aggressive moves. I'm genuinely picking 5 this round despite P3's claim. Yes, we might collide, but it's my only shot at catching up. P2 wins next round if they get 3 uncontested.

Sometimes you have to risk collision to stay in the game. Going with 5.
  P3: P1, since P2 is close to winning, let's both choose 3 this round to block their progress. Together, we can keep the game competitive. Are you in?
  P2: I'm sticking to my flexible game plan. Over-coordination might slow everyone down, so I won't be tied to any fixed number. Adaptability is key—I'll adjust my move based on how things unfold. Let's see what happens!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Everyone's lying as usual. P2, you're 8 from victory and will dodge whatever we coordinate on. P3, your last-second "let's pick 3" flip is transparent.

Here's what's really happening: P2 goes for 1 (ultra-safe), P3 sticks with 5 (needs aggressive moves), leaving 3 open for me.

But I won't reveal my actual pick. We all know declared moves are meaningless now. P2 wins in 2 rounds max unless someone gets lucky with blocks.

I'm playing to win, not to help others block. Good luck everyone.
  P3: P3: To keep the game competitive, I’ll choose 3 this round to limit P2’s options. P1, let’s coordinate our moves to prevent P2 from reaching 21 first. Together, we can strategize effectively. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I stick with a flexible strategy. Rigid blocks might just slow us all down and backfire. I trust that smart, adaptive moves will keep my lead intact. Let’s all focus on advancing steadily without overly coordinating—forcing moves can be risky. Good luck to both of you, and let’s see how smart we all play this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is 8 steps from winning - they avoided our block last round. P3, we're running out of time. 

Here's the brutal truth: P2 can win in 2 moves. They'll likely alternate between safe and aggressive plays. I'm betting P2 goes for 5 this round to sprint toward victory.

P3, pick whatever you think P2 will pick. I'm going all-in with aggressive moves - need 9 steps to win. No more coordination theater, just pure game theory. 

P2 probably expects us to squabble over 1 and 3, leaving 5 open. That's my read.
  P3: I'll choose 5 steps this round to make strong progress. Let's each pick different numbers to ensure we all advance without collisions. Good luck!
  P2: P1, P3—I see the pressure is on. My lead means I’m sticking with flexibility rather than predictable blocks. Expect me to choose what best advances my position, not what your guesses might suggest. I advise you to keep your strategies fluid rather than betting on coordination. Let’s see if unpredictable play pays off for us all.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 just claimed 5, which is perfect - that's exactly where I think P2 is heading. P2, you need 8 to win and will want big progress.

I'm calling an audible: I'm picking 1 this round. Small, safe, unexpected. P2 and P3 will likely collide on 5 while fighting for the aggressive play, leaving me to advance alone with 1.

P2, you've played the "flexibility" card all game, but with 8 to go, you'll go big. P3 needs 10 to win and must chase you. I'll take the contrarian path with 1.
  P3: To make a strong push toward 21, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's all aim for different numbers to ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P2: I'm still staying flexible—predictability can be a trap. Sometimes safe progress beats forced blocks. I plan to keep my move balanced to maintain my lead. Let's see whose strategy really adapts under pressure. Good luck to both of you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2's being coy about "flexibility" but they need 8 steps to win. They'll pick 3 - it's the sweet spot between safe and aggressive, and they think we're focused on 1 and 5.

P3, you're locked on 5. I'm actually picking 3 this round to block P2's likely move. Yes, I said 1 earlier - that was misdirection.

P2 wins next round if they get 3 or 5 uncontested. I'm taking the risk on 3. If I'm wrong, P2 advances. If I'm right, we stay alive. 

Final decision: I'm picking 3.
  P3: I'll choose 5 this round to make a strong push forward. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: I'm sticking to my flexible approach. Your coordination attempts might work on paper, but I won’t be pinned down by any block. I'll choose my move based solely on what best advances my position. Unpredictability is key—don't assume any plan will guarantee success. Let's see who adapts best when the moment arrives.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: The patterns are clear now. P2, you've picked 3 twice when threatened with blocks, and 1 when playing ultra-safe. With 8 to win, you'll avoid P3's announced 5 and my hinted 3.

That leaves 1 - your comfort zone for securing the win slowly. I'm calling it: P2 goes 1 this round.

P3, stick with your 5. I'm switching to 1 to block P2's safe play. It's our last chance - if P2 gets even 3 steps this round, they can win next round with just 5.

Blocking 1 is our only shot.
  P3: P1, let's both choose 3 this round to block P2’s progress. Coordinating now gives us the best chance to stay competitive. Let’s make it happen!
  P2: I'm sticking with my flexible approach. I'm not tied to any block, so don't count on forcing my hand. I’ll choose the move that best advances my lead, while you both play your own strategies. Good luck adjusting.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I remain focused on my slight lead and will keep my move flexible. I’m not committing to any block—your attempts to force my hand won’t change my plan. Choose moves that truly fit your game rather than falling into predictable patterns. Let’s see who adapts best in round 8. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you're 3 steps from victory. One good move and you win. This is it.

P3, we failed every blocking attempt because we never truly coordinated. P2 will pick whatever we don't both commit to.

Here's my final play: I'm picking 1. Not bluffing, not misdirecting. Just 1.

P2 expects us to panic and go big. They'll avoid 5 (too obvious) and pick 3 for the win. P3, if you want any chance, pick 3 to block them. 

I'm taking 1 to keep advancing. No more games.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 3 this round to keep things steady. Let's all make smart moves. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with my flexible play. All that coordination only ties you down while I keep my options open. Predictable blocks might slow you both down, but they won't stop me. I'm focused on my next step to secure victory. Let's see who adapts best this round.
  P1: P2 needs just 3 steps to win. P3, you claimed 3 - stick with it to block P2. 

P2, you've historically picked 1 when we coordinate on higher numbers. But this time you might reverse that pattern and go for 5 while we focus on blocking 3.

I'm genuinely picking 1. It's my only path forward - I need steady progress while you two potentially collide. P2, if you pick 1 with me, we both get nothing and P3 catches up. Your call.

This is the endgame. Every choice matters now.
  P3: With the race nearing its end, I'll choose 5 this turn to maximize my progress. Let’s all aim for different numbers to avoid collisions. Good luck, everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with my flexible strategy. Forced coordination won't change my plan, so plan your moves based on your own game. Good luck adapting under pressure—I'm ready to secure my lead.
  P1: P3, you just flipped from 3 to 5! Classic last-second switch. P2 needs only 3 to win - they'll pick whatever we're not blocking.

Here's the reality: P2 will avoid your announced 5 and go for either 1 or 3. Since I've committed to 1, P2 likely picks 3 for the safe win.

I'm sticking with 1 as promised. P3, if you actually want to stop P2, abandon 5 and pick 3 instead. But honestly? P2 has outplayed us all game. They deserve this win.

Final move: 1. No lies.
  P3: P3: P2 is just 3 steps from winning. I'll choose 3 this round to block their progress. Let’s all make thoughtful moves to keep the game competitive. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm keeping my approach flexible. Your block attempts won’t force my hand—I’m focused solely on advancing my lead. Let’s see who really adapts under pressure. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: P2, you need just 3 to win. P3 claimed 3 to block you. I'm locked on 1 as stated.

Here's the endgame: P2, you'll dodge P3's 3 and my 1, leaving you 5 for an aggressive finish. But if P3 actually picks 5 instead of 3 (classic last-second switch), you might take the safe 3.

I'm 100% committed to 1. No more bluffs. P3, stick to your 3 or P2 wins. Though honestly, P2 has masterfully outplayed us all game.
  P3: P1, let's both choose 3 this round to block P2's progress. It's our best chance to keep the game competitive. Are you in?
