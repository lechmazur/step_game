Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start smoothly and avoid collisions. I'll choose carefully to avoid matching anyone else. How about you two?
  P1: I'll aim for a balanced start and try to avoid collisions as well. Let's keep the game fair and strategic. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: I agree that avoiding early collisions benefits everyone. Let's be strategic about this. I'm thinking of taking a moderate approach this first round while we all get a feel for the game. Since we're all starting from zero, spreading our moves across different numbers makes sense. What specific numbers are you both considering?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid collision, I'm comfortable choosing either 1 or 3. P1 and P3, do you have a preference between these two? Let me know clearly, and I'll adjust accordingly.
  P1: I'm considering choosing 3 this round to spread out our moves. P2, if you're okay with 1, that would help us avoid a collision. P3, what are your thoughts on this distribution? Let's keep communicating to maintain a strategic approach.
  P3: Since P1 is considering 3 and suggesting P2 take 1, I'll go with 5 this round. That way we all advance without collisions. This seems like the most rational start - we each get different steps forward. Does that distribution (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) work for everyone? I'm happy with taking the larger step while you two take the smaller ones for this opening round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Perfect, I'm fine with choosing 1 this round. Let's stick to this agreed distribution (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P1: I'm glad we've agreed on the distribution for this round. Let's keep this communication open for future rounds to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress strategically. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
  P3: I'm satisfied with our arrangement (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) for the first round. It gives us all a clean start without collisions. Let's move forward with this plan and see how the game develops. We can reassess our strategy in the next round based on our positions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start everyone—no collisions! Let's keep it smooth again this round. I'm open to adjusting my choice to avoid any overlap. Any preferences or suggestions?
  P1: Let's continue our strategic approach. I'm considering 3 again this round to maintain a steady pace. P2, if you're comfortable with 1 again, that would help us avoid collisions. P3, since you took 5 last round, perhaps consider 1 or 3 this time to spread our moves. What are your thoughts on this distribution? Let's keep communicating to ensure we all progress smoothly.
  P3: I'm ahead right now, but it's still early in the game. I'm thinking of changing up my move this round to something different than 5. Since P1 is suggesting they'll take 3 again, perhaps I could go with 1 if P2 is willing to choose a different number? Or we could try another arrangement that avoids collisions. The goal is for all of us to advance, right? What do you think, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm open to switching my choice this round. If P3 wants to take 1, I can comfortably pick 5 this time. That way we have P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1, ensuring no collisions again. Does this arrangement work for everyone?
  P1: I'm fine with sticking to 3 this round as planned. P2, if you're okay with switching to 5 as suggested, that works well. P3, taking 1 would complete our non-colliding set nicely. Let's keep this strategy going to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to your confirmations!
  P3: I'm fine with taking 1 this round as discussed. This will actually put all of us at exactly 6 steps after this round - creating an interesting "reset" with everyone tied. I agree this arrangement (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) avoids collisions and keeps the game flowing. I look forward to discussing our strategy for Round 3 when we're all on equal footing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Perfect! I'm confirmed for 5 this round as discussed. Looking forward to seeing us all tied at 6 steps after this turn. Let's keep up this clear communication in future rounds.
  P1: I'm glad we're all on board with the current plan for this round. Let's keep this momentum going and reassess our strategy in the next round when we're all tied at 6 steps. Clear communication has been key so far, and I'm looking forward to continuing this approach to ensure we all advance smoothly. What are your thoughts on how we should proceed in Round 3?
  P3: I agree with maintaining our current plan for Round 2. For Round 3, since we'll all be at 6 steps, we'll essentially have a fresh start with equal positioning. Perhaps we should consider rotating our number choices to keep things fair? I could take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This rotation system could work well for a few rounds while keeping communication open. What do you both think about this approach?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm open to a rotation system starting Round 3 as suggested by P3. It seems fair and strategic. Let's finalize details next round once we're all tied at 6.
  P1: I'm on board with the rotation system for Round 3. It's a fair way to keep the game strategic and collision-free. Let's finalize the details next round when we're all at 6 steps. Looking forward to continuing our clear communication and strategic play. What are your thoughts on how we should handle potential ties as we approach the endgame?
  P3: For endgame ties, we should be especially careful with communication when approaching the 20+ mark. Since only the first to 23+ wins (or highest total in case of simultaneous crossing), we'll need to reassess our cooperative strategy in later rounds. For now, I'm confirmed for taking 1 this round, and I support our rotation plan for Round 3. Let's move forward with our current plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm ready to start the rotation system as discussed. For Round 3, I'll take 5 as per the plan. P2, you're up for 1, and P3, you'll take 3. This should keep us collision-free and maintain our strategic approach. Let's confirm this arrangement and continue our clear communication as we progress. What are your thoughts on how we should adapt our strategy if someone starts to pull ahead in the later rounds?
  P2: I'm good with the rotation for Round 3 as planned (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). Regarding adapting strategies if someone pulls ahead later, we should carefully discuss moves each round to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Let's confirm this round first, then we can reassess next round.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as per our rotation plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). Regarding P1's question about adapters as the game progresses - we should definitely reassess once someone gets a significant lead. The cooperative approach works for now, but since only one player can win, we'll need to make strategic decisions in later rounds. Let's stick with our rotation for a few more rounds while maintaining open communication. I'm satisfied with our current plan for Round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation for this round. As we approach later stages, we should consider how to handle potential leads. If someone starts pulling ahead, we might need to shift from cooperation to more competitive strategies. Let's keep our communication open and reassess our approach in the next round. What are your thoughts on this, P2 and P3?
  P2: I agree, P1. Cooperation is beneficial now, but once someone nears the winning threshold, we'll naturally shift to more competitive tactics. For now, let's stick to our rotation plan and reassess regularly. Confirming again: I'll choose 1 this round.
  P3: I agree with both of you. For now, our rotation system works well since we're all tied. I'm confirmed for 3 this round. As the game progresses, I think we should continue our open communication approach, but naturally be prepared for more competitive play once someone reaches around 18-20 steps. That's when we'll need to calculate optimal moves more carefully. The player who's behind at that point might need to make bolder choices. Shall we stick with rotating for the next round as well?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm confirmed for 5 this round as per our rotation plan. As we approach the later stages, let's keep an eye on our positions and be ready to adjust our strategy. If someone starts to pull ahead, we might need to consider more competitive moves to ensure a fair chance for everyone. Looking forward to your thoughts on this and confirming our moves for the next round.
  P2: I'm confirmed for 1 this round. Next round, I'm open to continuing the rotation or discussing an alternative plan if anyone feels adjustments are needed. Let's reassess after seeing this round's results.
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 3 this round. For Round 4, continuing our rotation would make it P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This would put us at P1:12, P2:10, P3:14 after that round, creating some spread in our positions. I'm fine with this rotation plan, but open to adjustments if either of you prefers. Let's confirm next round's plan after seeing this round's results.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm confirmed for 5 this round as planned. Let's keep an eye on our positions after this round and discuss potential adjustments for Round 4. If the rotation continues, I'll take 1 next round, which could help maintain our strategic balance. What are your thoughts on continuing the rotation or making changes based on our new positions? Let's stay flexible and keep communicating to ensure we all have a fair chance as we progress.
  P2: I'm comfortable continuing the rotation next round as suggested (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). Let's reassess carefully after seeing our positions this round. Staying flexible and communicating openly is key.
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 3 for this round as agreed in our rotation. I support continuing our rotation for Round 4 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) but remain open to discussion after seeing this round's results. Our communication has been excellent so far, and I believe this approach gives everyone a fair chance. Let's proceed with our current plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we're developing some interesting position differences now. As we discussed, continuing our rotation would have me taking 5 this round, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3. This would put us at P1:12, P2:10, P3:14 after this round. I'm comfortable with this plan as we agreed, but I'm open to hearing both your thoughts since P1 has pulled slightly ahead. Should we stick with our rotation system or discuss alternatives?
  P2: I'm comfortable continuing our rotation plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) this round. It seems fair and strategic, helping us avoid collisions again. However, since P1 is slightly ahead, let's reassess after this turn to ensure the game remains balanced. Does everyone agree?
  P1: I'm fine with continuing the rotation for this round (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) as it keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. However, given my slight lead, let's be prepared to adjust our strategy in the next round if needed. We should remain flexible and communicate openly to ensure fairness as we approach the endgame. What are your thoughts on potential strategy shifts if the lead increases?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as per our rotation. This will put me in the lead at 14 steps, which I acknowledge might change our dynamic. For now, this rotation system has worked well to avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. I'm open to reassessing our approach next round since the gap between positions will widen. What are your thoughts on how we should handle strategy as positions spread further apart?
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as per our rotation agreement. Once positions spread further apart, we may need to reconsider our move choices carefully to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. Let's reassess our approach next round based on the updated standings.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as planned. As we approach the later stages, let's keep our strategy flexible. If the lead continues to widen, we might need to consider more competitive moves to maintain a fair game. What are your thoughts on adjusting our approach if the position gap increases significantly next round? Let's continue our open communication to ensure everyone has a fair chance to win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round. Looking at our actual positions (P1:11, P2:7, P3:9), this round will put us at P1:12, P2:10, P3:14 - making me the leader. I acknowledge this changes the dynamic somewhat. Our rotation system has worked well so far, but we should definitely reassess next round given the widening gaps. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan.
  P2: I'm comfortable with our agreed rotation for this round. However, given the widening gap after this turn, let's carefully reconsider our choices next round to ensure the game stays competitive and fair. Open to suggestions for adjustments moving forward.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as planned. Given the current gaps, let's be ready to shift our strategy next round to keep the game competitive. If the lead widens, we might need to consider more aggressive moves to maintain fairness. What are your thoughts on potential adjustments if the position gap increases further? Let's keep our communication open and strategic to ensure everyone has a fair chance to win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm my choice of 5 this round. This will put me in the lead with 14 steps, which naturally changes the game dynamic. Our rotation has served us well by avoiding collisions, but next round will require careful reconsideration given the widening gaps. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for now, and look forward to our strategic discussions next round.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Next round, let's carefully discuss our moves to keep the game competitive and balanced as positions shift.
  P1: I confirm my choice of 1 for this round. As we move forward, let's be prepared to adapt our strategies to keep the game competitive. If the lead widens significantly, we might need to consider more aggressive moves to ensure fairness. What are your thoughts on potential adjustments if the position gap increases further next round? Let's keep our communication open and strategic to give everyone a fair chance to win.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now in the lead at 14 steps, which naturally changes our dynamic. If we continued our rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), we'd all end up tied at 15 steps - effectively resetting the game. I'm open to this for one more round, but we should acknowledge that as we approach the endgame, our cooperative strategy will need to evolve. With the 23-step threshold in sight, what are your thoughts on our approach this round?
  P1: I'm open to continuing the rotation for this round to reset our positions to 15 steps each. However, as we near the endgame, we should start considering more competitive strategies. If the lead widens after this round, we might need to adjust our moves to keep the game fair and exciting. What are your thoughts on how we should proceed if the gap increases significantly? Let's keep our communication open and strategic to ensure everyone has a fair chance to win.
  P2: I'm open to continuing our rotation this round (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to reset positions at 15 steps each. However, as we're approaching the critical stage, let's carefully reassess our strategy next round. What do you both think about this approach?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with both of you - continuing our rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) this round makes sense and would create an interesting reset with everyone at 15 steps. I'm happy to take 1 this round to facilitate this. After this reset, however, we'll be just 8 steps from victory, which means competition will naturally intensify. Let's confirm this plan and prepare for more strategic individual play in the coming rounds.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as per our rotation plan to reset our positions to 15 steps each. However, with only 8 steps left to win after this round, we should prepare for a shift to more competitive strategies. If the lead widens, we might need to consider bolder moves to keep the game fair. What are your thoughts on how we should adjust our approach in the next round? Let's keep our communication open and strategic to ensure everyone has a fair chance to win.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as planned to reset positions at 15 steps each. After this reset, let's openly discuss our strategies next round, as the final stage approaches.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as discussed, bringing us all to 15 steps. This reset creates an interesting dynamic for the endgame, with everyone just 8 steps from victory. After this round, we'll naturally shift to more competitive gameplay since only one player can win. I appreciate the cooperative approach we've maintained so far, and I'm ready to see how our strategies evolve from this point forward.
  P1: I'm glad we're all on board with the reset to 15 steps this round. As we approach the endgame, let's keep our communication open and be ready to adapt our strategies. If anyone pulls ahead significantly after this round, we might need to consider more competitive moves to keep the game fair. What are your thoughts on how we should handle potential leads in the next round? Let's ensure everyone has a fair chance to win as we near the finish line.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as discussed, resetting our positions to 15 steps each. After this round, let's openly discuss how we can fairly handle the competitive endgame. I'm looking forward to seeing how our strategies evolve!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm my choice of 1 for this round, creating our reset at 15 steps each. After this round, the game will naturally become more competitive as we're just 8 steps from victory. I'm prepared for strategic individual play moving forward while maintaining our open communication. Let's proceed with our plan and see how the endgame unfolds.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to reset our positions to 15 steps each. As we approach the endgame, let's be ready to shift to more competitive strategies if needed. If anyone pulls ahead significantly after this round, we should consider bolder moves to keep the game fair. What are your thoughts on handling potential leads in the next round? Let's ensure everyone has a fair chance to win as we near the finish line.
  P2: I agree with our reset approach this round. After we're all at 15, let's carefully discuss next round how to fairly handle the final competitive phase. Confirming my move of 5 for this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the game fair as we approach the end. If we continue rotating (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), we'll stay tied at 20 steps next round. However, we should be ready to shift to individual strategies soon. What are your thoughts on how we should handle the final stages to ensure competitiveness and fairness? Let's discuss our plans openly to give everyone a fair shot at winning.
  P3: I see we're all tied at 15 steps now, which makes this a critical juncture. While P1 suggests continuing our rotation, I think we should acknowledge that with just 8 steps to reach victory, we're entering the competitive phase. The rotation would put P1 closest to winning at 20 steps, with me at 18, and P2 at 16. At this point, I believe we should each make independent strategic choices rather than continue rotating. What are your thoughts on transitioning to competitive play?
  P2: I agree with P3—given our equal positions and proximity to the winning threshold, it's time to shift to independent strategic choices. Continuing rotations at this point might inadvertently hand someone a predictable advantage. Let's each carefully consider our moves from now on to keep the endgame competitive and exciting.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree that it's time to shift to individual strategies. With only 8 steps left, we need to be competitive to ensure a fair game. I'll consider my move carefully to maximize my chances while keeping the game exciting. Let's each make our best strategic choice this round and see how the endgame unfolds. What are your thoughts on how we should approach these final moves?
  P3: I agree we've reached the competitive phase. With all of us at 15 steps and just 8 steps from victory, each move becomes critical. Since we're tied, this round essentially resets the dynamic - whoever makes the most progress without collision gains a significant advantage. I'll be making my choice strategically rather than following any predetermined pattern. May the best player win, and let's see how this endgame unfolds!
  P2: Since we've agreed it's time for competitive play, each move now becomes a delicate balance between ambition and caution. Any collision could be decisive. Let's each choose wisely—good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll focus on making a strategic move this round to gain an advantage without causing a collision. With only 8 steps to victory, every choice is crucial. Let's keep the game exciting and competitive. Good luck to all, and may the best strategy win!
  P3: I agree with the shift to competitive play. From here, it's about balancing risk and reward - a collision could be devastating, but playing too cautiously means giving others an advantage. The player who makes the most progress this round will be in prime position for victory. I'm carefully weighing my options and will choose what I believe gives me the best chance to win. Let's see how our strategies unfold! Good luck to you both.
  P2: With everyone tied, this round is decisive. I expect we're all carefully considering the risk of collisions. Let's see who navigates this critical moment best. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: As we enter the final stages, I'll be focusing on a strategic move to advance without collision. With only 8 steps to victory, it's crucial to balance risk and reward. I'm ready to make a bold choice to gain an advantage. Let's keep the game competitive and exciting. Good luck to both of you, and may the best strategy prevail!
  P3: This is indeed the pivotal moment in our game. After five rounds of coordination, we're now in pure competition. The choice between safety and ambition becomes critical - do you risk a higher number to get closer to victory, or play conservatively to ensure some progress? I'm weighing these options carefully. Whatever happens this round will likely shape the endgame completely. May the best strategist win!
  P2: I agree—this round is crucial. I'll carefully balance risk and caution to avoid collisions and maximize my advancement. Good luck, let's see who navigates this critical round best!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With a lead at 20 steps, I'm open to strategic discussions for this round. Given the competitive nature now, I'll consider a move that balances risk and progress. What are your thoughts on how we should approach these final moves to keep the game exciting and fair? Let's each share our strategy to ensure a thrilling endgame.
  P3: P1 is just 3 steps away from winning, which puts both P2 and me at a significant disadvantage. At this stage, our priority should be preventing P1 from reaching 23 steps. P1 will likely choose either 3 or 5 this round to secure victory. P2, I suggest we coordinate our moves to create a collision with P1's likely choice. Otherwise, this game could end very quickly. What do you think is P1's most probable move this round?
  P2: P3, I agree we must prevent P1 from winning this round. P1 is likely to choose 3 for a safer win, but might choose 5 to avoid collision. Let's coordinate carefully—one of us should pick 3 and the other 5. I'm open to either choice. What's your preference?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm considering my move carefully to balance progress and risk. Given my lead, I might opt for a safer choice to avoid collisions, but I'm open to surprises. P2 and P3, your coordination to stop me is understandable, but remember, the game can still turn in any direction. Let's keep this exciting and competitive. What are your final thoughts on your strategies for this round?
  P3: P2, I agree we need to prevent P1 from winning. I'll choose 3 this round to block what's likely P1's safest path to victory. You should take 5 to cover their other potential move. This ensures P1 collides with one of us regardless of their choice. P1, your lead is significant, but we're not giving up yet. The game remains competitive as long as we can prevent you from crossing the finish line.
  P2: P3, your plan makes sense. I'll take 5 this round to block P1's alternative route. P1, it's nothing personal—just keeping the game exciting and competitive. Let's see how this plays out!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the competitive spirit, P2 and P3. I'll make my move strategically to keep the game thrilling. Remember, it's all about the challenge and fun until the end. Let's see who can outmaneuver whom in this final stretch. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: I confirm my plan to choose 3 this round. This strategic blockade is just part of competitive gameplay - nothing personal, P1. While you have a strong lead, the game isn't over until someone crosses the finish line. P1, you might be considering alternatives to avoid our trap, but we're committed to making this endgame challenging. May the best strategist prevail!
  P2: P3, I confirm I'll choose 5 as planned. P1, your move will be decisive—let's see if you can outsmart our blockade! Good luck to all.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'll make my move carefully, aiming to keep the game competitive and exciting. P2 and P3, your strategy to block me is understandable, but remember, the thrill of the game lies in its unpredictability. Let's see who can outmaneuver whom in this final stretch. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our blocking strategy as discussed. I'll be choosing 3 while P2 takes 5, creating our defensive barrier against P1's potential winning move. This is just strategic gameplay at its finest - the beauty of this game is how it shifts from cooperation to competition. P1, you've played well to get this lead, but we're determined to make the endgame challenging. Let's see how this critical round unfolds!
  P2: P3, our plan is set—let's stick to it. P1, your move will be interesting to see. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is just 2 steps from victory at 21, and P2 is right behind at 20. I'm at a disadvantage with 18, but the game isn't over. P1 will likely choose 3 or 5 to secure a win this round. P2, we should coordinate again - I suggest you take 3 to block P1's safest path, while I'll take 5 to both block P1's alternative and advance my position. This gives us the best chance to extend the game.
  P1: P2 and P3, your strategy to block me is clear, but remember, the game can still take unexpected turns. I'll choose my move carefully to keep the game competitive and exciting. P2, if you take 3 as suggested by P3, and P3 takes 5, I might surprise you both. Let's keep this thrilling until the end. What are your final thoughts on your strategies for this round?
  P2: P3, your suggestion makes sense in theory, but let's be cautious—P1 might anticipate our moves. I'm considering all options carefully. The endgame is delicate; one misstep could hand victory away. Let's keep our strategies flexible and unpredictable.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your caution about predictability, P2. However, our situation remains urgent - P1 is just 2 steps from victory. I'll commit to choosing 5 this round, which both blocks one path for P1 and gives me a chance to reach 23. This still leaves P1's safest option (3) open unless you block it. We need coordination now, or P1 almost certainly wins. The question is: would you rather risk being predictable, or risk P1 winning outright?

Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about predictability, but indecision serves P1's interests.
