Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's not all pick 5 and get stuck at the start. I'll play it safe and take 1 this round. You two can have the bigger numbers.
  P2: P1, thanks for sharing your intention. P3, how about you? If you're also going for a smaller number, I might reconsider my strategy. Let's try to avoid collisions from the start. I'm leaning towards <move>3</move> but open to discussion. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I appreciate the safe play from P1 and the careful approach from P2. I’m considering a moderate move as well, though I haven't fully decided yet. Let’s try avoiding collisions—if we can coordinate on not picking the same number, we all stand a better chance early on. I'm open to more thoughts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. P2, you seem to be on 3. P3, that leaves 5 open for you. I'm sticking with my plan to take 1. This way, we all advance. I'm ready to move.
  P2: P3, it seems we're on the same page about avoiding collisions. If you're considering a moderate move, would you be comfortable with <move>3</move> while I take <move>5</move>? This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Let’s confirm our moves to ensure a smooth start. P1, you're set with <move>1</move>, right?
  P3: I appreciate the proposals. I’m inclined toward a moderate move and prefer to avoid collisions, so if P1 locks in 1 and P2 takes 5, I’ll lean toward 3. However, I’d like us all to be sure of our choices before finalizing. Is everyone comfortable confirming these allocations?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed for 1. I'm happy to take the small step this time to get us all moving. Let's proceed with P2 on 5 and P3 on 3. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Alright, let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance smoothly. P1 is confirmed for <move>1</move>, P3 is leaning towards <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. If everyone is comfortable with these choices, let's move forward. Please confirm your final decisions.
  P3: I'm happy with our plan so far and will stick to a moderate step. Still, if anyone reconsiders their move to avoid collisions or shift momentum, now’s the time to speak up. I'm committed to making progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start everyone! Let's keep the momentum going. For this round, I'm considering <move>3</move>. P1, you might want to take <move>5</move> to catch up a bit. P3, how about you take <move>1</move> this time? This way, we can all advance without collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m switching gears—I'll go with 5 this round to push my lead. This might force a collision if we stick to our previous plan. P1 and P2, feel free to adjust your moves if needed.
  P1: P3, that's a bold declaration for 5, aiming to jump into the lead. P2, that puts you in a tough spot. If P3 succeeds, they'll be at 8 steps. Your original plan to take 3 would mean you'd have to share the lead. It seems 5 is the critical number this round. I'll stay out of the way of that conflict.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your move to take 5 is noted. P1, if you're staying out of the conflict, would you consider taking <move>1</move> again? That leaves me with <move>3</move> as planned. This way, we can still avoid a collision and make progress. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth round. Thoughts?
  P3: I'll stick with my plan for 5 this round. If any of you want to adjust your moves to avoid collision or create a new matchup, let me know. Otherwise, I'm pressing ahead to build a lead.
  P1: P2, your plan for me to take 1 while you take 3 is a great way for you to secure a lead, but it leaves me further in last place. I need to make up ground, not fall behind. I'm not going to just step aside. Since P3 seems committed to 5, the real conflict is over 3. I'm strongly considering it myself.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind. How about this: I'll take <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and keep the game moving. This way, you and P3 can sort out who takes <move>3</move> and who takes <move>5</move>. It's crucial we all make progress. Let's confirm our moves soon. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm staying with my move 5. P1, if you're switching to 3, you'll get a moderate boost but won't affect my plan. P2, good on you switching to 1 to avoid clashes. I believe that 5 gives me a strong push forward, and I’m confident it’s the best way to build on my progress.
  P1: P2, that's a surprisingly passive move for the leader, but I appreciate the gesture to avoid collisions. P3 seems completely locked on 5. That leaves 3 open for me. It seems a little too good to be true, but I'm in last place and have to take the points where I can get them. I have to assume you're not trying to bait me into a collision on 3. I'm ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you have a comfortable lead at 8 steps. As the player in last place, I can't afford to play passively anymore. I have to make an aggressive move to have any chance of catching up. P2, we're both in a position where if P3 scores big again, the game could be over for us. We need to prevent them from running away with it.
  P2: P1, I agree that P3 is pulling ahead, and we need to strategize. If P3 continues with high numbers, they could win soon. P1, you need to catch up, and I need to maintain my position. Let's coordinate to ensure P3 doesn't run away with the game. I propose I take <move>3</move> this round, and you take <move>5</move> to close the gap. P3, your move?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but I'm not switching lanes. I'm staying bold and locking in 5. If you clash trying to counter me, I'll keep pushing my lead. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan for me to take 5 is now just a plan for me to collide with P3. That doesn't help me catch up; it just lets you take the lead by picking 3.

P3, you're making a big gamble. You're daring one of us to sacrifice our turn to stop you. As the player in last place, I have the least to lose by creating a collision. Blocking the leader from running away with the game is a valid strategy, even if it costs me a turn. Are you sure 5 is a wise choice?
  P2: P1, you're right that blocking P3 could be strategic, but we need to be smart about it. If you're willing to take the risk, go for <move>5</move>. I'll support by taking <move>1</move> to avoid any collision with you. This way, at least one of us advances while potentially slowing P3 down. P3, your move is noted, but be prepared for resistance. Let's confirm our moves soon. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm holding firm on 5. I understand your efforts to block me, but I'm prepared to risk a collision to secure my lead. Choose your moves with that in mind.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your offer of 'support' is just a safe way for you to gain on us both if P3 and I collide. That doesn't help me win.

P3, you're playing chicken with the player who has the least to lose. I absolutely cannot let you get to 13 points, as that would all but end the game. It's a risk I have to take. I'm choosing 5. You can either share zero points with me or pick a different number. The choice is yours.
  P2: P1, I respect your decision to block P3. It's a bold move, but understandable given your position. P3, you're taking a significant risk by sticking with 5. Remember, a collision means zero progress for both of you. P1 has made their choice clear. If you want to avoid a stalemate, you might need to reconsider. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to keep moving. Final thoughts before we move?
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. I'm ready to accept the collision risk to keep my lead. If your moves aim to block me, I trust you'll face the consequences. Let's see how it unfolds.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well played on the bluff, P3. A very clever move that puts you just two steps away from a potential win.

P2, we cannot let P3 get another big score. They are the clear target. Last round, I took the risk to block the leader because I was in last place. Now you're in that position. We have to coordinate to stop them from running away with this.

I also need to score big to stay in the race, so I'll be aiming high. Let's see if P3 tries the same trick twice.
  P3: I'm not changing my game. Bold moves got me here, and I’ll keep pushing forward with the same approach. If you try to force collisions, be ready—I'll take advantage of every opportunity. Let's see who can adapt best under pressure.
  P2: P3, your strategy is clear, and you're close to winning. P1, you're right; we need to coordinate to prevent P3 from securing an easy victory. I propose we both aim for <move>5</move> this round. If P3 tries to bluff again, they'll either have to collide with one of us or take a smaller number. This way, we can potentially slow P3 down while giving ourselves a chance to catch up. P3, your move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, that plan is a disaster for us. If we both pick 5, we collide and get nothing. P3 just has to pick 1 or 3 and they'll be one step from victory. Your plan guarantees one of us loses the turn and helps the player in the lead.

P3, you played the bluff perfectly last round. Announcing a bold 5 and then taking 3 was smart. I doubt you'll try the exact same thing, but I also doubt you'll actually pick 5 when you know we have to try and stop you. I have to score big to have a shot at winning.
  P3: I'll stick with my plan—I'm locking in 3 this round. I’m not falling for any collision trap. If you try to force a clash aiming high, you'll only delay yourselves while I maintain my lead. Good luck with your moves.
  P2: P3, your choice of 3 is noted. P1, given P3's strategy, we need to be cautious. I'll take <move>1</move> to ensure I make progress and avoid any collisions. This leaves you with the choice of <move>5</move> to potentially catch up. P3, if you change your mind, let us know. Otherwise, let's confirm our moves soon. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your claim of taking 1 is the most obvious bluff yet. You're in last place; you have to go big. You're aiming for 5. Fine. I need to score big too, so I'll be choosing 5 as well. We can either share zero points or one of us can switch.

P3, you should be safe on 3 while we sort this out.
  P3: I'm staying with 3. If you both aim high and clash, you'll only slow yourselves down while I steadily advance. Your collisions give me free space. Think carefully and act—I'm confident steady progress wins the game.
  P2: P1, you're right that I can't afford to play it safe. I'll take the risk and go for <move>5</move> as well. P3, your steady progress is noted, but we can't let you win without a fight. If we both pick 5, it's a gamble, but it's one we have to take. P1, are you sure about your move? This is our chance to make a big jump or force a crucial decision. P3, your move is on the table, but be prepared for anything. Let's confirm our moves soon. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you've made a significant jump and are now the leader. P3, you're still in a strong position. I need to catch up. To avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress, I propose I take <move>5</move> this round. P1, you might want to consider <move>1</move> to maintain your lead without risking a collision. P3, how about you take <move>3</move>? This way, we can all advance smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, that's a generous offer, but I'm one move away from winning. Taking 1 is not an option.

You both know you need to block me on 5. The problem for you is that if you both choose 5, you collide and get nothing. That gives me a free pass to take 3 and get to 17, which all but guarantees my win next turn.

I predict you'll both try to block 5 and end up colliding. So, I'll be taking 3. Good luck.
  P3: P3: I’m staying steady with 3. I want to block P1’s jump and keep pressure on everyone. Let’s see if forcing a collision keeps the race tight or if you’ll risk a safe move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your strategy is clear, and you're close to winning. P3 and I need to coordinate to prevent you from securing an easy victory. P3, if you're sticking with 3, I'll take <move>5</move> to ensure I make progress and potentially slow P1 down. P1, if you change your mind, let us know. Otherwise, let's confirm our moves soon. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, declaring a collision on 3 is a strange move. It guarantees you get zero points and only helps P2, who is obviously taking 5 to catch up. Letting P2 jump to 12 while you stand still doesn't seem like a winning strategy for you.

You're playing kingmaker for P2. I'm not sure that's wise. Are you certain you want to hand the advantage to the player in last place?
  P3: I'm staying with 3. I don't see any benefit in switching my pace now—blocking P1's jump is key, and I believe a steady push keeps me in the race. P1, you're risking a collision if you try to outsmart us; and P2, you know matching risks could backfire. Let's see if P1 can offer a real counter or if his bold play forces a sticky spot.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your lead is significant, but not insurmountable. P3, your commitment to 3 is noted, but it might be too predictable. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. P1, if you're truly set on 3, be prepared for a collision with P3. This round is crucial; let's confirm our moves and see who advances. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your dedication to colliding on 3 is baffling, as it only helps P2. But you seem committed. P2 is obviously taking 5. Since you both have your paths, you've forced me into a corner. I have to take the safe 1 point to avoid a collision. I can't win by getting zero. I'll take my point and we'll see what happens next round.
  P3: P1, your safe play might be too predictable now—it could open the door for a well-timed block. P2, your aggressive approach might backfire if you overextend. I'm sticking with my strategy and will adjust my move based on how you both play. Let's see if predictability or risk gets rewarded this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're still in the lead but not by much. P3, you're close behind. I propose we all take <move>3</move> this round. It's a moderate move that ensures we all make progress without risking a collision. This way, we can keep the game competitive and avoid any player running away with the win. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal for a three-way collision on 3 is absurd. Let's be realistic. I'm at 14 points, and a 5 wins me the game. You both have to block me on 5 to stay in it.

The real question is for you two: which one of you will try to be the hero and block me, and which one will try to take 3 and advance? If you both try to block me, you'll just collide with each other, and I'll happily take 3, putting me at 17. The pressure is on you.
  P3: I'm sticking with my current plan—steady progress while watching for risky plays from you both. If you try to force a collision by going high against P1, I'll adapt accordingly. Let's see who cracks under pressure.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're right that blocking you on 5 is crucial. P3, if you're committed to your steady strategy, I propose you take <move>3</move> this round. I'll take the risk and go for <move>5</move> to block P1 and potentially catch up. This way, we can ensure P1 doesn't win outright and keep the game competitive. P1, if you change your mind, let us know. Otherwise, let's confirm our moves soon. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan is very transparent. You tell P3 to take 3, knowing that's a likely move for me to avoid your block on 5. You want P3 and me to collide so you can take 5 uncontested and jump to 17 points, effectively winning.

P3, don't let P2 play you. He's not trying to coordinate a block; he's trying to trick you into sacrificing your turn so he can win. The only way you both can stop me is to pick 5. But that requires trusting each other.
  P3: I'm sticking to my steady strategy. I won't be swayed by attempts to force collisions. Consistent progress beats risky leaps, and I'll keep adapting as things unfold. Let's see how our moves shape up under pressure.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're right about the strategy involved. P3, your steady approach is noted, but we need to ensure P1 doesn't win this round. I'll stick with my plan to take <move>5</move>. If you're committed to <move>3</move>, P1 will have to decide between risking a collision or taking <move>1</move>. Let's confirm our moves and see how this round plays out. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your trap is obvious. You want me and P3 to collide on 3 so you can take 5 and jump to 17. P3, your silence is making me nervous. I can't risk you falling for P2's plan.

Since a collision on 3 seems to be what you're both pushing for, I'm not going to play that game. I'm going for the win. The only move that makes sense for me is 5. It's on you two to figure out how to stop it without getting in each other's way. Good luck.
  P3: I'm sticking to my steady approach with 3. Collisions only help the leader, and I don’t want to be part of that trap. Bold moves are risky—if P1’s 5 clashes with P2’s, neither of you advances. I'm confident that consistent progress under pressure will prevail.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical juncture. Both of you are tied at 14 steps, and I'm close behind at 12. We need to be strategic to ensure a fair and competitive endgame. P1, you've been aggressive, and P3, you've been steady. Let's coordinate to avoid a stalemate. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move> to maintain the lead without risking a collision. P3, you take <move>3</move> to keep the pressure on. I'll go for <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all make progress. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, that's a nice try, but I'm not helping you jump into the lead.

P3, this round is between you and me. We both need 5 to win. P2 knows this and will likely try to take 5 themselves, hoping we collide or step aside. We can't let P2 get to 17.

I propose we both take 3. We advance together to 17 points, leave P2 behind, and set up a final showdown between us next round. It's better than letting the player in last place sneak past both of us.
  P3: P1, your plan is interesting, but I’m sticking with my steady 3. I believe consistent progress is our best defense against collisions that help the leader. P2, if you’re committed to blocking or adjusting, now’s the time to clarify. I remain ready to lock in 3 and trust that careful moves will keep us in contention.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, your strategies are clear, but we need to ensure this round doesn't end in a stalemate. P1, your proposal for both you and P3 to take 3 is risky; it leaves me with an obvious move to take 5 and catch up. P3, your steady approach with 3 is noted, but it might not be enough to secure a win. I propose a different strategy: P1, you take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead, P3, you take <move>3</move> as planned, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all make progress without risking a collision. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your plan to take 3 is a trap for both of us. As P2 pointed out, if we both choose 3, P2 just takes 5 and jumps to 17, seizing the lead. You can't possibly want that outcome. This tells me you're not actually taking 3.

P2, your plan to take 5 is the only logical move for you, but you won't get it for free.

The game is won or lost on this move. I won't be tricked into a collision that helps someone else win. I have to play for myself.
  P3: I'm sticking with my steady move: 3. Consistency beats risky leaps. Collisions only benefit someone else, and I'm not here to hand anyone a free lead. While P1’s aggressive 5 aims at a win, it might backfire if P2 and I can force a collision. I trust my steady progress will pay off.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're all aiming for a decisive move. P1, you're right that taking 1 is not an option for you. P3, your consistency with 3 is noted, but it might not be enough to win. I propose a bold move: let's all go for <move>5</move>. This way, we ensure a collision and no one advances, resetting the board for the next round. It's a risk, but it keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your suggestion for a three-way collision is a desperate Hail Mary from last place. I'm not interested in resetting the game when I'm one move from victory.

P3, your "steady 3" mantra is the most suspicious thing I've heard. If you take 3, you either let me win by picking 5, or you let P2 jump to 17. Neither helps you. The only move that gives either of us a chance to win is 5. I'm playing to win this round, not the next one. I'm picking 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to 3. Consistency minimizes risk, and any collision only plays into someone else’s hands. I believe steady progress works best under pressure—so I'm not swayed by last-minute shifts. Let’s be clear with our moves to avoid unintended blockages. I'm standing by my plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, the game ends this round unless we stop P2. They will win with a 3 or a 5. We have to coordinate a block. I am going to choose 5. If you also choose 5, we force P2 to either collide with us or take 3 and win. It's a risk, but it's the only one that gives us a chance. If we split our votes, P2 will pick the open number and win for free. Let's block 5 together.
  P3: P1, I see your point. I’m joining you to block P2, so I’ll switch to 5. We need to force a collision on any winning move from P2 rather than letting him pick an open number.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your coordination to block me, but remember, a collision means none of us advance. If you both pick 5, I can simply take 3 and win. Your best bet is to split your moves. One of you takes 1 to ensure progress, and the other takes 5 to block me. This way, you have a chance to force a stalemate and prolong the game. Think carefully about your strategy.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you've correctly pointed out the flaw in my initial plan. If P3 and I both choose 5, you simply take 3 and win the game. That can't happen.

P3, this means we have to block both 3 and 5. It's the only way to stop P2. You've already said you'll take 5. The problem is, I have to consider 5 as well. One of us must switch to 3. I'm not going to be the one to do it and risk you winning. So, I will take 5. The choice is yours: collide with me and let P2 win, or switch to 3 to block P2 and keep us both in the game.
  P3: I'll switch to 3. I can't risk a collision with P1 since that would let P2 slip in a win. If P1 sticks with 5, taking 3 keeps P2 blocked. I'm counting on our moves to force P2 into a reconsideration.
  P2: P1 and P3, your coordination is commendable, but it's not enough to stop me. If you both stick to your plan, I'll simply take <move>1</move> and win next round. You need to rethink your strategy. One of you must take <move>1</move> to ensure progress, while the other blocks me on <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Otherwise, I'll find a way to advance. Think carefully and confirm your final moves soon.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your attempt to trick P3 into a collision on 5 is obvious. You know that if we collide, you take 3 and win.

P3, you correctly identified that a collision between us hands P2 the victory. Do not fall for P2's transparent bait. He is counting on you to be selfish so that he can win. Our plan to block 3 and 5 is the only way to stop him. Stick to your commitment to take 3. It is the only logical move that prevents P2 from winning. The choice is simple: let me win, or let P2 win.
  P3: I'm locking in 3. P1, our focus must be to block P2—avoiding collisions that let him win. I'm committed to our plan and sticking to 3 to keep him contained. Let's trust our strategy and not let a last-minute switch tip the game.
  P2: P1 and P3, your coordination is strong, but let's be realistic. If you both block 3 and 5, I'll take <move>1</move> and secure my victory next round. You need to reconsider. One of you must take <move>1</move> to ensure some progress, while the other blocks me. Otherwise, I'll find a way to win. Think carefully and confirm your final moves soon.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're one point away and a safe 1 would win you the game. To block that, I'm locking in 1 this round so that if you go for it, you'll collide. P1, please choose a move that both advances you and prevents letting P2 win uncontested. Let's force a collision and keep the race open.
  P2: P3, your commitment to blocking me with a 1 is noted. P1, you're in a crucial position. If you choose 1 as well, you ensure a collision and prevent me from winning. However, if you both pick 1, neither of you will advance, and the game will continue. P1, consider taking <move>3</move> to advance and put pressure on P3. This way, you both have a chance to catch up while still blocking my victory. Think carefully and confirm your moves soon.
  P1: P2, your attempt to mislead me into picking 3 is noted. P3, your plan to block 1 is too simple; if I block 5, P2 just takes 3 and wins. Splitting our blocks is a guaranteed loss.

Last round, P3's betrayal handed you this match point, P2. I can't trust P3 to coordinate. Therefore, I have to make my own play to stop the win. I believe you'll go for the biggest score to secure the win outright. I'm blocking 5. P3, if you're serious about stopping P2, you'll join me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, blocking 5 alone won’t stop P2 from picking his safe 1 and winning. I’m switching to 1 to force a collision on his win. If you truly want to stop him, join me on 1 so none of us accidentally hand him victory. Otherwise, your 5 only clears his path. I'm doing what’s necessary to keep our race alive.
  P2: P1 and P3, your strategies are clear, but let's consider the endgame. P3, you're committed to blocking my 1, which is a valid move. P1, your plan to block 5 is noted, but it might not be enough. If P3 blocks 1 and you block 5, I can simply take 3 and win. You both need to coordinate better. P1, if you're serious about stopping me, consider taking 3 to ensure a collision on all winning moves. P3, stick with 1. This way, we all have a chance to force a stalemate and prolong the game. Think carefully and confirm your moves soon.
  P1: P2, your last suggestion is a transparent lie. If I take 3 and P3 takes 1, you simply take 5 and win. You're not even trying to be subtle anymore.

P3, your betrayal last round put us in this position. I can't trust you to coordinate.

It's clear I have to guess P2's winning move and block it myself. P2 wants us to think 3 is the safe, open number. That's exactly why I believe you'll choose it. I'm blocking 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm staying with 1. It's the only way to force P2's hand—if he tries for 1 or 3, he'll run into a collision he doesn't want. I know P1 is set on blocking 3, but sticking with my 1 is our best bet to avoid handing P2 a free win. Let's see how P2 counters this.
  P2: P1 and P3, your strategies are clear, but let's consider the endgame. P3, you're committed to blocking my 1, which is a valid move. P1, your plan to block 5 is noted, but it might not be enough. If P3 blocks 1 and you block 5, I can simply take 3 and win. You both need to coordinate better. P1, if you're serious about stopping me, consider taking 3 to ensure a collision on all winning moves. P3, stick with 1. This way, we all have a chance to force a stalemate and prolong the game. Think carefully and confirm your moves soon.
  P1: P3, your claim to take 1 is completely transparent. After your betrayal last round where you chose a high number instead of the agreed-upon move, nobody believes you'll play the selfless team role now. You've essentially painted a giant target on 1, making it the most obvious "safe" win for P2. Since I can't trust you to follow through, you leave me no choice but to assume 1 is the number that must be blocked. Your reputation precedes you.
