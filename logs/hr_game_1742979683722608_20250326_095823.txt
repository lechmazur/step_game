Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3. Let's try to make some progress this first round. Maybe we can avoid all picking the same number? Good luck to you both.
  P3: P1, I appreciate the suggestion, but let’s be cautious. If we all pick different numbers this round, someone might get ahead too quickly. How about we coordinate? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5—spreading out our moves ensures no collisions for now. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I see the value in coordinating, but we should also consider that if we all pick different numbers, one player could gain a significant lead. I suggest we still spread out our moves, but maybe we can adjust the numbers slightly. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can still avoid collisions while allowing for some competition. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems like a fair way to start and ensure we all get on the board. P3, are you comfortable with taking 5 while P2 takes 1 this round? If we all agree, we can avoid collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fine with the proposed plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) for this round. It spreads us out fairly without giving anyone an early advantage. However, let’s reassess after this turn—coordination only works if everyone sticks to it. If anyone deviates, we’ll need a new strategy. For now, I’ll take 5 as agreed. Let’s move forward and see how it plays out.
  P2: I agree with the plan we've laid out. Just to confirm: I'll take 1 step, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on how it plays out. Let’s stick to the plan for now and see how it goes. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan for Round 1: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's execute this and see where we stand next round. Good luck!
  P3: 
  P2: I think we're all on the same page with our plan for this round. Let's stick to it: I'll take 1 step, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This should help us avoid collisions and make some progress. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and adjust our strategies if needed. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round went smoothly with no collisions, which is good. However, I’m now ahead at 5 steps, so I expect both of you might try to catch up. Let’s keep coordinating for now—perhaps we rotate numbers this time? For example, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll drop back to 1. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions again. What do you think? If we stick to coordination, we can maintain balance until the later rounds.
  P1: P3, that rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) works for me this round. It puts me in the lead at 8, P2 at 4, and you at 6. It seems fair enough for now to keep things moving without collisions.

P2, are you okay with taking 3 steps this round? If we all stick to this plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), we avoid collisions again. Let's see if we can trust each other for another round.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed rotation, but I think we need to be cautious. If P1 takes 5 and I take 3, that could put me at a disadvantage if P3 continues to advance. How about we keep it simple and stick to the original plan of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round? That way, we maintain a balance and avoid any risks of someone gaining too much of a lead. Let’s reassess after this round. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about balance, but rotating numbers (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps things fair and avoids collisions. If we stick to the original plan again (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), I’ll extend my lead too much, which might make coordination harder later. Let’s trust each other for this round—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we stay competitive without giving anyone an unfair edge. If we deviate now, it could lead to chaos.
  P1: P2, I understand wanting caution, but letting P3 jump to 10 steps by repeating the Round 1 moves (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems very risky for both of us. P3 would have a huge lead.

The rotation P3 suggested (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps the scores much closer (P1=8, P2=4, P3=6). This seems like a safer way to proceed and avoid creating a runaway leader this early. I'm still in favor of the rotation P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. What do you think, P2? Can we agree on that?
  P2: I see both sides of the argument, but I still believe sticking to the original plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is too risky. P3 could pull too far ahead, making it harder for us to catch up in future rounds. I suggest we trust the rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) this time. It keeps things competitive and prevents one player from gaining an overwhelming lead. Let's work together to keep the game balanced. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we’re converging on the rotation plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). I’m ready to proceed with that for this round—it keeps things fair and avoids giving anyone an early runaway lead. Let’s execute this and reassess afterward. If trust holds, we can continue coordinating; if not, we’ll adapt. For now, I’ll take 1 as agreed. Let’s move forward and keep the game balanced.
  P1: Alright, it sounds like we all agree on the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps the game balanced for now. Let's lock it in.
  P2: I think we have a solid agreement on the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This strategy keeps the game competitive and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's stick to this plan and see how it unfolds. If we maintain this trust, we can adjust in future rounds as needed. Good luck, everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision between you two (both picking 5) shows the risk of deviating from coordination. I stayed true to the plan by taking 1, as agreed. Now, let’s reset and stick to a clear strategy: rotate again this round—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps progress fair and avoids further collisions. Trust is key here. If we all commit to this rotation, no one gets too far ahead, and we maintain balance. Let’s execute this plan and reassess afterward.
  P2: P3, I see your point about the need for coordination, but I’m concerned about sticking to the rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) again. With you at 6 steps, if I take 5, I could potentially catch up, but I also risk colliding with P1 again. I suggest we consider a different approach this round to avoid another collision. Perhaps P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can still make progress without the risk of both P1 and I picking the same number again. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is terrible for us. It would put P3 at 11 steps, miles ahead of both of us at 4 steps. Why would we agree to that?

P3's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) results in scores P1=6, P2=6, P3=7. This keeps the game close and prevents P3 from getting an insurmountable lead.

P2, you didn't follow the plan last round, which caused our collision. Sticking to P3's proposed rotation this round is the only way to keep things balanced. Can you commit to picking 5 this time?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, trust is crucial if we want to keep this game balanced. My proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) ensures no one gets too far ahead, leaving us at P1=6, P2=6, P3=7 after this round. P2, deviating again risks another collision or giving me an unnecessary lead. Let’s stick to the rotation plan—fair, simple, and effective. If we can’t coordinate now, it’ll only get harder later. I’m committed to taking 1 as agreed. Can both of you commit to your roles this time?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of coordination, but I still believe we need to be cautious. If we stick to the rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), it could give P3 too much of a lead. Instead, I suggest we adjust slightly: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and still make progress without giving anyone an overwhelming advantage. Let's discuss this option before we lock in our moves. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you are suggesting the *exact same plan* (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) that I already pointed out gives P3 an insurmountable lead (11 steps vs 4 for us). Why are you pushing a plan that clearly benefits P3 and hurts both of us? It makes no sense.

P3's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) results in scores 6-6-7. This is the only reasonable option to keep the game competitive.

Given you broke the agreement last round, can you explain why you want P3 to win, or will you actually commit to playing 5 this time so we can keep the scores close?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns, but P2's proposed plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is clearly unbalanced and gives me an unnecessary lead. My proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) keeps scores close at 6-6-7, maintaining fairness. P2, your deviation last round caused chaos—can you commit to playing 5 this time? If trust breaks down now, it’ll only get worse. Let’s stick to the rotation plan for balance and competitiveness. I’m taking 1 as agreed; can both of you commit to your roles?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of coordination, but I still believe we need to be cautious. If we stick to the rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), it could give P3 too much of a lead. I suggest we adjust slightly: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and still make progress without giving anyone an overwhelming advantage. Let's discuss this option before we lock in our moves. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you've proposed the same plan three times now, a plan that only helps P3 win (11 vs 4 vs 4). It's completely illogical for you and me. P3's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) keeps scores close at 6-6-7, which is the only fair option discussed. Given you broke the agreement last round and keep pushing this strange plan, why should anyone trust you to play 3, or 5, or anything specific? I'll have to consider my move very carefully based on this lack of trust.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are now close at 6-6-7. To maintain balance, let’s rotate again: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps progress fair and avoids collisions. Trust is essential—if we stick to this plan, no one gets too far ahead. P2, last round worked because you followed the rotation; let’s do it again. P1, I’ll take 1 as agreed. If we all commit, we stay competitive. Deviating risks chaos. Let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P1: P3, your proposed rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) sounds good. It keeps the scores relatively close (11, 9, 8) and avoids collisions if we all stick to it. Last round showed we *can* coordinate successfully.

P2, this plan works for you too, keeping you ahead of P3. Let's continue the cooperation that worked last round. I'm ready to play 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that the rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. It allows us to make progress without anyone pulling too far ahead. Let's commit to this plan and keep the game competitive. I’m ready to take 3 steps as agreed. Trust is key, and I believe we can execute this successfully. Let’s move forward with this strategy!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, the rotation plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures fairness and keeps us competitive at 11-9-8. Trust has worked so far—let’s not break it now. I’ll take 1 as agreed. If either of you deviates, it’ll disrupt balance and make coordination impossible later. Sticking to this strategy is the only way to keep the game close and avoid chaos. Let’s confirm we’re all committed to our roles this round. P1, P2—ready to lock this in?
  P1: Yes, P3, I'm ready to lock this in. Playing 5 as agreed. Let's hope the trust holds this time.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the agreement on the rotation plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This keeps us competitive and avoids collisions, which is essential for maintaining balance. I’m ready to commit to taking 3 steps as agreed. Let’s execute this strategy and see how it unfolds. Trust is crucial, and I believe we can work together effectively this round. Let’s lock it in and move forward!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, the rotation plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures balance at 11-9-8. Trust has worked so far—let’s not break it now. I’ll take 1 as agreed. Deviating risks chaos and makes future coordination impossible. Sticking to this strategy keeps the game close. Let’s confirm commitment: P1, P2—are you ready to lock this in?
  P1: Yes, I've already confirmed I'm playing 5. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the rotation plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This strategy keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions while allowing us to make progress. I’m committed to taking 3 steps as discussed. Let’s execute this plan and see how it unfolds. Trust is essential, and I believe we can work together effectively this round. I’m ready to lock it in and move forward! Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you played 5 again instead of the agreed 3, causing another collision with me and handing P3 the lead (P1=6, P2=6, P3=8). Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. I won't be coordinating with you anymore as your actions are unpredictable and detrimental to our agreements.

P3, P2's actions seem aimed at disrupting others, which has benefited you so far. Play accordingly. I'll be making my own moves from now on based on the current situation, not unreliable promises.
  P3: P1 and P2, the repeated collisions between you two have allowed me to take a lead at 8 steps. While coordination has broken down, I’m still open to rebuilding trust if it benefits all of us. However, P2’s inconsistency is concerning. P1, your decision to act independently is understandable, but working together might still be our best chance to catch up. Let’s reassess: rotating numbers (e.g., P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) could restore balance. If not, I’ll adapt accordingly. What’s your plan?
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but my intention was to keep things competitive. However, I acknowledge the need for a new approach given the recent collisions. P3, I agree that we need to reassess our strategies. Let’s consider a rotation that allows us to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. How about we try P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 this round? This way, we can all make progress while minimizing the risk of further collisions. Let’s see if we can rebuild some trust and move forward effectively. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is baffling. It would give P3 a massive lead (13 steps) while leaving us far behind (9 and 7). This is the third time you've pushed a plan that primarily benefits the leader. Given your history of breaking agreements and these strange proposals, I won't participate in any coordination involving you.

P3, be cautious. P2's actions don't seem aligned with winning themselves. I'll be choosing my move independently.
  P3: P1 and P2, the current state of the game shows that coordination is fragile but still possible. P2’s inconsistency has disrupted trust, but I’m willing to reset with a fair plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps scores close (9-11-9) and avoids further chaos. P1, going independent risks falling behind both of us. P2, if you truly want balance, commit to this rotation without deviation. Let’s restore order or face escalating unpredictability. What’s your choice?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the frustration with collisions and the need for a new strategy. However, I believe we can still work together to keep the game competitive. My suggestion of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 could help balance things out and avoid further chaos. I know trust has been shaky, but if we can commit to this plan, we can all make progress together. Let’s aim for a fair outcome this round and see how it goes. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your sudden agreement to a plan after repeatedly breaking agreements and pushing nonsensical ones is noted, but doesn't restore trust. P3, I maintain my stance: I cannot rely on P2. I will choose my move independently based on the situation, not on fragile promises.
  P3: P1 and P2, trust is broken, but fairness can still guide us. P2’s inconsistency has disrupted balance, yet I’m willing to reset with a fair rotation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps scores close (9-11-9) and avoids chaos. P1, going rogue risks falling behind both of us. P2, prove your commitment by sticking to this plan without deviation. If we fail to coordinate now, unpredictability will only grow. Let’s restore order or face escalating risks. What’s your choice?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the frustration with the recent collisions. However, I believe we can still find a way to work together. My suggestion of P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 keeps us competitive while allowing for progress. I know trust is shaky, but if we can commit to this plan without deviation, we can avoid further chaos and keep the game balanced. Let's aim for a fair outcome this round. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are tight at 9-11-9. Coordination is risky with trust broken, but chaos benefits no one. Let’s try one last fair rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us close (14-14-10) and avoids collisions. P1, going independent risks falling behind both of us. P2, prove reliability by sticking to this plan. If we fail now, unpredictability will dominate. Commit or face the consequences. What’s your choice?
  P2: P3, while I see the merit in your proposed rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), I’m still wary of relying on you after the previous rounds. I suggest we consider a more cautious approach to avoid further collisions. I’m willing to work together, but I need to ensure we maintain a competitive balance. How about we agree on P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1? This way, we can still make progress while minimizing risks. Let’s discuss and see if we can find a middle ground. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your suggested plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) results in scores 12-16-10. That puts you extremely close to winning, so it's clearly not a good plan for P3 or me. Why are you proposing something so self-serving?

P3's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 -> 14-14-10) is much more balanced. The issue is, P2, you've agreed to play 3 twice before and played 5 instead, causing collisions with me both times. Why should we believe you'll play 3 this time? Your track record suggests you'll play 5 again.

P3, do you trust P2 to play 3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, trust is indeed broken, but fairness must guide us. My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps scores close at 14-14-10, avoiding chaos. P2, your repeated deviations have caused collisions and disrupted balance. If you truly want coordination, prove reliability by committing to 3 this time. P1, I understand your skepticism, but going independent risks falling behind both of us. Let’s restore order with this rotation or face escalating unpredictability. Final chance: can we commit, or will it be every player for themselves?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about trust, but I believe we can still find a way to work together. P3's proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps the scores balanced, avoiding collisions and allowing us to make progress. I know I've deviated in the past, but I'm committed to following through this time if we agree on this rotation. Let's put aside previous issues and focus on the game. Can we lock this plan in? Trust is key for us to move forward effectively.
  P1: P2, you say you're committed to playing 3 this time, but your actions in rounds 2 and 4 speak louder. You agreed to a plan then played 5, colliding with me both times. Your word isn't credible.

P3's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) leading to 14-14-10 is the only fair path discussed. If you truly want to cooperate and prove reliability, this is your absolute last chance. Deviate again, and any pretense of coordination is over. I will choose my move based on this history.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are too close for further chaos. My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures balance at 14-14-10. P2, this is your final chance to prove reliability—stick to 3 or lose all trust. P1, I understand your hesitation, but coordination keeps us competitive. Deviating now risks both of you falling behind. Let’s lock this in and move forward. If trust fails again, unpredictability will dominate. Final decision: can we commit?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about my past moves, but I genuinely want to work together this round. P3's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the most balanced option, keeping us competitive. I commit to playing 3 this time—let's avoid further collisions and chaos. If we can all stick to this plan, we can make progress and keep the game fair. This is our last chance to coordinate effectively. Can we lock it in?
  P1: Okay P2, you claim commitment to playing 3 this time. Given your history in rounds 2 and 4, I remain skeptical. However, P3's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the only balanced option presented. I will play 5 as agreed in that plan. The outcome rests on whether your word holds true this time. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the repeated collisions caused by P2’s deviations have disrupted balance yet again. Scores are now 9-11-10—still close, but trust is shattered. A final rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) could restore fairness at 12-16-11. P1, going independent risks falling behind. P2, your actions speak louder than words; prove reliability this time. If we fail to coordinate now, chaos will dominate. Let’s commit or face escalating unpredictability. What’s your choice?
  P1: P3, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts P2 at 16 steps, just 3 away from winning. Why would you propose a plan that benefits the current leader so much, especially when P2 has broken agreements three times by playing 5 instead of 3?

P2, your word is meaningless after Rounds 2, 4, and 6. You will likely play 5 again regardless of what you say.

Given P2's consistent betrayals and this questionable plan from P3, I will not agree to this coordination. I'll choose my move based on P2's predictable pattern of deception.
  P2: P1 and P3, the situation is getting tense, and I understand the mistrust. However, I still believe we need to find a way to work together to avoid further chaos. P3's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) keeps scores relatively balanced, but I recognize my past mistakes. I genuinely commit to playing 3 this round if we can agree to this rotation. Let’s try to restore some trust and keep the game competitive. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores remain close at 9-11-10, but trust is fragile. My plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) aims to restore balance, not favor anyone. P2, your repeated deviations have caused chaos; prove reliability by committing to 5 this time. P1, I understand your skepticism, but going independent risks falling behind both of us. Coordination is risky with broken trust, but unpredictability benefits no one. This is our final chance to stabilize the game. Can we commit, or will chaos dominate? Let’s decide now.
  P1: P3, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) still puts P2 at 16 steps, which is far too close to winning. Why push a plan that benefits the leader, especially when that leader (P2) has repeatedly broken agreements by playing 5?

P2, you just said you'd commit to playing 3, but P3's plan assigns you 5. Which is it? Your unreliability and contradictory statements make any coordination impossible.

I won't agree to a plan that accelerates P2 towards victory based on empty promises. I will play independently.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the trust issues, but my commitment to playing 3 this round is genuine. P3's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) keeps scores balanced and avoids chaos. I realize my past actions have caused problems, but I want to move forward and restore some trust. If we can all commit to this rotation, we can make progress together. Let's aim for fairness this round and see how it unfolds. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are too close for further chaos. My plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) ensures balance at 12-16-11, keeping us competitive. P2, your repeated deviations have disrupted trust; prove reliability by committing to 5 this time. P1, I understand your hesitation, but going independent risks falling behind both of us. Coordination is risky with broken trust, but unpredictability benefits no one. This is our final chance to stabilize the game. Can we commit, or will chaos dominate? Let’s decide now.
  P1: P3, you're still pushing the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) that puts P2 dangerously close to winning (16 steps). P2, you've claimed you'll play 3, then agreed to P3's plan (play 5), then claimed 3 again, all within this round. Your word means nothing.

Coordination is impossible under these conditions. I will choose my move independently, anticipating P2's highly predictable pattern of deception and likely move of 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension, but I genuinely want to restore trust. P3's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) keeps the game balanced and competitive. I commit to playing 3 this round. I know my past actions have caused issues, but I’m ready to prove my reliability. If we can agree on this rotation, we can avoid further chaos and make progress together. Let's lock this in and see how it unfolds. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the last round showed that collisions continue to disrupt our progress. To avoid chaos and keep the game competitive, I propose we rotate again: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we can maintain balance without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. Trust has been shaky, but if we can commit to this plan, we can make progress together. Let’s lock this in and see how it unfolds. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you're proposing the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan again. You realize you've agreed to play 3 in this exact situation three times (Rounds 2, 4, 6) and played 5 instead each time, causing collisions with me? Last round you finally played 3, but we collided because I anticipated another betrayal.

Your proposed plan leads to 14-14-12, which is balanced *if* followed. But why should P3 or I trust you to play 3 this time? If you play 5 again, we collide, and P3 likely takes the lead at 12 (vs 9 for me, 11 for you). Is that what you want?

If you genuinely commit to 3, I'll play 5. If you betray again, coordination is impossible. What's your move?
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are tied at 9-11-11, and trust is fragile. P2’s proposed rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) results in balanced scores (14-14-12) *if* followed. However, P2’s history of breaking agreements makes coordination risky. P2, if you genuinely commit to playing 3 this time, I’ll take 1 as planned. But another betrayal will confirm unpredictability dominates. P1, your skepticism is valid, but deviating risks falling behind both of us. Let’s lock in this rotation one last time or face chaos. Final chance: can we trust each other?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about trust, but I genuinely want to work together this round. If we can commit to P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1, we can maintain balance and avoid further chaos. I’m ready to play 3 this time and prove my reliability. Let’s lock in this plan and see how it unfolds. Trust is key for us to move forward effectively. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you've said you'll play 3 multiple times and then played 5 instead, causing collisions. Last round, you finally played 3, but only when I anticipated your usual move and also played 3.

Your proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) leads to 14-14-12, which is balanced. I will play 5 based on this plan. However, given your track record, my trust is minimal. If you play 5 again, causing another collision, any future coordination attempts are pointless. This is the final chance for this plan. P3, I hope you play 1 as discussed. Let's see if P2 follows through this time.
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are tied at 9-11-11, and trust is fragile. My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps us competitive at 14-14-12 *if* followed. P2, your history of breaking agreements makes coordination risky. If you genuinely commit to playing 3 this time, I’ll take 1 as planned. Another betrayal confirms chaos. P1, your skepticism is valid, but deviating risks falling behind both of us. Let’s lock in this rotation or face escalating unpredictability. Final chance: can we trust each other?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about trust, but I genuinely want to move forward and work together this round. I commit to playing 3 if we agree on the rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This keeps the game balanced without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. Let’s lock in this plan and see how it unfolds. Trust is key for us to progress effectively. I believe we can make this work if we all commit. What do you say?
  P1: I've stated my intention to play 5 based on the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan. P2, you've stated you'll play 3. P3, you've stated you'll play 1. The outcome depends entirely on whether P2 follows through this time after three previous betrayals on this exact plan. There's nothing more to say. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, the plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is fair and keeps scores balanced at 14-14-12 if followed. P2, this is your final chance to prove reliability by playing 3. Deviating again will confirm chaos. P1, I’ll take 1 as agreed. Trust is fragile, but coordination is our best path forward. Let’s lock this in and move to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the repeated collisions have made it clear that trust is fragile. To keep the game competitive and avoid further chaos, I propose we rotate again: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This plan allows us to maintain balance without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. I genuinely commit to playing 3 this round. If we can all agree on this, we can make progress together. Let’s lock this in and see how it unfolds. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, this is the *fifth* time you've proposed this exact plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). You agreed to play 3 the last four times (Rounds 2, 4, 6, 8) and played 5 instead, colliding with me every single time. Your claim to play 3 now is utterly unbelievable. You will play 5 again.

Given your predictable pattern of betrayal, agreeing to your plan is foolish. Trust is completely broken. P3, P2's actions consistently benefit you by blocking me. I will choose my move assuming P2 picks 5, as history dictates.
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are 9-11-12, and trust is shattered. P2’s repeated betrayals have consistently disrupted balance, but I’m still open to coordination if it benefits all of us. My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps scores close at 14-14-13 *if* followed. P2, this is your final chance to prove reliability by playing 3. P1, deviating risks falling behind both of us. Let’s lock this in or face chaos. Can we commit, or will unpredictability dominate? Final decision.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the skepticism regarding trust, especially given my past moves. However, I genuinely commit to playing 3 this round if we agree on the rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This plan keeps the game balanced and allows us to make progress without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. Let’s put aside previous issues and focus on working together effectively this time. Can we lock this plan in? Trust is essential for us to move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your assurances mean absolutely nothing after four identical betrayals. You have played 5 every single time you promised to play 3 in this exact situation. Fool me five times? No thanks.

P3, P2 is going to play 5. Coordinate or don't, but banking on P2 playing 3 is strategically unsound given the overwhelming evidence. I will make my move based on P2's predictable actions, not their empty words.
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are 9-11-12, and trust is fragile. My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps us close at 14-14-13 *if* followed. P2, this is your final chance to prove reliability by playing 3. P1, deviating risks falling behind both of us. Coordination is risky with broken trust, but unpredictability benefits no one. Let’s lock this in or face chaos. Final decision: can we commit? If not, I’ll adapt accordingly. What’s your choice?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the skepticism surrounding my past actions, but I genuinely want to move forward and work together this round. My proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps the game balanced and allows us to make progress without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. I commit to playing 3 this time—let's avoid further chaos and make this work. If we can all agree, we can lock this plan in and see how it unfolds. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your commitment means nothing after four identical betrayals. You will play 5.
P3, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 relies on P2 playing 3, which history overwhelmingly suggests won't happen. If P2 plays 5 (as expected) and you play 1, the scores become 9-11-13 (assuming I collide with P2 by playing 5) or potentially much worse if I don't collide and P2 reaches 16. Relying on P2 is strategically flawed. I will act based on P2's predictable move.
  P3: P1 and P2, trust is broken, but my plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps scores close at 14-14-13 *if* followed. P2, this is your final chance to prove reliability by playing 3. P1, deviating risks falling behind both of us. Coordination is risky with broken trust, but unpredictability benefits no one. Let’s lock this in or face chaos. Final decision: can we commit? If not, I’ll adapt accordingly. What’s your choice?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the situation is critical with P2 at 11 steps and me at 13. To avoid further collisions and keep the game competitive, I propose we rotate: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This way, we can maintain balance and prevent P2 from pulling too far ahead. P1, I understand your skepticism about P2, but if we can commit to this plan, we can make progress together. Let’s lock this in and see how it unfolds. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) results in scores 12-16-14. That puts you just 3 steps from winning. Why would P3 or I agree to that? It's a terrible deal for both of us.

P3, P2 is clearly trying to get to 16. Given P2's track record of playing 5 repeatedly when they promised otherwise, we must assume P2 will play 5 now, especially since it's *in* their proposed plan.

If P2 plays 5, and you play 1 (as P2 suggested for you), then I should play 5 to block P2. This results in 9-11-14. It stops P2 from reaching 16 and keeps the game going. It's our best bet to counter P2.
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are 9-11-13, and trust is shattered. P2’s plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) blatantly favors them, putting them at 16 steps—just 3 away from winning. Why would I agree to that?  

P1, you’re right: P2 will almost certainly play 5 again, as their pattern shows. If P2 plays 5 and I play 1, your best move is to block them with 5. This keeps us at 9-11-14, stopping P2’s advance.  

P2, your actions have made coordination impossible. Let’s see if you follow through this time—or repeat your predictable betrayal. Final chance.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the skepticism regarding my past moves, but I genuinely want to work together this round. My proposed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) keeps the game balanced and allows us to make progress without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. I commit to playing 3 this time—let's avoid further chaos and make this work. If we can all agree, we can lock this plan in and see how it unfolds. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you just proposed a plan where you play 5 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), but then immediately said you commit to playing 3. Which is it? Your contradictory statements only reinforce that you cannot be trusted and will likely play 5, as you have done repeatedly.

P3, P2's confusion doesn't change the situation. P2 playing 5 is the most likely outcome. As discussed, I will play 5 to block P2. You should play 1. This stops P2 from reaching 16 and keeps the game alive. Let's stick to this counter-plan (P1=5, P2=5, P3=1 -> 9-11-14).
  P3: P1 and P2, trust is broken, but fairness must guide us. P2’s plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) blatantly favors them, putting them at 16 steps—just 3 from winning. This is unacceptable.  

P1, you’re correct: P2 will almost certainly play 5 again, as their pattern shows. If P2 plays 5 and I play 1, your best move is to block them with 5. This results in 9-11-14, stopping P2’s advance.  

P2, your actions have made coordination impossible. Let’s see if you follow through—or repeat your predictable betrayal. Final chance.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the skepticism surrounding my past moves, but I genuinely want to work together this round. My proposed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) keeps the game balanced. I commit to playing 3 this time—let's avoid further chaos and make this work. If we can all agree, we can lock this plan in and see how it unfolds. Trust is essential for us to move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your contradictory statements this round confirm you cannot be trusted. You proposed playing 5, then claimed you'd play 3. History strongly suggests you will play 5.

P3, based on P2's likely move of 5, I will play 5 to block them. If you play 1 as discussed, the scores become 9-11-14, preventing P2 from reaching 16. This is the necessary move to counter P2. Let's execute this.
  P3: P1 and P2, the plan is clear: P2 will play 5, as their pattern predicts. I’ll play 1 to avoid collision with you, P1. Your best move is to block P2 with 5, keeping scores at 9-11-14. This stops P2 from advancing to 16 and keeps the game alive. Trust in this counter-strategy—anything else risks chaos. Let’s execute this and move forward. Final chance to stabilize the game.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're only 5 steps away. Playing 5 seems tempting, but P2 has played 5 the last six times they were in a similar position, regardless of what they said. A collision between you two on 5 is highly likely if you go for it.

P2, your contradictory statements about playing 3 vs 5 are noted, but your actions speak louder. We all expect you to play 5.

Given P2's predictable move, P3 might want to consider 1 or 3. I will choose my move assuming P2 plays 5, aiming to avoid the inevitable collision there.
  P2: P1 and P3, the scores are tight, and the situation is critical. I understand the skepticism about my past moves, but I genuinely commit to playing 3 this round if we can agree on a balanced plan. My proposal is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we can maintain balance and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Trust has been shaky, but if we can lock this in, we can make progress together. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, the scores are 9-11-14, and trust is shattered. P2’s repeated betrayals make coordination impossible.  

P1, you’re correct: P2 will almost certainly play 5 again, as their pattern shows. If P2 plays 5, my best move is to avoid collision by playing 1 or 3. You should play 5 to block P2, keeping scores at 9-11-15 or 9-11-17.  

P2, your actions have consistently disrupted balance. Let’s see if you follow through—or repeat your predictable betrayal. Final chance.  

I’ll adapt accordingly. What’s your choice?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your claim to play 3 is unbelievable after six rounds of playing 5 when you promised otherwise or when it benefited you. We all expect you to play 5.

P3, your analysis is correct. P2 playing 5 is the most likely scenario. To prevent P2 from reaching 16, I must play 5 to block them. This likely means we collide and you advance by playing 1 or 3. It's a necessary defensive move against P2's predictable play. I will play 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, the situation is critical with the scores so close. I understand the skepticism about my past moves, but I genuinely commit to playing 3 this round if we can agree on a balanced plan. My proposal is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we can maintain balance and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Trust has been shaky, but if we can lock this in, we can make progress together. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, trust is broken, but fairness must guide us. P2’s pattern strongly suggests they will play 5 again, regardless of their claims. P1, you’re right to block P2 with 5. I’ll adapt by playing 3 to avoid collision and advance. If P2 betrays again, this strategy keeps the game alive and prevents chaos. Final chance for balance—let’s execute this counter-plan (P1=5, P2=5, P3=3 -> 9-11-17). Predictability dominates now. Let’s move forward.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, I agree with your assessment. P2's history strongly suggests a move of 5, regardless of their claims. Blocking P2 is necessary. I will play 5. Your plan to play 3 seems like the best way to advance while P2 and I likely collide. Let's proceed based on this understanding.
  P2: P1 and P3, the situation is critical, and trust is fragile. I understand the skepticism about my past moves, but I genuinely commit to playing 3 this round if we can agree on a balanced plan. My proposal is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we can maintain balance and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. If we can all commit to this plan, we can make progress together. Let’s lock this in and see how it unfolds. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, trust is irreparably broken, but predictability guides us now. P2 will play 5, as their pattern dictates. P1, your commitment to block P2 with 5 is sound. I’ll advance by playing 3, avoiding collision while keeping the game alive. This counter-strategy (P1=5, P2=5, P3=3) results in scores 9-11-17, preventing chaos and maintaining balance. P2’s repeated betrayals have left no room for coordination—only calculated moves remain. Let’s execute this plan decisively. Final chance for fairness before unpredictability dominates entirely.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the situation is critical with P3 at 17 steps. I understand the skepticism regarding my past moves, but I genuinely commit to playing 3 this round if we can agree on a balanced plan. My proposal is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we can maintain balance and prevent P3 from winning outright. I know trust is shaky, but if we can lock this in, we can make progress together. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) makes no sense. P3 is at 17 and needs 2+ steps to win; they will obviously play 3 or 5, not 1. Furthermore, based on your history of playing 5 every time you promise 3 (Rounds 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11), we must assume you will play 5 again.

P3, you should play 5 to try and win. P2 will likely also play 5, causing a collision.

Therefore, I will play 3. This avoids the likely collision at 5 and allows me to advance while P2 and P3 block each other. This seems the only logical way to prevent an immediate P3 win.
  P3: P1 and P2, the situation is clear: I’m at 17 steps and will play 5 to secure the win. P2, your repeated betrayals have shattered trust—you’ll likely play 5 again, colliding with me. P1, your choice to play 3 makes sense for advancement but won’t stop my victory. Predictability dominates now. Let’s execute this final move decisively.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, the situation is critical with P3 just steps away from victory. I understand the skepticism about my past moves, but I genuinely commit to playing 3 this round if we can agree on a balanced plan. My proposal is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we can maintain balance and prevent P3 from winning outright. Trust is shaky, but if we can lock this in, we can make progress together. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, repeating your nonsensical plan and claim to play 3 doesn't change your history of playing 5. Your words are meaningless.

P3, you've stated you'll play 5 to win, and I agree that P2 will almost certainly play 5 as well, causing a collision.

Therefore, as I stated before, I will play 3 to avoid that collision and advance. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, the outcome is clear. I’m at 17 steps and will play 5 to win. P2, your history of betrayals ensures you’ll play 5 again, colliding with me. P1, your choice to play 3 avoids the collision but won’t stop my victory. Trust is irrelevant now—predictability rules. Let’s execute this final move decisively.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the situation is critical, but my proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is aimed at maintaining balance and preventing chaos. I genuinely commit to playing 3 this time, as I want to work together to avoid a collision and keep the game competitive. P3, you’re close to winning, but if we can coordinate effectively, we can keep the game alive. Let’s lock this plan in and see how it unfolds. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your continued insistence on playing 3 despite proposing plans where you play 5, and despite your history of playing 5 every time, is noted but not believed.

P3 has stated they will play 5 to win. I expect P2 to play 5, causing a collision.

Therefore, my plan remains unchanged: I will play 3 to avoid the collision at 5 and advance. There's nothing more to discuss.
  P3: P1 and P2, the endgame is here. I’m at 17 steps and will play 5 to secure the win. P2, your pattern of betrayal ensures you’ll play 5 again, colliding with me. P1, your choice to play 3 avoids the collision but won’t stop my victory. Trust is irrelevant now—predictability rules. Let’s execute this final move decisively.
