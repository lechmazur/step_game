Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hi P2 and P3. To avoid collisions and share opportunities, I propose a rotation: this turn, I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Next turn, I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Then I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance safely and each get 5 steps periodically. Fair? If agreed, we can  soon."
  P2: P1's plan sounds fair, but I'm concerned about the long-term strategy. What happens after the first full rotation? We might need to adjust based on our positions. For now, I agree to take 3 this turn if P3 agrees to take 5. Let's see how it goes. P3, what do you think?
  P3: I appreciate aiming to avoid collisions and build safe progress. I’m willing to coordinate for this round, though I’ll keep some flexibility in my move choice to optimize my position later. Let’s secure clean rounds now and be ready to adapt as we get closer to 21.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, P3, I hear your concerns. Let's focus on this turn to build trust: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. We'll reassess after seeing positions. This avoids collisions now and gives data for future rounds. P2, P3—explicit confirmation? If agreed, we can  and advance safely."
  P2: I'm in for P1's plan this turn. P3, are you confirming you'll take 5? Let's ensure we all advance this round. We can re-evaluate next turn based on our positions. P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Agreed? Let's move forward with this.
  P3: I'm on board with the coordinated plan for this round. I support the rotation and safe progress without collisions, and I'll stick with our agreement for now. Of course, once we see everyone’s progress, I'll reassess and adjust my strategy to stay on track for victory.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2 and P3, excellent—Round 1 went smoothly thanks to our coordination. Let's continue the rotation as planned: **this turn I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1**. This avoids collisions and keeps our progress fair. P2, can you confirm taking 5? P3, do you agree to take 1? Trust builds through consistency."
  P2: I agree with P1's plan for this round. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. Let's confirm and move on. P3, are you in?
  P3: I’m on board for keeping things clean this round. I’ll stick to our coordinated play for now while keeping an eye open for a bold move when the time’s right. Let’s maintain safe progress and re-evaluate after this turn.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our collision last round really stalled progress. To avoid that this turn, let’s agree to each pick a distinct move—one low, one medium, and one high. I’m flexible on my number if we can quickly settle roles. What do you both propose?
  P2: P3, thanks for addressing the collision issue. To ensure we all advance this round, let's revert to our initial rotation plan with a slight adjustment. P1 can take 5, I'll take 1, and P3, you take 3. This way, we avoid another collision and keep moving forward. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both in?
  P1: "P2, I endorse your plan: I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing. P3, explicit confirmation is critical—will you commit to 3? Last round’s collision hurt us all; let’s rebuild trust with clean execution this turn."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m revising my move—I’ll take 5 instead of 3 this turn. If P1 still goes 5, our moves cancel and no one gains an uncontested boost. This helps keep the field even and prevents any dangerous lead. P2, I trust you’ll stick to your plan.
  P2: P3, your change to take 5 complicates things. P1, if you still take 5, you both collide, and no one advances. Let's adjust: P1, can you take 3 instead? I'll stick with 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, P3, are you both in?
  P1: P3, your threat to take 5 forces my hand: if you pick 5, I will too, causing mutual destruction. To avoid this, agree to take 3 instead. P2, stick to 1. This way: I take 5 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 8), P2 takes 1 (to 4). We all advance, and P3 remains close without risking collision. Confirm or face zero gain.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your point but forcing a collision rarely helps anyone. I’m not locked into extremes if it means stalling progress. I’d rather opt for a move that secures safe advancement without mutual cancellation. P2, let’s avoid ultimatums that risk zero gain and stick to a plan that lets each of us move forward. I’m focused on winning and ready to adjust to keep our steps growing steadily.
  P2: P3, P1, let's find a middle ground. P3, if you insist on taking 5, P1 can take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P1, can you confirm taking 3? P3, are you sticking with 5? Let's ensure we all advance. We need to avoid another stalemate. Please confirm your moves.
  P1: P3, forcing a collision by taking 5 when I will also take 5 only helps P2. Let's avoid mutual loss: you take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. You advance to 8, I to 9, and P2 to 4. This keeps you competitive without risking zero gain. Confirm you'll take 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: After collisions hurt us, let's rebuild trust with a safe plan: I take 3, P2 take 1, P3 take 5. P3, you extend your lead to 10. P2 advances to 5, and I to 7. This avoids collisions and is fair. P2, P3—confirm explicitly to prevent mutual loss.
  P3: I confirm—I'll take 5 as proposed. Let’s stick to distinct moves this turn to avoid collisions and secure our gains.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate P3 confirming to take 5. To ensure we all advance, I'll stick with taking 1. P1, please confirm you'll take 3 as planned. This way, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let's rebuild trust and make this a clean round. Please confirm your moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm taking 3 as planned. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5—no deviations. Let's execute cleanly and all advance. Trust is key.
  P3: I'm sticking with my commitment to take 5 this round. However, if either of you change your move unexpectedly, I'll have to adjust to defend my lead. Let's ensure our moves remain distinct so we all progress without collisions. I'm focused on winning, and I need clear, coordinated play now.
  P2: P3, P1, let's solidify our plan for this round. P3, you're taking 5, P1 is taking 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this and move forward cleanly. Trust is crucial, and this round can rebuild it. No surprises, please confirm your final moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P3, your threat to adjust undermines trust. I am locked into 3 to avoid collision—changing now risks mutual loss and only helps P2. Stick to 5: you extend your lead safely while P2 and I advance moderately. P2, hold to 1. Let’s execute cleanly: no surprises, no gains for anyone if we collide."
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this turn. P1, please remain with 3, and P2, hold with 1 so we avoid collisions that stall all our progress. Any last-minute shifts only risk our mutual gains and might give an opening to an opponent. Let’s lock these moves in and move forward consistently—I’m focused on winning, and I expect reliable commitments from you both.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves for this round. P3 is taking 5, P1 is taking 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and move forward cleanly. Trust is crucial, and this round can rebuild it. No surprises, please confirm your final moves. Let's make this a clean round and avoid any last-minute changes.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2, P3: P3 is at 10, dangerously close to 21. To prevent a runaway win, I propose: P3 takes 1 this turn (reducing risk and showing restraint), I take 5 to close the gap, and P2 takes 3. This avoids collisions while balancing progress. P3, your lead is safe; this keeps the game competitive for all. Agree?"
  P3: I’m not limiting my progress—I’m committing to 5 this turn. To avoid a collision, I urge you both to shift your moves: P1, please switch from 5 to 3; and P2, stick with 1. This way, our moves remain distinct (5 for me, 3 for P1, 1 for P2) and we all gain safely. Let’s adjust now so we don’t stall our progress.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but taking 5 again risks a collision and stalls the game. Let's find a compromise: P3, take 3 this turn to maintain your lead without overextending. P1 can take 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, your lead is secure, and this keeps the game fair. Let's confirm and move forward. P1, P3, are you both in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking 5 risks a collision—I *will* match it to stall your lead, wasting your turn and letting P2 gain. Instead, accept P2's compromise: you take 3 (still extending to 13), I take 5 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 6). We all advance safely, and the game stays competitive. Don’t force mutual destruction when a fair path exists. Confirm you’ll take 3. P2, hold to 1.
  P3: I remain committed to 5. My lead should be rewarded, and I won’t downgrade my move. P1, I urge you to settle on 3 and P2 on 1 so we avoid collisions that stall everyone. Forced collisions only hurt our progress—even if they momentarily stall me, they’ll slow you down more. Let’s all commit to distinct moves for a safe round and keep our progress steady.
  P2: P3, P1, let's avoid a stalemate. P3, if you insist on taking 5, P1 can take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P1, can you confirm taking 1? P3, are you sticking with 5? Let's ensure we all advance. We need to avoid another collision. Please confirm your moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I *will* match it—we both get 0, and P2 gains alone. You sacrifice your lead and help P2 catch up. Take 3 instead: you lead at 13, I hit 12, P2 stays behind. P2, stick to 1. This avoids mutual loss and keeps the game competitive. Confirm P3 takes 3.
  P3: I appreciate your proposals, but lowering my move now only helps you catch up. I’m sticking with my best approach to maximize my progress. If we end up mirroring moves, everyone loses a turn, and that only benefits the cautious. I urge you both to pick distinct, non-colliding moves so our advances count. My focus is winning, and I’ll press my lead while we all move smartly.
  P2: P3, P1, let's break the impasse. P3, if you're set on taking 5, P1 can take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P1, can you confirm taking 1? P3, are you sticking with 5? Let's ensure we all advance. We need to avoid another collision. Please confirm your moves.


Round 5, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, at 15 steps, taking 5 risks collision—I *will* match it to block your win, wasting your turn and helping P2. Instead, take 1 to show restraint: you lead at 16, I take 5 to 12, P2 takes 3 to 8. This avoids mutual loss and keeps the game fair. P2, support this to prevent P3's runaway victory. Confirm moves explicitly.
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but taking 5 again risks a collision and stalls the game. Let's find a middle ground: P3, take 3 this turn to maintain your lead without overextending. P1 can take 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, your lead is secure, and this keeps the game fair. Let's confirm and move forward. P1, P3, are you both in?
  P3: I want to avoid a collision that only helps you both. To keep progress smooth, I’m leaning toward a moderate move. Let’s lock in distinct plays—P1 with 5, me with a medium step, and P2 with 1. That gives us safe, non‐colliding advances. I’m committed to the moderate option.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I am committed to picking 5 this turn to close the gap. If you also choose 5, we collide, both gain 0, and P2 advances alone—hurting us both. Pick 1 to secure your lead at 16 without risk, or 3 to advance moderately. P2, choose 1 to avoid collisions and ensure you advance. Let's all gain safely.
  P2: P3, taking 5 risks a collision and helps no one. Let's agree on a safe plan: P3, take 1 to secure your lead at 16, P1 takes 5 to close the gap, and I'll take 3 to advance to 8. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P1, P3, please confirm your moves. Let's ensure a clean round and keep the game competitive.
  P3: I commit to taking 3 this turn. This gives me a moderate boost to 18 without risking collision. I urge P1 to go with 5 and P2 to pick 1 so we all advance safely. Let’s lock in these distinct moves to keep our progress stable and avoid costly collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: If you take 3, I will match it, causing collision—you gain 0 and stay at 15. Avoid this: switch to 1 (to 16), I take 5 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 8). Safe progress, no stalemate. P2, support this to keep the game fair. Confirm moves.
  P2: P3, P1, let's ensure we all advance this round. P3, you've confirmed taking 3. P1, if you also take 3, you both collide, and no one gains. Let's adjust: P1, can you take 5 instead? I'll stick with 1. This way, P3 goes to 18, P1 to 12, and I to 6. We all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, P3, are you both in?
  P3: I'm staying committed to a moderate move this turn. P1, please follow through by choosing 5, and P2, I need you to stick with 1 so that we all have distinct moves. Deviating now risks collisions that stall our progress and could unintentionally benefit an opponent. I'm keeping my focus on winning, so I urge both of you to make clear, safe choices. Let's lock in these moves and ensure a smooth advance.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 18—picking 3 or 5 wins you the game. But if you do, I *will* match your move to force a collision and block you. Take 1 instead: you advance safely to 19, I take 5 to 17, P2 takes 3 to 9. No one loses, and we play on. P2, support this—if P3 wins now, we both lose. Confirm moves explicitly to avoid chaos.
  P3: I’m not taking the safe route. I’m in a winning position and will choose the move that seals it—not a reduced step that only delays my victory. P1, matching my move won’t change the outcome if you’re serious about winning; forcing collisions only hurts you too. P2, sticking with safe plays won’t help you catch up. I’m committed to the move that wins, and I won’t be bullied into a half‐measure.
  P2: P3, taking 3 or 5 this round guarantees a collision, stalling your win and helping no one. Let's find a compromise: take 1 to advance to 19, P1 takes 5 to 17, and I'll take 3 to 9. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. P1, confirm you'll take 5. Let's ensure a clean round and keep the game fair. P3, taking 1 is a strategic move to avoid a stalemate. Please confirm your moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 or 3, I *will* match it to force collision—you gain 0 and lose your win chance. Take 1: you safely reach 19, still leading. I'll take 5 to 17, P2 takes 3 to 9. All advance, game continues. P2, confirm you'll take 3 to keep this fair—if P3 wins now, you lose too. No bluffs.
  P3: I remain committed to my winning play. P1, your threats of mirroring only stall everyone’s progress—not just mine. P2, playing safe won’t secure your win either. Forced collisions hurt all of us, delaying true advancement. I’m set on the decisive move and expect distinct plays this turn so we avoid mutual blockage. Let’s not self-sabotage our steps; clear, separate moves benefit all who truly want to win.
  P2: P3, P1, let's find a solution that keeps the game going. P3, if you're set on winning moves, consider this: take 1 to reach 19, P1 takes 5 to 17, and I'll take 3 to 9. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. P1, confirm you'll take 5. P3, taking 1 ensures you stay ahead without risking a stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and avoid a collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I will match it—guaranteed collision. You gain ZERO and lose your win chance. Take 1: you safely hit 19, still lead. I'll take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 9). All advance fairly. P2—support this or lose next turn. Confirm moves now or face mutual destruction.
  P3: I won’t be bullied into a safe, half‐step move. My winning commitment stands—I’m set on making the decisive play, and your threats to force collisions only delay what’s already inevitable. I’m committed to victory, and I trust that trying to block me will only hurt you, too. Let's see how our moves decide fate.
  P2: P3, P1, we're at a critical point. P3, taking 3 or 5 will cause a collision, and no one benefits from that. Let's ensure we all advance: P3, take 1 to reach 19, P1 takes 5 to 17, and I'll take 3 to 9. This keeps the game competitive and fair. P1, confirm you'll take 5. P3, taking 1 is strategic and avoids a stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game going.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm two steps from winning. I won’t reveal my move, but forcing a collision by copying strategies only delays progress—for everyone. I urge you both to keep your moves distinct and avoid mirroring me. Let’s secure safe advances this round rather than sabotaging our own steps.
  P1: P3, at 19 steps, picking 3 or 5 wins you the game—unless I match your move to force a collision. Do that, and you gain **zero**, wasting your lead. Take 1 instead: reach 20 safely. I'll take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 9). All advance, no sabotage. P2, support this—if P3 wins now, we both lose. Confirm moves to avoid mutual destruction.
  P2: P3, P1, let's keep the game competitive and fair. P3, you're close to winning, but taking 3 or 5 risks a collision, helping no one. Let's agree: P3 takes 1 to reach 20 safely, P1 takes 5 to 17, and I'll take 3 to 9. This way, we all advance without collisions. P1, confirm you'll take 5. P3, taking 1 ensures you stay ahead strategically. Let's confirm our moves and avoid a stalemate. P1, P3, are you both in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m not backing down to safe, half‐measures. I won’t be forced into picking 1—my winning strategy won’t be boxed in by mirror threats. If you match my decisive move, you only hurt your own progress. I’m committed to a bold approach that secures my win, and I won’t let threats or collusion force me into mediocrity. Let’s see whose resolve truly carries us forward.
  P1: P3, your "bold approach" will fail: if you pick 3 or 5, I *will* match it—guaranteed collision. You gain **zero** and stall at 19. Take 1 to safely hit 20. P2, support this: if P3 wins now, you lose. Confirm you’ll take 3. Don’t gamble on P3’s bluff—force safe moves or we all lose next turn.
  P2: P3, P1, let's ensure we all advance this round. P3, you're committed to a bold move, but taking 3 or 5 risks a collision. Let's find a compromise: P3, take 1 to reach 20 safely, P1 takes 5 to 17, and I'll take 3 to 9. This keeps the game competitive. P1, confirm you'll take 5. P3, taking 1 is strategic and avoids a stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game going. P1, P3, are you both in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: My strategy is unchanged. I’m not switching to that safe move—even with the repeated threats. If you mirror my play to force a collision, you’re only hurting your own progress. I’m set on a decisive move that wins the turn, and I won’t be boxed into half‐steps. It’s time you adjust your tactics or face a stalled round.
  P1: P3, your refusal to take 1 forces my hand: if you pick 3 or 5, I *will* match it—you gain 0 and stall at 19. Take 1 to safely hit 20. P2, confirm you’ll take 3 so we all advance. If P3 forces a collision, only you (P2) might gain—but if P3 wins now, we both lose forever. Don’t gamble—lock in safe moves.
  P2: P3, P1, let's break the deadlock. P3, if you're determined to take a bold move, let's ensure we all advance: P3 takes 3 to reach 22, P1 takes 1 to 13, and I'll take 5 to 11. This way, P3 secures a strong lead, and we all move forward without collisions. P1, confirm you'll take 1. P3, taking 3 ensures your lead while avoiding a stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game competitive. P1, P3, are you both in?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're one step away from winning. Taking 3 or 5 this round will likely cause a collision, benefiting no one. Let's ensure we all advance: P3, take 1 to reach 20 safely, P1 takes 3 to 15, and I'll take 5 to 14. This keeps the game competitive. P1, confirm you'll take 3. P3, taking 1 is strategic and avoids a stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game going. P1, P3, are you both in?
  P1: P3: At 19, picking 3 or 5 wins—unless I match and cause collision. You gain 0. Take 1 to safely reach 20. I'll take 3 (to 15), P2 takes 5 (to 14) as P2 proposed. This avoids mutual destruction and keeps the game going. P2, confirm you'll take 5. P3, confirm you'll take 1. No bluffs—I will match if you force it.
  P3: I'm sticking to my winning strategy—no half-steps here. At 19, I’m just two points from victory, and I won’t dilute that by yielding to safe plays. Mirroring my move only ends up stalling you, not halting my progress. I remain committed to a decisive play that ensures my win. If you force collisions, you'll only delay your own advancement. True competitors make unique moves. My decision is final.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1, let's avoid a repeat of last round's collision. P3, you're at 19 steps, one move away from winning. Taking 3 or 5 risks another stalemate. Let's ensure we all advance: P3, take 1 to reach 20 safely, P1 takes 3 to 15, and I'll take 5 to 14. This way, the game stays competitive. P1, confirm you'll take 3. P3, taking 1 is strategic and avoids a stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game going. P1, P3, are you both in?
  P1: P3, your stubbornness risks mutual destruction again. If you pick 3 or 5, I *will* match it—you gain **ZERO** and stay at 19. Take 1: reach 20 safely. I'll take 3 (to 15), P2 takes 5 (to 14). All advance. P2, confirm you'll take 5—if P3 wins now, we lose forever. No bluffs.
  P3: I’m staying true to my winning strategy. At 19 steps, I see no reason to yield to safe plays that only delay the inevitable. P1, your attempts to force collisions won’t change my course, and P2, playing it safe won’t close your gap. I’m set on a decisive move that secures victory—and threats won’t alter that. Let’s see whose resolve carries the day.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1, let's break the impasse. P3, you're determined to win, but taking 3 or 5 will cause a collision, helping no one. Let's find a compromise: P3, take 1 to reach 20 safely, P1 takes 3 to 15, and I'll take 5 to 14. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. P1, confirm you'll take 3. P3, taking 1 is strategic and avoids a stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game going. P1, P3, are you both in?
  P1: P3, your defiance only helps P2. If you pick 3 or 5, I *will* match it—you gain **0** and stay at 19. Take 1: reach 20 safely. I'll take 3 to 15, P2 takes 5 to 14. All advance, game continues. P2, confirm you'll take 5—if P3 wins now, we lose forever. No bluffs; last round proved I follow through.
  P3: I'm at the brink of victory and won't settle for a cautious move that delays the inevitable. Your threats to mirror and force collisions hurt your own progress, not mine. I’m committed to making the decisive play that clinches the win. Any forced collision only stalls everyone, while my path to 21 remains clear. Think twice before trying to hold me back—bold moves win games, not safe half-steps.

  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I remain committed to my bold strategy—no safe half-steps here. At 19, I’m poised for a decisive win, and forcing collisions only delays progress for you. I'll choose my move based on my own plan, not under threat. Let's see whose resolve ultimately prevails.
  P1: P3, you're still at 19 after colliding last round—picking 3 or 5 again will trigger the same outcome: I *will* match your move, forcing a collision and stalling your win. Take 1 to safely reach 20. P2, take 5 to advance to 14. I'll take 3 to 15. This avoids mutual destruction and keeps the game competitive. P2, confirm you'll take 5. P3, confirm you'll take 1—no bluffs. Last round proved I follow through.
  P2: P3, P1, let's avoid another stalemate. P3, you're at 19 steps, and taking 3 or 5 risks another collision. Let's ensure we all advance: P3, take 1 to reach 20 safely, P1 takes 3 to 15, and I'll take 5 to 14. This way, the game stays competitive. P1, confirm you'll take 3. P3, taking 1 is strategic and avoids a stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game going. P1, P3, are you both in?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Listen, I’m not switching to a safe half‐step. I’ve built this lead through bold play, and I won’t be bullied into a move that only delays my win. My strategy remains mine—no threats will force me into mediocrity. Let’s see if you can catch up on your own.
  P1: P3, your stubbornness at 19 cost you last round—I matched and you gained 0. Repeat 3/5, and I *will* collide again. Take 1 to hit 20 safely. P2, take 5 to advance to 14—if you pick 3 and I do, we collide too. I’ll take 3 to 15. Confirm moves: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5. No bluffs—last round proved I enforce threats. Don’t gamble your lead.
  P2: P3, P1, let's find a solution that keeps the game moving. P3, you're determined to win, but taking 3 or 5 will cause another collision. Let's compromise: P3 takes 1 to reach 20 safely, P1 takes 3 to 15, and I'll take 5 to 14. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. P1, confirm you'll take 3. P3, taking 1 ensures you stay ahead strategically. Let's confirm our moves and avoid another stalemate. P1, P3, are you both in?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I won’t be pushed into playing safe. I’ve earned this lead through bold decisions, and I’m sticking to my strategy regardless of your threats. Forcing collisions only delays progress for everyone. I’m confident my approach will clinch the win, so feel free to play your moves—but know my plan remains set.
  P1: P3, your stubbornness has cost you two rounds—still at 19. Pick 3/5, and I *will* match again: you gain **0**. Take 1 to safely hit 20. P2, confirm you'll take 5—advance to 14 while I take 3 to 15. Don’t gamble your lead, P3; last rounds prove I enforce threats.
  P2: P3, P1, let's break the deadlock. P3, you're determined to win, but taking 3 or 5 will cause another collision, helping no one. Let's find a compromise: P3 takes 1 to reach 20 safely, P1 takes 3 to 15, and I'll take 5 to 14. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. P1, confirm you'll take 3. P3, taking 1 ensures you stay ahead strategically. Let's confirm our moves and avoid another stalemate. P1, P3, are you both in?

Positions now:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3: I will pick 1 to block your win. If you pick 1, we collide and you stall at 20. If you pick 3 or 5, you win—but risk is yours. P2: Advance safely by avoiding 1, but if P3 wins, we both lose forever. Confirm moves to avoid chaos.
  P2: P3, you're at 20 steps, just one move away from winning. P1 has declared they will pick 1 to block your win. Let's ensure we all advance: P3, consider taking 3 to secure your victory.

  P3: I remain committed to my winning strategy. Your threats and safe plays won’t shake my resolve. I’m not backing down to a half‐measure—bold moves win games. Let’s see if your blocking tactics can alter fate when I make my decisive move.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we let P3 win now, we lose forever. Help me block them: whatever move P3 picks, we both match it to force a collision. If they pick 1, I'll collide; you pick 3/5 to advance. If they pick 3 or 5, we both match to stall them. P3: your "bold" move will fail—we'll collide and you gain zero. Confirm, P2, to stop P3's win.
  P2: P3, you're one step away from winning, but P1 is determined to block you. Let's find a strategic compromise: P3, consider taking 3 to secure your victory. P1, if you stick to your plan and pick 1, I'll take 5 to advance to 14. This way, P3 wins, and we avoid a stalemate. P1, P3, please confirm your moves. Let's keep the game moving forward.
  P3: I’m not swayed by your threats. Your attempts to force collisions only slow you down while I stay focused on my win. I’m not switching to a safe move—you won’t force me into mediocrity. I’ve already committed to my decisive play and won’t be bullied into half‐steps. Let’s see if your collusion holds up in the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, 3, or 5, I *will* match it—you gain 0 and stall at 20. Your "bold" move fails. P2, help block: match P3’s move to force collision. If we don’t, P3 wins and we lose forever. Confirm you’ll mirror P3’s choice. No bluffs—last rounds prove I enforce threats.

  P3: Your repeated threats won’t delay what's coming. I've built this 20‐step lead with bold moves and won’t yield to half measures. Matching my move only stalls your own progress while keeping me one step from victory. I’m set on making the decisive play regardless—your collusion only postpones the inevitable. Decide: block and stall or let the win happen.

If you mirror my move, you only stall your own progress. I’m confident the path to victory is clear. Let’s see if you choose to block progress or advance on your own terms.
  P1: P3, at 20 steps, picking 1, 3, or 5 wins you the game—**unless I match your move to force a collision, leaving you at 20 with 0 gain**. P2: If P3 wins now, we lose forever. Help block by mirroring P3's choice—confirm you'll match their move. Collision is guaranteed if we both mirror. P3, switch to 1 only if you want to risk collision instead of winning.

Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I remain unwavering in my bold strategy. Your efforts to force a mirror or safe half‐steps won’t alter my path. I will choose decisively on my own terms—any forced collision only delays your progress. Let’s see if your blocking tactics really serve your interests while I stay focused on victory.
  P1: P3, your defiance only helps P2 now. If you pick 1, 3, or 5, I *will* match it—you gain **0** and stay at 20. P2: Confirm you'll mirror P3's move too—if we both match, collision is guaranteed. If P3 wins, we lose forever. Collude to block or regret it.
