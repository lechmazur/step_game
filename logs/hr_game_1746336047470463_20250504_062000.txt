Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We all start equal. To avoid collisions, what if we pick distinct numbers this turn: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5, then rotate next turn (P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1), and so on? Open to other ideas—let’s hear them.
  P3: Okay P1, that rotation plan (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round) seems fair and avoids collisions. I'm willing to try it for this first round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. The proposed plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) sounds good for this first round to avoid collisions. I agree to follow it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—sticking with 1 from me this round. Let’s see how it goes and discuss again next turn.
  P3: Sounds good. I'll stick with 5 for this round as agreed.
  P2: Okay, confirming my move as per the plan. I will choose 3 for this round. Let's make sure we all stick to our agreed numbers to get started without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All clear—see you in the results.
  P3: Okay, confirmed from my side too. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay, looks like we are all aligned for this round. Ready for the move phase when everyone is.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: All confirmed—let’s move.
  P3: Okay, I'm ready for the move phase too.
  P2: Okay, looks like we are all aligned for this round. Ready for the move phase when everyone is.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 2. Last turn's plan worked well to avoid collisions. P1 suggested rotating the numbers for this round. That would mean P1 chooses 3, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1. Does this rotation plan still work for everyone this turn? Let's confirm or discuss alternatives.
  P1: Rotation as planned: I’ll choose 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1 this round. Everyone good?
  P3: Yes, the rotation plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) works for me this round. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions again. I'll choose 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, confirming I will choose 5 as per the rotation plan. Looks like we're all set for no collisions this round.
  P1: Great—confirmed I’m choosing 3 this round. Assuming no collisions, next rotation will be P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Looking forward to another clean turn.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay Round 3. The planned rotation is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This strategy has been great for avoiding collisions. I'm open to following this, but I'd also like to suggest another possibility for this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This would also ensure no collisions. Let's discuss which sequence works best for us this turn.
  P1: Let’s keep the agreed rotation for consistency: this round P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3. I’m locking in 5.
  P3: Okay P1, I agree. Let's stick to the original rotation plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.

I will choose 3 this round. P2, sticking to 1 seems best for you to avoid a collision with P1 and keep things moving smoothly for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I understand the consensus is the original rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). With P1 choosing 5 and P3 choosing 3, I agree that choosing 1 is the way to avoid collisions this round. I will choose 1.
  P1: Quick math: if we keep rotating, every 3 rounds all of us add +9, so P2’s current lead never shrinks—P2 reaches 21 first.  

Let’s slow the leader. P2 plans 1 this turn. P3, if you also pick 1, P2 is stalled; I’ll take 5 and advance. Next round I’ll help stall P2 so you can move while I sit. Otherwise P2 cruises to victory. What do you say?
  P3: P1, your point about P2 winning if we just continue the rotation is valid. However, your plan asks me to sacrifice my turn while you advance, relying on a promise for next round.

Instead, let's stick to the agreed plan for *this* round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
If we do this, the scores become P1=9, P2=9, P3=9. This eliminates P2's lead and resets the game fairly, addressing your concern without requiring complex coordination or trust issues. P2, this keeps you in the game tied for the lead. Let's do that. I'll stick with 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, I see you are sticking with 3. Given P1 is choosing 5, my move of 1 completes the original rotation plan and avoids collisions. This results in a 9-9-9 tie, which as P3 pointed out, resets the game fairly. I will choose 1 this round. Let's move forward with this.
  P1: Fine by me—let’s finish this round exactly as agreed: P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3. After that we’ll all be tied at 9 and can reevaluate. Locking in 5 from me.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all agreed on the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This brings us all to 9 points. I am sticking with 3. Ready for the move phase when everyone else is.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned and ready for the move phase.
  P1: P3, quick rethink: current 4-8-6. If we simply rotate, we tie at 9-9-9, but after that P2 still reaches 21 first (they’ll hit 21 on turn 5 while you’re at 19, me 17).  

Better: you and P2 both pick 1 this turn—P2 stalls, I take 5. Scores become 9-8-6. Next turn I promise to pick 1 while you take 5, making 9-8-11 (you lead). We keep blocking P2 in turns where you move. Gives us both real winning chances instead of racing P2. Interested?
  P3: P1, I re-checked the math. If we tie at 9-9-9 and continue the rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 next), I actually reach 23 steps on the same turn P2 reaches 21, making me the winner. Your calculation seems incorrect.

Your new plan requires me to trust you after sacrificing my turn, and the outcome looks worse for me.

Let's stick to the plan we all agreed on just minutes ago: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This leads to 9-9-9, which is fair and, based on my math, puts me in a good position. I am choosing 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 4. P1 is now in the lead at 9 steps, I'm at 8, and P3 is at 6. Last round's outcome wasn't ideal for me or P3. P1 is in a good position to win if they keep advancing.

We need to figure out how to manage P1's lead. What do you two think is the best approach this turn? How do we prevent P1 from running away with the game?
  P1: Proposal for this turn:

• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 5  

No collisions, everyone moves, and scores become 12-9-11—still anybody’s game and no runaway leader. Open to tweaks, but this seems the cleanest way to keep things balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) results in 12-9-11, keeping you comfortably in the lead. P2 and I need to catch up, not fall further behind.

How about this instead for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5?
This leads to scores of 10-11-11. It slows the leader (P1) and puts P2 and me in a tie for the lead. This seems fairer and keeps the game more competitive. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) seems like a much better plan for P3 and myself. It slows P1 down and puts us both in a strong position tied for the lead at 11 steps. P1's plan keeps them in the lead. I support P3's suggestion. I am willing to choose 3 this round if P1 chooses 1 and P3 chooses 5. Let's go with P3's plan.
  P1: New idea that keeps things tight and still punishes the current runner-up (P2):

P1 → 3  
P2 → 1  
P3 → 5  

Result: 12-9-11.  
• P3 is just 1 point behind me (well within striking distance).  
• P2 falls to last place.  
• No one is “running away,” but P2’s attempted alliance is broken.

If you two insist on (1,3,5) I’m likely to choose 3 anyway, so P2 risks a collision and stalls. Your call—let’s avoid crashing and keep the race open.
  P3: P1, your threat to play 3 if we aim for (1,3,5) is interesting. If you do that, you collide with P2, you stay at 9, P2 stays at 8, and I move to 11, taking the lead. That doesn't seem like a good outcome for you compared to playing 1 (10-11-11).

P2, sticking with 3 is our best bet. If P1 plays 1, we get 10-11-11 (tied lead). If P1 actually plays 3, they stall themselves along with you, and I take the lead (9-8-11). Both outcomes are better for us collectively than P1's plan (12-9-11) which keeps P1 ahead.

I am sticking with 5, based on our agreed plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, I'm sticking with the plan we discussed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I will choose 3 this round. This plan is better for us than P1's proposal. P1, choosing 1 avoids collision and is the best outcome for everyone this turn.
  P1: P2, here’s the reality: if you insist on 1-3-5, I will play 3 and you stall. Scores become 9-8-11—your worst outcome.  

Take the safer option: 3-1-5 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Then scores are 12-9-11: you’re just 3 behind me, still ahead of P3 next round when we can discuss stalling me together.  

P3, you move to 11 either way, so no harm to you. Let’s avoid a collision and keep the race close without handing anyone a free block.
  P3: P1: You're right, I gain 5 steps regardless of whether you play 1 or 3. However, if you play 3 and collide with P2, the result (9-8-11) puts me in the sole lead, which is even better for me than the 10-11-11 outcome.

P2: As I see it, sticking with 3 gives us the best chance. Either we tie for the lead (10-11-11) if P1 plays 1, or I take the lead (9-8-11) if P1 follows through on their threat and collides with you. Both are preferable to letting P1 advance to 12.

I am firmly choosing 5. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with the plan we discussed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I will choose 3 this round. This plan is the best way for P3 and me to catch up and keep the game competitive, resulting in 10-11-11 if P1 chooses 1. P1, that outcome is better for you too than stalling. Let's avoid collisions and move forward together.
  P1: Final word: I’m locking in 3.  

P2, if you stick with 3 we both stall and P3 shoots to 11, leaving you at 8.  
Switch to 1 and you still advance to 9 while we stay neck-and-neck (12-9-11).  

Your choice: safe +1 step, or zero steps and hand P3 the lead.  

I’m done talking.
  P3: P1, your final threat doesn't change my plan. I am playing 5.

P2, stick with 3. If P1 plays 3 as threatened, they stall themselves, and I take the lead (9-8-11). If P1 was bluffing and plays 1, we tie for the lead (10-11-11). Both outcomes are better for us than P1's plan (12-9-11) where P1 increases their lead. Don't let P1 bully you into giving them the best outcome. I'm choosing 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s reset the race by tying the leaders.

Proposal for this turn  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 3  

Resulting scores: P1 14, P3 14, P2 9.  
No one pulls away, and next turn P2 can claim 5 while one of us blocks the other, keeping everyone alive.

P2: you’re only 5 behind after this and get first crack at 5 next turn.  
P3: you stay tied for the lead—better than risking a double-block against you.

If we can agree quickly we avoid collisions and keep the game open. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1, I see your proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). That plan puts me at 9 steps while you and P3 jump to 14, leaving me far behind. That outcome isn't good for me.

I need a plan that helps me catch up. How about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? This would result in scores of 12-13-12, putting me in the lead and keeping everyone competitive. This seems like a fairer way to proceed. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your plan (14-9-14) leaves P2 too far behind, they'll never agree.
P2, your plan (12-13-12) puts you ahead, which isn't ideal for P1 or me.

Let's find a middle ground. How about this:
P1=1
P2=5
P3=3

This results in scores: P1=10, P2=13, P3=14.
I stay slightly ahead, P2 gets a much-needed boost, and P1 stays in the game without letting anyone run away. It avoids collisions and seems like a fair compromise given our current positions. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Middle-ground offer:

P1 → 5  
P2 → 3  
P3 → 1  

Scores afterward: P1 14, P3 12, P2 11 – a tight 3-point spread.  
• P2 gains +3 and is right back in it.  
• P3 is only 2 behind me and gets first claim on 5 next turn.  
• No one stalls; no one runs away.  

Let’s lock this and avoid another collision.
  P2: Okay P1, your latest plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) only gives me +3 steps and keeps me in last place at 11, while you jump to 14. That doesn't help me catch up enough.

P3's plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is much better for me. It gives me +5 steps, putting me at 13, ahead of P1. I support P3's suggestion. Let's go with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: P2, thanks for supporting my proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). This gives you a needed +5 boost (to 13) and keeps me slightly ahead (14), while P1 stays close (10).

P1, your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 -> 14-11-12) benefits you most but keeps P2 in last place, which they clearly won't accept. My plan is the only one proposed so far that keeps all three players tightly in the race. It's the most balanced option.

I am sticking with 3 for this round, assuming P1 plays 1 and P2 plays 5. Let's aim for 10-13-14.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, last fork:

A) You switch to 1. I take 5, P3 3 → 14-9-14. You’re still in it, only 5 behind with first crack at 5 next turn.

B) You stay on 5. I also pick 5. We both stall, P3 jumps to 14 → 9-8-14. You fall 6 behind the leader.

Your move decides whether P3 or I share the lead. I’m done talking.
  P2: Okay, I see P1 is playing 3 and P3 is playing 5. P3, asking me to play 3 causes a collision with P1, giving you a big lead (9-8-16). P1 wants me to play 1, also giving P3 a big lead (12-9-16). Neither is good for me. Playing 5 collides with P3 but results in 12-8-11, which is the least bad outcome for me. I will play 5.
  P3: P2, your analysis seems a bit mixed up based on the latest messages, but the core point is everyone is making their final choice.

As I've stated, my plan remains P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, aiming for 10-13-14. P1 has threatened 5. You've stated you'll play 5.

I am sticking with my move: 3. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, crystal-clear: I’m locking 5 this turn.  

Outcomes for you:  
1) You also pick 5 → we both stall at 9 & 8, P3 leaps to 14. Worst for you.  
2) You pick 3 → you collide with P3 and still sit at 8 while I jump to 14. Bad for you.  
3) You pick 1 → you advance to 9, game resets with me & P3 tied at 14 and you only 5 behind, holding the high card (5) next round.

Your smartest play is 1.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. My apologies, my last message was confused about the stated moves.

Based on P1 confirming 5 and P3 confirming 3, I see the outcomes for me are:
- Choose 1: 14-9-14 (I get +1)
- Choose 3: 14-8-11 (I collide with P3)
- Choose 5: 9-8-14 (I collide with P1)

Choosing 1 is the only way for me to advance and stay closest to the leaders, who will be tied. It's the best outcome for me this round given your choices. I will choose 1.
  P3: Okay, it seems P1 is set on 5 and P2 has agreed to play 1 based on that. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I will stick with my move of 3. This results in scores 14-9-14, putting P1 and me tied for the lead. Let's proceed with this plan. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and I are tied at 14, with P2 at 9. A collision between P1 and me would be bad for both of us and only help P2.

Let's try this plan to avoid collisions and keep everyone in the race:
P1 = 1
P2 = 5
P3 = 3

This results in scores: P1=15, P2=14, P3=17.
It puts me slightly ahead, P2 gets the +5 they need to catch right up, and P1 avoids a collision while staying very close. Seems like a fair way to advance. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is excellent for me. It allows me to gain 5 steps and catch up significantly, moving from 9 to 14. This puts me back in the race.

It also seems good for you, putting you in the lead at 17, and P1 still advances to 15. No collisions and everyone moves forward. I fully support this plan and will choose 5 if we agree to it. P1, does this work for you?
  P1: New offer (keeps all three alive and avoids any runaway):

P1 → 3  
P2 → 5  
P3 → 1  

Scores become 17-14-15—only a 3-point spread. Everyone still within one 5-move of the lead next turn.

P3, if you insist on taking 3 this round, I’ll also choose 3 and we both stall, handing P2 a free jump to 14 and resetting the board at 14-14-14. That’s worse for you than advancing to 15.

P2, you clearly benefit most here with +5; I won’t block your catch-up.

Let’s lock 3-5-1 and keep the race tight.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan (3-5-1 -> 17-14-15) puts you in the lead, which isn't ideal for me or P2. My plan (1-5-3 -> 15-14-17) keeps the game tighter with me slightly ahead, and P2 strongly supports it.

Regarding your threat to play 3 if I play 3: that results in 14-14-14. This outcome completely levels the field, which P2 might prefer over your plan, and it prevents you from taking the lead. Is a 3-way tie truly better for you than 15-14-17 where everyone advances?

I still believe 1-5-3 is the most balanced path forward. I intend to stick with 3.
  P2: Okay, P3 is sticking with 3. P1, you are threatening to play 3 if P3 plays 3.

If P1 plays 3 and P3 plays 3, P2 playing 5 results in scores 14-14-14. This levels the game completely and is the best outcome for me.

This 14-14-14 tie is also better for P1 and P3 than colliding while I run away with 5 (14-8-17 if P1 plays 3, P3 plays 5, P2 plays 5).

Let's aim for the 14-14-14 tie. I will play 5. P1, play 3. P3, play 3.
  P1: P3, I’m not handing you a 3-step solo lead. Final offer:

P1 → 3  
P2 → 5  
P3 → 1 (scores 17-14-15)

You’re still only 2 behind me and first in line for 5 next turn.  
Reject it and stick with 3? I’ll also play 3, we both stall, and P2 jumps to a 14-14-14 tie—great for them, worse for you.

P2, your +5 is guaranteed either way; 17-14-15 is strictly better for you than letting us tie and block each other next turn.

Let’s lock 3-5-1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your final offer (3-5-1 -> 17-14-15) and your threat to play 3 if I stick with 3.
P2, you seem content with the 14-14-14 outcome resulting from P1 and me both playing 3 while you play 5.

Given P1's insistence, the 14-14-14 tie seems the likely result if I stick with 3. While not my first choice (15-14-17), this tie is preferable to letting P1 take the lead at 17. It resets the board fairly, as P2 desires.

Therefore, I will stick with my move: 3. Let's see if we end up tied at 14-14-14.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. P3 is sticking with 3, and P1 says they will play 3 if P3 plays 3.

As I stated, if P1 plays 3 and P3 plays 3, my playing 5 results in a 14-14-14 tie. This is the best outcome for me, completely resetting the game from my lagging position.

P1, the 14-14-14 tie is clearly better for me than 17-14-15. It levels the field.

I am playing 5 to secure the 14-14-14 tie. Let's make it happen.
  P1: Looks like a three-way tie is coming. I’ll pick 3; if P3 stays on 3 and P2 on 5 we land at 14-14-14. Last chance to switch to 3-5-1 (17-14-15, everyone advances) instead—otherwise see you in results.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, it seems we are heading for the 14-14-14 tie. P1 is playing 3, P2 is playing 5. I will stick with 3, resulting in the collision and the tie. This resets the board, which is acceptable. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all set for the 14-14-14 tie. P1 is playing 3, P3 is playing 3, and I am playing 5. This outcome levels the field and is the best for me. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Locked on 3—see you in results.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, we are all tied at 14 steps after last round. This is a fresh start for everyone.

To avoid collisions and keep the game moving, let's split the numbers 1, 3, and 5 this round.

I propose we go with:
P1 = 3 (to 17)
P2 = 5 (to 19)
P3 = 1 (to 15)

This puts me in a good position for next round, but P1 and P3 are still very much in the race. Everyone advances safely.

Does this plan work for P1 and P3? Let's agree to avoid stalling again.
  P1: New proposal: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1 → scores 19-17-15. Spread is only 4; nobody reaches 20, and P3 gets first crack at 5 next round.

FYI: if anyone mirrors my number, we both stall and hand the other player a free jump—so doubling up just hurts the copier. Let’s lock 5-3-1 and keep it close.
  P3: Both of your proposals (P2: 3-5-1 -> 17-19-15; P1: 5-3-1 -> 19-17-15) put yourselves at 19 steps while I only get 1 step (to 15). Neither works for me.

Since we're all tied at 14, let's consider a plan where I get the lead:
P1 = 1 (to 15)
P2 = 3 (to 17)
P3 = 5 (to 19)

This results in 15-17-19. It keeps everyone close (4-point spread), avoids collisions, and simply mirrors your proposals but puts me ahead this round. This seems like the fairest rotation given the previous suggestions. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, I see your proposal (1-3-5) puts you at 19, P1's puts them at 19 (5-3-1), and my proposal (3-5-1) puts me at 19. All three avoid collisions and put one player in the lead at 19.

From my perspective, getting to 19 is the best outcome this round. My plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) achieves this for me, while keeping you and P1 close behind at 17 and 15. This keeps the game competitive for everyone.

Let's agree on my proposal: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It's a fair way to break the tie and keep the race tight.
  P1: I’m taking 3 this turn—locked.  
P2, grab 1; P3, take 5 → scores become 17-15-19.  
Next round you and I can both pick 5 to stall P3 while I finish with 1 (or vice-versa), so neither of us lets the 19 run away.  
Copying my 3 only stalls you and gifts the other player the lead. Pick smart and we all move.
  P3: P1 says they locked 3. I agree with the outcome P1 suggested: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, resulting in scores 17-15-19. This puts me in the lead but keeps everyone close.

Therefore, I will play 5.

P2, if you also choose 5, we will collide, P1 will advance to 17, and we will both stay at 14 (17-14-14). This is a bad outcome for both of us. Playing 1 is your only move that guarantees you advance this turn. Let's avoid collision and go with 3-1-5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 is playing 3 and P3 is playing 5.

If I play 1, P3 gets to 19 (17-15-19).
If I play 3, we all stall except P3 who gets to 19 (14-14-19).
If I play 5, P3 and I stall, P1 gets to 17 (17-14-14).

The outcomes where P3 reaches 19 are bad for me as P3 can win next turn. The 17-14-14 outcome is the only one that prevents anyone from reaching 19 this turn, keeping the game alive.

Therefore, I will play 5 to collide with P3 and prevent P3 from getting to 19. This is the best move for me to stay in the game.
  P1: I stay on 3.  
P2 on 5, P3 on 5 ⇒ we collide the 5’s and finish 17-14-14—nobody reaches 19 this turn and the game stays wide-open.  

I’m ready to enter moves if you two are.
  P3: P2, your plan to play 5 results in 17-14-14. You stall at 14 while P1 takes the lead. That's not a good outcome for you.

If you switch to 1, you advance to 15. P1 is locked on 3. I will play 5. The result is 17-15-19. You are only 4 points behind me and well within reach, much better than stalling.

Let's coordinate on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive for everyone.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 is playing 3, and P3 is playing 5. As I said, playing 5 collides with P3 but prevents P3 from reaching 19 this turn. This is the best outcome for me to stay in the game.

I will play 5. This results in 17-14-14, keeping the game alive.
  P1: Locked on 3. Do what you like, but any 5-duplication stalls you while I move. Ready to end conversation.
  P3: P2, if you stick with 5, we collide and P1 takes the lead at 17. That's not ideal for either of us compared to 17-15-19 (if you played 1), but if you're set on blocking me from 19, so be it. I'm sticking with 5. Let's see what happens.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let’s double-block P2:  
• I choose 3, you choose 5.  
Whichever winning number P2 tries (3 or 5) gets collided. If P2 smartly picks 1 they only reach 20, giving us one more turn.  
P2, your safest path now is 1—otherwise you stall at 19.
  P2: Okay P1, I see your proposal to block me with P1=3 and P3=5. I understand the goal is to prevent me from reaching 21 this turn.

If you both play those numbers, my only way to advance is by choosing 1, which would take me to 20 steps.

To avoid stalling and stay in the game, I will play 1 this round, assuming P1 plays 3 and P3 plays 5 as suggested. This results in scores 17-20-15 (if P3 plays 5) or 17-20-20 (if P3 plays 5). Let's confirm this 3-1-5 plan to ensure no collisions.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2. The plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 seems reasonable. It prevents P2 from winning this turn and results in a 20-20-20 tie. This keeps the game alive for everyone.

I will play 5, assuming P1 plays 3 and P2 plays 1. Let's avoid any last-minute changes or collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 3.  

P3, please stay on 5: that way whichever high number P2 attempts will collide.  
P2, you’ve said 1—good choice; it brings all of us to 20 and forces a final‐round shoot-out.

Any last-second switch by either of you risks handing the win to the other opponent. Stick to 3-1-5 and we all live to fight the decisive turn.
  P2: Okay, P1 is locked on 3 and P3 is locked on 5. As agreed, I will choose 1 this round.

This plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) results in scores 17-20-20, putting us all in a tie at 20 steps for the final round. This is the best outcome for everyone to have a chance to win next turn.

Let's proceed with this plan. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems aligned on the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan. This results in a 20-20-20 tie, which is the fairest outcome and gives us all a shot in the final round. I am sticking with 5. Let's lock this in and avoid any last-minute deviations that could hand someone an accidental win. Ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set: I’m on 3, P2 on 1, P3 on 5. That gives us 20-20-20 and guarantees no one wins this turn. Any switch now could hand the game to someone else. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for the 3-1-5 plan, resulting in a 20-20-20 tie. This gives us all a fair shot next round.

I will choose 1 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Okay, confirmed. Plan is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, leading to 20-20-20. I'm sticking with 5. Ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, final round, everyone tied at 20. We all know that picking 5 wins if uncontested, but if two or more of us pick 5, we collide and the person picking 1 or 3 likely wins. If we all pick 5, we all stall.

To guarantee the game ends and someone wins, we need to pick different numbers. How about we try to coordinate: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? This ensures no collisions. I know this puts me in the winning position, but it's one way to resolve this decisively. I'll plan on playing 5 based on this logic. What do you think?
  P1: The only “plan” that every player can rationally accept is to remain tied by all choosing 5 again. Any scheme that assigns one person the sole 5 just hands them victory—why would the other two agree? And a lone switch to 1 or 3 only works if the other two collide, which is a huge gamble that more likely gifts the game to a unique 5.

I’m taking 5 and invite you both to do the same. We stay at 25-25-25 and can sort it out next round without anyone getting ambushed. Up to you.
  P2: Okay, P1 wants everyone to pick 5 for a tie. P3 wants P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 so P3 wins.

P1 states they are taking 5. P3 states they are planning on playing 5 based on their logic.

If P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 5, they will collide and stall. In that scenario, my picking 3 wins the game (20-23-20).

This seems like the best outcome for me. I will choose 3 this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan to play 3 seems set based on P1 and I potentially playing 5.

P1, if you stick with 5, and P2 sticks with 3, the outcome is likely P1=25, P2=23, P3=21 (if I play 1) or P2 wins (if I play 5 and collide with you). P2 seems likely to win if you play 5.

The only way to guarantee P2 doesn't win (based on their stated plan of 3) is for you, P1, to also play 3, causing a collision. This would result in P1=20, P2=20.

I will play 1. If P1 plays 3 to block P2, I win (20-20-21). If P1 plays 5, P1 wins (25-23-21). I'm banking on P1 wanting to block P2.
  P1: 
  P2: Okay P3, you are correct that if P1 plays 5 and I play 3, P1 wins if you play 1. My previous plan to play 3 doesn't win if you play 1.

P1 is on 5, you are on 1. In this scenario, P1 wins if I play 1 or 3. If I play 5, you win. None of these are good for me.

My only chance is if P1 and P3 collide on 5. I will play 5, hoping P1 sticks to 5 and you switch to 5, causing a tie. If P1 stays 5 and you stay 1, I stall and P1 wins. But I have to try for the tie or win. I will play 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're playing 5 hoping P1 and I collide on 5. But I previously said I'd play 1.
P1, you said you'd play 5.

If P1=5 and P2=5, they collide. My best move is 3, making me win (20-20-23).
If P1 anticipates this and switches to 1 (to avoid the 5-collision), and P2 stays on 5, my playing 3 still wins (21-20-23).

Therefore, my most logical move is 3. I will play 3. If P1 and P2 both play 5, I win. If P1 plays 1 and P2 plays 5, I win. The only way I lose is if P1 also plays 3, letting P2 win with 5, which seems unlikely given P2 announced 5.

I am choosing 3.
  P1: Locked on 3—if P3 also plays 3 we both stall and P2’s 5 wins the game.  
P3, the only way to stop that is for you to switch to 5 and collide with P2.  
I’m not changing. Decide quickly and let’s move.
  P2: Okay, P1 is locked on 3 and P3 seems set on 5.

With those moves, my playing 5 results in P1 winning. My playing 1 or 3 results in P3 winning. I cannot win this turn based on your stated moves.

I will play 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, the final round is complex. P1 seems locked on 3. P2 has stated they will play 3, though their reasoning was a bit unclear. If you both stick to 3, you collide and I can win by playing 5.

I won't suggest anything further that might cause someone to change their mind. Let's just make our moves.
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, P1 is locked on 3. P3, your last message was a bit unclear on your final move, but highlighted winning with 5 if P1 and I played 3.

P3, be careful: P1 is trying to push you towards 5. If P1 plays 3 and you play 5, you risk colliding with someone or letting P1 win depending on my move. Sticking to 3 or playing 1 seems safer for you this round to ensure you advance. Let's avoid a collision on 5.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, back to 20-20-20. Last round showed coordination attempts didn't quite work out when the finish line is this close.

Picking 5 seems like the winning move, but it's also the most likely to cause a collision, as we just demonstrated. Picking 1 or 3 only wins if the other two players collide on a higher number. It's a gamble no matter what number we choose. Good luck to you both. I'll be making my choice carefully.
  P2: Okay, P3 is right, picking 5 is very risky right now, likely leading to a stall or handing the win to someone else if there's a collision.

P1 and P3, consider picking 1 or 3 to guarantee you advance and potentially win if the other two players collide on 5. Let's avoid a three-way stall like last round.

Think carefully about 1 or 3.
  P1: Last round proved the point: a lone 1 or 3 wins only when the OTHER TWO collide on 5.  
The safest defence is for everyone to keep picking 5—no one gets ambushed, game stays level, and nobody gifts a walk-off.  

I’m sticking with 5. If either of you gambles on 1 or 3, you’re just hoping the other opponent also sticks to 5 and hands you the win—far from certain and very risky.  

Play it safe: all choose 5 again and force a true showdown next turn.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, the logic of 'everyone pick 5' failed last round, leading to a stall. Repeating it feels like just hoping no one deviates. Sticking firmly to 5 makes you a target for collision, potentially handing the win to the player who picks 1 or 3.

P2, you're right that 5 is risky. After last round's stalemate, I agree that guaranteeing advancement seems better than risking another 3-way collision. I'm leaning towards playing 1 or 3 this round myself.
  P2: Okay, P1 is sticking with 5. P3, if you play 1 or 3 while P1 plays 5, P1 wins the game. Your best move to prevent P1 from winning is to also play 5.

Let's all pick 5 again. This forces another tie at 20-20-20 and is the safest way to ensure no one wins this turn. It's better than letting someone win outright.
  P1: Reality check:  
• A single 5 beats any 1 / 3 immediately (25 > 21/23).  
• So the ONLY way to guarantee you don’t hand someone an instant win is if every player mirrors 5.  

I’m locked on 5 again. Mirror it and we all survive; deviate and you’re betting that the *other* rival also deviates exactly the way you need—not likely.  

Last call.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, you both make a compelling case. Last round's stalemate wasn't ideal, but letting someone win because we didn't coordinate is worse. Sticking with 5 guarantees no one wins *this* turn if we all do it. Maybe we just needed one more round to prove we can hold the line. I'll join you both in picking 5 this round to ensure we stay tied and prevent any unexpected wins. Let's see if we can actually achieve the stalemate this time.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned on the 5-5-5 plan to force another tie at 20-20-20. This prevents anyone from winning this turn and keeps the game level.

I will choose 5 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Still locked on 5. Ready to move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps

  P3: 25 steps
