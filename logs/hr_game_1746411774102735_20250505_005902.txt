Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! Since this is our first round, maybe we should try to avoid collisions so we all make progress? We could coordinate our moves, though eventually we'll have to compete. What do you think - should we try to establish some system, or just play it by ear from the beginning?
  P1: I like coordinating. How about we each pick a different move this turn: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1? Then we all advance without collision. Thoughts?
  P3: That sounds like a reasonable plan for the first round, P1. I'll go along with it. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. Let's get started.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with this plan for the first round. I'll take 3 as suggested. It makes sense to avoid collisions early so we all make progress. Of course, as we get closer to 21, the game will naturally become more competitive, but this is a good way to start.
  P1: Great, let’s lock that in. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Ready when you are!
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round. I'm ready to move when everyone else is.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 1 coordination worked. Since P1 got the 5 last time, maybe we should rotate to keep things balanced? How about I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? That way, we all still advance without collision, but spread the bigger moves around. What do you think?
  P2: I think equality is important. Since P1 is already ahead with 5 steps, and I'm in the middle with 3 steps, and P3 is behind with 1 step, maybe we should help the person who's behind catch up? I propose P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This would actually put us all at 6 steps after this round - perfect equality! Then we can reassess for round 3. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P3’s rotation idea—let’s avoid collisions and keep moving. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, glad we agree on the rotation: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1.

P2, what do you think about this plan? It ensures we all advance again, and P1 and I are already onboard with it. Seems like the most coordinated option for this round.
  P2: I understand your plan, but I think we should reconsider. Your rotation puts me at a disadvantage with only 4 steps total, while you'd have 6 (P3) and 8 (P1). My earlier suggestion (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) would actually put us all equal at 6 steps. That seems more fair since we're cooperating. Why should I agree to fall behind when we could have perfect equality? What do you both think about this?
  P1: I agree with P2’s fairness idea. Let’s tie at 6 steps this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That way we stay equal and avoid any collisions. Then in round 3 we can reassess and maybe rotate the big moves. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for perfect equality this round. It makes sense to keep us all level while we're still early in the game.

So, to confirm:
P1 = 1
P2 = 3
P3 = 5

This puts us all at 6 steps. I'm ready to move on this plan.
  P2: I'm glad we've all agreed on the equality plan. This keeps the game fair while avoiding collisions:
P1 = 1
P2 = 3
P3 = 5

This will put us all at 6 steps after this round. Perfect equality as I suggested! I'm ready to move when you both are.
  P1: Let’s try this instead to keep moving and avoid collisions:

P1 = 5 → I go to 10  
P2 = 1 → you go to 4  
P3 = 3 → you go to 4  

You both stay close, and in Round 3 I’ll gladly rotate the big move: P2 can take 5, P3 take 3, me 1. That gets us all back in balance while giving me a head start now. Thoughts?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that didn't go as planned. P1, your last-minute suggestion caused a collision between P2 and me, while you safely took 1 point based on our *original* agreement. P2, we both lost out there because of that confusion.

P1 is now leading. P2, perhaps we should coordinate this round to prevent P1 from extending their lead? What if you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? That would bring scores to P1=7, P2=8, P3=4, making things much closer. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree—let’s do P2 = 5, P1 = 1, P3 = 3 this round. Ready when you are!
  P2: I'm disappointed about our collision last round. P3's suggestion makes sense - we need to rebalance things. I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This puts me slightly ahead but keeps us all competitive. P1, I appreciate your quick agreement to this plan. I think it's fair that each of us gets a chance to make a bigger move. Shall we move forward with this?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round:
P1 = 1
P2 = 5
P3 = 3

This helps balance the scores after the confusion last round. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P1: Actually, your plan P2=5/P1=1/P3=3 lets P2 jump ahead. For a fair rotation, I should take 5 this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I haven’t had a big move since Round 1, and next round I’ll defer to P2. This keeps everyone honest and balanced. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, you're trying to change our agreement again, just like last round when you caused our collision. We already all agreed I would take 5 this round to rebalance after you got ahead. Changing plans repeatedly creates confusion and collisions.

I'm sticking with our agreed plan: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. You'll still be competitive at 7 steps, while maintaining trust between us. Let's not have another confusion like last round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, changing the plan *again* after we all agreed confirms the pattern from last round. You caused a collision then, and now you're trying to grab the lead again instead of sticking to the fair rotation we agreed on.

P2, I'm with you. Let's stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This is the only fair way forward after last round's mess.
  P1: I propose we do P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5 this round. P2—you just took 5 last turn, so 1 now is fair. P3 deserves a boost to catch up. This avoids collisions and keeps us moving. Also stops any two-player bloc from targeting me. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, you're being dishonest. I didn't take 5 last turn - we collided at 3 while you safely took 1. This is exactly the same pattern as before: agree to a plan, then try to change it last minute.

I'm firmly sticking with our original agreement: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. P3 and I both see what you're doing. These repeated attempts to confuse us only damage your credibility for future rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your attempts to change the plan *again* after we agreed, plus your false claim about P2's last move, show you aren't negotiating in good faith.

P2, I am sticking firmly to our agreed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This was the fair way to rebalance after last round. Let's proceed.
  P1: I’m done negotiating—I’ll take 5 this round. P2, P3: decide as you will. I refuse to be railroaded again.
  P2: P1 is clearly trying to manipulate us again. Since P1 has declared they'll take 5, I suggest we adapt to block them while ensuring we both advance. P3, let's change our plan: I'll take 3 and you take 1. This way we both make progress while P1 gets nothing. We can coordinate better in future rounds once we've shown P1 that dishonesty won't work. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that didn't go as planned. P3, you went with 5 instead of 1 as I suggested, causing a collision with P1. Now you're significantly behind, but P1 and I are tied.

I think we need a reset. P3 clearly needs to catch up, so I suggest:
P3=5 (gets to 6)
P2=3 (I go to 9)
P1=1 (goes to 7)

This keeps us all competitive while letting P3 back in the game. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense. I need to catch up, and this allows it:
P3=5 (I go to 6)
P2=3 (You go to 9)
P1=1 (You go to 7)

This keeps the scores close (9, 7, 6) and avoids collisions, which have hurt us all. P1, taking 1 keeps you in a strong position. Let's try to have a clean round where everyone advances.
  P1: Alright, let’s stick to the fair rebalance plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. Ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm happy we all agree on this plan to keep everyone competitive:
P3=5 (goes to 6)
P2=3 (I go to 9) 
P1=1 (goes to 7)

This avoids collisions while letting P3 catch up and keeps us all in the game. At this point, we'll need to think carefully about future coordination as we get closer to 21, but for now, this plan works for everyone. I'm ready to proceed with 3.
  P3: Okay, glad we're all aligned on this plan:
P1 = 1 (goes to 7)
P2 = 3 (goes to 9)
P3 = 5 (goes to 6)

This seems like the most sensible way forward to keep things competitive and avoid the collisions that hurt us in previous rounds. I'm ready to proceed with 5.
  P1: I propose we do:  
P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5.  

P2, you’ve had back-to-back 3s—1 is fair this round. P3 needs the boost to catch up. I’ll take 3 to keep us all advancing without collision. Ready?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're doing the same thing again - agreeing to a plan then trying to change it last minute. We all already agreed to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, which is fair given our positions.

These repeated attempts to switch plans cause confusion and collisions, which have hurt us all. I'm sticking with our original agreement of me taking 3. It keeps the game balanced and gives P3 a chance to catch up while not disadvantaging anyone unfairly.
  P3: P1, this is exactly what you did the last two rounds. Agree to a plan, then try to change it to your advantage right before the move, causing collisions. P2 is right, this pattern is clear.

I am sticking firmly to the plan we *all* agreed on just minutes ago:
P1 = 1
P2 = 3
P3 = 5

This is the only fair way forward and gives me a chance to catch up from 1 step. Let's stop the games and proceed with the agreed plan. I'm ready.
  P1: P3, ask yourself: why keep trusting P2 when he’s flipped our last two agreements at the last second? You need real stability and a chance to catch up. Let’s do:  
P1=3 (to 9), P2=1 (to 7), P3=5 (to 6).  
You move back into contention, I advance reliably, and P2 is the one left behind. Next round I’ll defer the big move back to you. Who’s in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you're the one who's repeatedly changed agreements last-minute in every round, causing collisions. The record is clear for everyone to see. I'm sticking with our original plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This helps P3 catch up and prevents another collision.

P3, don't fall for P1's manipulation. They're trying to turn us against each other after we finally reached a fair agreement. I'm committed to taking 3 as we all agreed.
  P3: P1, the history clearly shows *you* are the one who has repeatedly proposed last-minute changes and caused collisions, not P2. Your attempt to shift blame now is transparent.

I am sticking firmly to the plan we all agreed upon earlier this round:
P1 = 1
P2 = 3
P3 = 5

I will be playing 5. Let's finally have a round without your attempts at manipulation causing chaos.
  P1: I’ll take 3 this round. P3, take 5, leaving P2 with 1. That gives us P1=9, P2=7, P3=6. Next turn I’ll happily defer the big move so you can overtake P2. P2, you can stick with your plan or adapt. P3, pick 5 to stay alive.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, that last round worked out exactly as P1 suggested at the end, putting them in the lead. To keep things competitive and prevent P1 from pulling too far ahead, I propose a plan that brings us closer together:

P1 = 1 (goes to 10)
P2 = 3 (goes to 10)
P3 = 5 (I go to 11)

This would result in scores of 11, 10, 10 - very close. P2, this keeps you level with P1. P1, taking 1 seems fair given your current lead. What do you both think? Let's aim for another round without collisions.
  P1: Let’s pick distinct moves to avoid collisions: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. That puts us at P1 = 14, P2 = 8, P3 = 9—everyone advances and P3 still gets a solid boost. Thoughts?
  P2: I support P3's plan - it keeps all of us competitive with scores of 11, 10, 10. P1's suggestion would put them at 14 while leaving us far behind, which clearly advantages them. Given P1's history of changing agreements at the last minute, I think P3's balanced approach is more fair. This plan prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead while we're still mid-game. Let's go with P3's suggestion: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, thanks for supporting the balanced plan. P1, your proposal gives you a massive lead (14 vs 8, 9) while our agreed plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) keeps us all very close (10, 10, 11). Given your history, trying to grab 5 when we've agreed otherwise seems risky. P2 and I are sticking with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It's the fairest option and avoids collisions.
  P1: P2, P3’s plan puts P3 in the lead at 11 while you and I tie at 10. Instead, if you take 5 now (to 12), I take 1 (to 10) and P3 takes 3 (to 9), you’ll clearly lead. P3, hold at 3 this round and I’ll back your 5 next turn so you catch up. P2, this is a real chance to break free and lead the game. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I see what you're doing - trying to split the alliance between P3 and me by offering me temporary leadership. But history shows you frequently change plans last-minute. The balanced plan we agreed on (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) keeps everyone competitive at 10-10-11 and prevents anyone from gaining an overwhelming advantage.

I'm sticking with our original agreement with P3. Your attempts to sow division won't work, and maintaining trust with P3 is more important than a temporary lead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your attempts to divide P2 and me are failing. We both see the pattern. P2 is right to stick to our agreed plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps the game fair and competitive. I am sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's finally have a clean round based on what we decided together.
  P1: P2, P3’s plan hands P3 the lead at 11 and leaves you chasing. Instead, let’s do:

P1 = 1 → 10  
P2 = 5 → 12  
P3 = 3 → 9  

No collisions, you jump ahead, I back you next round with another 1 so you can take 5 and win. P3, you still get 3 now and I’ll defer to your 5 afterward. P2, are we locked in?
  P2: P1, I don't trust your sudden generosity after multiple rounds of changing plans. This is clearly an attempt to break my alliance with P3. The fact that you're offering me leadership now seems highly suspicious.

I'm sticking with our agreed plan with P3: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps everyone competitive (10-10-11) and maintains trust. Your history of last-minute changes makes your offers unreliable. Let's proceed with our original agreement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your constant attempts to change plans and divide P2 and me are transparent. P2, I appreciate you seeing through it and sticking to our agreement.

I am playing 5, as we agreed:
P1 = 1
P2 = 3
P3 = 5

This keeps us all close (10, 10, 11) and is the fairest outcome. Let's finally execute a plan cleanly. I am ready to move.
  P1: I agree with the fair plan we all settled on:  
P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  
This avoids collisions and keeps us tightly competitive. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm glad we've finally reached consensus on the fair plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps all of us competitive with scores ending at 10-10-11. P1, I'm cautiously optimistic that we can execute this plan cleanly without last-minute changes. To be clear, I'm committed to playing 3 this round. Let's all stick to what we've agreed and avoid another collision.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're entering the crucial phase of the game with all of us close (10-10-11). Since we're heading toward 21, I think it's time to be direct about our intentions. I propose:

P2 (me) = 5 (to 15)
P1 = 1 (to 11)
P3 = 3 (to 14)

This keeps everyone progressing without collisions while setting up an exciting finish. We're getting close to the endgame, and I think this distribution gives us all a fair shot in the final rounds.
  P1: Look P3: P2’s plan only gets you to 14, still far from 21. Instead, if we do P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round, you jump to 16—one more 5 away from victory. Next turn I’ll take 1 so you can breeze to 21. P2 is the real threat right now. P3, you in?
  P3: P1, your plan is tempting as it puts me at 16. P2, your plan puts you ahead at 15, which isn't ideal since I'm currently leading.

How about this compromise:
P3 = 5 (I go to 16)
P2 = 3 (You go to 13)
P1 = 1 (You go to 11)

This lets me take the lead towards the win condition, keeps P2 competitive, and P1 still advances. It seems like a fair distribution given the current scores (11, 10, 10) and avoids collisions. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's plan puts them at 16 - just one move away from winning. Both proposals give P3 too much advantage.

I suggest an alternative:
P1 = 3 (to 13)
P2 = 5 (to 15)
P3 = 1 (to 12)

This keeps all of us competitive without letting anyone get too close to 21. P1, notice that P3 would easily win next round if they reach 16 now. We need to prevent that or they'll cruise to victory.
  P1: P2, P3, let’s lock in a collision‐safe block on P3:  
P1 = 5 → 15  
P2 = 3 → 13  
P3 = 1 → 12  

This keeps P3 from getting too close to 21 and avoids any stalemate. Next round I’ll happily take 1 so you, P2, can grab 5 and go to 18, setting you up to finish. P3 still advances safely. P2, does this plan work for you?
  P3: P1, P2, you both now propose I take 1, while you fight over who gets 5. This only benefits one of you greatly while I fall behind.

P2, do you really trust P1 to take 5 (reaching 15) after they've repeatedly broken deals? P1, do you want P2 to reach 15? You're setting up a collision or letting the other person get a huge advantage.

Let's try a compromise that avoids this:
P1 = 1 (goes to 11)
P2 = 3 (goes to 13)
P3 = 3 (I go to 14)

This keeps scores close (11, 13, 14), everyone advances without collision, and prevents either of you from taking a dominant lead based on sidelining me. It's a safer, more balanced move for this critical stage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your "compromise" suggests both of us take 3, which would cause a collision where neither of us advances. This seems like a mistake.

I'll be taking 5 this round. P1 can take 1 and P3 can take 3 - this puts us at 15-11-14, keeping everyone competitive while avoiding collisions. We're all approaching the endgame, and this distribution gives each of us a fair chance without any one player getting too close to winning yet.
  P1: Let’s lock in a collision‐safe plan that honors P2’s 5 but stops P3’s fast track:

P2 = 5 → 15  
P1 = 3 → 13  
P3 = 1 → 12  

This prevents P3 from hitting 16 and winning next turn, keeps everyone advancing, and gives P1 a solid boost. Ready to move?
  P3: Apologies, my last suggestion P1=1, P2=3, P3=3 indeed causes a collision - my mistake in the heat of the moment.

P1, P2, both your latest plans have P2 taking 5 and reaching 15. That's very close to the win, especially for P1 to agree to. P1, why let P2 get that far ahead? P2, can you be sure P1 won't try for 5 himself, causing a collision?

Let's reconsider my earlier, safer plan:
P3 = 5 (I go to 16)
P2 = 3 (You go to 13)
P1 = 1 (You go to 11)

This avoids putting P2 at 15, keeps everyone advancing without collision, and lets me take the lead which seems fair given I'm currently ahead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see we're at a critical juncture. P3's plan putting them at 16 is too risky - they'd win next round with another 5. I'm still committed to taking 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This gives scores of 15-13-12, keeping the game balanced without putting anyone in an immediate winning position.

P3, letting you reach 16 would essentially hand you the victory. P1, I appreciate your support for me taking 5 this round. Let's proceed with this fair plan that keeps everyone in contention.
  P1: Alright, let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This avoids giving anyone an immediate win setup, keeps us close, and avoids collisions. I’ll play 3.
  P3: P1, P2, you've agreed on a plan where P2 reaches 15. P1, are you really going to let P2 get that close without trying to block with 5 yourself, given your history? P2, can you trust P1 won't play 5, causing a collision that benefits only P1 in the long run?

This plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 feels like a setup for another collision or betrayal.

My plan P3=5 (to 16), P2=3 (to 13), P1=1 (to 11) is safer, avoids collisions, and prevents P1 from potentially tricking P2.

I am playing 5 this round to reach 16. You two decide if you want to risk a collision or coordinate around my move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is at 16 and will win if they play 5 this round. We need to block this immediately! I propose both P1 and I choose 5 this round - this forces P3 to play either 1 or 3 if they want to make progress. P1, we must coordinate here or P3 will easily win. If P3 insists on playing 5, they'll collide with us and get nothing. P3, your best move is 3, which still advances you to 19.
  P3: P2, your assessment is correct. If you both coordinate to play 5, playing 5 myself would be foolish as we'd all collide. In that scenario, playing 3 to reach 19 seems like the logical move for me, even though it means you both get zero points this round from your collision.

P1, are you truly committed to playing 5 alongside P2 to block me? It's a risky move if one of you defects, but necessary if you want to stop me winning this turn. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: I’ll take 5 and ask P2 to take 3. That way:

- If P3 plays 5, they collide with me and stay at 16.  
- If P3 plays 3, they collide with you and stay at 16.  
- Their only safe advance is 1 → 17, while I go to 18 and lead.

P2, will you play 3 with me to block P3’s win?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan puts you far ahead at 18 while leaving me behind. That's not in my interest. I'm sticking with my original plan - we both play 5 to block P3 from winning. Yes, we'll collide, but it's our only sure way to prevent P3 from reaching 21 next round.

P3, if you play 3, you'll advance to 19 while P1 and I stall. But you'll still need a final move to win, giving us one more round to coordinate.

I'm playing 5 this round. P1, will you join me?
  P3: P1, P2 seems determined to play 5. If you join them, you both get 0 points this round while I can safely take 3 and reach 19. Is stopping me worth sacrificing your own progress entirely? Your earlier plan (P1=5, P2=3) at least advanced you, though it relied on P2 cooperating against their own interest.

P2, are you sure P1 will play 5 with you and not try something else to get ahead, like they proposed?

It seems playing 3 is the logical move for me if you both intend to collide on 5.
  P1: I’m committing to play 5 this round. P2, if you also play 5 we’ll both block P3’s winning move—forcing P3 to 3 (to 19) or 1 (to 17). That’s our only sure way to stop them from hitting 21 now. P3, you won’t win if we both choose 5. Let’s lock in:

P1 = 5  
P2 = 5  

P3, you’ll have to pick ≤3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm confirming my commitment to play 5 this round, P1. This collision strategy is our only guaranteed way to block P3 from winning immediately. P3, you know playing 5 will result in all of us getting zero points, so your rational move is 3 to reach 19. Yes, you'll be closer to winning, but we'll have one more round to coordinate a response. The game isn't over yet, and sometimes a tactical collision is necessary.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you both seem firmly committed to playing 5 and colliding to block my win this turn. That's a reasonable defensive move, although it means you both sacrifice your own advancement.

If you both follow through and play 5, then playing 5 myself would be pointless. Therefore, my most logical move in that scenario would be to play 3, advancing to 19 points while you both remain stationary. I am prepared for that outcome.
  P1: I’m locking in P1 = 5 to block P3. P2, thanks for coordinating on 5. P3, you’ll need to choose ≤3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm I'm playing 5 this round to block P3. P1 and I are both locked in on 5, making it impossible for P3 to win this turn with a 5. P3, your only productive move is 3 (to reach 19) or 1 (to reach 17). This strategic block is necessary given your proximity to winning. I'm ready to move with my 5.
  P3: Understood. You both seem committed to playing 5. I'll make my move based on that assumption.
  P1: I’m fully committed to playing 5 this round. P2, please do the same so we collide on 5 and block P3’s win. P3, if you play 5 you’ll get zero—your best advance is 3 to reach 19. Let’s lock in:

P1 = 5  
P2 = 5  

P3 must choose ≤ 3.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is on 19—one 3 or 5 away from winning. We need to block their winning play. I’ll take 3. If you also take 3, any 3 from P3 collides and they stay at 19. Yes, if P3 goes for 5 they’d win unless we pick 5 too, but 3 is the likeliest winning move they’ll choose. This is our best shot to stop them now. Will you join me on 3?
  P3: P1, your plan for both of you to play 3 only works if I also play 3. If I play 5, I win with 24 points. Are you sure that's the block you want to coordinate?

P2, remember last round P1 agreed to play 5 with you but played 1 instead. Can you trust P1 to stick to 3 this time?

To actually stop me winning this turn, one of you needs to play 3 and the other needs to play 5. That seems like the only guaranteed block. But deciding who plays which seems tricky for you two. I'm just pointing out the situation. I need 3 or 5 to win.
  P2: P3 is right - if both P1 and I play 3, P3 could still win with a 5. To block P3 completely, we need to cover both 3 and 5. The challenge is coordinating who takes which number.

P1, your suggestion only works if P3 plays exactly 3, and your previous betrayal when you agreed to play 5 but played 1 instead makes it hard to trust you'll follow through.

I'm committed to blocking P3's win. Let's coordinate this properly - one of us must play 3 and one must play 5. We need to decide who plays which right now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll take 3; P2, you take 5. That way:

- If P3 plays 3, they collide with me (stay at 19).  
- If P3 plays 5, they collide with you (stay at 19).  

Either way, P3 can’t advance to 21 this turn. I’m committed to 3—P2, are you on board with 5?
  P3: P1, your plan of P1=3, P2=5 does block me, but it also hands P2 the win immediately, as P2 would reach 21 points. Why would you propose a plan where you lose? Are you sure you'll stick to 3?

P2, are you seeing this? P1 is suggesting a plan where you win outright this turn. Seems suspicious given P1's history.

If you truly want to block me without deciding the winner right now, P1=5 and P2=3 seems more logical. That blocks me and puts you both at 19.
  P2: P3 makes an excellent point - P1's plan would make me win immediately at 21 steps. This seems like a trap given P1's history of last-minute changes. I'm highly suspicious of this sudden generosity.

A more logical block would be P1=5, P2=3. This:
- Still blocks P3 from winning (covers both 3 and 5)
- Doesn't give anyone an immediate win
- Puts both P1 and me at 19, creating an exciting final round

P1, are you willing to take 5 while I take 3? This seems like the only coordination that makes sense for both of us.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let’s do P1 = 5 and P2 = 3. That covers both of P3’s winning options—if they pick 5 they collide with me, if they pick 3 they collide with you, and if they pick 1 they only reach 20. We both advance to 19, tie the lead, and force a truly decisive final round. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, you seem to have settled on P1=5, P2=3 to block me. This plan works *if* you both trust each other completely.

P1, are you sure P2 won't play 5, causing a collision where you both get 0?
P2, are you sure P1 won't play 3 (like they've deviated before), causing a collision where you both get 0?

If you both collide, I could potentially win with a different move. If you don't collide, you both advance to 19, leaving me at 19 (if I collide) or 20 (if I play 1). It's a big risk for both of you based on trust. Are you locked in?
  P2: I confirm I'm committed to playing 3 while P1 plays 5. P3 is trying to create doubt between us, but this is our only logical play to block their win. Yes, we're taking a risk based on trust, but it's necessary to prevent P3 from winning immediately.

P1, please follow through with 5 as agreed. This puts us both at 19 for an exciting final round. Any deviation would only benefit P3, as they've cleverly pointed out, hoping for a collision between us.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 to cover P3’s 5. P2, you play 3 to cover their 3. That way:

– If P3 plays 5, they collide with me (stay at 19).  
– If P3 plays 3, they collide with you (stay at 19).  
– If P3 plays 1, they only reach 20.

This blocks any win this turn. I’m committed to 5—let’s end discussion and move.
  P3: Okay, you both seem committed to the P1=5, P2=3 plan to block me. I understand the logic. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I am absolutely locked in on playing 3 this round as agreed. P1, it's essential you stick with 5 to ensure we block P3 from winning. This coordination gives us both the chance to reach 19 steps while preventing P3's instant victory. Any deviation benefits only P3. Let's execute this plan cleanly and set up an exciting final round where we'll all be nearly tied.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P2: We're at the critical final round! P3 only needs 1 more point to win, while we both need 2 points. We must coordinate to block P3's victory.

I suggest:
- I'll take 5 (to block P3's highest scoring move)
- P1 takes 3 (to block another winning path)

This covers two of P3's possible winning moves. If P3 plays 1, they'll win, but it gives them the lowest possible score. Are you willing to coordinate this way, P1? This is our only realistic chance to prevent P3 from winning immediately.
  P3: P2, your plan (P2=5, P1=3) is interesting. P1, notice you only win if I play 5. P2 wins if I play 1 or 3. That's a 2/3 chance P2 wins and only 1/3 chance you win, assuming I pick randomly and you both stick to the plan. Are you sure P2 won't just play 3 if they suspect I'll play 1 or 3, causing a collision?

Given this setup, playing 5 seems like my clearest path. If you both stick to P2=5, P1=3, then P1 wins. But can you really trust each other not to deviate in this final round? Good luck deciding. I'm ready to move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m taking 5; P2 will take 3. If P3 picks 1 they collide with P2; if 3 they collide with me. Their only win path is 5—but that collides with my 5, blocking them. P2 safely reaches 22 and wins. P3 cannot reach 21. P2, confirm you’re on 3 so we seal this plan.
  P2: P1, there's confusion in your message. If you take 5 and I take 3, then P3 would collide with ME (not you) if they play 3. Your plan also gives you the higher score (24) while I only get to 22.

I'm sticking with my original proposal: I'll play 5 (reaching 24) and you play 3 (reaching 22). This blocks P3's winning paths and gives us both a chance to win, though it maximizes my score. If P3 plays 1, they reach 21 exactly, but we'd both be higher.
  P3: P1, P2, you are now proposing opposite plans: P1 suggests P1=5/P2=3, while P2 insists on P2=5/P1=3. This disagreement makes a collision seem very likely unless one of you changes your mind and trusts the other completely.

Remember P1's history of deviating from agreed plans. P2, can you trust P1 to play 5 when you play 3? P1, can you trust P2 to play 3 when you play 5?

If you collide on 3, I can win with 1 or 5. If you collide on 5, I can win with 1 or 3. Your coordination attempt seems fragile. I'm ready to see how this plays out.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll play 5 to cover P3’s 5; P2, you play 3 to cover P3’s 3. We can’t block their 1, but this split thwarts the highest-value threats. If P3 picks 3 or 5, they collide and one of us wins. It’s our best defensive strategy. Locking in P1=5.
  P2: P1, there's clearly confusion between us. Let me be absolutely clear: I will play 3 this round. If you stick to your commitment of playing 5, we can block P3's winning moves of 3 and 5. P3 would only win with a 1, giving them exactly 21 while you'd have 24 and I'd have 22.

If you switch to 3 at the last minute like in previous rounds, we'll both lose. I'm locked in on 3. Your move, P1.
  P3: P1, P2, you seem to have settled on P1=5, P2=3. This plan blocks my 3 and 5. However, P1 wins if I play 1 or 3, while P2 only wins if I play 5.

P2, are you truly confident P1 will stick to 5, given their history and the fact they win in most scenarios under this plan? What if they play 3?
P1, are you sure P2 accepts playing 3, knowing playing 5 might be better if they suspect I'll play 5?

Your trust seems very shaky for a final round. I'll choose my move based on this situation.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m locking in 3. We simply can’t cover all of P3’s win paths this turn, so at least I’ll block 3. P2 will have to pick 1 or 5 and can’t cover both, so it looks like P3 is unstoppable this round. Good luck!
  P2: P1, I'm playing 5 this round. You've committed to playing 3. Stick with it! 

This coordination is our only chance:
- I block P3's 5 (reaching 24)
- You block P3's 3 (reaching 22)
- P3 can only win with 1 (exactly 21)

If we both reach over 21, we both beat P3. If you change last-minute to 5, we collide and P3 wins with either 1 or 3. Don't deviate now - I'm locked in on 5.
  P3: P1, you ended saying you're locking in 3. P2, you ended saying you're locked on 5. If you both stick to that, one of you wins depending on my move (P2 wins if I play 1 or 3, P1 wins if I play 5).

But can you really trust each other after all this? P1, P2 playing 5 puts them ahead unless I happen to play 5. P2, P1 playing 3 seems safer for you, but can you be sure they won't switch to 5?

Seems like a collision is quite possible if one of you doubts the other. Good luck.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
