P3, I get your plan to block P1, but if we split moves, there\u2019s a risk P1 slips through. P1, I\u2019ll agree to your deal: you take 3 to 21, I take 5 to 20, P3 takes 1. It ends the game with me in a solid spot. P3, if we collide, P1 wins uncontested. Let\u2019s avoid that chaos and finalize this. I\u2019m ready to move if we align. Thoughts?"}

P1, you are trusting P2 to honor a deal that guarantees they lose. This alliance is fragile.\n\nI am not taking 1. I will choose either 3 or 5 to block one of you and try to force another round. You'll have to guess which of you I'm targeting. Good luck."}
