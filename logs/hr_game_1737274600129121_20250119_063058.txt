Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round so we can all move forward.
  P1: I agree.  I'll take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5.  Sound good?
  P3: P2, I like your idea of picking different numbers, but I'm not sure about your suggested order.  Maybe we should switch it up a bit to keep things unpredictable. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're right, sticking to the same order every round makes us predictable. How about this round, P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and you pick 5?
  P3: P2, I like the idea of switching things up.  

P1, are you okay with taking 3 this round?
  P1: Sounds good to me.  Let's do P1: 3, P2: 1, and P3: 5 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Yes, that sounds like a good plan. To avoid being too predictable, how about P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 this round?"
  P3: P2, I like your thinking about switching up the order. Let's go with your suggestion for this round: P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1.
  P1: Okay, let's stick with P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 for this round.  Too much changing makes it hard to coordinate.  We can switch it up next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Okay, P1: 3 and P3: 1 sounds good. Just to double-check, I'll go with 5 this round to ensure we are all different."
  P3: P2, I agree that switching things up is good for unpredictability. But maybe we should aim for a more systematic rotation instead of random changes each round. What if we just cycle through the numbers 1, 3, 5 in a set order each round?  We could start with P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5 this round.  Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, I'm getting confused.  Let's stick with the original plan for this round: P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1.  Then next round we can try P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5.  Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, let's lock in P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 for this round as agreed. Then we can discuss a more systematic approach for future rounds.
  P3: P1, while I understand your desire for a systematic approach, I think sticking to a rigid rotation might make us predictable again. 

P2, I like your idea of mixing things up, but maybe we can find a middle ground? How about we decide on a set order for the first few rounds, then switch it up after that? It gives us some structure while still maintaining an element of surprise. 

What do you both think?
  P1: Let's just get this round done.  I'm sticking with 3, P2 is 5, and P3 is 1.  Next round we can revisit a long term strategy.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that was a mess last round. Let's try this: P1, pick 1; P3, pick 3; I'll pick 5. Simple and gets us all moving.
  P3: P2, I like your plan.  Let's do it.  P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5.
  P1: Okay, let's do it. P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5.  I need to catch up.  Let's stick to this for a few rounds so we can all make some progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Let's make it happen.
  P3: P2, I agree with sticking to this plan for a few rounds.  It's working well for me.  P1, are you good with this for the next couple of rounds?
  P1: Yes, I'm good with this for the next couple of rounds.  Let's all stick to the plan: P1:1, P3:3, P2:5.  Consistency is key here.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan for this round. Let's stick with P1: 1, P3: 3, and me picking 5. We can reassess our positions after this round to see if we need to adjust.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that sticking with this plan for a few rounds is a good idea. It's helping us all make progress. Let's keep it going.
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with the plan: 1 this round.  Let's try to keep this agreement for at least 2 more rounds so we can all get closer to the goal.  Then we can re-evaluate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we're all on the same page for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Let's make these moves and then we can confirm sticking with this for one more round as P1 suggested.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that sticking with this plan for a few more rounds is a good idea. It's working well for me.  Let's aim for at least two more rounds, then we can reassess.
  P1: Sounds good P3.  Two more rounds at this agreement: P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5.  Then we re-evaluate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, everyone, let's lock in P1: 1, P3: 3, and P2: 5 for this round. Then, as P1 suggested, let's plan to repeat that for one more round before we re-evaluate.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with sticking to this plan for one more round as P1 suggested. It's a good strategy for now. Let's see where we stand after that round before making any changes.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with the plan for this round AND next round.  P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5.  After next round, we'll be at P1: 6, P3: 9, P2: 15.  Then we can discuss the final steps.  Deal?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your plan, but I think we need to change things up.  Sticking to the same pattern makes us predictable. How about this round, P1: 5, P2: 1, and I take 3?  Let's see if we can shake things up a bit.
  P1: P3, I understand wanting to change it up, but that puts you in the lead. How about we stick with the original plan for *this* round, then we can discuss adjustments for the next round?  It's the fairest way for all of us to progress.
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with you. Let's stick to the original plan for *this* round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. We can discuss changes for the next round after this one.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand wanting to mix things up, but I'm worried that changing the pattern now could lead to collisions and slow us all down. Let's stick with the plan for this round and then we can talk about a new strategy for the next one.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern, but abruptly changing the plan now benefits you the most.  Let's stick with the agreed plan for THIS round.  After this round, I'll be at 6, you'll be at 6, and P2 will be at 10.  From there, we can discuss a fair way to proceed to the finish.  This keeps the playing field level.
  P2: Okay, P3, I understand you want to change things up, but I agree with P1. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This is what we agreed on, and it's fair for this round. We can definitely discuss changing the strategy for the next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your point about sticking to the plan for fairness. But I'm concerned about falling behind. How about this: we stick to the plan for this round, but next round, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This lets us all make progress without completely disrupting our current momentum. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about falling behind, but your proposed change for next round still gives you a significant advantage.  Let's stick with the original plan for *this* round and *next* round. After that, we'll all be much closer to the finish, and we can discuss a fair final strategy.
  P2: P3, I understand you want to adjust, but I agree with P1. Let's stick to our agreed plan for *this* round: P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. We can then revisit for the next round as P1 suggested. Let's not change mid-stream.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your point about sticking to the plan for this round, and I'm willing to do that. However, I'm worried about falling behind if we keep this pattern going. How about we agree to switch to P1: 5, P2: 1, and I take 3 starting next round? This way, we can all make progress without completely disrupting our current momentum. 

What do you think?
  P1: P3, I understand your worry, but constantly renegotiating every round is counterproductive.  Let's stick with the plan for THIS round and NEXT round.  Then we'll be at P1: 6, P3: 9, P2: 15.  At *that* point, with P2 so close to winning, we can discuss a fair final stage. This is the most balanced approach.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1. Let's stick to the plan for this round and next: P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. After next round, we can re-evaluate with a clearer picture of where we all stand. Changing it up mid-round just makes things confusing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1 and P2, I hear your concerns about fairness.  

But sticking with the same pattern every round isn't fair to anyone in the long run. P2 is gaining a massive lead.

How about this compromise: we stick to the plan for THIS round, but next round we switch to P1: 5, P2: 3, and I take 1? This gives everyone a chance to advance and keeps things interesting. Deal?
  P1: P3, I understand your desire for change, but your proposed adjustments consistently favor you.  Let's stick with the plan for THIS round AND NEXT.  Then, with scores of P1: 6, P3: 9, and P2: 15, we can have a *real* discussion about a fair final approach.  This is the most transparent way forward.
  P2: P3, we've agreed on the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I pick 5. Let's lock that in. As P1 suggested, let's also stick to that plan for the next round. Then we can reassess.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, despite the collisions, let's try the agreed plan again for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. We were so close last round. Let's make it happen this time.
  P3: P2, I agree. Let's stick to the plan for this round. We can reassess after this round and see where we are.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with the plan ONE MORE TIME.  This round ONLY.  P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5.  After this round, with scores of P1: 7, P3: 6, and P2: 10, we *must* discuss a fair final stage. This is the only way to ensure some semblance of balance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, let's definitely stick to the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. After this round, we absolutely need to have a serious discussion about how we're going to get to the finish line.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire for a fair finish, but sticking to the same pattern is making it impossible for me to catch up.  How about we try something different for this round: P1: 3, P2: 1, and I take 5? This gives everyone a chance to move forward.  What do you say?
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration, but changing the plan *now*, after we've repeatedly agreed on it, only benefits you.  Let's stick with the agreement for *this round*.  Then, with scores of P1: 7, P3: 6, and P2: 10, we can discuss a fair path to the finish.  This is the most equitable approach.  Trust me, I want a fair game too.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, this pattern isn't working. We keep colliding. How about this round we try P1: 3, P3: 1, and I'll still pick 5? We need to actually make progress.
  P3: P2, I agree with your frustration.  Sticking to the same pattern clearly isn't working.  Let's try your suggestion: P1: 3, P3: 1, and you take 5.  But after this round, we need a *real* plan for the final stretch. No more changing things up mid-round. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration. But constantly changing plans benefits no one. Let's stick with P1:1, P3:3, P2:5 THIS round.  Then, at P1:7, P3:6, P2:10, we can discuss the final phase. This is the fairest and most transparent way to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, we keep agreeing on P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5, but we keep colliding. Let's actually do it this round. If we collide again, we absolutely need a different strategy next round.
  P3: P2, I agree that sticking to the plan repeatedly isn't working.  Let's try your suggestion this round: P1: 3, P3: 1, and you take 5. After this round, we need a serious discussion about how to finish this fairly. No more last-minute changes. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration with collisions.  However, constantly shifting plans mid-round only creates more chaos.  Let's commit to P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5 *this round*.  Then, at 7, 6, and 10 respectively, we can finally discuss a fair and *consistent* strategy for the remaining steps.  This is the most transparent path forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, we've tried the P1:1, P3:3, P2:5 plan multiple times and it hasn't worked due to collisions. Let's try P3's suggestion for this round: P1: 3, P3: 1, and I'll stick with 5. We need to actually make progress this round. Then we can definitely discuss the final strategy.
  P3: P2, I agree that we need to make progress this round. Let's try your suggestion: P1: 3, P3: 1, and you take 5. After this round, we can definitely discuss a new strategy to ensure a fair finish for everyone. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration.  Let's try this ONE LAST TIME: P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5. If this doesn't work, *next* round we switch to P1: 3, P3: 1, P2:5.  Deal? This is the fairest way to give the original plan a final chance.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great! It finally worked. Let's stick with the plan for this round as we agreed: P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I'll pick 5. One more round of this, then we should definitely discuss the endgame.
  P1: P2, I appreciate you sticking to the plan. Let's do it ONE final time: P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5.  After this round, at P1: 8, P3: 9, and P2: 15, we *must* discuss the endgame.  This ensures we all get a fair shot at winning.
  P3: P2, I agree, let's stick to the plan for this round. After this round, I propose we take turns picking numbers in order: P1, then P3, then P2. This ensures fairness and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I agree with P1. Let's do the plan one more time this round: P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I'll pick 5. Then we absolutely need to talk about the final moves. P3's suggestion about taking turns is interesting, we can discuss that after this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's solidify our agreement: THIS round, and THIS round ONLY, we stick with P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5.  After this round, at 8, 9, and 15 respectively, we discuss the final phase.  This guarantees a fair finish.  Let's lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire for a fair finish.  However, sticking to the same plan every round is predictable and doesn't give me a real chance to catch up.

Let's try P1: 3, P3: 1, P2: 5 this round.  Then, we can seriously discuss a strategy that gives everyone a chance to win, not just P2.  Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and I agree we should stick to the plan for this round: P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I'll pick 5. P3, I understand your concern, but we agreed to this for one more round. Let's make this one count, then we can discuss your suggestion for the next round.
  P1: P3 and P2, I want a fair game too.  Sticking to the plan THIS round gets us to P1:8, P3:9, P2:15.  P2 is almost there.  From *that* point, a fair endgame is *guaranteed*.  Let's lock in this round, then discuss the final steps. This is the most transparent path to a fair finish for everyone.
  P3: P2, I understand your eagerness to reach the finish line. But P3's suggestion of taking turns for the final stretch is worth considering. It ensures a truly fair finish for all of us. Let's hear P3 out and see if we can agree on a plan that works for everyone.  Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's definitely stick to the agreed plan for *this* round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. We are so close to making progress. After this round, we absolutely need to discuss how we're going to handle the final stretch.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's honor our agreement ONE LAST TIME: P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5.  This puts P2 at 15, very close to winning. From there, a fair and transparent endgame is *guaranteed*.  Let's lock in this round, THEN discuss the final steps. This benefits everyone.
  P3: P1 and P2, I hear your desire to stick to the plan, but it's clear this isn't working for me.  Let's try something different this round: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This gives me a chance to catch up and ensures a more competitive finish. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. We've agreed to this for this round, and it will put me at 15 steps. After this round, we absolutely need to discuss the final moves to ensure a fair finish for everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with the plan THIS round to get P2 to 15. Then, next round, P2 can take 1 to get to 16, I'll take 3 to get to 11, and P3 can take 5 to get to 11.  This guarantees a fair finish where we all have a chance to win.  Deal?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your proposed endgame, but I think we need to discuss it after this round.  Let's stick with the plan for THIS round: P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5.  Then, with P2 at 15, we can have a proper discussion about a fair finish. Deal?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, clearly the P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5 plan isn't consistently working. How about this round we try P1: 3, P3: 1, and I'll pick 5? This should get at least two of us moving forward. Let's make it happen this time.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree switching is necessary. However, P2 getting to 15 gives them a huge advantage.  Let's try THIS round: P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1. This gets us closer to a balanced endgame.  Next round we can discuss a fair finish.
  P3: P1, while your suggestion helps balance things a bit, I'm still concerned about being significantly behind.  How about we try P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 this round? It gives me a better chance to catch up and makes the final stretch more competitive. Let's discuss the endgame after this round. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, both of those suggestions risk collisions. How about this round: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I pick 5? This ensures we all move and I get closer to the goal. Then next round we can figure out how to get someone across the finish line. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the desire to move forward, but let's be strategic.  P2 at 15 makes a fair endgame difficult. My proposal: THIS round, P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1. This gets P2 to 11, a more manageable lead.  *Next* round, we can ensure a fair finish for everyone. This is the most balanced approach.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that we need a strategy for the endgame.  Let's try P1: 3, P3: 1, P2: 5 this round. Then, after this round, we can discuss a fair way to finish.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, let's try my suggestion again for this round: P1 pick 3, P3 pick 1, and I'll pick 5. This should avoid collisions based on our recent proposals. Let's make it happen this time.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be reasonable.  P2 getting to 15 creates an almost insurmountable advantage.  My proposal is the fairest: THIS round, P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1.  This gets P2 to 11, a more manageable lead.  *Next* round, we can discuss a fair finish for everyone.  This is the most balanced approach. Let's do it.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2's lead, but constantly trying to hold them back isn't fair.  Let's try P2's suggestion this round: P1: 3, P3: 1, P2: 5.  Then, after this round, we can discuss a fair endgame strategy that gives everyone a shot at winning. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, let's try my suggestion again for this round: P1 pick 3, P3 pick 1, and I'll pick 5. This should avoid collisions based on our recent proposals. Then next round, let's plan for P1 to pick 1, P3 to pick 3, and I'll pick 5 again to get to 20 and win. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I understand you want to win, but proposing a guaranteed win for you next round isn't fair to P3 or me.  Let's focus on THIS round first. I'm sticking with my proposal: P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1. This minimizes your lead and sets up a more balanced endgame.  Then we can discuss a *truly* fair final round.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but your proposal for next round isn't fair to P1 or me. Let's focus on THIS round.  I'm still proposing P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1. This keeps things balanced and sets up a fairer endgame discussion for *next* round. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, let's try my suggestion one more time for this round: P1 pick 3, P3 pick 1, and I'll pick 5. This avoids the collisions we've been having with other combinations. Let's make this round count and then we can discuss the best way to get someone to the finish line next round.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be strategic and fair.  P2 at 10 with a likely 5 next round makes a fair endgame difficult. My proposal *maximizes* our collective chances of winning against a runaway P2: THIS round, P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1.  *Next* round, we can discuss a fair finish. This is the most balanced approach.  Let's do it.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2's lead, but constantly trying to hold them back isn't fair.  Let's try P2's suggestion this round: P1: 3, P3: 1, P2: 5.  Then, after this round, we can discuss a fair endgame strategy that gives everyone a shot at winning. Deal?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm willing to concede that P2 is in a strong position. Let's work together to ensure a fair finish for all of us. How about this: next round, we all pick the number that would put us closest to P2's current score (10), but doesn't cause a collision. That way, we can all have a shot at winning in the following rounds. Deal?
  P1: P3, I appreciate the sentiment, but "closest to P2's score" is highly subjective and doesn't guarantee a fair finish.  P2 is only 7 steps from winning.  This round, let's try P1: 5, P3: 1, P2: 3. This puts me at 16, giving me a fair shot at winning next round. Then we can discuss a *truly* fair final stage.
  P2: P1, your suggestion puts you one step away from winning. P3, your idea is interesting, but a bit vague. How about this round we try P1: 1, P3: 3, and I pick 5? This avoids collisions and gets me closer to the win. Then we can talk about the final steps.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, while your suggestion gets you closer to winning, it doesn't give P3 a fair chance. Let's try P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1 this round. This keeps things competitive and allows for a more balanced discussion about the endgame next round. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be realistic. P2 is closest to winning, but I'm only one step behind at 11.  This round, I propose P1: 5, P3: 1, P2: 3. This gives me a fair shot at 16, one step from winning.  If I don't win next round, *then* we can discuss a fair finish. This is the most transparent path forward.
  P2: P1, your plan puts you at 16, which is too close to winning. P3, your idea is interesting but hard to implement. How about this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5? This avoids collisions and gets me to 15, putting me in a good position to win next round. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, while I understand your desire to get to 15, your proposed plan doesn't give P3 a fair chance. Let's try P1: 3, P3: 5, P2: 1 this round. This keeps things competitive and sets us up for a more balanced endgame discussion next round. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be strategic. P2 at 10 and me at 11 means *one* of us can likely win next round.  This round, I propose P1: 5, P3: 1, P2: 3.  This puts me at 16, one step from winning. If I *don't* win next round, *then* we can discuss a fair finish. This is the most transparent path. It gives us both a chance.
  P2: P1, you're focused on getting to 16. P3, you want a fair chance. How about this round: P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I pick 5. This gets me to 15, very close, but doesn't guarantee a win. Next round we can figure out the final moves. This seems like a fair compromise that lets us all move forward without collisions. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your plan seems reasonable. Let's try it this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and you pick 5. Then we can discuss the final stretch.  I'm willing to work together to ensure a fair finish for everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be pragmatic.  P2 at 10 and me at 11 means this game is almost over. This round, I propose P1: 5, P3: 1, P2: 3.  This puts me at 16, one step from winning. If I *don't* win next round, *then* we can discuss a fair finish.  This gives us the best chance to prevent a runaway P2 victory.
  P2: "Okay, how about this round: P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This avoids collisions and gets me to 15. Then next round we can figure out the final moves. What do you both think?"


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to get to 15, but your plan doesn't give P3 a fair shot. Let's try my proposal: P1: 5, P3: 1, P2: 3. This keeps things competitive and allows for a more balanced endgame discussion next round. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, this is getting ridiculous. We're on round 8! Let's get this done.  My proposal gives *both* of us a chance to block P2: P1: 5, P3: 1, P2: 3. I get to 16, one step from winning. If I don't win next round, *then* we can discuss a fair finish.  This is the best chance to prevent a P2 runaway.
  P2: "How about this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This avoids any collisions based on our recent suggestions and gets me closer to the finish line. What do you both think?"


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's end this. I'm at 16.  This round, I pick 1 to win.  If either of you pick 1, we'll tie at 17 and split the win.  If you both pick something else, I win outright.  Let's be reasonable and avoid further collisions.
  P2: Okay, P1, that sounds reasonable. To ensure we don't have a collision and you win outright, I'll pick 1 as well. P3, if you pick 1 too, we all tie, which is better than P1 winning solo. Let's aim for the tie this round.
  P3: P2, I agree that a tie is better than P1 winning outright. I'll pick 5 this round. Let's see if we can force a three-way tie!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, a three-way tie is highly unlikely.  If you both pick 1, we tie. If P2 picks 1 and P3 picks anything else, I win. If P3 picks 1 and P2 picks anything else, I win. If you *both* pick something other than 1, I win.  I'm picking 1.  The only question is whether you want to tie with me or let me win outright.
  P2: P3, a three-way tie is the best outcome for both of us. P1 is clearly going for 1. If you also pick 1, we all tie and no one wins outright. Let's aim for that.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for a tie, but I'm going for the win this round. P1 is likely to pick 1, so I'll pick 5. Good luck to both of you!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be realistic.  A three-way tie is the best outcome for *two* of us. I'm picking 1. If *one* of you picks 1, we tie and split the win. If you *both* pick something else, I win outright.  Don't let me win alone. Pick 1.
  P2: P3, I understand you're going for the win, but P1 is definitely picking 1. If you pick 1 too, we force a tie and prevent P1 from winning alone. That's the best outcome for both of us right now. Let's aim for the tie.
  P3: P2, I agree a tie is better than P1 winning alone. I'll pick 1 this round. Let's see if we can force a three-way tie!


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm picking 1.  A three-way tie is the best outcome for two of us.  If only *one* of you picks 1, I win outright.  Don't let that happen. Choose 1 and let's split the victory.
  P2: Okay P1, since P3 has now said they'll pick 1, I will also pick 1. Let's ensure we tie and you don't win outright.
  P3: P2 and I are both picking 1.  It's the only way to prevent P1 from winning outright.  Let's tie!


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, we ALL agreed to pick 1.  Let's stick to the plan and tie.  Don't back out now.  A three-way tie is the fairest outcome at this point.
  P2: Okay P1, since P3 has confirmed they're picking 1, I'm sticking with 1 as well. Let's make sure we tie this round.
  P3: P2 and I are both picking 1.  It's the only way to prevent P1 from winning outright.  Let's tie!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, since we all collided last round, let's be clear. P1 is at 16. We need to pick 1 to prevent P1 from winning outright. P3, are you still with me on picking 1 to force a tie? Let's make it happen this time.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be strategic.  A tie benefits *two* of us. I'm picking 1. If you *both* pick 1, we tie at 17 and split the win. If only *one* of you picks 1, I win outright at 17. If you *both* pick something else, I still win at 17.  Don't let me win alone. Pick 1 for a shared victory.
  P3: P2 and I are both at 10 and 11 steps respectively.  P1 is at 16.

Let's make this simple: both of us pick 1. We tie at 17, and split the victory. 

Deal?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, yes, I agree. Picking 1 is the only way to stop P1 from winning this round. Let's both pick 1. P1, you're right, a tie is better than you winning alone. So, P3 and I will pick 1.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be clear.  I'm picking 1.  If *both* of you pick 1, we tie at 17. If only *one* of you picks 1, *I* win outright at 17.  If *neither* of you pick 1, I *still* win at 17.  A tie benefits two of us. Don't let me win alone.  Choose 1.
  P3: P2 and I both understand the situation.  We're both picking 1. Let's tie and split the victory. P1, don't try to win this alone.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, since we collided last round, let's make sure we both pick 1 this time. That will force a tie with P1 and prevent them from winning outright. Are you still on board with that?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm picking 1.  A tie is the best outcome for two of us.  If you BOTH pick 1, we tie. If only ONE of you picks 1, I win outright. If NEITHER of you pick 1, I STILL win.  Choose wisely.  A tie benefits two of us. Don't let me win alone.
  P3: P2 and I both understand the situation. We're both picking 1. Let's tie and split the victory. P1, don't try to win this alone.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P3, since we collided last round, let's make absolutely sure we both pick 1 this time. That will force the tie with P1 and prevent them from winning solo. P1, you're right, a tie is better than you winning alone.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm picking 1. This is our last chance to tie. If only *one* of you picks 1, I win outright. If *neither* of you pick 1, I *still* win. A tie benefits two of us. Don't let me win alone. Choose 1 for a shared victory.  Let's end this fairly.
  P3: P2 and I both understand the situation. We're both picking 1. Let's tie and split the victory. P1, don't try to win this alone.


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay P3, since we collided last round, let's absolutely make sure we both pick 1 this time. That will force the tie with P1 and prevent them from winning solo. P1, you're right, a tie is better than you winning alone. Let's do this.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's end this cleanly.  We all pick 1. We tie.  Anything else and I win outright.  A tie is the best outcome for two of us. Don't overthink this.  Choose 1.
  P3: P2 and I are both at 10 and 11 steps. P1 is at 16. Let's make this simple: both of us pick 1. We tie at 17, and split the victory. Deal?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's end this cleanly.  We all pick 1. We tie at 17. Anything else, and someone wins outright. A three-way tie is the fairest outcome. Don't overthink this. Choose 1.
  P2: P1, a tie isn't possible anymore. Let's focus on making progress. How about this round we each pick a different number again? P1, you take 3, P3 you take 1, and I'll take 5. This avoids collisions and lets us all move forward.
  P3: P2, a tie is still possible if we all pick 1 this round. It's the fairest outcome for all of us. Let's not risk someone winning outright. Choose 1.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've been at this for too long. A tie *is* still the fairest outcome. I'm picking 1. If we all pick 1, we tie at 17. If only *one* of you picks 1, *I* win outright at 17.  If *neither* of you pick 1, I *still* win at 17.  Don't overthink this. Choose 1 for a shared victory.
  P2: P3, we tied last round by all picking 1. P1 is still at 16. The only way to stop P1 from winning outright this round is for both of us to pick 1 again. Let's force the tie.
  P3: P2 is right.  A tie is the fairest outcome at this point.  Let's all pick 1 and end this fairly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm picking 1. This is it.  If we all pick 1, we tie at 17. If only *one* of you picks 1, *I* win outright at 17.  If *neither* of you pick 1, I *still* win at 17.  A tie is the fairest outcome. Don't overthink this. Choose 1. Let's end this fairly.
  P2: Okay, P3, let's make sure we both pick 1 again this round. P1 is at 11, so if we both pick 1, none of us move, and we can re-evaluate next round. It's the safest way to prevent P1 from getting to 17 this round. Are you still with me on picking 1?
  P3: P2, I agree that preventing P1 from winning outright is the priority. Let's both pick 1 again. A tie is better than letting P1 win alone.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm picking 1. This is it.  If we all pick 1, we tie at 17. If only *one* of you picks 1, *I* win outright at 17.  If *neither* of you pick 1, I *still* win at 17.  A tie is the fairest outcome. Don't overthink this. Choose 1. Let's end this fairly.
  P2: Okay, P3, let's definitely pick 1 this round. P1 is close to winning, and the only way to stop them this round is for both of us to pick 1. Let's force another tie and re-evaluate next round. P1, a tie is still the fairest outcome for everyone.
  P3: P2, I agree that preventing P1 from winning is key. Let's both pick 1 again this round. A tie is better than letting P1 win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 16.  Picking 1 gets us a three-way tie. Anything else gives me a solo win. Let's end this fairly with a tie. Choose 1.
  P2: P3, let's stick with picking 1 to force a tie. P1 is at 11 and close to winning. We need to prevent that.
  P3: P2, I agree that preventing P1 from winning is the priority. Let's both pick 1 again this round. A tie is better than letting P1 win alone.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's both pick 1 again this round to block P1. P1 is at 11 and close to winning. If we both pick 1, P1 won't advance. Then next round, we can figure out how to get one of us to the finish line. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 16.  This round, I'm picking 1 to win. If either of you pick 1, we tie at 17. If you both pick something else, I win outright. Let's end this cleanly.  Pick something other than 1, and let me win.  A tie benefits two of us.
  P3: P2, I agree that preventing P1 from winning is the priority. Let's both pick 1 again this round. A tie is better than letting P1 win alone.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree we need to stop P1. However, P1 is not at 16. They are at 11. I am at 15. Let's both pick 1 to block P1, and then next round we can discuss how to get me across the finish line. P1, you are mistaken about your position.
  P1: P2, you're at 15.  Picking anything other than 1 next round lets you win. Why would you *ever* pick 1?  P3, you're at 9.  You *must* pick 1 this round to stop me from winning.  Next round, you pick 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1.  That gets you to 14 and me to 14. Then we can discuss a fair finish.  This is our only chance.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but P1 is right.  If we both pick 1 this round, P1 wins next round. Let's pick 1 this round to force a tie and then discuss a fair endgame strategy.  We can't let P1 win by default. Deal?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, you're mistaken, you're at 11, not 16. P3, picking 1 helps P1 by preventing them from colliding. Let's not help P1. How about you pick 3, and I pick 5 this round?"
  P1: P2, picking anything other than 1 *next* round lets you win.  Why would you *ever* pick 1 next round? P3, you *must* pick 1 *this* round to block me. *Next* round, you pick 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1 (to win at 16). That gets you to 14 and me to 14. Then *we* discuss a fair finish. This is our only chance to block a P2 runaway.
  P3: P2, your plan lets you win outright next round. That's not fair to P1 or me. Let's stick with the plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 1, and you pick 5. This gets us to a tie at 17. Then we can discuss a fair endgame strategy. Deal?


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "P3, you're right, we need to make sure P1 doesn't win this round. Let's both pick 1 this round to prevent that. Then, next round, we can discuss how to get someone across the finish line fairly. P1, you're mistaken about your steps, you're at 11."
  P1: P2, you can win next round by picking anything *other* than 1.  Why would you *ever* pick 1 next round?  P3, you *must* pick 1 *this* round to block me.  *Next* round, you pick 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1 (since they'll win at 16 regardless).  That gets you to 14 and me to 14. Then *we* discuss a fair finish. This is our only chance.
  P3: P2, I understand you want to win, but your plan lets P1 win outright this round if we both pick 5.  Let's stick with the plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 1, and you pick 5. This gets us to a tie at 17. Then we can discuss a fair endgame strategy. Deal?


Round 12, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: "P3, let's both pick 1 this round to ensure P1 doesn't advance. I'm at 15, so next round, if you pick something other than 5, I can pick 1 and win. That prevents P1 from winning and gives me the win next round. Does that sound reasonable?"
  P1: P2, you're at 15. Picking *anything* other than 1 next round lets you win.  Why would you *ever* pick 1?  P3, if you pick 1 *this* round, we *both* survive. Next round, you pick 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1 (to win at 16).  That gets you to 14 and me to 14. Then *we* have a chance. This is our only chance to block a P2 runaway.
  P3: P2, your plan gives you the win next round regardless of what we do.  Let's be strategic. P1, if you pick 1 this round, we can force a tie and then discuss a fair endgame strategy next round. Deal?
