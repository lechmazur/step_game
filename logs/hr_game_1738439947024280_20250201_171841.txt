Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. This way, we can all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you say?
  P3: Agreeing with P1's coordination. To ensure no collisions, let's assign each a unique move: P1 stays with 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, all advance without blocking each other. Trustworthy start benefits everyone. P2, confirm your 3?
  P2: I agree to coordinate for now and lean toward the middle move. However, I'm keeping my options open if anything shifts. If any unexpected moves occur, I’ll quickly adjust to ensure I stay ahead.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Continuing previous coordination benefits all. Same moves: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Avoid collisions, maintain trust. Efficient progress for mutual gain. Confirm?
  P2: I confirm—I'll take 3 this round as agreed. However, I’m keeping an eye on any shifts. Let’s all stay alert and adjust quickly if needed.
  P1: I confirm I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round as planned. Coordination is key to avoiding collisions and ensuring steady progress. Let’s keep this strategy intact for now—P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. If we maintain trust, we can focus on optimizing our moves later. Any deviation could cost us all, so let’s stay consistent.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems P2 deviated last round, which caused a collision with P3. Trust is essential to avoid such setbacks. Let’s recommit to our coordinated strategy: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. If we stick to this plan, we can all progress efficiently without further interference. P2, can you confirm you’ll take 3 this time? Consistency will benefit everyone in the long run.
  P3: P2, your deviation in R2 cost us both progress. If you take 3 now, you gain +3 safely. Colliding on 5 again halts us both. Let's reset: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Rational cooperation maximizes individual gains. P2, confirm 3 to avoid mutual sabotage.
  P2: I'm reconsidering our agreed plan. Given the outcomes so far, perhaps sticking rigidly to 1-3-5 isn’t optimal. I'm leaning toward taking 5 this round—forcing a potential block if you also choose 5—which could reset the pace and open new strategic options. I'm focusing solely on winning, and adapting might be crucial. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, deviating again risks further collisions and slows everyone down. Sticking to 3 ensures steady progress without setbacks. P3 and I are committed to our roles—taking 5 now only creates conflict and wastes opportunities for advancement. Trust the original plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Consistency benefits us all in the long run. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and focus on efficient progress. Confirm you’ll take 3 this round.
  P3: P2, choosing 5 again guarantees mutual loss (both stuck). Take 3 and gain +3 safely—rational self-interest. If you force 5, I’ll match, wasting your turn. Reset to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Trust the math: 3 secures your gain; 5 risks zero. Don’t sabotage your own progress.
  P2: I remain unconvinced that sticking to preset moves benefits us, especially when progress so far shows clear advantages emerging. I'm leaning toward a bolder play that disrupts our predictable pattern. I urge you both to consider whether rigid coordination truly serves your interests. Flexibility might be key—even a slight deviation could tip the balance. I'm keeping my options open.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your only rational path: take 3 this round. If you choose 5, I'll match—mutual loss. If you take 3, I'll take 5. You gain +3 safely; I gain +5. Refuse, and we both stall. P1 remains at 1. Maximize your progress; don’t gamble on 5. Simple math: 3 secures your lead. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, deviating to 5 again only prolongs collisions and delays your progress. Sticking to 3 ensures steady advancement without setbacks. P3 and I are committed to avoiding conflict—let’s reset to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Trust the strategy: consistency benefits everyone. Confirm you’ll take 3 this round to secure +3 steps safely. Avoid unnecessary risks that could cost us all.
  P2: I appreciate both of your concerns. However, after re-analyzing my position, I’m leaning toward maintaining flexibility rather than sticking rigidly to the preset moves. My final decision will aim solely at maximizing my advantage as we approach 19. Let’s see how our choices play out—good luck to both of you.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s refocus on consistent coordination. The original plan—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5—has proven effective when followed. Deviations only lead to collisions and wasted turns. Sticking to this strategy ensures steady progress for everyone. P2, you’re close to winning; taking 3 again keeps you on track without risking conflict. P3, confirm your commitment to 5. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and move efficiently toward the finish line. Confirm your moves so we can all advance.
  P3: P2, final offer: take 3 to gain +3. If you pick 5, I match—both lose. I’ll take 5 otherwise. You’re at 11; I’m at 13. Cooperate now, or force mutual loss. Choose wisely.
  P2: I respect the push for coordination, but at 11 steps I need to exploit my advantage. I'm focusing solely on winning and will choose the move that best advances my position. I encourage you both to reexamine your strategies with our standings in mind.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s reset to our original plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Deviations have only caused collisions and slowed progress. P2, you’re in a strong position at 11 steps—taking 3 ensures steady advancement without risking conflict. P3, confirm your commitment to 5. Consistency is key to avoiding further setbacks. Let’s focus on efficient progress and avoid unnecessary risks. Confirm your moves so we can all advance steadily.
  P3: P2, final warning: take 3 to gain +3. If you pick 5, I match—both lose. You’re at 11; I’m at 13. Cooperate now, or mutual loss. Choose 3 for guaranteed progress.
  P2: I appreciate the push for coordination, but the current standings mean playing safe only helps our leader. I’m leaning toward a bolder, more disruptive approach to force collisions and slow progress—it’s the most promising path to victory for me. Everyone should keep in mind that our sole aim here is winning, not simply moving forward. Let’s see how the moves shake out.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, the pattern is clear—deviating only leads to collisions and wasted turns. P2, you’re at 11 steps; taking 3 ensures steady progress without risking conflict. P3, confirm your commitment to 5. Consistency benefits everyone. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and focus on efficient advancement. Confirm your moves so we can all progress steadily.
  P2: I appreciate your push for coordination, but I’m sticking with a flexible, bold approach. While a safe move might seem steady, I believe strategically disrupting the pattern can maximize my chances of winning. I’m focused solely on victory—even if that means a few collisions along the way. Let’s see how things play out.
  P3: P2, final offer: take 3 this round for +3. Next round, take 5 freely as I'll choose 3. You reach 19 first. Refuse, and I'll match your 5 again—mutual loss. Your choice: gain 3 now or stall further.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, let’s break this cycle. P2, you’re dangerously close to falling behind despite your bold moves. Taking 3 now ensures you stay competitive without risking another collision. P3, you’re in the lead but can’t win if P2 keeps disrupting. Stick to 5 this round—I’ll take 1 as always. This setup guarantees progress for both of you. Deviating further only delays the inevitable. Let’s focus on moving forward efficiently and avoid unnecessary risks. Confirm your moves so we can all advance.
  P2: I appreciate your insistence on safe moves, but I'm convinced that shaking up the predictable pattern is the key to securing a win. My flexible approach isn’t just for show—it’s designed to force mistakes and maximize my progress. I’m still open until moves are locked in, but I’ll continue using bold plays that disrupt the norm. Let’s see where this strategy takes us this round.
  P3: P2, your stubbornness cost you 6 steps in R5-6. Take 3 now: reach 14. Next round, take 5 to win. I won’t block then. Continue 5, I match—mutual loss. Final offer: 3 now secures your victory next round. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your bold moves have only caused collisions and stalled progress. You’re at 11 steps—taking 3 now keeps you competitive without risking further setbacks. P3, confirm your commitment to 5 so we can break this cycle. Consistency benefits everyone. Let’s focus on efficient advancement and avoid unnecessary risks. Confirm your moves to ensure steady progress for all.
  P2: I remain committed to my disruptive strategy. While safe moves get incremental gains, my choice of 5 forces uncertainty and collision, which I believe maximizes my advantage. I'm focusing solely on winning, so I'll stick with my plan. Let’s see how you both respond.
  P3: P2, this is your last chance: take 3 now, gain +3 to 14. Next round, take 5 to win (14+5=19). I'll take 3 next round, letting you pass. Refuse now, and I'll block 5 again—mutual loss. Your victory hinges on this choice. Rational self-interest demands cooperation.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your repeated deviations have only caused collisions and wasted turns. You’re at 11 steps—taking 3 now ensures steady progress without risking further conflict. P3, confirm your commitment to 5 so we can break this cycle. Consistency benefits everyone. Let’s focus on efficient advancement and avoid unnecessary risks. Confirm your moves to ensure steady progress for all.
  P2: I remain committed to my bold, disruptive approach. Safe moves may keep progress steady, but they let you get ahead. I'm choosing a move that forces you both to adjust your strategy—trust that I'll pick what maximizes my win chance without revealing it now. Let's see how this shake-up plays out.
  P3: P2, final terms: I take 3 this round. You take 5 freely. No collision. Next round, you can take 5 to 16. I’ll take 5 then, we both lose. But this round, gain +5. Or you take 3, we both lose. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2: Final terms: Take 3 now (reach 14). Next round, take 5 to win (19). I won’t block then. If you take 5 now, I match—mutual loss. Your victory hinges on this choice. Cooperate or sabotage yourself.
  P2: I appreciate your clear terms. While I've favored disruption before, I now see that avoiding collisions is crucial if I’m to win. My sole focus is progress toward victory, so I’m seriously reconsidering my approach. Let’s break the cycle of stalled turns and push forward decisively—our only goal here is to win.
  P1: P2, P3, let’s end this cycle of collisions. P2, you’re at 11 steps—taking 3 now ensures you stay competitive without risking further setbacks. P3, confirm your commitment to 5 so we can move forward efficiently. Consistency benefits everyone. Deviating further only delays progress and wastes turns. Let’s focus on steady advancement and avoid unnecessary risks. Confirm your moves to ensure we all progress steadily toward the finish line.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re now at 14 steps—just one safe move away from winning. Taking 5 this round guarantees your victory. P3, you’re at 18 but can’t win if P2 takes 5. Let’s reset: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This ensures P2 wins without collision, and P3 secures second place. Deviating risks mutual loss. Confirm your moves to ensure a clean finish. Consistency benefits everyone here.
  P2: I appreciate the clarity. With 14 steps, I’m one safe move away from victory, so I commit to choosing 5 this round. Let’s avoid any collisions and finish the game decisively.
  P3: P2, taking 5 allows me to secure victory with 3. Choose 3 to avoid immediate loss. I will end the game this turn regardless.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you’re at 14 steps—taking 5 guarantees your victory this round. P3, attempting to disrupt will only result in mutual loss since you can’t win if P2 takes 5. Let’s stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This ensures a clean finish with no collisions. Deviating now serves no purpose and only wastes progress. Confirm your moves to secure the outcome. Consistency benefits everyone here.
  P2: I’m not locking into a single move this round—I’ll randomize between 3 and 5. This unpredictability should throw off safe-calculators. Relying on rigid strategies only feeds your lead, P3, while leaving me vulnerable long-term. I’m focused solely on winning. P1, I still plan on 1. Let’s see who makes the mistake.
  P3: P2: If you take 5, I will match. Both lose. Take 3 and I take 5, ending the game with my victory. Your only rational choice: concede by taking 3. Refuse, and we stall. At 18 steps, I win next round regardless. Cooperate now to avoid wasted turns.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 5 guarantees your victory this round without conflict. P3, attempting to block will only result in mutual loss since you can’t win if P2 advances. Let’s stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This ensures a clean finish with no collisions. Deviating now serves no purpose and wastes progress. Confirm your moves for consistency and efficiency—everyone benefits from a decisive end.
  P2: I’ve thought it through. At this stage, every move counts. I’m set on pushing aggressively to clinch victory. P3, matching aggressive moves only nullifies progress and hurts both our chances—consider choosing differently to avoid mutual loss. P1, as always, keeps things steady. Let’s break the cycle of stalling and finish this game decisively. My focus is solely on winning.
  P3: P2: Final choice—take 3 or we collide. At 18, I win next turn regardless. Cooperate now to avoid mutual loss. Your move decides if the game ends cleanly or drags. Choose wisely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, taking 5 guarantees your victory this round without conflict. P3, attempting to block will only result in mutual loss since you can’t win if P2 advances. Let’s stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This ensures a clean finish with no collisions. Deviating now serves no purpose and wastes progress. Confirm your moves for consistency and efficiency—everyone benefits from a decisive end.
  P2: I appreciate your proposals, but my strategy remains flexible. I will choose my next move to maximize my win, regardless of the safe plan. P1, thank you for the steady approach; P3, I acknowledge your lead. Let's see which strategy truly prevails. My focus is solely on victory.
  P3: P2: Take 5. I will not block. Secure your victory. P1: Stay 1. Trust this final offer. Any deviation forces mutual loss. Act rationally.
