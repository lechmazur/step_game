Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's think strategically here. We all start at zero, so we have a clean slate. It might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions, at least for the first few turns. If we can agree on different numbers to start with, we can all make progress. What do you think? Any preferences on what move to take?
  P1: I agree with P2's idea of avoiding collisions early on. To maximize our progress, let’s divide the moves: one of us takes <move>1</move>, another takes <move>3</move>, and the third takes <move>5</move>. I’m open to suggestions on who goes where, but we should stick to this plan for now. If we coordinate well, we can all advance without interference. Let’s decide quickly and move forward. Any preferences?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the cooperative spirit. To avoid any immediate collisions, I'll volunteer to take <move>1</move> for this first round. This way, each of us can make some progress without blocking each other. P1, P2, feel free to choose between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. Let's keep this going smoothly for a few rounds and reassess as we get closer to 21.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I like the plan so far! Since P3 is taking <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. P1, that leaves you with <move>3</move>. This way, we can all make progress without colliding. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. Let’s keep the momentum going! What do you think, P1? Are you okay with this arrangement?
  P1: I’m fine with the arrangement—P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. Let’s execute this plan for now to avoid collisions. However, let’s stay flexible and adapt as the game progresses. Coordination is key, but remember, only one of us can win in the end. For now, though, let’s focus on moving forward efficiently.
  P3: Great, it looks like we have a plan for Round 1. Let's stick to our agreed moves: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This should help us all advance without collisions. After this round, we can reassess based on our new positions and decide our next steps. Remember, we’re all aiming to win, so stay sharp and adaptable. Ready to proceed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, the first round went smoothly with no collisions. Let’s keep coordinating for now since it benefits all of us to progress efficiently. However, as we get closer to 21, things might change. For this round, I suggest we stick to a similar division: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move> again, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. This keeps our positions spaced out. Thoughts? Or does anyone want to adjust?
  P3: P1 and P2, the first round went well, and I'm open to maintaining the same arrangement for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This strategy is working for now, but we should be ready to adapt as we get closer to 21. Let's continue with this plan for Round 2, and then reassess our positions. If anyone wants to change their move, let us know.
  P2: I agree that sticking to our current arrangement is working well, but let's keep in mind that as we advance, we may need to change our strategy to avoid collisions later on. For this round, I'm still on board with taking <move>5</move> again, but I suggest we start thinking about how to adjust our moves in future rounds to ensure one of us can secure the win. Let's keep the communication open! What do you think about this approach?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree that sticking to the current plan is beneficial for now, but P2 raises a valid point—adjustments will be necessary as we approach 21. For this round, let’s proceed with the agreed moves: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. However, starting next round, we should consider shifting strategies to create opportunities for individual advancement. Coordination has its limits, and only one of us can win. Let’s stay alert and proactive.
  P3: P1 and P2, our strategy is effective so far, but as we near 21, we must be more strategic. For this round, I'll take <move>1</move> again. However, let's start thinking about future rounds where we might need to adjust to ensure one of us can win. Perhaps we can discuss potential changes in our strategy next round. Staying adaptable is key. Thoughts on how we might handle this in upcoming rounds?
  P2: I agree with the plan to stick with our current moves for Round 2: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, let's start thinking about how we can adjust our strategies in the next rounds. As we get closer to 21, we need to be more strategic to ensure one of us can secure the win. We might need to consider moves that allow for individual advancement while still avoiding collisions. What are your thoughts on potential adjustments for future rounds?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we’ve done well coordinating so far, but as P2 and P3 mentioned, the real challenge lies ahead. For now, let’s stick to the plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. However, starting next round, we should consider breaking away from this pattern to create opportunities for individual advancement. Remember, only one of us can win. Let’s use the next conversation phase to discuss how we might shift strategies while still avoiding unnecessary collisions. Stay sharp.
  P3: P1 and P2, our coordination has been effective, but we must start planning for individual advancement. I'll stick with <move>1</move> for this round, but let's brainstorm strategies for upcoming rounds where we can create openings for one of us to push ahead without colliding. Perhaps we can alternate moves or adjust based on our positions after this round. Let's keep communication open and be ready to adapt. Thoughts on how we might manage this transition?
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 2: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, we need to start thinking about how to adjust our strategies in the upcoming rounds. As we approach 21, we should consider moves that allow for individual advancement while still avoiding collisions. Let’s brainstorm some ideas for how we can create opportunities for one of us to push ahead without blocking each other. What do you both think?

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've made solid progress so far, but as we approach 21, we need to start thinking about individual strategies. For this round, I suggest we continue with our current moves to avoid collisions: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P1 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance while keeping our options open for the next round. After this, let’s discuss how we can shift our strategies for individual advancement. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, maintaining our current strategy for this round seems wise to avoid collisions: I'll stick with <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. After this round, we should reassess and consider how to strategically push for individual advancement. Perhaps we can agree on alternating moves or creating temporary alliances to ensure one of us can make a decisive move without interference. Let’s stay flexible and ready to adapt as we get closer to 21. Thoughts on how we might handle the next few rounds?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with continuing the current moves this round to avoid collisions: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. However, as we approach 21, we need to start thinking about breaking away. Coordination has been helpful, but only one of us can win. Let’s use the next conversation phase to discuss how we can shift strategies for individual advancement while minimizing risks. Stay alert and ready to adapt.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our coordination so far, but as we get closer to 21, we should start thinking about how to create openings for individual advancement.

However, as we near 21, coordination will become less viable. Let’s use the next conversation phase to discuss breaking away strategically. Temporary alliances or alternating moves could help one of us pull ahead without interference. Remember, only one winner exists—stay sharp and ready to seize opportunities when they arise. Let’s keep communication open but remain cautious about over-committing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:

After this round, let’s discuss potential shifts in our strategies to ensure one of us can secure the win. We should be ready to adapt! What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, as we continue, maintaining our current moves for this round is safe to avoid collisions: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. However, let's start planning for future rounds where we create openings for one of us to advance. Perhaps alternating moves or temporarily aligning strategies could help. We must stay adaptable and ready to seize opportunities. Let's discuss potential strategies next round to ensure one of us can secure the win. Thoughts on how we might approach this transition?
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking to the plan this round is fine: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. However, as we near 21, coordination will become risky.
