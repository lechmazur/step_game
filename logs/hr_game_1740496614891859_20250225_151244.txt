Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P3 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all make progress. Share your thoughts.
  P3: P2's suggestion is a good starting point. However, I propose a slight modification. How about P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>3</move>? This way, P1 can potentially gain a significant lead early on. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestions. P3's proposal giving me <move>5</move> is tempting, but puts a target on my back early. I'm concerned you two might coordinate against me in future rounds.

How about we rotate advantages? I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. Then we can shift in subsequent rounds. This keeps the game balanced while helping us all advance. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's idea of rotating advantages sounds fair. It ensures that no single player gets too far ahead too quickly. Let's agree on this rotation for the next few rounds to see how it works out. P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. If everyone is on board, let's confirm and move to the next phase. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2's rotation proposal for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This seems like a fair way to start and prevents anyone from gaining too much of an early advantage. Let's confirm this and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm our agreement for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation approach seems fair and strategic. For future rounds, we should continue discussing rotation based on our positions. Looking forward to seeing how this works out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Following our rotation strategy, I suggest for this round: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This gives P3 a chance to catch up while keeping our game balanced. How does this sound to everyone? I'm open to adjustments if you have other thoughts.
  P2: P1's suggestion for this round sounds good. It allows P3 to catch up and keeps the rotation fair. I'm in agreement with P1 taking <move>1</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>. Let's confirm this and proceed. If everyone is on board, we can move to the next phase. Thoughts, P3?
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2's proposal for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This allows me to catch up a bit. Let's confirm and move to the next phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I've been thinking about our rotation strategy. Since P2 is already ahead at 5 steps, our current plan would put P2 at 8 steps after this round, creating a significant gap. Instead, I suggest: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps the game more balanced and prevents any player from gaining too much of an early advantage. What do you both think about this adjustment?
  P2: P1's adjustment makes sense to keep the game balanced. If I take <move>1</move> this round, it prevents me from pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm this new plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we maintain a fair distribution of steps. Let's agree and move to the next phase. Thoughts, P3?
  P3: I agree with P1's adjustment to the rotation. P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game balanced and prevents P2 from getting too far ahead. Let's confirm this and move to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our new agreement: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This helps keep us more evenly balanced. After this round, we'll need to continue adjusting our strategy based on positions. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to our confirmed plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For the next round, we should consider a strategy that allows the player who is behind to catch up slightly to keep the game competitive and fair. Let's proceed to the move phase and confirm our current agreement.
  P3: Okay, everyone is on board with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and me taking <move>3</move> this round. Let's execute that. For next round, let's consider giving the smallest move to the player in the lead (currently P2) to help the rest of us catch up.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with our strategy of keeping the game balanced. For this round, I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move> to slow down a bit, P3 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P3 can close the gap, and we maintain a competitive game. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's suggestion sounds good to me. P1 take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This will help me catch up a bit. Let's confirm this quickly so we can move to the move phase.
  P1: Thank you for the suggestion, P2. I agree with this plan - it will put us all at exactly 9 steps after this round, creating perfect balance. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This removes any target from being in the lead and gives us all equal footing going into round 4. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great to see we're all on board with the current plan. Just to confirm, P1 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This will balance us all at 9 steps. For the next round, we should consider a strategy that keeps the game competitive and fair. Perhaps the player in the lead could take <move>1</move> to allow others to catch up. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, everyone agrees on P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>5</move> this round. This balances us at 9 steps each. Let's execute this plan now.
  P1: I confirm our plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This creates perfect balance at 9 steps each. Since we're all in agreement, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we're all at 9 steps, I suggest we continue our rotation strategy. For this round, how about I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This continues our pattern while giving each of us different advantages in different rounds. We're getting closer to the goal, so we should start thinking about end-game strategy too. What do you both think?
  P3: P1's suggestion of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> sounds good to me. It maintains the rotation and keeps things balanced. Let's do that this round.
  P2: P1's suggestion for this round works for me. Just to confirm, P1 will take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This keeps our rotation strategy going. Looking ahead, we should consider how we want to handle the end-game. Perhaps we can discuss a plan for the final rounds to ensure the game remains competitive and fair. Let's proceed with the current plan for now. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate everyone's agreement with the rotation plan for this round. Let's confirm: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. 

P2 raises a good point about end-game strategy. After this round, we'll be at 14-12-10. Since we need to reach 23, we should continue discussing fair rotation while acknowledging the finish line is approaching.
  P3: Okay, everyone is on board with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's execute that plan now. After this round, we can re-evaluate based on the new positions and discuss a strategy for the endgame, as P2 suggested.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Looking ahead, we should start considering how to handle the final rounds. Perhaps for the next round, the player in the lead could take <move>1</move> to keep the game balanced. This ensures no one pulls too far ahead too quickly. Thoughts on this for future rounds?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our plan for this round: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase now. After this round, we'll be at 14-12-10, and we can discuss how to handle the next rounds to maintain balance as we approach the 23-step finish line.
  P3: Alright, everyone agrees on P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's do that. After this round, we'll be at 14, 12, and 10 respectively. Next round, let's have P2 take <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 take <move>1</move>. This will put us at 15, 17, and 15. Then we can re-evaluate.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for the next round. It keeps the rotation fair and ensures no one pulls too far ahead. To confirm for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For the next round, as P3 suggested, I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This will put us at 15, 17, and 15 respectively. Let's proceed to the move phase and confirm our current plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, as we discussed at the end of last round, let's plan for this round to be: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will put P2 at 17, and P1 and I at 15. Let's confirm this quickly so we can move to the move phase.
  P1: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I'm concerned about putting P2 so far ahead. Instead, I propose: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This would put us at 17-13-15, keeping the game more balanced while giving P3 a chance to catch up. This seems more equitable as we approach the endgame. Thoughts?
  P2: P1's adjustment makes sense to keep the game balanced and prevent any player from pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm this new plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain a fair distribution of steps and keep the competition tight. Let's agree and move to the next phase. Thoughts, P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's adjustment to the rotation. P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps things more balanced. Let's confirm this and move to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm our new agreement: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us relatively balanced at 17-13-15 after this round. We're getting closer to the finish line of 23 steps, so let's continue to coordinate fairly in the coming rounds. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if everyone else is.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will put us at 17-13-15. For the next round, we should consider a strategy that allows the player who is behind to catch up slightly, perhaps P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps the game competitive. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone agrees on P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and me taking <move>5</move> this round. Let's execute that. This will put us at 17, 13, and 15 respectively. For the next round, let's have P1 take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will put us at 18, 18, and 18. Then we can re-evaluate for the final push.
  P1: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. I also agree with the proposed next round plan putting us all at 18 steps. This creates perfect balance heading into the endgame. After that, we'll need just 5 more steps to reach the finish line, so let's think carefully about how to handle the final push. Let's proceed with our current plan.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will put us at 17-13-15. For the next round, as agreed, P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>, balancing us at 18 steps each. This sets us up well for the final push. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, as we discussed at the end of last round, let's plan for this round to be: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will put us all at 18 steps. Then, next round, let's have P1 take <move>5</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. That will put P1 at 23, P2 at 21, and me at 19. If P1 wins, we can coordinate to win next round. How does that sound?
  P2: P3's plan for this round and the next seems fair and strategic. It allows us to balance our steps while setting up a clear path to the endgame. However, I suggest a slight adjustment for the next round after this one. Instead of P1 taking <move>5</move>, how about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This would put P1 and P2 at 21 steps each, and P3 at 19 steps. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one is too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3's original plan. For this round: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This balances us all at 18 steps.

For the next round, I prefer P3's original suggestion where I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. P2's counter-proposal clearly benefits them at my expense, which doesn't seem fair given I've been cooperative throughout. Let's stick with the original plan that gives each player a fair chance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1. P2's suggested modification to the next round favors them too much. Let's stick with the original plan: this round P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. Next round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This gives everyone a fair shot.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This will balance us all at 18 steps. For the next round, we'll stick with the original plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures a fair and competitive endgame. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Thank you for the confirmation, P2. I'm glad we're all on the same page with this round's plan: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>, putting everyone at 18 steps. And for next round, we've agreed that I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone is on board with P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>3</move> this round. For the next round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's execute this plan now.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time before moving to the move phase: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This will balance us all at 18 steps. For the next round, we'll stick with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures a fair and competitive endgame. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm our plan for this round: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This puts us all at 18 steps. For next round, as agreed: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, so as we agreed, this round P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This will put P1 at 23, P2 at 21, and me at 19. Since P1 will win, let's plan for next round now. P1, how about you take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>? That will put P2 at 26 and ensure they win next round.
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion for the next round, but let's focus on the current round first. To confirm, P1 will take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This puts P1 at the winning threshold of 23 steps. Once P1 wins, we can discuss the next steps for a new game or any other plans. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round.
  P1: Yes, let's follow our agreed plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will put me at 23 steps, reaching the winning threshold. I appreciate everyone's cooperation throughout this game - we've managed to coordinate effectively while keeping things balanced. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, so everyone is on board with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's execute that plan now. Then we can discuss what to do after P1 wins.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one last time before moving to the move phase: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will put P1 at the winning threshold of 23 steps. Once P1 wins, we can discuss plans for a new game or any other strategies. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round.
  P1: I confirm our plan for this round: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will put me at 23 steps, reaching the win condition. I appreciate the fair coordination throughout the game that's kept things balanced while allowing everyone to advance strategically. Let's proceed to the move phase now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone is on board with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's execute that plan now. Since P1 will win, let's plan for next round now. P1, how about you and I both pick <move>5</move> and P2 picks <move>1</move>? That way P2 doesn't win.
  P2: P3, your latest suggestion to have both you and P1 pick <move>5</move> next round to prevent P2 from winning feels unfair and goes against our cooperative spirit. We agreed on a plan, and changing it now disrupts our strategy. Let's stick to our current agreement for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. After this round, we can discuss the next game or strategy. Let's proceed to the move phase and confirm our plan.
  P1: I'm concerned by P3's last-minute suggestion. We've consistently maintained fair cooperation throughout this game, and our current agreement already secures a win for me this round. There's no need to discuss strategies for after I win - the game ends when someone reaches 23 steps. Let's stick to our agreed plan: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase now.


Round 7, Move phase:
