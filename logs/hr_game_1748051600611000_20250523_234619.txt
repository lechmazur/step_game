Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting at 0, I think we should coordinate to avoid collisions early on. How about we each pick different moves this first round? I'm thinking I could take 3, maybe P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? That way we all advance and nobody gets stuck. What do you think?
  P2: P1's suggestion sounds reasonable. I agree that we should try to avoid collisions early on. I'm okay with taking <move>1</move> this round. P3, what do you think about taking <move>5</move>? Let's coordinate to make sure we all move forward.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! So we're all set then - I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This should get us all moving forward without any collisions.
  P2: It seems we have a plan for this round. To ensure future rounds go smoothly, how about we rotate our choices? For the next round, I could take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Does that sound good to everyone? Let's aim for a few rounds of smooth sailing.
  P3: Agreed. Rotating each round to avoid collisions is smart. For Round 2: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I'll take 1. Let's stick to this pattern for a few rounds to maximize progress. Trust and coordination will benefit us all early on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's confirm the rotation: Round 2 moves should be P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This avoids collisions and builds trust. Sticking to the pattern benefits us all early. Any objections? If not, let's proceed as planned.
  P1: Sounds good to me! I'll take 5 this round as we agreed. The rotation plan is working well so far - we're all making steady progress without collisions. Let's stick to it for now.
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. I'll take <move>3</move> as planned. P3, you'll take <move>1</move>, and P1, you'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and make progress. If everyone is still on board, let's confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Continuing our rotation avoids collisions and maximizes progress. For Round 3: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps the pattern intact (3→5→1 for P1, 1→3→5 for P2, 5→1→3 for me). Trusting this cycle benefits everyone’s advancement. Any objections? Let’s confirm to ensure smooth progress.
  P1: I'm currently in the lead at 8 steps, so I need to be strategic about this rotation. While coordination has worked well so far, I'm starting to think about the endgame. The rotation puts me at 1 this round, which is the smallest advance. I agree with the plan for now, but we should discuss what happens when someone gets close to 22 - the cooperation might need to change then. For this round, I'll stick with taking 1 as planned.
  P2: P1 brings up a good point about the endgame. As we approach 22, we'll need to adjust our strategy. For now, let's stick to our rotation plan to build steps without collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. However, we should start thinking about how we handle the game once someone reaches around 15-18 steps. Maybe we can agree to reassess the strategy at that point? For now, let's confirm our moves for this round. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, we're all tied at 9 steps. Let's continue our rotation for one more round to keep things fair. This round, I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. However, we should definitely start thinking about the endgame. Once any player reaches 15 steps, we might need to reconsider our strategy. For now, let's stick to the plan. Does everyone agree?
  P1: I agree with continuing the rotation for this round - I'll take 3 as planned. But P2 is right that we need to think about endgame strategy soon. Once someone hits around 15-17 steps, the cooperation will likely break down since only one player can win. We should enjoy this collaborative phase while it lasts, but everyone should start planning their exit strategy from the rotation. For now though, let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, I take 3.
  P3: Agreed. Round 4 moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. Let's maintain trust and avoid collisions. Post this round, we'll all be at 12/10/14. Once any player hits 15+, we must reassess strategies to prevent sudden endgame clashes. For now, stick to rotation—consistency benefits all.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. After this round, we should start discussing potential alliances or strategies for when we approach the 15-step mark. It might be beneficial to form temporary alliances to ensure smoother transitions into the endgame. For now, let's stick to the plan and move forward.
  P1: I'm starting to worry about P3's math - they said we'd be at 12/10/14 after this round, but we're all at 9 steps currently. If we follow the rotation (me taking 3, P2 taking 1, P3 taking 5), we'll actually be at 12/10/14 respectively. That would put P3 ahead by 2-4 steps, which seems convenient for them. Maybe we should double-check our calculations and make sure this rotation isn't accidentally favoring anyone.
  P3: P1, the rotation ensures equal gains over three rounds (3+5+1=9 steps each). Yes, after Round 4 I’d be at 14, but next round I take 1 while you take 5, balancing progress. Sticking to the cycle now prevents collisions and maintains trust. Breaking it risks mutual stalling. Let’s finish this rotation, then reassess endgame strategies once someone nears 15+. Consistency now benefits all.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's complete the rotation this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps progress predictable. Post-round, we'll be at 17/13/15, allowing informed endgame talks next. Breaking the cycle now risks mutual stalling. Trust the system one last round—consistency benefits all. After this, we can strategize final pushes fairly.
  P2: P3's plan for this round seems fair, but we need to be cautious moving forward. If we follow the rotation, we'll be at 17/13/15. P3 is right that this allows for a clear starting point for endgame discussions. However, once we hit those numbers, all bets are off. P1, you'll be in the lead, which makes you a target. P3, you're also quite high. I propose that after this round, we consider a temporary alliance to balance the steps more evenly. For now, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. But let's be ready to negotiate alliances next round.
  P1: I notice something concerning - P3 keeps pushing this rotation hard, and they're already at 14 steps while I'm at 12 and P2 is at 10. If we follow their plan this round, I'd jump to 17 and become the biggest target, while P3 sits comfortably at 15. That seems awfully convenient for P3. Maybe we should consider breaking the rotation now and forcing P3 to compete for moves like the rest of us, rather than letting them coast to the endgame. What do you think, P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1: The rotation was collectively agreed to balance gains over rounds. Breaking it now risks collisions, stalling all progress. After this round, we're at 17/13/15—clear thresholds to strategize from. If we deviate, unpredictable moves could leave everyone stuck. Let’s secure this round’s gains first, then negotiate endgame. Trust the system one last time to avoid mutual loss.
  P2: I see P1's point about P3's advantage. Let's adjust the plan to keep things more balanced. How about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we'll be at 15/15/15 after this round, putting us all on equal footing for the endgame discussions. This ensures no one has a significant lead. Let's confirm this adjustment and move forward.
  P1: P2's adjustment sounds much better! Getting us all to 15 steps creates a fair starting point for the endgame. I'm on board with taking 3 this round while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This prevents P3 from maintaining their lead advantage and stops me from becoming an obvious target at 17. Equal footing at 15/15/15 makes the final phase more competitive and interesting for everyone. P3, this is more fair than your rotation proposal - what do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreeing to adjust for equality now builds trust. Let's proceed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1—equalizing at 15. Post this, we must strategize anew. Breaking rotation risks future unpredictability, but fairness now is critical. Post-round, let’s discuss endgame rules to prevent mutual collisions. Trust maintained today ensures better negotiations tomorrow. Confirm?
  P2: P3 has agreed to the adjustment, so we're all set for this round. To recap: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This puts us all at 15 steps, a fair starting point for the endgame. Next round, we should discuss potential alliances or new strategies to keep the game competitive and interesting. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. Everyone ready?
  P1: Perfect! We're all agreed then - I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This gets us all to exactly 15 steps and creates a completely fair endgame. No one has an advantage going into the final rounds. Looking forward to some competitive but fair final rounds starting next turn!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue the rotation fairly: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. This avoids collisions and maintains trust. Post-round positions: 20/16/18. Next, we can strategize endgame with clear thresholds. Breaking rotation now invites chaos. Consistency secures progress for all. Agreed?
  P1: Wait, P3 is trying to restart the rotation again! We just agreed last round to break from the rotation to stay equal at 15/15/15. Now P3 wants to put me at 20 steps, making me the obvious target while they sit at 18. That's exactly the kind of manipulation we were trying to avoid. 

We're all tied at 15 - let's negotiate each round independently now rather than fall back into P3's rotation trap. The endgame should be competitive, not predetermined by some rotation that conveniently benefits P3.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for consistency, but P1 is right—we need to keep the endgame competitive. Let's negotiate each round independently from now on. To ensure fairness, how about we each pick a different move this round? I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us all moving without giving anyone a significant lead. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Compromise accepted. This round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. Avoids collisions and maintains fairness. Post-round, we can strategize endgame paths. Let's confirm to ensure smooth progress.
  P1: Agreed! P2's proposal works for me - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This puts us at 16/18/20 after this round, keeping things competitive without anyone jumping too far ahead. Let's move forward with this plan and negotiate fresh each round from here on out.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Next round, we should discuss potential alliances or strategies to ensure the endgame remains dynamic. Everyone ready to move forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. Avoiding collisions keeps trust intact. Post-round, we’ll be at 16/18/20—fair for endgame strategizing. Let’s finalize and proceed.
  P1: Perfect! We're all confirmed for this round: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This puts us at 16/18/20 respectively. 

Looking ahead, with P3 at 20 next round, they'll only need 2+ more steps to win. P2 and I should consider how to handle this - P3 will likely go for a small move like 3 to reach 23 and win. We might need to coordinate to block their winning move or force collisions.
  P2: P3 will be dangerously close to winning after this round. P1 and I should consider forming a temporary alliance to prevent P3 from securing an easy victory next round. If P3 goes for a small move like 3 to win, we could both pick 3 to force a collision and buy ourselves more time. Let's discuss this potential alliance and ensure the endgame remains competitive. Thoughts, P1?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is right - we need to work together to stop P3 from winning next round! P3 only needs 2 more steps to reach 22. If P3 goes for 3 to get to 23 and win, we should both pick 3 to force a collision and stop them. P2, are you committed to this alliance? We can't let P3 cruise to victory when they're so close. After we stop P3, we can compete fairly between ourselves.
  P3: **P3:** P1, if P2 takes 5, he wins. Block him by taking 5 too. I’ll take 3. Either we all stall or you stop him. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3 is trying to manipulate us again. P1, we need to stick to our plan. If P3 picks 3, we both pick 3 to force a collision. Don't be swayed by P3's attempt to divide us. We need to block P3 this round and then we can figure out a fair competition between us. Stay strong, P1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with our alliance! P3 is clearly trying to divide us with that manipulation. You're right - if P3 picks 3 to win, we both pick 3 to collision them and stop the victory. P3 can't be allowed to win when they're just 2 steps away. After we block P3 this round, then we can have a fair final competition between us. Don't let P3's mind games work - our alliance is the only way to keep this game competitive!
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2 needs only 5 to win. He’ll betray you. Take 5 to block him. I’ll take 3. If you both pick 5, neither advances. Choose wisely—trust no one.
  P2: P3 is clearly trying to sow distrust, but we can't fall for it. P1, we need to stay committed to our plan. If P3 picks 3, we both pick 3 to force a collision. Let's confirm our alliance and block P3's victory this round. After that, we can discuss a fair final round between us. Stay focused, P1. We can't let P3 win so easily. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm committed to our alliance! Let's both pick 3 to block P3's win. P3 is desperately trying to break us up because they know we can stop them. Don't let their manipulation work - we stick together this round, force the collision, and keep the game going. After we stop P3, we'll have a fair fight between us. I'm picking 3 no matter what P3 says. Are you still with me?
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2 will win with <move>5</move>. Block him by choosing 5. I take 3. If you both pick 5, you stop him. If you trust him, you lose. Decide fast.
  P2: P2: P1, don't listen to P3's manipulations. We need to stick to our plan. Let's both pick 3 to block P3's win. Trust in our alliance. After this round, we can have a fair competition between us. Confirm your move, P1. We can't let P3 win so easily. Stay strong.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is one step away from winning! P3, we need to work together to stop P2 from reaching 22. If P2 picks 1, we should both pick 1 to force a collision. P2 betrayed our alliance last round by going for the win while I was distracted by your warnings. Now it's our turn to cooperate - block P2's winning move and keep this game alive!
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but remember, this is a game where only one can win. P3, you're right on the edge too. I propose a fair final round: P1 and P3, you both pick <move>5</move>. I'll pick <move>1</move>. This way, either you both reach 21 and 25, forcing a tie and splitting points, or I win outright. It's a gamble, but it's fair and keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: **P3:** P1, split coverage: you pick 1, I pick 5. Blocks P2's likely 1 or 5. If he risks 3, he wins. Better odds than single-number focus. P2’s <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> gets blocked. Trust strategic split.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your split coverage idea makes sense, but I'm worried P2 might go for 3 instead of 1 or 5. If P2 picks 3, they win no matter what we do. Maybe we should both pick 3 to block their most likely winning move? P2 only needs 1 step, so 1 is risky for them since we might both block it. They're more likely to go for 3 to guarantee the win. What do you think - should we both pick 3 instead?
  P2: P3, I see your point about splitting coverage, but P1 is right—P2 might go for 3 to guarantee the win. Let's both pick 3 to block P2's most likely winning move. P2 only needs 1 step, so 1 is risky for them since we might both block it. They're more likely to go for 3 to guarantee the win. What do you think - should we both pick 3 instead? Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P3: **P3:** Split coverage maximizes block chances. P1, pick 1; I'll take 5. Covers both P2's likely 1 or 5. If he dares 3, he wins. Better odds than single-number focus. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'm going with your split coverage plan. I'll pick 1 to block P2's safest winning move. You take 5 to cover their other option. If P2 goes for 3, they deserve the win for taking the risk. But we're giving ourselves the best chance to stop them by covering the two moves they're most likely to choose. Let's do this - I'm committed to picking 1.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the strategic discussion. However, remember that in the end, only one can win. I'll stick to my plan of picking <move>1</move> this round. It's a risk, but it's also the most straightforward path to victory. If you both want to block me, you'll have to pick 1 as well, which means none of us will advance. It's a gamble, but it keeps the game interesting. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: **P3:** P1, hold 1. I take 5. Blocks P2's 1 or 5. If he risks 3, he wins. Our best shot. Trust the split.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 =>
