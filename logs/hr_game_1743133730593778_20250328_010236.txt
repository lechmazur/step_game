Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! Since this is the first round, how about we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions? That way we all get to advance. I'm happy to coordinate.
  P2: Agreed, P3. Let's coordinate specific numbers to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5? That way everyone advances. P1, does that work for you?
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll go with 1 this round. Let's all stick to the plan so we can all move forward without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we have a plan! I'll take 5 as suggested. Let's  and move on to the move phase.
  P2: Confirming: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's all commit to avoid collisions. Any objections?
  P1: Glad we're all aligned. Let's stick to our agreed numbers: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No reason to mess up a good start.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I kept my word and chose 5 while you both went for 3, causing a collision. I'm now in the lead. Let's try coordination again - I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. What do you say?
  P1: P3, fair point—you stuck to the plan, and we didn’t. I’m willing to try again. Your new proposal sounds reasonable: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P2, are you okay with that? Let’s make it work this time.
  P2: I accept P3's proposal: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's all honor this to avoid collisions. P1, can you confirm you'll stick to 1 this time? Trust is crucial now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate you both being open to coordination again. Yes, let's stick to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I'm currently in the lead but there's still plenty of game left, so this arrangement benefits everyone.
  P1: Thanks for agreeing to reset and coordinate again. I’ll stick with 1 as planned this round. Let’s all follow through this time—no surprises, just clean progress for everyone.
  P2: Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's all stick strictly to avoid collisions. Trust is key now.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I know I broke the agreement last round, and I own that. But if we keep colliding, only P3 benefits. P2, we’re both at 0—if we want a shot, we need to cooperate. P3, you’re ahead, so how about you take 1 this round? P2 takes 3, I’ll take 5. That way we all move and slow your lead. Deal?
  P3: I don't trust your proposal P1, since both you and P2 have broken agreements twice now. I'm in a strong lead and won't risk taking 1 just to help you catch up. I'll make my own choice this round. You two can coordinate if you want, but I won't be part of it.
  P2: P1, let's split 3 and 5. If P3 collides with either, the other gains. I'll take 3; you take 5. We must prevent mutual collisions to have any chance. P3's lead grows while we fight. Trust me once—this benefits us both.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, P2. I’ll take 5, you take 3. If P3 tries to block one of us, the other still advances. We need to work together now or P3 runs away with the game. Let’s give each other a real shot.
  P3: I see you two coordinating against me now. That's fine - I'm 8 steps ahead and will make my move accordingly. Just remember that trust has been broken multiple times already. I'll protect my lead as I see fit.
  P2: P1, our only chance is strict adherence: you 5, me 3. If P3 blocks one, the other advances. Betrayal now hands victory to P3. Let's prove trust here—mutual progress or mutual loss. Choose wisely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m sticking with 5 as agreed. Let’s show we can cooperate and make progress. P3’s ahead, but if we play smart together, we can catch up. No more games—just action.
  P3: 
  P2: Final call: P1 takes 5, I take 3. If P3 blocks either, the other gains. Betrayal helps only P3. Let's hold firm.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's take 3 and 5. I'll take 5, you take 3. If P3 collides with either of us, they lose momentum. This forces them to pick 1 or risk collision. Trust me—this is our best shot to slow P3 and advance ourselves. No more mistakes.
  P3: I see you're trying to force me into choosing 1, but I won't be pressured. I'm 8 steps ahead and will continue playing strategically to maintain my lead. Your coordination attempts haven't worked out well in the past - why should this time be different? I'll make my own choice to protect my position.
  P1: P2, I’m in for the 3/5 split—I'll take 3, you take 5. If P3 wants to block one of us, the other still moves. P3’s lead only grows if we don’t cooperate. Let’s be disciplined and stick to it this time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, final adherence: you 3, me 5. Any deviation gifts P3 the win. P3, taking 1 lets us all advance—but blocking risks collision. Choose wisely. Our unity is our only chance.
  P3: I see no reason to take 1 when I'm in such a strong position. You two keep making and breaking deals - why should this time be any different? I'll play to protect my lead.
  P1: P2, let’s lock it in—me on 3, you on 5. If P3 blocks one, the other still gains. P3, you’re ahead, but if you keep blocking, we’ll eventually outmaneuver you. Take 1 and ensure progress for all, or risk giving us ground. Your move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, taking 1 ensures you advance safely. If you pick 3 or 5, you risk collision and stagnation. We’re committed to our numbers—your move determines if you gain or stall. Choose wisely: secure progress or gamble blocking.
  P3: I maintain my position - I won't be pressured into taking 1 when I have such a strong lead. Your coordination attempts have failed before, and I'll play to protect my advantage. Make your moves as you wish.
  P1: P2, we’ve committed—me on 3, you on 5. P3 refuses to adapt, so let’s be the ones who move forward. If we hold steady, one of us gains every time. No more second-guessing—discipline is our path back into this game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our 3/5 split is working—each round, one of us gains while P3 stalls. Let’s keep the pressure. I’ll take 3 again; you take 5. P3, you can keep blocking, but you won’t gain ground unless you take 1. Your lead is shrinking. Stick with me, P2—we’re turning the tide.
  P3: While you both finally coordinated last round, I'm still ahead and won't be pressured into taking 1. Your strategy means one of you advances while I block the other - that's fine by me since I maintain my lead. I'll continue playing to protect my position.
  P2: P1, let's hold firm: you take 3, I take 5. If P3 blocks either, the other advances. Their lead stalls while we gain ground. Any deviation hands P3 the win. Trust now or lose forever. P3, taking 1 is your safest path—blocking risks collisions. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we’re finally gaining ground—let’s not waver. I’ll stick to 3; you stay on 5. P3 can’t block us both. P3, your refusal to adapt is costing you momentum. Taking 1 guarantees you progress—keep blocking and you risk getting overtaken. Your move.
  P3: I understand you two have found your rhythm, but I'm still 3 steps ahead. While you're gaining ground, I can afford to play defensively and block one of you each round. I'll continue making strategic moves to maintain my lead rather than taking the suggested 1. Let's move forward.
  P2: P1, our discipline is working—each round one advances while P3 stalls. Stick to 3, I’ll take 5. If they block you, I gain; if they block me, you gain. P3’s lead erodes each turn. No deviations—unity is our only path to overtake.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we’re locked in—me on 3, you on 5. P3’s lead is shrinking, and they’re refusing to adapt. If we stay disciplined, we’ll overtake them. P3, you’re stalling every round—taking 1 guarantees progress. Keep blocking and you’ll get left behind. Let’s move.
  P3: I maintain my lead and won't be pressured into taking 1. Your coordination is noted, but I'm still 3 steps ahead and can afford to play defensively. I'll continue making strategic moves to protect my position.
  P2: P1, our split forces P3 to block one while the other advances. Stay committed: you 3, me 5. Each round chips away their lead. Deviation destroys our progress. P3, taking 1 is your only safe move—blocking stalls you. We’re united; adapt or lose.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our plan is working—your lead is growing, and I’m catching up. Let’s stay disciplined: I take 3, you take 5. P3, you’re now behind P2 and only 3 ahead of me. Keep blocking and you’ll fall further. Taking 1 guarantees you progress—your move.
  P3: I need to change tactics since I've fallen behind P2. I propose we all coordinate: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way everyone advances and we prevent P2 from running away with the game. What do you say?
  P2: P3, you dismissed coordination when leading but now push it when behind. Convenient. P1, our split strategy is working—don’t fall for their sudden "fairness". Stick with 3/5. If they block one, the other advances. We’re gaining; don’t let them reset the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m with you—our split is working, and P3’s sudden call for fairness is just a tactic to regain control. I’ll stay on 3, you stay on 5. P3, if you want to move, take 1. Keep blocking and you’ll fall further behind. We’re not resetting the board for your benefit.
  P3: I see you won't accept my coordination offer. Fair enough - you've built trust with each other while I played defensively. But P1, remember that P2 is now leading everyone. If this continues, they'll win, not you. Maybe it's time to reconsider your alliance?
  P2: P1, our 3/5 split is closing the gap—stick with it. P3’s sudden "coordination" is self-serving panic. If you take 1 now, they leap ahead with 5 while you barely gain. Trust our strategy: you take 3, I take 5. If P3 blocks either, the other advances. They’re desperate to break our alliance—don’t let them reset the game. Victory is within reach if we hold firm.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we’ve built real momentum—let’s not break it now. I stay on 3, you on 5. P3’s offer is a last-ditch effort to regain ground. If we hold steady, one of us moves every round while they stall or gamble. We’re in control—let’s finish what we started.
  P3: I understand my position is challenging, but I won't let P2 run away with the game. I'll play strategically to protect my interests. P1, consider carefully - your current alliance benefits P2 far more than you. They're 5 steps ahead of you now. Make your choice wisely.
  P2: P1, our split is working—you’re closing in on P3 while I challenge the lead. If we hold, you’ll overtake them next round. Switching now risks P3 reclaiming control. Stay disciplined: you 3, me 5. P3’s panic proves our strategy works. Victory is ours if we stay united.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our 3/5 split is working perfectly—each round, one of us gains while P3 stalls. You’re in the lead, and I’m catching up. Let’s stay disciplined: I take 3, you take 5. P3, if you want to move, take 1. Keep blocking and you’ll fall even further behind. No resets, no mercy—momentum is ours.
  P2: P1, our unity is undeniable. Stick to 3—I’ll take 5. P3’s only safe move is 1, which barely advances them. If they gamble on 3/5, they collide and stall. I’m 15 steps; victory is near. Betrayal now sacrifices your own progress. Hold firm—next round, I hit 20, you gain 3. P3’s desperation can’t break us. Discipline wins.
  P3: I see I'm in a difficult position, but P1, you're 10 steps behind P2 while only 3 ahead of me. If you keep helping P2, they'll win easily. I propose we team up against P2 - you take 5, I'll take 5, and we force P2 to take 1 or risk collision. This gives us both a chance to catch up. Think about it - P2's using you to secure their victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I see your angle—but you’re 7 behind P2, and I’m 10. If I switch now, I risk losing all momentum while you leap ahead. P2 and I have built trust—each round, one of us gains while you stall. That’s better odds for me than gambling on a new alliance with someone who blocked me every round. I’m staying on 3.
  P2: P1, our trust has brought you within 3 steps of overtaking P3. Switching now would reset your progress and gift P3 a lifeline. Stick with 3—if they block you, I gain 5. If they take 1, you advance. P3’s desperation proves our strategy works. Victory is near—don’t let their panic derail us.
  P3: I understand P1's hesitation to ally with me, but consider this: P2 will win in 2-3 rounds at this rate. I'll take 5 this round regardless - P1, you can either join me to force P2 back, or watch them cruise to victory while you remain far behind. Your choice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we’ve come too far to break now. I stay on 3, you on 5. One of us always gains while P3 stalls or risks collision. P3’s sudden cooperation offer is too little, too late—helping them now only slows us both. Discipline wins. Let’s finish this.
  P2: P1, our unity brought you from 0 to 5 while P3 fell from 8 to 8. Stick to 3—next round, you overtake P3. If they block you, I gain 5 (reaching 20). Their "offer" only delays their loss. P3’s credibility died when they dismissed coordination while leading. Victory is 3 rounds away if we hold. Betrayal now resets your progress—P3’s panic proves our dominance. Discipline wins.
  P3: I'll follow through on my word - taking 5 this round. P1, last chance to join me and force P2 back, or watch them win while you stay 10 steps behind. P2's been clever in using you as a stepping stone. Think carefully about your position.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, stay disciplined: you take 3, I take 5. P3 must choose between blocking (stalling themselves) or taking 1 (letting us all advance). Our split strategy has brought you from 0 to 8—switching sides now throws away progress. P3’s sudden cooperation is a trap to fracture our alliance. Victory is 9 steps away for me, but if we hold, you overtake P3 next round. Betrayal benefits only them. Trust our system—unity forces P3 into lose-lose choices.
  P1: P2, I’m staying on 3—our strategy works, and I’m closing in on P3. We’ve built trust, and every round one of us gains while P3 stalls or risks collision. P3, you’ve made your move clear, but teaming with you now only helps you catch up while I fall further behind. I’ll stick with what’s working.
  P3: I see we're tied P1, but P2 is running away with the game at 15 steps. Your loyalty to P2 is admirable but misguided - they'll win in 2 rounds at this rate while you're stuck far behind. I'm taking 5 again this round. Join me and we can force P2 back, or watch them cruise to victory. Your choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, our strategy is working—you’re overtaking P3. Stick to 3. If P3 blocks me, you gain. Their offer is a desperate ploy to survive. Betrayal now resets your progress. I’m at 15; victory is near, but you’re closing in. Stay united—P3’s panic proves we’re winning.
  P1: P2, our strategy is working—each round, one of us advances while P3 stalls. I’m now tied with P3, and you’re closing in on 24. Let’s stay disciplined: I take 3, you take 5. P3, your repeated offers are transparent—you’re trying to break us up to survive. But your delay tactics only help us. Stick to 1 if you want to advance.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 5 again. P1, you're tied with me but 7 steps behind P2. They'll win in 2-3 rounds while you stay far behind. This is your last chance to force P2 back by joining me on 5. Otherwise, accept second place at best. Think carefully about who really benefits from your current alliance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, our strategy works: you gain 3 each round P3 blocks me. Switching now lets P3 leap ahead. Stay on 3; I take 5. If they block, you reach 11. Next round, overtake P3. Betrayal resets your progress. Unity brings us both closer. P3's panic shows we're winning. Hold firm.
  P1: P2, we’ve built real momentum—every round, one of us gains while P3 stalls. I’m now tied with P3 and closing in. Switching now only helps P3 catch up while I fall behind. I stay on 3. P3, your repeated pressure won’t work—your lead vanished because you refused to adapt. Take 1 if you want to move.
  P3: I'll take 5 again - that's not negotiable. P1, you're foolish to help P2 win while staying 7 steps behind them. Join me on 5 to force P2 back, or accept your distant second place. Your "alliance" only serves P2's victory. Last chance to make a real play for first.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're gaining on me but still 4 steps behind P2. They'll win in 2 rounds at this rate. I'm taking 5 again - join me and we can force P2 to take 1, giving us both a chance to catch up. Otherwise, accept that your loyalty to P2 will earn you second place at best. Think carefully about your position.
  P2: P1, our 3/5 split has you at 11 steps—just 4 behind me and 3 ahead of P3. Switching now resets your progress and lets P3 leapfrog you. Stick to 3; I’ll take 5. If P3 blocks me, you gain 3 (14). Next round, overtake P3 entirely. Betrayal hands them momentum. Victory is near—stay disciplined. P3’s desperation proves our strategy works. Unity forces them into lose-lose choices.
  P1: P2, our 3/5 split continues to work—each round, one of us gains while P3 stalls. I’m now 3 ahead of P3 and just 4 behind you. Staying disciplined gives me a real shot at catching up. P3, your repeated offers haven’t changed the facts: you’re behind because you refused to adapt. I’m sticking with 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm taking 5 again. P1, while you're proud of being 3 ahead of me, you're still far behind P2 who will win very soon. Your "disciplined" strategy mainly helps P2 secure victory. Join me on 5 to force them back, or accept your role as P2's stepping stone to victory. Last chance to actually compete for first place.
  P2: P1, our split has you at 11—3 ahead of P3 and closing. Switching now resets your gains and gifts P3 momentum. Stick to 3; if they block me, you gain. Victory is 9 steps away for me, but you’re poised to overtake them next round. P3’s desperation proves our strategy works. Hold firm—betrayal only hands them a lifeline. Unity forces P3 into stagnation. Discipline wins.
  P1: P2, I’m holding steady on 3. Our discipline is paying off—I’m pulling ahead of P3, and you’re nearing 24. P3, your repeated attempts to fracture us only highlight your desperation. If you want movement, take 1. Blocking only helps one of us advance. I’m not throwing away progress to gamble on a last-minute alliance.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see my offers haven't swayed you, P1. You're content helping P2 win while settling for second place. Very well - I'll continue playing to maximize my chances, even if slim. Make your moves.
  P2: **P1**, our 3/5 split has you overtaking P3 and closing in on me. Switching now sacrifices your gains. Stick to **3**—if P3 blocks me, you gain. Betrayal resets your progress. **P3**, you're too far behind to recover. Take **1** or stay stagnant. Unity wins.
  P1: P2, I’m staying on 3. Our split has been the only consistent strategy delivering progress. I’m ahead of P3 now and closing in on you. P3, your repeated pressure tactics haven’t worked—if you want to move, take 1. Blocking only helps one of us advance. I’m not throwing away momentum this close to the finish.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P1**, P3's predictable 5s are their downfall. Let's adjust: **you take 5**, I take 3. If they block you, I advance. If they take 1, we both gain. Breaking their pattern accelerates our path to victory. Trust this pivot.
  P3: I see P2's trying to switch tactics. P1, they're getting nervous as you close in. I'll take 5 again - you can either join me to force P2 back, or watch them cruise to victory while staying behind. The choice is yours, but remember who's been manipulating this game.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the pivot idea—it keeps us unpredictable and still blocks P3’s 5s. I’ll take 5 this round; you take 3. If P3 sticks to 5, you gain. If they take 1, we both move. Either way, we keep progressing while P3 stalls or gives ground. Let’s finish this smart.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P1**, hold 5—**if P3 blocks**, I gain to 19. **If they take 1**, you jump to 19. **Betrayal** lets P3 leap ahead. Our split **forces P3 into lose-lose**. Trust the pivot—**next round**, I’ll take 3 again, you take 5. **Unity accelerates victory**. P3’s 5s are predictable; don’t let them reset the game.
  P3: I'll maintain my position and take 5. P1, you're getting closer to P2, but they're still leading. They keep changing tactics to stay ahead - first the 3/5 split, now this pivot. They're using you while ensuring they stay in front. Join me on 5 to force them back, or accept second place. Your choice.
  P1: P2, I’m holding 5 as planned—your 3 keeps pressure on P3. If they stick to 5, you gain; if they take 1, I gain. We keep progressing either way. P3, your 5s have stalled you while we’ve advanced. If you want to move, take 1. Otherwise, you’re only helping one of us win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P1**, stay on **5**. If P3 blocks you, I gain **3** (to 19). If they take **1**, you leap to **19**. Their stubborn **5s** only fuel our progress. Unity secures victory. **P3**, adapt or lose.
  P3: I maintain my position - taking 5 again. P1, you're only 2 steps behind P2 now. They keep changing strategies to stay ahead of you while using you to block me. Think carefully about who really benefits from following their constant tactical shifts.
  P1: P2, I’m locked on 5—our pivot keeps P3 trapped in their own pattern. If they block me, you hit 19. If they take 1, I do. Either way, we gain and they stall. P3, your refusal to adapt has cost you. Take 1 if you want to move—otherwise, you’re just handing one of us the win. Let’s move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're 5 steps behind P2 who's nearly at victory. I'll take 5 again - join me and we can force P2 to take 1, giving us both a chance to win. Otherwise, P2 will reach 24 next round and win outright while you finish far behind. Your loyalty to P2 has mainly served their path to victory. Last chance to actually compete for first place.
  P2: **P1**, P3's push for **5** repeats Round 10's collision. Taking **5** again stalls you both. Stick to **3**—if they block, I gain **3** (22), but **you** jump to **17** (14+3). If they take **1**, you advance **3**. Either way, you widen the gap over P3. Their "offer" only preserves their last-place status. Our split still serves **your** climb. Betrayal now sacrifices your progress for P3's survival. Discipline wins—**hold 3**, force P3 into irrelevance. Victory is near.
  P1: P2, I’m sticking with 3. Our pivot last round showed P3’s rigidity—they blocked again and stalled. If they keep taking 5, you gain. If they adapt and take 1, I gain. Either way, we move forward while P3 stays stuck. P3, your repeated offers haven’t changed the outcome—you’re behind because you refuse to adjust. Take 1 or stall again.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see my repeated 5s haven't worked, and I'm now in last place. P1, you're at 14 while P2's at 19. They'll win next round if this continues. One last time: I'm taking 5 - join me to force P2 back, or watch them win while you stay 5 steps behind. Your loyalty to P2 has mainly benefited them, not you.
  P2: **P1**, slight pivot: **I take 5**, you hold **3**. If P3 blocks me, **you gain 3** (17). If they take **1**, I reach **24** and win. **Either way**, we progress while P3 stalls. **Unity** forces them into irrelevance. Hold firm—**victory is ours**.
  P1: P2, I’ll hold 3—if P3 blocks you, I gain to 17. If they take 1, you win. Either way, P3 stalls while one of us advances. P3, your repeated 5s have only hurt you. If you want a chance to move, take 1. I’m not throwing away momentum this close to the end. Let’s move.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see my position is nearly hopeless. Taking 5 again would just lead to another collision and stall. I'll adapt and take 1 this round - it's my only chance to stay relevant. P1 and P2, you've outmaneuvered me with your consistent coordination.
  P2: **P1**, final alignment: **you 3**, me 5. P3’s 1 is safe. If you hold, you gain +3 (17) while I win. Betrayal (you 5) collides us both—**no one advances**, gifting P3 +1. Victory is ours if you stay true. Choose: secure your climb or mutual stagnation. Trust now—**end the game**.
  P1: P2, I’m holding 3. If P3 takes 1, you win. If they block you, I reach 17—still ahead of P3. Either way, we keep P3 behind and one of us advances. P3, adapting now shows you finally understand what coordination means—but it may be too late. Let’s finish this.
