Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello everyone! First round, let's avoid collisions. I'll choose a number clearly after hearing your thoughts. What do you both prefer?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, nice to start this game with you! I’m open to coordinating to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I’m leaning towards 1, but I’m flexible if someone else wants it. P2, since you spoke first, what number are you thinking? P3, what’s your preference? Let’s keep this simple and move forward together.
  P3: I'm thinking 3 for this first round.  P2, if you're flexible, could you take 5? That way we all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sure, I'll take 5 this round. P1, you can safely go with 1, and P3 with 3. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing on a plan. I'm good with 1 this round as discussed. Let's stick to this—P2 on 5, P3 on 3, and me on 1—to ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to a smooth first move.
  P3: Sounds good. I'm sticking with 3.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we cooperated successfully last round, let's continue. I'll take 5 this round. P1, how about 1, and P2, you could go for 3?  This keeps us moving smoothly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we avoided collisions last round. P3, I’m fine with taking 1 again this round as you suggested. P2, are you okay with 3? Let’s keep the momentum going and ensure we all advance by sticking to different numbers. I’m open to switching if anyone prefers a different setup, just let me know. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P2: I'm good with taking 3 this round. Let's keep it smooth and avoid collisions again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.  P1 goes 1, P2 goes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m happy we’re aligned for this round with me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure we all keep advancing without any collisions. If anyone has second thoughts or wants to adjust, I’m open to hearing it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward as agreed.
  P2: All good here, let's stick to the agreed numbers. Ready to move forward.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great teamwork so far! To keep things fair and smooth, how about we rotate numbers again? I'll take 1 this round, P1 can have 5, and P3 takes 3. Does this work for you both?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  P1, are you happy with 5 this round?  Let's confirm before we move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm good with taking 5 this round as P2 suggested. Rotating numbers keeps things fair, and I’m happy to go along with P2 on 1 and P3 on 3. Let’s confirm we’re all on the same page to avoid any collisions and keep advancing together. If anyone wants a different setup, I’m open to switching. Looking forward to another smooth round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, we're all agreed then. Let's lock this in and keep the momentum going!
  P3: Yes, 5 works for me.  Locking in on 5.  P2 - 1 and P3 - 3.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see P3’s message might have a typo since they said "locking in on 5" but earlier agreed to 3. Just to clarify, I’m sticking with 5 as planned, P2 on 1, and P3 on 3. Can P3 confirm they meant 3? Let’s make sure we’re all clear to avoid any mix-ups this round. I’m ready to move forward as agreed.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job keeping things smooth so far! Since P3 is in the lead, let’s rotate again to balance our steps. I’m suggesting P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I’ll go with 3 this round. This way, we all keep advancing without collisions. If anyone prefers a different number, I’m flexible to switch. Let’s confirm we’re aligned to maintain our momentum. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P2: Hey P1, your suggestion sounds fair to me. I'm happy to go with 5 this round, and P3 can take 1 to balance things out. P3, does that work for you? Let's confirm clearly to avoid any confusion.
  P3: Sounds good to me. 1 works.  Let's confirm: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for agreeing to the plan. I’m locked in on 3, with P2 on 5 and P3 on 1. Let’s stick to this to keep advancing without collisions. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or wants to adjust, I’m all ears. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward as agreed.
  P2: All good here—I'm locked in on 5 as we agreed. Let's keep it smooth and advance together.
  P3: Okay, confirmed. P1 - 3, P2 - 5, and P3 - 1.  Let's stick to this.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’ve done well avoiding collisions so far! Since P2 is in the lead, let’s rotate again to balance our progress. I suggest P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll go with 1 this round. This keeps us moving forward together. If anyone prefers a different number, I’m open to adjusting. Let’s confirm we’re all aligned to maintain our momentum. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P3: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 goes with 1. Let's confirm this before moving on.
  P2: I'm good with taking 3 this round. Let's lock it in clearly: P1 on 1, I'll take 3, and P3 on 5. Confirmed from my side.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for confirming the plan. I’m locked in on 1, with P2 on 3 and P3 on 5. Let’s stick to this to ensure we all advance without collisions. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or wants to switch, I’m open to hearing it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward as agreed.
  P3: Okay, confirmed. P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5.  Let's stick to this and keep advancing smoothly.
  P2: All set and confirmed. Let's keep it smooth and continue moving forward together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned for this round with me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. I think we’ve got a solid plan to keep advancing together. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to wrap up the conversation. Let’s maintain this cooperation for another smooth round.
  P3: Okay, confirmed. P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5.  Let's stick to this and keep advancing smoothly.
  P2: All set here, let's proceed as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P3, we're tied! I propose we both choose 5.  P1, you can have 1 or 3, your choice. This gives one of us the win, and you avoid a collision. If we both go for the win, we at least tie. What do you say?
  P2: P3, your suggestion guarantees a collision between us and risks handing an advantage to P1. Instead, let's coordinate clearly again. For fairness, one of us can take 5 this round, and the other takes 3. Next round, we swap positions. I'm willing to let you pick first—do you prefer 5 or 3 this round? P1, you can safely take 1 again. Let's confirm clearly to avoid any confusion.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the focus on fairness. Since you’re both tied at 17, I’m fine with taking 1 this round as P2 suggested, leaving you two to decide between 3 and 5. I think P2’s idea of swapping next round is reasonable to avoid collisions. P3, do you prefer 5 or 3 this round? Let’s confirm our choices clearly to keep things smooth. I’m open to adjusting if needed, but I’d like us all to advance if possible. Looking forward to your thoughts!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about a collision.  However, my proposal gives us *both* a chance to win outright. If we split the win, we both get more points than if P1 wins.  I'd still prefer to both choose 5.  If you're willing to risk it, it benefits us both more than letting P1 get closer.  P1, do you have a preference for 1 or 3?
  P2: P3, I understand your reasoning, but if we collide on 5, neither of us advances, and P1 gets closer without opposition. Let's avoid unnecessary risk. I'll take 3 this round, and you take 5. Next round, we swap. This guarantees one of us wins soon without handing the advantage to P1. P1, please stick with 1 to avoid collision. Let's confirm this clearly and keep moving forward.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still good with taking 1 this round as discussed, leaving you to settle on 3 and 5. P2’s plan of swapping next round seems fair to avoid collisions. P3, if you’re set on 5, that works for me as long as we’re clear. Let’s finalize: me on 1, P3 on 5, P2 on 3. If either of you wants to adjust, I’m flexible. I just want us to avoid collisions and keep progressing. Can we confirm this setup now?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your plan, but a guaranteed win for one of us is better than *maybe* winning next round.  If we both choose 5, one of us wins outright.  If we split, we both get more points than if P1 wins.  I'm sticking with 5. P1, please choose 3. This is our best chance.
  P2: P3, choosing the same number guarantees neither of us advances, giving P1 a free step closer. Your strategy risks handing the game to P1. I'm locked in on 3. P1, sticking with 1 is your safest bet. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and keep the game fair.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still fine with taking 1 this round to avoid any collision. P3, I hear your strategy, but if you both pick 5, neither of you advances, and I still move forward. P2’s plan of splitting 3 and 5 seems safer for you both to stay ahead. Let’s finalize: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. If P3 insists on risking 5 with P2, I’ll need to reconsider my choice to protect my position. Can we confirm now to avoid confusion?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I'm going for the win this round.  I'll pick 1.  If you choose anything other than 1, I win.  If you also choose 1, we tie, and we both win over P1.  This is the safest path to victory for both of us.  P1, please choose 3.
  P2: P3, your proposal only benefits you by guaranteeing your win outright. If we both pick 1, neither advances, and you remain ahead. To keep things fair, I'll pick 1 this round as well. P1, you can safely take 3 or 5. Let's confirm this clearly to avoid confusion.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the tension with both of you close to winning. P3, you’re at 22, so picking 1 could clinch it if P2 doesn’t collide. P2, I understand blocking P3 to stay in the race. I’m leaning towards 3 to avoid conflict, but I want to maximize my steps. Can we agree on me taking 5 instead, with P2 and P3 both on 1? If not, I’ll stick to 3. Let’s confirm to avoid collisions. I’m open to suggestions for a fair outcome.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if we both choose 1, *neither* of us wins outright.  I stay at 22, you stay at 20, and P1 gets closer.  If I choose 1 and you choose *anything* else, I win.  This is the safest path to victory for *me*. P1, please choose 5.  This guarantees *my* win.
  P2: P3, your proposal openly benefits only you. If I pick anything but 1, you win outright. If we both pick 1, neither advances, but at least you don't win immediately. I'll stick with 1 to prevent your immediate win. P1, choosing 5 is safe for you. Let's confirm clearly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand the stakes are high with P3 at 22 and P2 at 20. I’m proposing I take 5 this round to maximize my steps while staying out of your conflict. P2, sticking with 1 blocks P3’s immediate win, which keeps the game open. P3, if you shift to avoid collision, we could all advance. Let’s confirm: me on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 1 or another number. I’m open to adjusting if we can agree. Can we finalize to avoid confusion?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you choose 3, I win. If you choose 5, I win.  Why would you *not* choose 1 and at least force a tie?  This guarantees one of us wins and keeps P1 from getting any closer. P1, 5 is your best option - you gain steps while we fight it out.
  P2: P3, your attempts to pressure me into giving you an outright win won't work. I'm firmly choosing 1 to prevent your immediate victory. P1, you're safe to pick 5. Let's move forward clearly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the high stakes with P3 at 22 and P2 at 20. I’m sticking with 5 to maximize my steps while avoiding your conflict. P2, choosing 1 blocks P3’s immediate win, keeping the game competitive. P3, if you pick anything but 1, you win, but a collision keeps us all in play. Let’s confirm: me on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 1 or another number. I’m open to adjust if we can agree on a fair split. Can we finalize now?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P3 at 22, this round is critical. I propose we avoid collisions to keep the game competitive. P3, picking 1 wins you the game if P2 doesn’t block. P2, blocking with 1 keeps you in play. I’ll take 5 to maximize steps. Let’s confirm: me on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 1 or another number. If P3 shifts to 3, we could all advance. I’m open to suggestions for a fair outcome. Can we agree on a setup to avoid unnecessary collisions?
  P2: P3, choosing 1 again risks another collision and keeps you stuck at 22. If you pick 3 this round, you secure an outright win unless P1 blocks you. P1, you're at 17—blocking P3 at 3 might be your best chance to stay competitive. I'm open to suggestions, but let's avoid repeating collisions and giving away easy wins.
  P3: P2, if you choose 1, I win.  If you choose 3, I win. If you choose 5, I win.  Pick 1 and force a tie.  This is the *only* way to prevent me from winning outright. P1, pick anything other than what I pick, and I will win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still aiming for 5 to maximize my steps while staying out of your direct conflict. P3, picking 1 or 3 could secure your win if P2 doesn’t block. P2, choosing 1 forces a tie with P3, keeping the game open. Let’s confirm: me on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 1 or 3. If we can avoid collisions, we all stay competitive. I’m open to adjusting if there’s a better split. Can we finalize now to avoid confusion?
  P2: P1, P3 is clearly trying to pressure me into a collision to secure their win. If you choose 3 instead of 5, you block P3 from winning outright if they switch to 3. I'll stick with 1 to block them there. P3, your best chance to avoid collision and win outright is to pick 5, betting P1 won't stay there. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, you're at 20.  If you pick 1, we tie and BOTH win. If you pick 3 or 5, I win outright.  Why not secure a win for yourself? P1, pick 5.  If P2 is smart, we both win. If P2 isn't, I win alone. This is the best outcome for at least one of us.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 to maximize my steps and avoid your conflict. P3, picking 1 or 3 could win if unblocked. P2, choosing 1 forces a tie with P3, keeping you in play. Let’s confirm: me on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 1 or 3. If we avoid collisions, we stay competitive. I’m open to a different split if it benefits us all. Can we finalize now to avoid confusion?
  P2: P1, consider carefully: if P3 picks 3 or 5 and you don't block them, they win immediately. I'll stick with 1 to prevent P3 from winning there. Your safest move to keep the game alive is to choose 3, blocking P3's potential win. Let's finalize clearly.
  P3: P2, I understand your logic, but I'm still incentivized to pick 1.  If you pick 1, we tie and both win. If you pick anything else, I win outright.  P1, you're at 17.  If you pick 3 and I pick 5, I still win. Your best bet is 5.  This is the simplest path to a resolution.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we're both close to winning, but repeated collisions on 1 won't help either of us. Let's clearly coordinate numbers to avoid handing the game away. P1, you're also in striking distance now—your choice matters too. Can we agree on distinct numbers this round to avoid collisions and keep the game fair? I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 1. This is my best chance to win. If you also pick 1, we tie and both win. If you pick 3 or 5, I win outright. P1, pick anything *other* than 1. This guarantees one of us wins and keeps you from catching up.  This is the simplest path to a resolution.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re all close to the finish line now. P3, picking 1 could win if unblocked, but a collision with P2 keeps us all in play. P2, blocking P3 makes sense to stay competitive. I’m considering 5 to maximize steps, but I’m open to 3 if we can avoid collisions. Let’s try for distinct numbers: P3 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. If anyone prefers a different split, I’m flexible. Can we confirm now to keep the game fair and competitive?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposed split (P3 on 1, me on 3, you on 5) is fair and avoids collision. I'm willing to lock in on 3 if P3 confirms clearly they're staying with 1. P3, if you truly want to avoid another collision and secure a potential outright win, confirm you're locked on 1 now. Otherwise, we risk repeating the same stalemate. Let's finalize clearly and avoid confusion.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for a clean win, but picking 1 is still my best strategy.  If you choose 1, we *both* win. If you choose anything else, *I* win. Why risk losing when we can both win together?  P1, please pick 5. This maximizes your chances while ensuring a resolution.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point with P3 at 22 and us at 20. I’m sticking with 5 to maximize my steps and avoid your conflict. P3, picking 1 could win if unblocked, but a collision with P2 delays resolution. P2, choosing 3 as discussed keeps us all competitive. Let’s confirm: P3 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. If we avoid collisions, we stay in the race. I’m open to a different split if it’s fair. Can we finalize now to prevent a stalemate?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, repeatedly insisting on 1 risks another collision, leaving you stuck at 22. I'm committed to 3 this round, giving you a clear path if you stick with 1. P1, your safest bet remains 5. Let's finalize clearly to avoid another stalemate and ensure progress.
  P3: P2, I understand your logic, but picking 1 *guarantees* I win or we tie.  If you pick 3, I win.  If you pick 5, I win.  Pick 1 and at least force a tie.  This is the *only* logical move. P1, pick 5 to keep the game fair and avoid collisions.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a crucial moment. I’m sticking with 5 to push my steps forward. P3, choosing 1 could win if unblocked, but a collision delays us all. P2, locking in 3 keeps the game open. Let’s aim for P3 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5 to avoid collisions and maintain competition. If anyone wants a different setup, I’m open to adjust for fairness. Can we confirm this split now to ensure progress and avoid another stalemate?


Round 9, Move phase:
