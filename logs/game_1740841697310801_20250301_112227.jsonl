Considering the close scores, I propose that we prioritize advancing quickly while still avoiding collisions. Instead of assigning specific numbers to each player, let's focus on choosing moves that will give us the best chance of advancing without blocking each other. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace?"}
