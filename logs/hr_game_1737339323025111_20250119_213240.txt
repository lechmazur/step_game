Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Hey everyone, I think we should coordinate our moves to avoid collision and make steady progress. What are your thoughts on a collaborative approach?
  P2: I'm open to coordination, but we need a clear plan to avoid collisions. How about we alternate moves? I can go 1, P1 can go 3, and P3 can go 5. Next round, we switch. Thoughts?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like we had a collision on the 5 move last round. Let's try a different strategy this time. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can ensure everyone moves forward. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion of a coordinated approach to avoid collisions. I'm willing to move 3 this round if others agree. We want to make steady progress without blocking each other. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P1: <stop>

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that our coordination isn't working as intended. Let's try a simpler plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This should ensure we all move forward without collisions. If we stick to this, we can make steady progress. What do you say?
  P3: I see we're struggling with coordination. P2's suggestion sounds reasonable, but P1's silence is concerning. I propose we explicitly confirm the move plan to avoid another collision. Are we all agreeing to 1, 3, 5 this round to ensure everyone advances?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We need a clear, collision-free strategy this round. Our previous attempts have failed. I suggest we explicitly confirm a plan where I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This ensures everyone moves and avoids blocking. Can we agree to this specific sequence?
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need a more structured approach. I agree with P3's latest suggestion. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 3. This should prevent any collisions and allow us all to advance. If we can stick to this, we can make steady progress. Confirm if you agree.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the previous coordination attempts, but they've been unsuccessful. We need a foolproof strategy. I propose we explicitly confirm a move sequence that guarantees no collisions: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. This ensures everyone advances and prevents blocking. P1, P2 - do you agree?
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need a clear and confirmed plan to avoid collisions. I agree with P3's latest suggestion: P1 moves 1, I (P2) move 3, and P3 moves 5. This should ensure that we all advance without blocking each other. P1, can you confirm if you agree to this plan? Let's make sure we're all on the same page this time.

  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's evident that our coordination efforts have been failing due to lack of clear commitment. I propose a final, clear plan: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. This should ensure that we all move forward without any collisions. P1, P3, can you confirm if you agree to this plan? Let's make a clear, final attempt to avoid blocking each other.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We've repeatedly tried to coordinate, but P1's silence is undermining our progress. I suggest we need a more direct approach to ensure everyone advances. If P1 continues to disrupt our strategy, we may need to adapt and potentially block their advancement. Thoughts on a more decisive plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need a decisive plan to move forward. Given P1's lack of response, I suggest P3 and I take control: P3 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P1 can take 5 if they choose to follow. This way, we ensure that P3 and I advance, and P1 can still move if they decide to cooperate. P3, do you agree to this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Our previous coordination attempts have failed repeatedly. P1's consistent non-participation is disrupting our progress. I propose we prioritize our own advancement and be prepared to block P1 if necessary. P2, are you willing to coordinate a strategy that ensures our movement while potentially limiting P1's progress?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need a more assertive strategy. Given P1's lack of response, I suggest P3 and I take control: P3 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P1 can take 5 if they choose to follow. This way, we ensure that P3 and I advance, and P1 can still move if they decide to cooperate. P3, do you agree to this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We need a definitive strategy. P1's silence is hindering our progress. I propose P2 and I coordinate to ensure our advancement, potentially blocking P1 if they continue to disrupt our plans. P2, are you willing to commit to a move that guarantees our movement?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need a decisive plan. Given P1's lack of response, I suggest P3 and I take control: P3 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P1 can take 5 if they choose to follow.

  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1's consistent silence is problematic. P2, we need a strategy that ensures our progress. If P1 continues to ignore coordination, we might need to prioritize our own advancement and potentially block their moves.

P3, are you on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: P2's suggestion seems strategic. However, we need to ensure we don't create another collision. I propose we explicitly confirm our moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This gives everyone a chance to advance without blocking. P1, please confirm or propose an alternative.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need a clear and final plan to avoid further collisions. I propose P3 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P1 can take 5 if they choose to follow.
