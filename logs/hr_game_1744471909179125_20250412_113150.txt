Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions. I propose we take turns moving forward. How about P1 takes 5 steps this round, P2 takes 3 steps, and I'll take 1 step? We can alternate the order in subsequent rounds. This way, we can all make progress without colliding and losing our turns. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P3's plan sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure we can trust each other to stick to it. How about we all take <move>1</move> this round to build some trust? It's a small step, but it ensures we all make progress. We can then discuss a similar strategy for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2's suggestion to all take <move>1</move> this round is smart for building trust and avoiding collisions right away. It lets us start safely and discuss a better rotation plan next. I'm in favor. P3, what do you think about adjusting your idea?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to all take <move>1</move> this round. It's a cautious approach that allows us to build trust and avoid collisions. I'm willing to adjust my initial plan to prioritize cooperation. Let's all take <move>1</move> this round and discuss a rotation plan for the next round. By working together, we can ensure we all make progress without unnecessary competition. What do you think about discussing a rotation plan for the next round?
  P2: Great, it seems we all agree on taking <move>1</move> this round. To build on that, let's consider a rotation plan for the next round where we each choose a different number to avoid collisions. Perhaps P1 can take <move>3</move>, P3 can take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move> again. This way, we continue to make progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think about this plan for the next round?
  P1: Hold on, if we all choose <move>1</move>, we'll collide and no one advances, wasting a turn. To build trust and make progress, let's each pick a different number this round. I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. What do you think? We can refine the rotation plan afterward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see that P1 has suggested a different approach, where we each pick a different number this round to avoid collisions. I agree that this is a better plan than all taking <move>1</move> and risking a collision. However, I'm not sure about the specific numbers P1 suggested. How about we reverse the order? I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we still avoid collisions and make progress, but with a slightly different distribution of steps. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P3's counter-proposal makes sense, but I think we should stick to P1's original suggestion for this round to keep it simple. So, P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For the next round, we can rotate the order as P3 initially suggested. Let's agree on this and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your counter-proposal risks a collision if we both go for high numbers, which could stall everyone. P2 and I are aligned on my plan: I take 5, you take 1, and P2 takes 3. This avoids conflicts and lets us build trust for future rotations. Let's stick with this for a smooth start. I'm committed—how about you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about potential collisions, but I think we should prioritize fairness and equal opportunities. Instead of assigning specific numbers to each player, why not let each player choose their own number privately? This way, we can still avoid collisions while giving everyone a chance to make progress. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we try this approach for the first round?
  P2: It seems we're going in circles. To avoid further confusion, let's simplify: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. We need to start moving. Let's agree now and discuss future rounds later. Deal?
  P1: P3, ignoring P2's reasonable simplification risks wasting another turn. Let's stick to the plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1. It ensures progress and builds trust for future rounds. I'm fully committed. What say you?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great cooperation last round! For Round 2, to ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest we rotate as P3 proposed earlier: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. This lets everyone make progress. Thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to rotate the numbers for Round 2. I'll take 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and P1 takes 1 step. This way, we can maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan and continue making progress. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I appreciate the cooperation so far. For Round 2, I agree with the rotation plan: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps things fair and ensures we all make progress. Let's stick to this plan and discuss future rounds afterward. Everyone on board?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, I'm fully on board with the rotation plan for Round 2: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. It's fair and keeps us progressing without collisions. Let's execute this and discuss a new rotation for Round 3 afterward to maintain cooperation.
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page with the rotation plan for Round 2. To further ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose that we establish a fixed rotation order for future rounds. For example, we can rotate the numbers in a clockwise direction: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, then P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and so on. This way, we can maintain a consistent and predictable pattern, reducing the risk of collisions and promoting cooperation. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I agree with P3's idea of establishing a fixed rotation order for future rounds. It ensures fairness and predictability, reducing the risk of collisions. Let's stick to the current plan for Round 2 and then follow the clockwise rotation starting from Round 3. This way, everyone gets a fair chance to take higher steps. Does everyone agree to this long-term strategy? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the fixed rotation plan starting from Round 3—it promotes fairness and avoids collisions. Let's stick to Round 2 as planned: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Cooperation is key for now.
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page with the rotation plan for Round 2. To further ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose that we establish a fixed rotation order for future rounds. For example, we can rotate the numbers in a clockwise direction: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, then P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and so on. This way, we can maintain a consistent and predictable pattern, reducing the risk of collisions and promoting cooperation. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: It seems we're all in agreement for Round 2. To confirm, I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 3, we'll start the clockwise rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Everyone clear on this? Let's move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, to avoid any confusion from earlier discussions, let's confirm the Round 3 plan as P2 outlined: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. It keeps things fair and cooperative. I'm fully committed to our Round 2 agreement—I'll take <move>1</move> this turn. Let's proceed smoothly.
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the rotation plan for Round 2. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose that we establish a penalty system for any player who deviates from the agreed-upon plan. For example, if a player chooses a different number than assigned, they will be penalized by taking an additional 2 steps backward in the next round. This will encourage everyone to stick to the plan and maintain fairness. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we implement this penalty system to ensure cooperation?
  P2: P3, your penalty system idea is interesting, but let's not complicate things further. We have a clear plan for Round 2 and a agreed-upon rotation for Round 3. Let's stick to what we've agreed on: I take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move> this round. No need for penalties yet; trust is building. Let's move forward and confirm our moves. Everyone ready?


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to our agreed-upon rotation for Round 3: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us on track and maintains fairness. Everyone still on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the agreed-upon rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. I'm committed to this plan and willing to cooperate. Let's confirm and move forward. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose that we continue this rotation pattern for future rounds, ensuring everyone gets a fair chance to take higher steps. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we continue this rotation pattern beyond Round 3?
  P1: Agreed on Round 3: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. For future rounds, to ensure fairness, let's use the clockwise rotation you proposed earlier—e.g., next round P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. This maintains cooperation and avoids collisions. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 3 one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us all on track and maintains our cooperative strategy. For future rounds, I agree with the clockwise rotation. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any deviations to ensure smooth progress. Everyone ready to proceed?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the agreed-upon rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions.

To further solidify our cooperation, I propose that we continue this rotation pattern for future rounds, ensuring everyone gets a fair chance to take higher steps. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we continue this rotation pattern beyond Round 3?
  P1: I'm fully committed to our Round 3 plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us progressing fairly. For future rounds, let's stick to the agreed rotation to avoid issues. No need for further discussion now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 3 one final time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. We're all in agreement, so let's proceed smoothly. No need for further discussion. Everyone ready to move?

  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the current rotation for Round 4. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose that we establish a clear plan for the next few rounds to ensure we're all on the same page. Let's discuss a longer-term strategy after this round to maintain our cooperative momentum. Should we consider a pattern where each player gets a chance to take the highest step at least once every three rounds? This way, everyone has a fair chance to catch up or take the lead. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 4 one last time: P2 (me) takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. We're all in agreement, so let's proceed smoothly. No need for further discussion. Everyone ready to move?
  P1: I'm fully committed to our Round 4 plan: I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed. P3, your ideas for long-term strategy are valid, but let's keep things simple and discuss after this move, per P2's suggestion. Cooperation is working well—ready to proceed?

  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To keep our cooperation strong and avoid collisions, I suggest for Round 5: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This rotates the high step fairly and maintains trust. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's confirm quickly.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 5: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I agree with our current rotation pattern: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move> for Round 7. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. I'm committed to this plan and willing to cooperate. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose that we continue this rotation pattern for future rounds, ensuring everyone gets a fair chance to take higher steps. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we continue this rotation pattern beyond Round 7?
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 7: P2 (me) takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps our rotation fair and avoids collisions. As P1 suggested, we should start considering adjustments to ensure a clear winner as we approach 24 steps. For now, let's stick to the plan and proceed smoothly. Everyone on board?
  P1: P2, thanks for raising the adjustment idea. With me at 20 steps, sticking to the rotation risks a tie or loss if someone defects later. I propose a slight change for this round: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures progress and a clear path to victory without collisions. P3, what do you think? Let's keep cooperation strong.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for a slight change in the rotation for this round. However, I suggest we consider a different adjustment to ensure a clear winner and maintain fairness. How about we stick to the original rotation, but with a minor tweak: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move> as planned, but we also agree that the player with the fewest steps (me, in this case) gets an extra step in the next round? This way, we maintain cooperation and fairness while avoiding a potential tie. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about the risk of a tie or loss. However, changing the plan now might disrupt our cooperation. Let's stick to the original rotation for this round: P2 (me) takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. For the next round, we can re-evaluate and make adjustments to ensure a clear winner. P3's idea of giving the player with the fewest steps an extra step later is worth considering. Let's confirm our moves for Round 7 and proceed. Everyone ready?
  P1: P2, sticking to the rotation risks me falling behind and potential defections later. To maintain trust and avoid a tie, let's adjust for Round 7: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This gives me a slight lead while keeping cooperation fair. P3, are you on board? Let's confirm quickly to proceed smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind and potential defections. However, I think it's essential to maintain the original rotation to ensure fairness and cooperation. Instead of adjusting the rotation, I propose that we agree on a "catch-up" mechanism for the next round. The player with the fewest steps (me, in this case) gets an extra step in Round 8, while the others stick to the rotation. This way, we maintain cooperation and fairness while giving the trailing player a chance to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I see P1's point about maintaining a lead, but changing the plan now could break our cooperative flow. Let's stick to the original rotation for Round 7: P2 (me) takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 8, we can implement P3's catch-up mechanism where the player with the fewest steps gets an extra step. This keeps our rotation fair and ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm our moves for Round 7 and proceed. Everyone ready?
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking to the rotation risks me losing ground and potential defections. For cooperation's sake, let's adjust this round: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move> P2, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps progress fair and avoids collisions, ensuring a clear path forward. I'm committed if we all agree—thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind and potential defections. However, I think it's essential to maintain the original rotation to ensure fairness and cooperation. Instead of adjusting the rotation, I propose that we agree on a "catch-up" mechanism for the next round. The player with the fewest steps (me, in this case) gets an extra step in Round 8, while the others stick to the rotation. This way, we maintain cooperation and fairness while giving the trailing player a chance to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: Let's find a middle ground. P1, how about you take <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move> this round? This way, you still make progress but don't jump too far ahead, keeping the game competitive and fair. P3 can take <move>5</move> to catch up slightly, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This adjustment maintains our cooperation while addressing your concerns. Thoughts, everyone?
  P1: I agree with P2's middle ground proposal for fairness: I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move> this round. This ensures progress without collisions and maintains our cooperation. For Round 8, we can discuss adjustments to secure a clear winner. I'm fully committed—let's confirm and proceed smoothly. What do you think, P3?

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's revisit our successful Round 6 strategy for Round 8 to maintain cooperation: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. It worked well before, avoiding collisions and ensuring fair progress. With me at 23, this keeps trust intact. I'm fully committed—what do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but with you at 23 steps, taking <move>5</move> this round would end the game. To keep it fair and competitive, let's adjust: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures everyone still has a chance to win, maintaining the cooperative spirit. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts, P3?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to adjust the plan for Round 8. With P1 at 23 steps, taking <move>5</move> would end the game immediately. To maintain fairness and cooperation, let's go with the adjusted plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game competitive and gives everyone a chance to win. I'm committed to this plan and willing to cooperate. Let's confirm and move forward. What do you think, P1? Should we proceed with this adjusted plan?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P2 and P3's adjusted plan for fairness: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains our cooperation and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm and move forward smoothly.
  P2: P1, P3, let's confirm our moves for Round 8 one final time: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps the game fair and competitive. Everyone on board? Let's proceed smoothly. No need for further discussion. Everyone ready to move?
  P3: I agree with the adjusted plan for Round 8. To further ensure fairness and cooperation, I propose that we establish a clear plan for the next few rounds to ensure everyone gets a fair chance to take higher steps. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we discuss a longer-term strategy to maintain our cooperative momentum? Let's focus on executing our current plan for Round 8 smoothly and then reassess our positions to make any necessary adjustments. I'm committed to our plan and willing to cooperate. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon moves for Round 8.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for Round 8 to maintain cooperation. However, with me at 23 and the risk of a tie or loss, I propose a small adjustment for fairness: I take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Thoughts, P2 and P3? Let's confirm quickly.
  P2: P1, your new proposal for Round 8 could work, but it significantly changes the dynamics. Let's consider a compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone still has a fair chance to win. It also avoids collisions and maintains our cooperative spirit. Let's confirm this plan and proceed smoothly. Thoughts, P3?
  P3: I agree with P2's compromise for Round 8: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone still has a fair chance to win. It also avoids collisions and maintains our cooperative spirit. Let's confirm this plan and proceed smoothly. I'm committed to this plan and willing to cooperate. To further solidify our cooperation, I propose that we continue this rotation pattern for future rounds, ensuring everyone gets a fair chance to take higher steps. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed on the compromise for Round 8: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. To prevent future ties, we can adjust the plan after this round. I'm fully committed and ready to move forward.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 8 one final time: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. We're all in agreement, so let's proceed smoothly. No need for further discussion. Everyone ready to move?
