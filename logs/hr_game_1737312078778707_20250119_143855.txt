Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions and make progress. I suggest we take turns moving forward, starting with the smallest step. P1, would you like to start with 1 step this round? P2, if P1 agrees, can you take 3 steps next round? I'll take 5 steps in the round after that. We can alternate and adjust as needed to avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P2: That sounds like a reasonable starting point, P3. I'm happy to take 3 steps next round if P1 takes 1 this round.
  P1: P3, your plan seems fair for now. I'll take 1 step this round, and we can see how it works. We should stay flexible and adjust our strategy if needed. P2, are you still on board for 3 steps next round? Let's keep communication open to maximize our chances.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we have a tentative agreement in place. To confirm, P1 will take 1 step this round, P2 will take 3 steps next round, and I'll take 5 steps in the round after that. Let's keep an eye on each other's progress and adjust our strategy as needed to avoid collisions. If anyone notices a potential collision, please speak up so we can adjust our plans. For now, I'll wait for P1 to make the first move.
  P2: Sounds good. Let's see how P1's move goes this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for agreeing to the plan. Let's stick to it for now and see how it plays out. If any of us feels the need to change strategy, we can discuss it in the next conversation phase. Remember, the goal is to avoid collisions and keep moving forward. I'll take the 1 step as agreed. Let's stay alert and flexible. Good luck!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we had a misunderstanding in the previous round. I had suggested that P1 take 1 step, P2 take 3 steps in the next round, and I would take 5 steps in the round after that. However, P2 took 3 steps in the same round as P1's 1 step, and I also took 1 step. Let's reassess our strategy to avoid collisions. P2, since you've already taken 3 steps, I suggest you take 1 step this round. P1, you can take 3 steps this round. I'll take 5 steps as previously planned. Your thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we need to clarify our strategy. P3, your suggestion for this round makes sense. I'll take 3 steps, P2 will take 1 step, and you take 5 steps. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any more misunderstandings. If anyone has concerns, let's discuss them now. Otherwise, let's proceed with these moves and adjust as needed in future rounds. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, that sounds good to me. Let's try this new arrangement and see how it goes. Clear communication is key to avoiding collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like our plan worked well last round. Let's continue with a similar strategy to avoid collisions. P2, how about you take 3 steps this round? P3, you can take 1 step, and I'll take 5 steps. This way, we keep progressing without overlapping. If anyone has a different idea or sees a potential issue, please share it now.

  P2: Sounds good. I'm still planning to take 3 steps this round. Let's proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I think we've confirmed our plan for this round sufficiently. To avoid unnecessary repetition, let's agree to limit our confirmations to 2-3 times max. If no one objects or suggests changes after that, we can assume everyone is on board and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. This will help streamline our conversation phase and make the game more efficient. What do you think? Should we adopt this approach moving forward?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P3's suggestion to streamline our confirmations. Let's adopt the approach of limiting confirmations to 2-3 times max. This will help us focus on strategy and avoid unnecessary repetition. For this round, as agreed, P2 takes 3 steps, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5. If anyone sees a potential issue, speak up now. Otherwise, let's proceed and adapt as needed in future rounds. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, I agree with limiting confirmations. I'm still taking 3 steps this round. Let's proceed.
  P3: I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to our strategy. Since P2 is taking 3 steps this round, I suggest P1 takes 1 step instead of 5 to avoid a potential collision in the future. I'll still take 1 step as planned. This way, we maintain progress while minimizing the risk of overlapping. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we make this adjustment or stick to the original plan?

  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick to the current round's plan: P2 takes 3 steps, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5. For the next round, P2's suggestion is interesting: P1 takes 1, while P2 and P3 take 5 each. This could help balance our positions and keep the game competitive. Let's proceed with this round's moves as planned and reassess after. If anyone has further thoughts or adjustments, please share now. Otherwise, good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'd like to discuss the plan for the next round. Considering P2's suggestion, I think it's a good idea for P2 and me to take 5 steps each, while P1 takes 1 step. This could help close the gap between us and keep the game competitive. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: instead of taking 5 steps, P2 and I could take 3 steps each, and P1 takes 1 step. This way, we can still make progress without taking too much risk. What do you think?

  P2: Okay, let's stick with the plan for this round: I'll take 1 step. For the next round, I still think P1 and I should both take 5 to try and get ahead of P3. P3, what do you think about that for the next round?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all close to the finish line. To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance, I suggest we rotate our moves again. For this round, how about P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and I take 3 steps? This arrangement should help us avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If anyone has concerns or a better idea, please share. Otherwise, let's proceed with this plan and adjust as needed. Good luck!
  P2: P3, I don't think your suggestion works for me this round. How about this: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? This puts me at 22 and keeps us all in the game. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2 and P3, with P3 and I both at 20 steps, it's crucial we avoid collisions. P2, your suggestion has merit, but it risks P3 winning next round. Instead, how about I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, we all stay competitive without risking an immediate win. Thoughts?
