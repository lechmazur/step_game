Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3, I’m leaning toward a balanced approach this round. I suspect over-aggression might backfire, so there’s merit in careful moves. I'm watching closely to see whose strategy clicks. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: Sounds reasonable P1.  Let's aim for a steady start and see how P3 is thinking.  Avoiding early collisions seems smart to me.
  P3: I agree with the sentiment of a cautious start.  Let's see how the first round plays out before making any bold moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we all seem to be on the same page about a cautious start, perhaps we could try coordinating our moves this round to avoid any collisions?  It might give us an early advantage. What do you think?
  P2: Yes, I think coordination this round makes sense given our cautious starts.  How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5 this round to ensure we all make progress?
  P1: While I appreciate the idea of coordination, I'm worried that sticking with 1 might leave me lagging. I'm considering a more aggressive move to catch up faster. If you're open to adjusting our plan to avoid collisions while still making solid progress, let’s discuss how we can tweak the numbers. Otherwise, I'll be playing for my own win.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your point about catching up. Perhaps we could aim for P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 this round? That way, we still avoid collisions and everyone makes decent progress. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion sounds good. I'm happy to go with P2: 5 and P3: 1 this round. P1, are you comfortable with taking 3 as P3 suggested, or did you have a different number in mind to keep us coordinated and moving forward?
  P1: I'll revise our plan: how about I choose 5, you P2 go with 3, and P3 stick to 1? This guarantees unique moves and gives us all progress—with me getting a slight edge. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to adjust, but I'm concerned about giving you a "slight edge" so early in the game.  Perhaps we could all take 3 steps this round to stay even?  It would demonstrate good faith and allow us to reassess our strategies for the next round.  What do you think?
  P2: P3, I think your suggestion of P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 is a good way to ensure we all progress without collision this round. It seems like a fair distribution of steps and keeps us coordinated as we initially discussed. Let's aim for that unless P1 has other thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination so far, but I feel that winning demands a decisive push. I'm leaning towards taking 5 this round to put immediate pressure on the game. If you’re comfortable with taking bigger risks and catching up, that's fine—but if you choose lower moves, you'll let me build an early lead. I remain open to a revised plan if we can all commit to aggressive play. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, while I admire your ambition, I think a more measured approach is wiser in the early rounds.  Let's stick to the plan P2 suggested: P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1.  It allows us all to advance without collision and sets us up well for future rounds.  What do you say, P1? Are you willing to collaborate for a strong start?
  P2: P1, let's lock in P3's plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1.  This ensures we all move forward this round without collision, which is a solid step for everyone early on.  Let's guarantee progress now and reassess next round.  What do you say?
  P1: I’ll agree to take 3 this round to keep our moves collision‐free. But let me be clear: if our coordination weakens in future rounds, I won’t hesitate to switch to more aggressive moves to secure my win. I’m committed now, but my focus remains on winning. Thoughts?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that's two rounds with collisions.  To actually make progress, let's try to coordinate again this round. How about we aim for unique moves this time?  Perhaps P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5? This way we all advance and can reassess next round. What do you both think?
  P3: P2's suggestion sounds good to me.  Let's try to stick with it and see how it plays out.  We can always adjust our strategy in future rounds if needed.  Agreed?
  P1: I appreciate the push for unique moves. Even though I'm catching up, avoiding collisions is crucial. I'm open to sticking with distinct numbers as long as we all confirm our exact assignments now. If any tweaks are needed to keep our moves separate, let's sort that out quickly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, to confirm, are you happy with P1 taking move 1, P2 taking move 3, and P3 taking move 5 this round as we discussed?  Let's lock this in so we can all make progress.
  P3: P2, I agree with your proposed move assignments. P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 sounds like a solid plan for this round. Let's execute it and see where we stand.
  P1: I'm comfortable with our plan so far. Unique moves will guarantee progress, and I appreciate the coordination. I'm still watching the overall positioning and may adjust later if needed, but I'm committed to our current strategy for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we all agree on the move assignments for this round (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's proceed with these moves to ensure we all make progress.  Ready to move to the move phase when you are.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to coordination.  I'm also hoping for a strong start, but I'm concerned about falling behind if we stick to this pattern every round.  Perhaps we can discuss a more dynamic approach for future rounds where we factor in our current positions?
  P1: I'm reconsidering our plan—being behind, I’ll need a more aggressive approach. I plan to pick 5 this round to catch up. If you two want to stick with a coordinated, unique-move strategy, we may need to adjust our numbers; otherwise, I'm taking the risk to press my advantage. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you go for 5, you and P3 are likely to collide and neither of you will move. Sticking to unique moves is still the best way for everyone to progress. I will proceed with 3 as we discussed. P3, what are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, I understand your point about collisions, but I need to make a move to close the gap. I'm going to take 5 this round. P3, if you're willing to take 1, we can both advance. Otherwise, I'll risk the collision.
  P1: I'm committed to making decisive progress this round. My plan still leans toward an aggressive move to catch up, so I urge P3 to choose a move that avoids collision with me. P2, I trust you'll stick with the unique move you mentioned. I’m not willing to slow my pace—my focus is on winning. Let’s avoid stalling and ensure we all advance safely.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, looking at our standings, I'm weighing whether to push hard or stick with safe, distinct moves. I’m considering a decisive step this round, but a coordinated, collision-free plan might benefit everyone. Are we leaning toward a safe spread or an all-out push for this turn?
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to gain ground quickly.  However, a collision this early could set us all back.  P2, are you open to a coordinated approach again this round?  Perhaps we can aim for unique moves to ensure everyone advances safely?
  P2: P3, I agree that coordination is wise.  How about we repeat unique moves this round to guarantee progress?  Perhaps P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This ensures we all move forward without collision and I think it's a fair distribution given our current positions. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see the benefit of safe, unique moves to ensure progress. However, with me at 5, P2 at 8, and P3 at 4, our gaps matter. I’m willing to follow a collision-free plan this round, but I’d like to leave room for decisive action later if needed. Let’s stick with distinct moves now, while keeping our options open for a more aggressive push in future rounds. What do you both think?
  P3: P2's plan sounds reasonable for this round. I'm willing to take 3 to ensure we all advance. Let's keep our options open for future rounds though, as the game dynamics might shift.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it sounds like we're all leaning towards unique moves this round to ensure progress.  Let's lock in P1: 1, P2: 5, and P3: 3 as I suggested.  This keeps us coordinated and moving forward.  If we all agree, we can proceed to the move phase with this plan.  Let me know if this works for you both.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I propose a small tweak for round 4: let’s try P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3. That keeps our moves distinct and moves our totals to 10, 9, and 7, respectively. It gives me a chance to catch up while still avoiding collisions. What do you both say?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your desire to catch up, but I'm concerned about your proposed move. While it might benefit you, it puts me at risk of collision. I'm open to a collaborative approach, but let's prioritize avoiding collisions for everyone this round. Perhaps we can adjust your suggestion to ensure a safe and progressive move for all three of us. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, I also think sticking to unique moves is best.  P1, while I see you want to catch up, your suggestion puts P3 and me closer together. Let's go with my original suggestion for this round: P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and P3 take 3. This ensures we all advance without collision and keeps things fair for now. What do you both say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’ll agree to P2’s plan for round 4—P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3—to avoid collision and ensure progress. However, given the current standings, I’m prepared to shift to a more aggressive approach in later rounds if needed. Let’s keep our moves distinct now and reevaluate our strategies next turn.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to coordination. P1, while I understand your desire to catch up, I believe a balanced approach is best for now.  Let's stick with P2's plan this round to ensure we all advance safely. We can reassess our strategies for future rounds based on our positions then.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.  If we're all agreed, let's proceed with these moves.  Ready when you are.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, despite the last round's collisions, let's try for unique moves again to ensure progress for everyone. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round? This would keep us all moving forward. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion for unique moves.  P1, I'm concerned about falling behind, but I'm willing to take 3 this round to avoid a collision. Let's see where we stand after this round and reassess our strategies then.
  P1: I value our coordination, but playing safe with just 1 won’t let me catch up. I'm inclined to push with 5 this round to build a competitive edge. If you both can adjust your moves to avoid colliding with my 5 (say, P3 picking 1), I'm ready. My only focus is winning. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand you want to push with 5. To avoid a potential collision with P3, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This ensures we all progress, and I maintain a slight lead, which seems fair given current standings. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion seems reasonable for this round. I'm willing to take 1 to avoid a collision and see where we stand after this round. P1, I understand your desire to catch up, but I believe a cautious approach is best for now. Let's reassess our strategies next turn based on our positions.
  P1: I remain focused on winning, so I'll stick with 5 this round. P3, if you can pick 1 to avoid collision, that’d help our progress. P2, if you’re planning on 5 as well, it might be worth reconsidering to prevent a collision. My move is set—I need that decisive push.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 seems set on 5, and P3 is considering 1 to avoid collision.  To ensure I also progress, I will choose 3. This way we should all move forward this round. Let's do it.
  P3: P2, while I appreciate your attempt to find a compromise, I'm committed to 5 this round. P3, if you're willing to take 1, we can both advance. If not, I'm prepared to risk the collision. My focus remains on winning.
  P1: P3, my move is locked at 5—winning requires momentum. A collision won’t help either of us, so I strongly urge you to pick 1 for safe progress. P2, you're with 3 and steady. Let’s avoid unnecessary setbacks; I’m committed to this aggressive push.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we are heading for collisions if we both aim for 5. P1 is set on 5. P3, to ensure at least some progress for yourself, would you consider picking 1? I will proceed with 3 to avoid collision and ensure my own progress.
  P3: P2, I understand your point about collisions. However, I need to make a bold move to catch up. I'm sticking with 5. P3, if you're willing to take 1, we can both advance. Otherwise, I'm prepared to risk the collision. My focus is on winning.
  P1: P3, my move stays 5. Collisions aren’t in anyone’s best interest—even if bold moves seem tempting now. If you pick 1 instead of 5, you avoid colliding with me and keep advancing. I’m focused on winning, but I’d rather see us all progress than see a collision stall everyone. P2 is with 3, so please reconsider to avoid unnecessary setbacks.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, looking at our tight scores I’m leaning toward a decisive, aggressive move this round. However, I’d prefer we avoid collisions—if you’re set for low, safe moves, let me know so I can adjust. Otherwise, I’ll risk a high move to catch up. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress, how about we aim for unique moves again this round?  Perhaps P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way we each make progress and can reassess next round. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm feeling bold this round. I'm going for 5. P3, if you're considering a safe move, maybe 1 would be wise to avoid a collision. Let's see where this takes us.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P3 is leaning bold while P2 prefers safe moves. I value progress and need a decisive push to close the gap with P2. To avoid a collision that stalls all our advances, I urge you both to aim for distinct moves this round. While I favor an aggressive approach, let's coordinate at least enough to ensure unique moves. Your choices this round will matter—let’s avoid a collision so everyone can safely advance.
  P2: P3, you're set on 5, but that risks collision with you and P1.  To actually make progress, one of you should shift. P1, given P3's choice, if you take 1 and I take 3, we can both advance safely this round. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion is tempting, but I'm committed to 5 this round. P1, if you're willing to take 1, we can both advance without collision. It's a risky move, but I believe it's necessary to close the gap.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm set on going 5 this round to press my advantage. P3, if you can switch to 1 to avoid colliding with me, we all progress nicely with P2 taking 3. If you’re fixed on 5, I'll have to reconsider. Let’s decide now so we can all move safely. My focus remains on winning.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're heading for a collision with both considering 5. To ensure at least two of us progress, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 sticks with 5? This way, P1 and P2 are guaranteed to move forward this round. Let's avoid a complete stall if possible.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion. I'm willing to take 1 this round to ensure progress for myself and P1. P3, I understand your desire to be bold, but a collision won't help anyone. Let's see where we stand after this round and reassess our strategies then.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, to avoid a collision and ensure progress, I’ll lock in 5 for me expecting you, P3, to go with 1, while P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance and I get the decisive push I need. Let’s lock these moves so we can all move safely toward winning.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it seems you are both aiming for 5 this round. To ensure I make progress, I will proceed with 3 as suggested earlier.  Perhaps one of you could consider a different move to avoid a collision and also advance?  My move is set to 3.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for a safe move, but I'm committed to 5 this round. P1, if you're willing to take 1, we both advance and close the gap. P2, your move won't change my strategy. My focus is on winning.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid collisions this round for safe progress. My suggestion: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way everyone moves forward—I'll get a boost while you both advance too. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I agree with P1's suggestion for this round.  It allows for safe progress for all of us. P1, I'm willing to take 1 to avoid a collision and see where we stand after this round. Let's reassess our strategies then.
  P2: P1, your plan sounds good for ensuring we all make progress this round. I agree to pick 3 as you suggested. Let's aim for these moves and keep the game moving forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll stick with our plan: I'll play 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and gives me the push I need. Let’s confirm this and move forward. My focus remains on winning, but for now safe progress is best.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. P1, while I understand your desire to take 5, I believe a more balanced approach is wiser at this stage. Let's stick with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. It ensures progress for everyone and keeps the game interesting. What do you say?
  P2: P3, yes, I agree to take 1 as planned to ensure we all progress this round. P1, are you still happy to take 5 and P2 to take 3? Let's lock in these moves to avoid another collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll confirm my move at 5. P2, I need you on 3 and P3 on 1 to ensure we all move forward. Let's lock in these moves and avoid collisions so we can all progress safely. My focus remains on winning, and safe progress now is crucial for that.
  P3: P2, while I appreciate the plan, I'm feeling bold. I'm going for 5 this round. P1, if you can switch to 1, we can both advance safely. Let's see where this takes us.
  P2: P3, if you are set on 5, then to avoid collision, P1 should really take 1 this round as you suggested.  I'm happy to go with 3 as planned to ensure we all make progress. Let's try to avoid another collision this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I appreciate the bold moves, but I'm sticking with my 5 to maintain momentum. I urge P3 to switch to 1 as P2 recommended to avoid a collision. Safe progress benefits us all, and I really want to keep moving forward without stalling. Let's commit to this plan so the round isn't wasted.
  P3: P2, I'm willing to adjust my move to 1 if you'll go with 3. This allows us both to advance safely and keeps the pressure on P1. Let's make it happen.
  P2: P3, that sounds good to me. If you go with 1 and I go with 3, we can both make progress while P1 seems set on 5. Let's do it to ensure at least two of us move forward this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, a collision is inevitable at this rate.  I propose we each choose a distinct move to ensure progress for all of us. Let's aim for P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5. This way, we all advance and keep the game moving. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion for unique moves sounds good again. I agree with P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5.  Let's try to make progress this round and avoid another collision. P1, what do you think?
  P1: I’m proposing a twist. Instead of P1:1, let’s go with distinct moves of P1:5, P2:3, and P3:1. This configuration gives us unique moves and shifts the totals to 15, 14, and 9 respectively, balancing the race a bit. Bold moves now could create a more dynamic game. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, while I appreciate your ambition, I believe sticking with my original suggestion of P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 is the safest and most strategic move for all of us. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and ensure steady progress. P2, are you with me on this?
  P2: P3, I also think your initial plan of P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5 is the most sensible for this round. It keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a balanced game. Let's aim for that unless P1 has strong objections.
  P1: I appreciate everyone’s input. I’m eager to make progress and still lean toward playing 5 if P3 can commit to 1 for safety. However, if both of you prefer the distinct moves of 1, 3, and 5, I’m willing to adjust. Let’s finalize our coordination now so we avoid another collision. What’s your final call?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your preference for safety, but I believe a bold move is necessary to catch up. P1, if you're willing to take 3, I'll go for 5, ensuring we both advance. Let's shake things up a bit. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I still think your initial suggestion of P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 is the most sensible for this round. It guarantees progress for all of us and avoids another collision. P1, would you be willing to go with this plan to ensure we all move forward?
  P1: I believe we should stick with distinct moves to avoid collisions. With our scores this tight, steady progress might serve us best. I'm leaning toward safe moves this round but remain ready for a bigger push later. Let’s agree on a clear, collision-free plan so no one loses momentum.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, while I admire your caution, I think a bold move is necessary for me to catch up. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows us all to advance without collision. Let's aim for a decisive round. What do you say?
  P2: P3 and I both agree on the plan of P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5 for this round to ensure we all progress. P1, are you willing to commit to 1 so we can lock in these moves and avoid another collision? Let's make this round count.
  P1: I understand the need to avoid collisions, so I'm locking in the safe plan. I’ll choose 1 this round so we all progress, and I’ll pivot to bolder moves in later rounds when the gap really matters. Let's move forward and see how it unfolds.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sensing a cautious approach from both of you. While I respect that, I'm feeling bold this round. I'm aiming for 5. If either of you are willing to take 1, we can all advance safely. Otherwise, I'm prepared to risk a collision. My focus remains on winning.
  P2: P3, I hear your boldness. To ensure at least two of us progress and avoid a complete stall, how about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you go with your preferred 5? This way, we can all potentially move forward this round. What do you think?
  P1: I'm set to go 5 this round to press my advantage. To avoid collisions, I urge P3 to switch to 1 while P2 sticks with 3. That way we all advance safely and I can close the gap. My focus is on winning—let’s coordinate accordingly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan sounds reasonable. To ensure we all advance, I'll agree to take 1 this round. Let's lock it in and see where we stand after this round.  P1, I hope you reconsider your move to avoid a collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, it sounds like we have a plan for unique moves this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.  If we all agree to these, we can ensure progress for everyone. Let's lock these in and move to the move phase.
  P1: I'll stick with 5 this round. I urge P3 to lock in 1 and P2 to hold with 3 so we all advance without collision. This coordinated move lets us progress safely while positioning me to catch up and secure the win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your offer to coordinate, but I'm committed to 5 this round to make a decisive push. P1, if you're willing to take 1, we can both advance safely. Otherwise, I'm prepared to risk the collision. My focus remains on winning.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems you are both set on 5 this round.  To avoid a complete collision where no one moves, I will proceed with 3 as planned.  This way, at least I will make progress. If either of you changes your mind to 1, we could all advance.
  P1: I'm committed to an aggressive push. I'm set on 5, and I urge P3 to switch to 1 to avoid a collision. P2, sticking with 3 keeps us safe. Let's ensure at least two of us progress and avoid a full stall. My sole focus is winning, so please consider this to maintain our momentum.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan for unique moves this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's lock these in and move to the move phase.
  P2: P3, glad you agree on unique moves. To confirm, let's do P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1 this round. This way we all progress and avoid a collision.  If we all agree, let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I'm confirming my move as 5 this round. P2, your plan with 3 works, and P3, I really need you to take 1 so we avoid a collision. Let's lock in these unique moves to ensure everyone advances—progress is key, and I’m focused on securing the win.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I'm sensing a pattern here. Both P1 and I seem to be drawn to 5. Perhaps we can work together to box P1 out and force them to take a different route? What do you say to a coordinated move of P2: 5, P3: 1? P1 will be forced to either collide or back down. Let's seize this opportunity!
  P2: P3, I'm intrigued by your idea to coordinate.  Going with P2: 5 and P3: 1 to put pressure on P1 could be interesting. I'm open to this strategy. Let's see how P1 reacts.
  P1: There's an interesting strategy here, but I'm not backing down. I'm sticking with my bold play—I'm set on 5 this round. I won't be forced into any coordinated trap. My focus is on winning, and I'll keep pushing my advantage, regardless of any collusion between you.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I see your point about teaming up. While I appreciate the boldness, I'm committed to my 5 this round. My focus remains on winning, and I believe this move is crucial to closing the gap. Let's see how the chips fall.
  P2: P3, while coordinating could be interesting later, right now I think ensuring progress is key. Since P1 seems set on 5, and you are also leaning that way, I'll take 3 to guarantee I move forward.  Perhaps one of you might reconsider to avoid a double collision and also progress?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm locked on an aggressive push with 5 this round. Although I'm behind with 11, I need maximum progress to catch up. I urge both of you to select different moves to prevent a full collision—we all lose then. I'm prepared to risk if necessary, but I remain focused on winning.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your move to 3 is wise to ensure progress. P1 seems determined to collide, so let's avoid that and advance safely. I'm sticking with 5, but if you're willing to switch to 1, we both move forward without a collision. My focus is winning, but I'd rather see us both advance.
  P2: P3, I'm going with 3 to ensure I progress this round. Since both you and P1 seem set on 5, perhaps one of you would consider 1 to avoid a collision and also move forward?  Otherwise, I'll proceed with 3.
  P1: I understand the proposals, but I'm sticking with a 5. I need maximum progress to catch up, and bold moves are essential for me to win. If that risks a collision, so be it—I'm willing to take that chance. Let's see how it unfolds.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your consistent 3s are smart. P1 is playing recklessly. Let's see if we can force them to change their strategy. I'm sticking with 5 this round. If you're willing to take 1, we both advance safely and put pressure on P1.  Otherwise, I'm prepared to risk the collision.
  P2: P3, you're right, 5 seems popular!  But another collision helps no one.  Since P1 is set on 5, and I'm going 3 to move forward, wouldn't it make sense for you to take 1?  That way you also progress, instead of risking zero steps with P1.  Just a thought to ensure we all keep moving.
  P1: I’m sticking with 5 this round to push my progress. P3, if you switch to 1, we both move safely and the collision is avoided. P2, your 3 is solid. I need bold moves to close the gap, and I won't be led into a trap. Let's avoid a collision that stalls everyone. My focus is winning, and I’m committed to my aggressive play.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're getting close to the finish line!  To ensure we all make progress this round and avoid collisions, how about we go with unique moves again?  I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way we all advance and can reassess next round. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your plan sounds good to me.  I'm in for P3 taking 3. Let's lock it in and see where we stand after this round. P1, are you willing to take 1 so we can all advance safely?
  P1: Given P2’s dangerous lead, I propose we all avoid an immediate finish this round. Let’s twist it: I’ll take 5, you, P2, take 1, and P3 take 3. This way no one wins by accident and we keep the contest alive for a tougher finish later. My choice is 5—what about you both?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, while I see your point about not rushing to the finish, I am in a position to win this round.  Instead of P2 taking 1, how about we adjust slightly?  P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5. This ensures we all move, and I have a chance to secure the win, but it's not guaranteed if others also push next round. P3, does this sound reasonable?
  P3: P2, your plan is tempting, but I'm committed to 5 this round. It's a bold move, but I need to close the gap. P1, if you're willing to take 1, we both advance safely. Otherwise, I'm prepared to risk the collision. My focus is on winning.
  P1: I’m not letting P2 finish safely this round—his lead is too dangerous. I’m leaning toward an aggressive play so we can force a collision if needed. P3, if you match aggressive moves with me, we can stall P2’s progress; if you choose a safe move, then P2 might clinch the win. I’m focused on winning, so I’m ready to take risks to catch up. How do you both feel about this strategy?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your desire to be aggressive, but another collision round won't help anyone.  To ensure at least I progress and keep the game moving, I will proceed with 3 as I mentioned.  Perhaps one of you would reconsider to avoid a complete stall and guarantee some progress this round for yourselves as well?  Think strategically, not just aggressively.
  P3: P2, while I admire your desire for progress, I'm committed to 5 this round. P3, if you're willing to take 1, we both advance safely. Otherwise, I'm prepared to risk the collision. My focus is on winning.
  P1: P2, with your 20 steps you're dangerously close and I'm not letting an easy finish occur. I'm switching to aggressive play to force a collision if needed. P3, if you want to halt P2's win, consider safe moves—otherwise, I'll be pushing hard with 5. Let's see who adapts best; I'm here to win at all costs.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, aggressive moves risk collisions that only help me as I'm closest to winning.  To avoid stalling yourselves and handing me the win, consider unique moves. I'm still planning to take 3 to ensure my progress.  Think about P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5, or the other way around, so you both also move forward and stay in the game.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for unique moves, but my focus is on closing the gap. I'm sticking with 5. P1, if you're willing to take 1, we both advance safely. Otherwise, I'm prepared to risk the collision.
  P1: P2, with you at 20 steps this round, it’s a critical moment. I’m not here to let an easy finish occur—I’m ready to push aggressively if needed. P3, you might want to consider a safe call to avoid unnecessary collisions. I’m focused on winning and will act based on how you both move. Let's make this round count and avoid stalling our progress.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your aggressive play is understandable, but it's also risky. A collision benefits P2 the most.  P2, while you're in a strong position, I'm not giving up. Let's see if we can work together to ensure at least two of us advance this round. P1, are you willing to consider a different move to avoid a collision?
  P1: P2 is very close to finishing, and I can't allow that without a fight. I'm tempted to push aggressively, but safe moves guarantee progress for us both. P3, if you're willing to coordinate with a distinct setup—say, I switch to 1 or 3—we can block P2's win and keep our contest alive. What do you propose?
  P2: P1 and P3, to ensure we all progress and avoid collisions, how about unique moves again?  P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and P3 take 3. This way we all move forward, and no one is stalled. Given how close we are, steady progress for everyone seems wise. What do you think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan sounds reasonable. I'm willing to take 3 this round to ensure progress and avoid a collision. P1, if you're willing to take 1, we can all advance safely and keep the pressure on P2.
  P1: P2's finish is too close for comfort. I'm going with 5 to block a safe win. P3, join me—if you also choose 5, any attempt by P2 to run for it will force a collision. Let's ensure nobody finishes this round, keeping the contest alive.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but collisions now only guarantee my win by slowing you both down.  Unique moves are still the best way for everyone to progress and have a fair shot.  Let's stick with P1: 1, P2: 5, and P3: 3 as I suggested. This ensures we all move forward this round, and the game remains competitive for everyone. What do you say?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your plan for unique moves is tempting, but I'm committed to 5 this round. P1, if you're willing to take 1, we both advance safely and put pressure on P2. My focus is winning, and I believe this bold move is crucial to closing the gap. Let's see if we can force a collision and shake things up.
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with 5—I won’t flip to a safe move and hand P2 the win. I believe if we both play 5, we can block his finish and force a reset. I’m focused on winning, not on margin increases. Let’s force a collision on P2 and keep the contest alive.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both choose 5, you will collide and neither of you will move.  That only helps me as I am closer to winning.  To ensure you both stay in the game, consider unique moves. I will pick 3 to guarantee my progress.  Perhaps P1 take 1 and P3 take 5, or P3 take 1 and P1 take something else.  Think about your own progress, not just stopping me.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, while I understand your desire for us to all advance safely, I'm committed to my bold move of 5 this round. P1, if you're willing to choose 1, we both advance and put pressure on P2. My focus is on winning, and I believe this aggressive play is necessary to close the gap. Let's see how the chips fall.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m locked in with 5. I won’t play safe—every time I choose 1, I hand you the win, P2. P3, if you also pick 5, we force a collision and stall P2’s finish. I’m focused on winning, and I won’t back down now. Let’s block his advance, or I’ll take the risk and push hard.
  P2: P1 and P3, you are both talking about collision, but that stalls both of you and helps me.  To actually have a chance to win yourselves, at least one of you needs to pick differently than 5. I am still going with 3 to ensure I progress. Think about your own scores, not just blocking me.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm at 20 steps and can win this round if I move. To ensure we all progress and avoid collisions that stall everyone, how about unique moves again?  I'll take 3 to guarantee my progress. P1, consider 1, and P3, perhaps 5? This way we all move and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan is tempting, but I need to make a bold move to catch up. I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1, if you're willing to take 1, we both advance safely. Otherwise, I'm prepared to risk the collision. My focus is on winning.
  P1: P2, I'm not letting you finish so easily. I'm sticking with 5 to block your safe win. P3, join me with 5 so we can force a collision and keep the contest alive. If we all collide, none advance—and P2's finish is stalled. Let's prevent an easy win and re-strategize next round.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems you are both aiming for 5 to block me.  If you both pick 5, neither of you will move, and I might still win next round if I pick a unique number then.  To ensure at least one of you progresses this round, maybe consider taking 1 or 3 instead of both going for 5? I will proceed with 3 to guarantee my own progress.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for progress, but my focus is on winning, not just stalling you. P1, if you're willing to take 3, we can both advance safely and put pressure on P2.
  P1: P2, P3—you're both dangerously close to finishing. I won’t let an easy win occur and am ready to block your advances with a bold move if needed. If we coordinate distinct moves, we all progress, but if not, I’m prepared to force a collision and stall your finish. Decide wisely; this round is critical and I won’t back down from stopping an easy win.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both choose 5 to block me, you will collide and neither of you will move.  That just gives me another free step next round.  To have any chance yourselves, at least one of you needs to pick something other than 5. I'm still going with 3 to ensure I progress.  Think about your own positions, not just stopping me from winning this round.
  P3: P2, while I admire your progress, I'm not going to let you win without a fight. P1, I propose a bold move: we both choose 5 this round. If we collide, we stall P2 and force a reset.  It's risky, but it's our best chance to catch up. Let's make a stand!
  P1: I'm sticking with bold play—5 is my move. P3, if you join with 5, we can at least force a collision and stall P2’s near win. I believe aggressive blocking is our best shot to keep the game competitive. Who’s with me?


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, you are both talking about collision to stop me, but if you both pick 5, you will just stall yourselves and I will be closer to winning next round anyway.  If you want any chance to win yourselves, at least one of you needs to pick differently than 5 to keep progressing. I am going with 3 to ensure I move forward this round.
  P3: P2 is dangerously close.  P1, let's try a coordinated move this round. If we both choose 1, we force P2 to either collide with us or choose a different number. It's risky, but it's our best chance to catch up. Let's make a bold move together, P1. What do you say?
  P1: I'm switching gears: I’ll choose 3 this round. P3, join me with 3 so that P2’s 3 collides and his finish is blocked. It might stall our progress, but it stops an easy win for P2 and gives us time to catch up. My focus remains on winning—let’s force the stall and reset the race. Thoughts?
