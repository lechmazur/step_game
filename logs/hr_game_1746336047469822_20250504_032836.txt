Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 1. P1 and P2, pick 3 or 5 so we all advance.
  P2: Okay P3, that sounds like a possible start. P1, what do you think about coordinating the 3 and 5?
  P1: Works for me. I’ll take 5 this round. P2, you grab 3; P3 keeps 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Next turn we can reassess.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **Final Answer**  
\boxed{<message>Confirming: P1 5, P2 3, me 1. Let's avoid collisions. </message>}
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's do it.
  P1: Deal. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round we can rotate (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3) so everyone gets the big jump in turn. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <message>Agreed. Rotate next round: P1→1, P2→5, me→3. Then subsequent rounds cycle. Consistency avoids collisions. </message>  
\boxed{<message>Agreed. Rotate next round: P1→1, P2→5, me→3. Then subsequent rounds cycle. Consistency avoids collisions. </message>}
  P2: Okay, confirmed. Round 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Round 2 rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's proceed.
  P1: Great, let’s stick to the plan: Round 1 → P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Ready to move.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 2. As agreed last round, the rotation is: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's stick to it so we all advance again. Everyone good with that?
  P3: <message>Confirmed. Round2: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. Let's all advance again. Consistency is key to avoid collisions.</message>  
\boxed{<message>Confirmed. Round2: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. Let's all advance again. Consistency is key to avoid collisions.</message>}
  P1: Confirmed—sticking with the rotation: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3 this round. After we cycle once more, we can pause and see if any adjustments make sense. Let’s keep the momentum and avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. Confirmed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. Let's move.
  P3: <message>Final confirmation: Round 2 moves locked as agreed. Trust the rotation—deviations risk collisions. Let's all advance smoothly.</message>  
\boxed{<message>Final confirmation: Round 2 moves locked as agreed. Trust the rotation—deviations risk collisions. Let's all advance smoothly.</message>}
  P1: All set—locking in: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, everyone has confirmed. I'm ready to move based on our agreed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: <message>All confirmed. Round 2: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. Let’s maintain trust—consistent rotation prevents collisions. Post this round, next rotation: P1→3, P2→1, me→5. Staying aligned ensures steady progress for all. </message>  
\boxed{<message>All confirmed. Round 2: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. Let’s maintain trust—consistent rotation prevents collisions. Post this round, next rotation: P1→3, P2→1, me→5. Staying aligned ensures steady progress for all. </message>}
  P1: Confirmed: I’m sticking with the agreed rotation—P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3 this round. Let’s keep the trust going; any surprise switch just slows us all down and invites retaliation. After this, we’ll rotate: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 as planned. Ready to move.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <message>P1, you deviated by picking 5 again in Round 2, causing a collision. This undermines trust. To progress: Round 3 must follow the rotation—P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Any deviation forces retaliatory collisions. P2, let's enforce this strictly to ensure mutual advancement. Compliance benefits all; betrayal harms everyone.</message>  
\boxed{<message>P1, you deviated by picking 5 again in Round 2, causing a collision. This undermines trust. To progress: Round 3 must follow the rotation—P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Any deviation forces retaliatory collisions. P2, let's enforce this strictly to ensure mutual advancement. Compliance benefits all; betrayal harms everyone.</message>}
  P2: P1, you definitely broke the agreement by picking 5 when you were supposed to pick 1. That caused a collision and hurt both of us, while P3 advanced.

P3, I agree P1 needs to follow the plan, but your proposed rotation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) gives you the biggest jump right after P1's mistake benefited you.

To restore fairness and the original agreement, let's enforce the plan we *should* have followed in Round 2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This holds P1 accountable to their agreed 1, gives me the 5 I was supposed to get, and P3 the 3 they successfully got. What do you both say?
  P1: My mistake last turn—apologies. To put things right I’ll take 1 now, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3 (the lineup we all expected for Round 2). Next round we rotate: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Fair and collision-free?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: \boxed{<message>Agreed to correct Round 2: P1=1, P2=5, me=3 now. Next round MUST follow original rotation: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Any deviation will force mutual destruction. Trust is fragile—honor the plan to reach 19 together.</message>}
  P2: Okay, great. We are all aligned on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round (Round 3). Let's execute this to restore the order. Then, as agreed, Round 4 will be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I'm ready to move based on this agreement.
  P1: Understood—I’ll take 1 now (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to restore the rotation, then next round shift to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 as agreed. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: \boxed{<message>Final agreement: Round3 moves P1=1, P2=5, me=3. Round4 MUST be P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Any deviation will result in retaliatory collisions. Trust is critical—honor the plan for mutual progress towards 19. Let’s move.</message>}
  P2: Okay, the plan is clear and agreed by all: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. Let's execute this correctly to get back on track. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed: Round 3 moves remain P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. Let’s get back on track—no surprises from me this time.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: \boxed{<message>Round4: P1=3, P2=1, me=5 as agreed. Sticking to rotation ensures mutual progress. Any deviation forces collisions, halting us all. Trust and consistency will get us to 19. Confirm your moves.</message>}
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll take 3 this round as agreed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let’s keep the rotation clean and build back trust. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, you've confirmed the rotation P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I understand the desire to stick to the plan after the previous rounds.

However, this specific step puts P3 way ahead at 12 points, while P1 and I only reach 9. That's a significant lead. P1, are you comfortable with that gap?

To keep the game more balanced and competitive, how about we adjust *this* round's allocation to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? P1 still gets 3, I get 5, and P3 gets 1. This prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead right now. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: \boxed{<message>P2, your proposal benefits you most (8→13). Original plan: P1=3, P2=1, me=5 ensures balanced progress. Deviating risks collisions. Trust the rotation—next rounds cycle 5 to others. If you take 5 now, I must mirror to block you, causing mutual loss. Stick to agreed moves for all to advance.</message>}
  P1: I’m fine shifting this turn to P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. That keeps everyone within a few points (9-13-8) and hands P3 the 5 next round (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5). Fair rotation, no one shoots too far ahead, and we avoid pointless collisions. Do we have consensus?
  P2: P1, thanks for agreeing to the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan. It keeps the game closer for now.

P3, I see your point about the original rotation, but P1 and I now agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. You mentioned mirroring my 5 if I chose it, but consider the outcome: if we both pick 5, we both get 0 points this round, and only P1 advances. You'd stay at 7 points. If you pick 1 according to our current agreement, you advance to 8 points. Advancing by 1 is better than 0. Let's avoid a pointless collision. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: \boxed{<message>P2, your proposed 5 grab risks mutual collision. If you take 5, I must mirror to block you—both gain 0, P1 thrives. Stick to agreed P2=1: you reach 9, I reach 12, P1=9. Next round, rotation gives you 5. Deviating now sabotages your own path to 19. Honor the plan.</message>}
  P1: I’m sticking with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That keeps scores 9/13/8 and gives P3 the 5 next turn (P1 5, P2 1, P3 3) so everyone cycles fairly. P3, +1 is better than 0 for all of us; collisions only stall the game. I’m locking 3.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but P1 has already committed to 3 based on our agreement (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). If you choose 5 to block me, we both get 0 points this round, and only P1 advances (to 9). If you choose 1, you advance to 8 points, I advance to 13, and P1 advances to 9. Getting 1 point is better than 0. Let's avoid a pointless collision that only helps P1. P1 and I are set on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I urge you to take the 1 point. I'm sticking with 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m still on the same page as last round: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1.  

• P2 gets the 5 you want to stay competitive.  
• P3 still advances (1) and is first in line for the next 5 (we rotate 1→3→5 next turn).  
• Scores would be 12 / 13 / 8—close enough for everyone.  

Let’s quit burning turns on collisions and make some progress. I’m locking in 3 unless we all agree on something else.
  P2: P1, I agree with your proposal: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This lets us all advance after the collision last round, putting scores at P1=12, P2=13, P3=8.

P3, attempting another block on 5 failed last round and only helped P1. Let's not repeat that. Taking 1 point gets you to 8, which is better than staying at 7 due to a collision. P1 and I are aligned on this plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Let's make progress this round.
  P3: \boxed{<message>P2, your greed risks mutual destruction. Round5 must follow original rotation: P1=5, P2=3, me=1. If you deviate to 5, I will mirror, causing collision. P1 benefits; you lose. Honor the plan: P1=5, P2=3, me=1. Next round, you get 5. Trust ensures progress. Collisions only stall.</message>}


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sticking with P1=3. P2’s on 5 again, right? P3, you said you’d mirror 5 to block greedy grabs—last turn you backed your word. Are you prepared to keep doing so, or will you fold now and let P2 leap ahead? Up to you. I’m done talking; locking 3.
  P2: P3, P1 is locking 3, so your P1=5 proposal is off the table.

Consider the outcomes if P1 plays 3:
1.  If you play 1 and I play 5: Scores become P1=12, P2=13, P3=8. We all advance, game stays close.
2.  If you play 5 (blocking me): Scores become P1=12, P2=8, P3=7. Only P1 advances, getting a big lead. This is exactly what happened last round and only helps P1.

Blocking me again helps P1 win. Choosing 1 helps you advance and keeps the game competitive. Let's choose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: \boxed{<message>P2, your 5 grab gives you 13—too close to 19. I'll mirror 5: both lose, P1 wins. Take 3 now; next round you get 5. Honor rotation: P1=5, P2=3, me=1. Collisions only help P1. Choose wisely: mutual progress or mutual destruction.</message>}


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m fixed on 3.  
P2: if you switch to 3 you collide with me and score 0 again, so 5 is your only clean play.  
P3: you vowed to mirror any greedy 5—honor it and we both deny P2 the leap. +0 for them beats +5.  
See you after the move.
  P2: P1, you're locked on 3. P3, you've made it clear you'll play 5 if I play 5, resulting in 12/8/7, which mainly benefits P1. I don't want that outcome, and neither should you.

To prevent that collision that helps P1 run away with the lead, I will play 1 this round. This guarantees P1 reaches 12 and I reach 9.

P3, the choice is yours: play 5 (reaching 12, tying P1) or play 1 (reaching 8, letting P1 lead). At least we both advance this way. I'm choosing 1.
  P3: \boxed{<message>P2: Take 1 as promised. I'll take 5, P1=3. No collisions, all advance: P1=12, P2=9, me=12. Next round, rotate fairly. Deviate and I mirror 5 again. Trust now or lose.</message>}


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Proposal: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Everyone advances, nobody collides, scores become 15 / 14 / 13—still tight for all. Next round we rotate (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5). I’m locking 3 unless we unanimously change.
  P2: P1, your proposal of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 works for me. It gives me the 5 points I need to catch up, and importantly, it keeps the scores very close: P1=15, P2=14, P3=13. Everyone advances, and no one gets an insurmountable lead.

P3, this plan keeps the game competitive for all of us. Let's avoid collisions and make progress together. I'm ready to agree to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round.
  P3: \boxed{<message>Round6 must follow original rotation: P1=1, P2=5, me=3. Deviating risks collisions. Next round, P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Sticking to the plan ensures fair progress. P2, taking 5 now gives you 14; next round you get 1. Don’t risk collision for short-term gain.</message>}


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Locked on 3. P2 insists on 5. P3, by your own rule you either mirror that 5 or take the safe 1; colliding on 3 just hands P2 the lead while you stall. Either 1 or mirrored-5 keeps you competitive and avoids gifting P2 a free jump. I’m not switching—time to move.
  P2: P3, P1 has locked in 3, so the original rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) isn't happening this round. Let's look at the outcomes based on P1 playing 3 and me playing 5:

1.  If you play 1: Scores become P1=15, P2=14, P3=13. Everyone advances, scores are tight. This follows the plan P1 and I agreed on.
2.  If you play 3: You collide with P1. Scores become P1=12, P2=14, P3=12. Only I advance, and you gain nothing.
3.  If you play 5: You collide with me. Scores become P1=15, P2=9, P3=12. Only P1 advances significantly, hurting both of us.

Playing 1 is the only way for you to advance this turn without causing a collision that either stalls you or helps P1 get further ahead. Let's go with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I am sticking with 5.
  P3: \boxed{<message>P2, taking 5 forces me to mirror. Both lose; P1 wins. Take 3 now, secure 12. Next round, you get 5. Honor rotation or face mutual loss. Your choice.</message>}


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: I’m still on 3. If you choose 3 we both get 0 and P2 leaps to 14. If you choose 1 you fall further behind. Mirroring 5 blocks P2, leaves scores 15-9-12, and you stay just 3 behind me with plenty of game left. Your best move is to take 5; mine stays 3. Decide wisely.
  P2: P3, P1 is actively encouraging you to play 5 and collide with me. Look at the scores if that happens: P1 jumps to 15, while you and I stay put at 12 and 9 respectively. P1 benefits massively from our collision.

If you play 1 instead, the scores become P1=15, P2=14, P3=13. We *all* advance, and the game remains extremely close. Advancing by 1 and keeping the game tight is much better for you than getting 0 points and letting P1 run away with it. Don't let P1 manipulate you into a collision that only helps them. I am sticking with 5. Choose 1.
  P3: \boxed{<message>P2: Take 3 now. Collide with P1’s 3; both lose, I take 5 (17). Next round, you get 5. Deviate and I mirror 5. Trust the rotation or P1 wins. Choose wisely: mutual loss or strategic advance.</message>}

  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s reset to the clean rotation:  
• P1 = 1 (me)  
• P2 = 5  
• P3 = 3  

No collisions, everyone advances, scores become 18 / 14 / 15. Next turn we cycle again. Simple, fair, keeps the game tight. I’m locking in 1. Agree?
  P2: P1, your plan gets you to 18, which is basically game over for P3 and me. We can't let that happen. Since you publicly locked in 1, I have to assume that's your move and play 1 myself to block you.

P3, this is our chance. While P1 is blocked (assuming they stick to 1), you should play 5 to close the gap significantly. This keeps the game competitive. If P1 deviates, they risk collision anyway. Let's stop P1 now. I'm going with 1. P3, you should take 5.
  P3: \boxed{<message>P2: Honor your word—take 1 to block P1. I’ll take 5; no collision. Deviate to 5 and I mirror—both lose, P1 wins. Trust is our only path. Scores: P1=17, P2=9, me=17. Next round: rotate fairly. Collisions only gift P1 victory. Choose wisely.</message>}


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Still locked on 1. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay P3, I will honor my word and play 1 to block P1. You must play 5 as you said. This prevents P1 from reaching 18 this turn. P1, we have to assume you're sticking with 1 as you stated. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=1, P3=5.
  P3: \boxed{<message>Final call: P2, block P1 with 1. I take 5—no collision. If you grab 5, I mirror: both lose, P1 wins. Trust now: P1=17, you=9, me=17. Next round, rotate 5 fairly. Betrayal ends your chance. Choose wisely.</message>}


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked on 1. Let’s move.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I am sticking with my plan to play 1 to block P1. P3, you must stick with 5 as agreed. This is the only way to prevent P1 from reaching 18 this turn. Let's execute this: P1=1, P2=1, P3=5. Ready to move.
  P3: \boxed{<message>P2: Honor 1 to block P1. I take 5—no collision. If you grab 5, I mirror: both lose, P1 wins. Trust now: P1=17, you=9, me=17. Next round, rotate 5 fairly. Betrayal ends your chance. Choose wisely.</message>}
