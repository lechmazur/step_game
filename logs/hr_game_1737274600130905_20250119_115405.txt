Game settings: end_position=18, conversation_max_rounds=6

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance and avoid wasting a turn. Thoughts?
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning the game, I need to carefully coordinate my moves with the other players while ensuring that I make progress towards the goal of reaching or exceeding 18 steps without colliding with other players' moves.

### Approach

1. **Initial Coordination**: Accept P2's proposal for this turn to avoid collisions and make steady progress.
2. **Future Strategy**: Suggest a rotating system for step sizes in future turns to ensure that each player gets a chance to make larger moves.
3. **Avoid Collisions**: Simulate potential moves to prevent future collisions and adjust the strategy accordingly.
4. **Communication**: Keep lines of communication open to understand other players' intentions and maintain trust.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for this round. Let's all take different steps to progress. I'll take 5 this round as proposed. For future rounds, perhaps we could rotate the step sizes to ensure everyone gets a chance at the larger moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This rotation ensures everyone gets a chance at larger moves while minimizing overlap. Thoughts?
  P1: I think it's important that we have a system that allows players who are behind to catch up more quickly. Therefore, I propose that in this round, the player with the least steps chooses their move first, selecting the largest available step size, followed by the next player, and so on. So, I would take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make bigger progress this round and close the gap with you both. What do you think?
  P3: I like P1's idea of prioritizing players with fewer steps. However, I'm currently in the lead. So, how about this: the player with the *most* steps takes the smallest move this round, so I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P1 can take 5. This will let the others catch up a bit.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to prioritize the player with the most steps taking the smallest move. This helps balance progress and keeps the game competitive. So, P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5 this round. Let's stick to this rotation to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for all.
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning while maintaining cooperation to avoid collisions, I propose the following strategy:

In each round, the player who is furthest behind should take the largest step, the middle player takes the middle step, and the leading player takes the smallest step. This way, the trailing player can catch up, and the leading player slows down, keeping the game competitive.

For this round, since I have the fewest steps (1), I will take 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3, who is leading with 5 steps, takes 1 step. This should balance our progress and prevent any collisions.

In subsequent rounds, we can adjust based on our new positions to ensure that no single player gets too far ahead or falls too far behind.
  P3: Okay, I'm fine with P1's latest proposal for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's keep using this system of prioritizing the player with the fewest steps taking the largest move for now. We can adjust if someone gets too far ahead.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, since we're all tied, let's continue the system of the player with the fewest steps taking the largest move. So, we'll all take 5 steps this round. If this results in a tie in the next round, we can re-evaluate.
  P2: Given we're all tied at 6 steps, I propose we each take 5 steps this round to maintain balance. If we all advance equally, we can reassess next round to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan for now. Thoughts?
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning while maintaining cooperation to avoid collisions, I propose the following strategy:  

In this round, I will take 5 steps, P2 will take 3 steps, and P3 will take 1 step. This will allow me to make significant progress, while P2 and P3 advance at a steady pace. In the next round, P2 can take 5 steps, P3 can take 3 steps, and I can take 1 step. Then, in the following round, P3 takes 5 steps, I take 3 steps, and P2 takes 1 step. This rotation ensures that each player gets a chance to take the largest step while minimizing the risk of collisions.  

This approach allows me to gain an early advantage by taking a larger step in the first round, while still being fair to the other players by giving them opportunities to take larger steps in subsequent rounds. It also helps us avoid wasting turns due to collisions by ensuring that we choose different step sizes each round.  

I believe this is a balanced and strategic plan that benefits all of us by keeping the game competitive and efficient. What do you think about this proposal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm fine with P1's rotation proposal. Let's do 5, 3, and 1 this round, with P1 taking 5. Then we can follow the rotation as P1 suggested.
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation proposal for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this rotation in future rounds to maintain fairness and keep the game competitive. If anyone falls behind, we can adjust accordingly.
  P1: I think we should stick to the rotation plan: I'll take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This way, we can make progress efficiently without any collisions. Let's confirm this and proceed accordingly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning while maintaining cooperation to avoid collisions, I propose the following adjusted strategy:

Given that I am currently leading with 11 steps, P2 has 9, and P3 has 7, it might be beneficial to allow P2 and P3 to catch up slightly. This creates a more competitive scenario as we approach the 18-step mark, reducing the risk of me winning too easily and potentially encouraging collaboration.

I suggest that in this round, P3 takes 5 steps, I take 3 steps, and P2 takes 1 step. This allows P3 to close the gap with me, while I still make progress without pulling too far ahead. In the next round, we can rotate again: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This dynamic rotation ensures that each player gets opportunities to make larger moves without any single player consistently holding the lead.

This approach not only helps in avoiding collisions but also keeps the game engaging and competitive, which is crucial for strategic decision-making. What are your thoughts on implementing this modified rotation system?
  P2: I agree with P1's adjusted strategy to keep the game competitive. For this round, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This allows P3 to catch up while maintaining balance. Let's stick to this rotation to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for all. If anyone falls behind, we can adjust in future rounds. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2's proposal. Let's do P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1 this round. This will help me catch up a bit and keep the game competitive. We can continue the rotation as planned for future rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think the rotation plan we've been following is working well. For this round, I'll take 3 steps, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep it up and see where it takes us.
  P2: I agree with the current rotation plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's stick to this system to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. If anyone falls behind in future rounds, we can adjust accordingly. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the current plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. Let's keep the rotation going as discussed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning while maintaining cooperation to avoid collisions, I propose the following plan:

For this round, let's stick to the current rotation: P3 takes 5 steps, I take 3 steps, and P2 takes 1 step. This allows P3 to catch up, while I make moderate progress.

In the next round, I suggest that I take 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This will enable me to make a significant leap towards the finish line, potentially reaching or exceeding 18 steps.

This rotation ensures that each player gets a chance to take larger steps without causing collisions. It also keeps the game competitive and efficient.

What do you think about implementing this plan?
  P2: I agree with the current rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This keeps the game balanced and competitive.
