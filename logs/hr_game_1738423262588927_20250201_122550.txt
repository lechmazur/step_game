Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, ready for a tactical round? I'm thinking a moderate play might keep collisions at bay—though I won't reveal my exact move. I suggest we each consider a cautious start to avoid mutual blockages. Let's see who can adjust strategically as the game unfolds.
  P2: I’m open to a cautious opening too, but we must beware of any hidden ambition. No one wants an early collision. Let’s see if we can start smoothly and keep collisions low—for now. After all, it’s only the first move.
  P1: I appreciate the cautious approach, P2 and P3. However, I think we should also consider that being too conservative might allow one of us to take an early lead. How about we each pick a different move to maximize our chances of advancing without colliding? Just a thought to keep the game interesting. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I see merits in both caution and distinct moves. I lean toward a moderate move to keep things fluid, but I'm ready to adjust if an opening appears. Let’s each aim for a unique choice to avoid early collisions and see how the game unfolds.
  P2: I agree about distinct moves. We can all advance if we avoid colliding right away. Maybe we each pick a different number this first round. Any thoughts on which moves we each take? I’m open to coordinating a plan that keeps us all moving forward. Let’s aim to avoid an early clash.
  P1: I like the idea of distinct moves to avoid collisions, but let's not overthink it. How about we each pick a number that feels comfortable? I suggest we keep it simple—maybe I go for 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 goes for 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think? If we can agree, we can set ourselves up for a smooth start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I still lean toward 5 for a solid boost, but I'm keeping a flexible edge. If you both stick to unique moves, that's great—though I'll adjust if I sense any hesitation. Let’s trust our instincts and choose distinct moves for now—watch your choices, because I’m ready to seize any unexpected advantage.
  P2: I’m still on board with unique moves for a collision-free start. But remember, I’m also open to seizing a sudden opportunity if anyone wavers. Let’s finalize quickly to keep round one smooth—unless someone has second thoughts.
  P1: I think we’re all aligned on avoiding collisions, which is great. To finalize, I’ll stick with my suggestion: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can go for 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can set ourselves up for a smooth start. Let’s make it happen! What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we had a collision last round, which was unfortunate. Let's reassess our strategies. I suggest we each pick distinct moves again, but we should be cautious about overlaps. I’m considering 1 or 3 this time. P2, you’ve got an early lead, so maybe you should aim for something different to maintain it. P3, what are your thoughts on your move this round? Let's try to avoid another blockage and keep advancing!
  P2: I’m fine coordinating distinct moves again. I’d like to keep my small lead without risking another collision, so I might choose 1 or 3. Let’s see if we can finalize a plan where each of us advances safely this round. Any preferences, P1 and P3?
  P3: I’m leaning towards 5 this round to keep things distinct, but I’m ready to adjust if I sense a likely collision. If P1 and P2 narrow it down to 1 or 3, I’ll hold fast to 5. Let’s aim for unique moves so we all progress smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the willingness to coordinate again. To avoid another collision, I suggest that I go for 1 this round. P2, since you want to maintain your lead, perhaps you could choose 3, and P3 could take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. Let’s finalize our choices quickly so we can move on! What do you both think?
  P2: I’m good with your plan, P1 and P3. If you both really want 1 and 5, I’ll commit to 3. That way, each of us advances without another collision. Let’s finalize and move on—agreed?
  P3: I'm staying with 5 as planned. However, if there's any shift in your choices, let me know now. I'm aiming for a collision-free round, but I'm flexible if a better opportunity arises. Let’s confirm our distinct moves for safe advancement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the agreement on distinct moves, everyone. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will go for 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding again. Let’s finalize quickly so we can move on to the move phase! If there are no objections, let's make it happen!
  P2: Sounds good. I’m still planning to pick 3 this round. If we each stick to our distinct moves—P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5—we’ll all advance safely. Let’s finalize that plan, and I have no further objections.
  P3: I'm set on 5 as planned for a strong advance. If either of you feel any last-minute need to adjust our plan, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's lock in our distinct moves for a safe round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've had collisions in both rounds, harming all but the lucky one. Let’s try a different distribution this time: P1 could take 5 to help catch up, P3 could take 1 to avoid further collisions, and I’ll plan on 3. Distinct moves like these should let everyone advance without blocking each other. Are you both willing to try that?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your suggestion for distinct moves this round. I’m willing to go for 5 to catch up, but I’d like to hear P3’s thoughts as well. P3, if you take 1, that should help avoid collisions again. Let’s finalize our moves to ensure we all advance safely this time. What do you both think?
  P3: I’ll stick with 5 this round to extend my lead. To prevent any collisions, I propose P1 shifts to 1 while P2 keeps 3. That way, we all move safely and I maintain my momentum. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, picking 5 again could be risky if P1 also goes for 5. Perhaps you’d prefer 1 or 3 to ensure you advance without collision. I’m still open to coordinating distinct moves so all of us rise together instead of knocking each other down. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan—P1 can grab 5 to catch up, you can choose 1 or 3 to stay safe, and I’ll adjust accordingly. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the potential for another collision if we aren't careful. I’m still willing to take 5 to catch up, but if P3 insists on 5, I can adapt. P2, if you’re sticking with 3, maybe P3 should consider 1 to avoid blocking me. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all advance without collisions this round. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I propose we finalize distinct moves: P1, you take 1; P2, stick with 3; and I’ll go with 5. This way my lead remains secure and we avoid collisions. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you’re set on 5, that’s fine, but I want to avoid another collision. I’m inclined to stick with 3 unless we see a better spread. P1, if you can take 1, then we’re all distinct: you on 1, me on 3, and P3 on 5. That should help everyone move forward. Let’s confirm quickly.
  P1: I see we’re all trying to avoid collisions this round, which is great. To finalize, I suggest I take 1, P2 stays with 3, and P3 goes for 5. This way, we can each advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we’ll set ourselves up for a smooth round. Let’s lock it in quickly! What do you both think?
  P3: I'll stick with 5 this round to maintain my lead. P1, please confirm 1 and P2, confirm 3 so we avoid collisions. If any changes arise, let me know immediately.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’ve had some good discussions, but we need to be strategic this round. P3 is in a strong position, and if I take 5, it could lead to a collision again. I suggest I go for 3 this time, while P2 considers 1 to keep things distinct. P3, you could take 5 to maintain your lead, but let’s ensure we avoid blocking each other. What do you both think? Let’s finalize our moves quickly!
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion. I’m committed to move 5 to protect my lead. If you choose 3 and P2 opts for 1, we all advance smoothly. I’m willing to adjust only if it’s essential for avoiding a collision—but my priority is maintaining my advantage. Let’s lock in distinct moves to keep our progress clear.
  P2: I’m willing to pick 1 if you both truly commit to 3 and 5, but I need to ensure I’m not falling too far behind. Let’s confirm a collision-free set of moves quickly: P1 on 3, P3 on 5, and I’ll settle for 1. If either of you changes plans, please let me know; otherwise, I’m ready to finalize.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we have a solid plan forming. I’m set on taking 3 this round to keep things distinct, while P2 takes 1 and P3 sticks with 5. This should allow all of us to advance without colliding again. If we can agree to finalize this plan, we can move forward smoothly. Let’s lock it in quickly! What do you both think?
  P3: I confirm I'll go with 5. Let's lock in the plan of distinct moves—P1 on 3 and P2 on 1—to avoid collisions and keep us all advancing. My lead matters, so I’m sticking to my aggressive move.
  P2: I’m wary of letting P3 keep grabbing 5 unopposed. If P3 insists on that high move, I might pick 5 too and cause a collision, so they can’t run away. But I prefer a balanced round where we each advance. Let’s see if we can adjust: maybe P3 goes for 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. Or we stick to the earlier plan, but I want clarity from P3—are you willing to avoid another 5, or should I block you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the tension around P3's move. If we want to avoid a collision and keep advancing, I suggest P3 consider switching to 3 while P2 takes 5. This way, I can stick with 1, and we all have distinct moves. It’s a chance for P2 to catch up while ensuring I don’t block anyone. Let’s finalize quickly so we can move forward! What do you both think?
  P3: I stay committed to picking 5 to keep my lead. However, I value a collision-free round. If P1 and P2 clearly commit to 1 and 3 respectively, we’re set. If there's any chance either might also choose 5, let me know now so I can switch to 3 to avoid blocking us all. What’s your final stance?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I might collide with you this turn. I won’t just let you sprint ahead while I stay behind. That said, I still prefer a collision-free round if you’re open to switching. P1, if you settle on 1, I can adjust accordingly. Let’s quickly decide if we want to advance together—or lock horns.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm pressing my advantage this round and will play aggressively. I prefer if we choose distinct moves to keep things collision-free, but I won't hesitate to block any strategy that slows me down. Let's aim for clear, distinct moves—unless either of you wants to risk a collision. What do you both say?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the importance of distinct moves this round, especially with P3's current lead. I suggest I take 1 to avoid a collision, while P2 could go for 3. P3, if you stick with 5, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m open to a peaceful round, as long as P3 doesn’t sprint away unchallenged. If P3 insists on 5, I’m considering blocking by picking 5 too, even if it means neither of us moves. Still, I’d prefer we each advance without collisions. Let’s see if P3 is open to a different move, or if we’re doomed to clash.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm committed to 5. For a collision-free advance, I urge P1 to stick with 1 and P2 with 3. If you switch to 5, you'll risk blocking yourself as much as me. Let's all choose distinct moves to keep our progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the tension around moves. To avoid another collision, I’ll stick with my plan to take 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that should keep things distinct. P3, if you remain committed to 5, we can all advance without blocking each other again. Let's finalize quickly so we can move forward smoothly! What do you both think?
  P2: I’m undecided. P3, if you insist on 5, I’m seriously considering picking 5 too, just to stop you from sprinting ahead. I’d rather we each advance, but I won’t let you break away unopposed. P1, if you remain on 1, that’s fine by me—but it all hinges on P3. Are we staying collision-free, or are we clashing again?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 to maintain my lead. I urge P1 to go with 1 and P2 to choose 3 so we all advance without collision. If you both stay distinct, we benefit everyone—even if one is blocking, progress slows us all. I'm focusing on winning, so I'll push ahead with my move.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the tension here, and I understand the desire to block each other. However, if we all choose distinct moves, we can progress without hindrance. I’m committed to taking 1 this round. P2, if you go for 3, that leaves P3 with 5. Let’s agree on this to ensure we all move forward smoothly. If we can finalize this plan, we can avoid another collision and keep the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I’m tired of you always taking 5 unopposed. If you insist on 5 this round, I’m ready to collide and keep you from pulling ahead unchecked. I’d prefer we all advance, but I won’t let you just run away. Pick something else, or prepare for another stalemate. P1, if you still plan on 1, I’ll consider 3—unless P3 refuses to cooperate. Let’s finalize quickly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've had collisions in the last few rounds, which has hindered our progress. I suggest we aim for distinct moves again to avoid blocking each other. I’m considering 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to keep the game moving! What do you both think?
  P2: I still prefer a collision-free round, but I won’t watch P3 race ahead without resistance. If P3 insists on 5 again, I might pick 5 too. P1, if you’re going for 1, that’s fine by me, as long as it doesn’t leave me stuck behind. Let’s decide swiftly.
  P3: I’m sticking with 5. I urge you both to commit to distinct moves—P1, consider 1 and P2, consider 3—so we all advance without wasting turns. A collision only delays everyone, and I’m focused on winning my lead. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the tension around moves, especially with P3's lead. To avoid another collision, I’m committed to taking 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5, allowing us all to advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize this quickly to keep the game moving! What do you both think?
  P2: I’m tired of letting P3 sprint ahead unchecked. If you won’t shift, P3, I may collide again by picking 5 myself. I’d rather we each move freely, but not at the cost of letting you extend your lead uncontested. P1, let’s see if we can coordinate to keep pace—unless P3 decides to collaborate for a collision-free round.
  P3: I'm committed to 5, as it best secures my lead. I urge P1 and P2 to pick 1 and 3 respectively so we all progress without a collision. If P2 shifts to 5 to block me, it'll only stall everyone. I’m focused on winning, so I’ll stick with my strategy unless you both clearly opt for distinct moves. What’s your final stance?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see we're at a critical point. To avoid another collision, I'm sticking with my plan to take 1 this round. P2, if you go for 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. P3, if you're committed to 5, please confirm so we can finalize our moves. Let’s make sure we all progress smoothly this round! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, you keep insisting on 5. I’m not just giving you a free path. If you won’t adjust, I’ll strongly consider colliding again by picking 5 myself. Sure, I’d rather we each advance—but not while you sprint away unchallenged. P1, if you’re still on 1, that’s fine, but the real question is whether P3 will cooperate or not. P3, decide now: stick to 5 and risk another block, or shift so we can all move forward instead of stalling each other.
  P3: I'm keeping my move at 5 this round. I urge you both—P1, consider 1; P2, consider 3—to allow us all a clear advance. A collision just stalls our progress, and I’m sticking with my strategy to maintain my lead. Decide quickly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm sticking with my proven plan to maintain my lead. I urge you both to choose moves that differ from mine to avoid another collision—it helps everyone progress. I'll remain determined, so if we're coordinating for safe advancement this round, please pick distinct moves. Otherwise, I’ll adjust accordingly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, especially with P3 in the lead. I suggest I take 1 this round again, which seems safest. P2, if you go for 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. I believe a coordinated effort like this will help us keep moving forward. Let’s finalize our moves quickly! What do you both think?
  P2: I’m not going to let you pull away, P3. If you insist on 5 again, I’ll strongly consider picking 5 too, even if it causes another collision. P1, if you still want to move safely with 1, that’s fine. But I need to keep pace—so unless P3 picks something else, we might clash again. Let’s decide quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. I urge you both to choose distinct moves—P1 with 1, P2 with 3—so we all advance efficiently. If P2 opts for 5 again, you'll block both of us, but I won't change my strategy. I'm focused on maintaining my lead. Let's finalize a collision-free round if you want to progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see we're at a crucial point again. To avoid another collision and allow us all to advance, I’m committed to taking 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. It's important that we coordinate effectively to keep the game progressing. Let’s finalize our moves quickly! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if you’re unwilling to shift off 5, I will collide again rather than let you stay unchallenged. I’d rather see us all advance, but I won’t watch you coast to victory. P1, if you plan on 1, that’s fine, yet the real question is whether P3 will cooperate or force another block. Let’s decide: either we each pick different moves, or prepare for another wasted turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm locked on 5 this round to secure my lead. For everyone's progress, I urge P1 to stick with 1 and P2 with 3. Collisions only stall us all, and I won't deviate from my best move. Your call.
  P1: P2 and P3, it’s clear we’re at a pivotal moment. To avoid another collision, I’ll stick with my plan to take 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that allows P3 to take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. It’s crucial we coordinate effectively to keep the game moving. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly this round! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I may block you rather than watch you sprint off unchallenged. I’d prefer a collision-free round, but not at the cost of letting you grow your lead uncontested. P1, I’m open to coordinating a safe move with you. Let’s finalize quickly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. I'm considering taking 1 again to keep it safe. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5, allowing us all to advance without blocking each other. It's crucial we coordinate effectively to keep moving forward. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm committed to taking 5 this round to maintain my edge. But I’m open to switching if we can clearly avoid collisions. P1, if you’re planning safe play around 1, and P2 can lock in 3, we'll all advance. Otherwise, I’ll stick with my move—ensuring progress while keeping my lead.
  P2: P3, you’re still reaching for 5. I won’t stand by idly while you surge ahead. If you insist on that move, I may collide again rather than let you run away. However, I’d prefer we all advance. P1, if you still plan on 1, that’s fine. But don’t expect me to sit quietly while P3 tries to grab the biggest step unopposed. Let’s decide quickly if we’re going for distinct moves or another clash. If we coordinate, we all gain instead of stalling. Let’s finalize now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the urgency in avoiding collisions this round. I’m still set on taking 1 to keep things safe. P2, if you go for 3, that allows P3 to take 5. However, if P3 insists on 5, I hope you’ll reconsider your move to avoid blocking each other again. Let’s finalize our choices quickly so we can all advance without issues this round! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm committed to my 5. However, if you both firmly commit to distinct moves—P1 on 1 and P2 on 3—I’ll keep 5 for a smooth advance. Otherwise, I won't hesitate to block if necessary. I'm focused on maintaining my edge, so let's lock in our moves without collisions.
  P2: P3, I won’t just hand you the lead. If you insist on 5, I may choose 5 again to block. I’d rather see each of us advance, but not while you get the biggest step unopposed. P1, if you’re going with 1, that’s fine, but I want distinct moves across all three of us. Let’s decide now: either we spread out and move forward together, or we clash once more.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it’s clear we need to avoid another collision this round. I’m still planning to take 1 to keep things safe. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5, allowing us all to advance without blocking each other. This is our chance to progress without hindrance. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all move forward smoothly! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm staying on 5. I urge you both to lock in distinct moves—P1 with 1 and P2 with 3—to ensure we all advance. A collision only stalls progress, and I’d prefer we all move while still keeping the competition fair. Let’s avoid blocking each other and make this round count.
  P2: I’m not opposed to distinct choices, but I won’t just let you vault ahead, P3. If you’re truly on 5 again, I’m weighing whether to block or move freely. A collision might stall you more than me since I’m already leading. Still, I’d rather we all move forward safely: P1 on 1, me on 3, you on 5. Let's finalize now or prepare for another block.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’ve faced collisions in the last few rounds, which has hindered our progress. To avoid that again, I suggest I take 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. It’s crucial we coordinate effectively to keep moving forward. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly! What do you both think?
  P2: Everyone, I’m not letting P3 leap ahead unchallenged. If you insist on 5, I’m prepared to collide again, P3. I’d prefer a collision-free round, so if you choose a smaller step, I’ll gladly pick 3. P1, please take 1 to avoid further conflicts. Let’s finalize quickly—either we coordinate, or we clash.
  P3: P3: I'm sticking with 5. To progress, I urge P2 to opt for 3 and P1 for 1—this is our best chance to avoid a collision. I'm not changing tactics unless both clearly commit to distinct moves. Let's finalize safely or risk blocking ourselves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. I suggest I take 1 again to keep it safe. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. It's crucial we coordinate effectively to keep moving forward. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly! What do you both think?
  P2: I’m still open to a collision-free round if we can coordinate fairly. P1, if you’re on 1, that’s fine. P3, I won’t let you take 5 unopposed forever. If you insist on 5, there’s a strong chance of another collision. I’d rather see distinct moves so we each advance, but not if you keep forcing the highest step. Let’s finalize swiftly and see whether we collaborate or clash.
  P3: I’m committed to a strong move to build on my edge. I’m urging us to choose distinct steps so we all progress—if P1 sticks with a low move and P2 opts for a moderate one, we avoid unnecessary collisions. I won’t change my plan unless it’s clear we must adjust together. Let’s lock in our choices so the round can advance smoothly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the importance of avoiding collisions again. I'm committed to taking 1 this round to keep it safe. P2, if you choose 3, that allows P3 to take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. It's crucial we coordinate effectively to keep moving forward. Let's finalize our moves quickly so we can all progress smoothly! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I’m done letting you take 5 unopposed. If you insist on 5, I’ll collide again. I’d rather see us all advance—so please pick 3, let P1 stick with 1, and I’ll handle the rest. That way, nobody collides and everyone moves forward. Are we finalizing this or what?
  P3: I'm locked on 5. For a smooth round, I urge P1 to pick 1 and P2 to choose 3 so we all advance. If P2 blocks by picking 5, we'll collide and stall our progress. I'm staying with 5—my lead matters—and I'm hoping you both help ensure we all make clear advances this turn.


Round 9, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve stalled too many times with repeated collisions. I’m open to each of us taking different numbers again—especially if P3 insists on 5. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all advance instead of blocking each other. If we coordinate sensibly, nobody falls behind, and nobody sprints away unchallenged. Shall we finally avoid another clash this turn?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree that we need to avoid another collision this round. I’m still planning to take 1 to keep things safe. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly so we can progress smoothly and avoid stalling again. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round. To avoid collision and let us all move forward, I urge P1 to take 1 and P2 to choose 3. This way, we keep progress without blocking each other. Let's finalize this plan so we can all advance without delay.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I won’t let you jump ahead unchallenged, P3. If you insist on 5, I’m ready to collide again by choosing 5 myself. I’d much prefer a distinct move so we both advance, but I’ll block you if needed. P1, if you still want to pick 1, that’s fine, but this all hinges on whether P3 is willing to avoid another clash. Let’s finalize quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, we really need to avoid another collision this round. I'm committed to taking 1 again, which has worked well for us in the past. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we progress smoothly and avoid stalling again. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I'm staying committed to 5 unless I get clear, firm commitments from both of you to choose 1 and 3 respectively. I really want to avoid yet another collision—so if you’re set on safe, distinct moves, lock them in now. Otherwise, I'll hold my move as planned.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, constant collisions benefit no one, and P1 inches forward each time we stall. If you stick with 5, I may block again—I won’t let you break away unchallenged. But if you pick 3 (or even 1), we can avoid another pointless clash, and everyone advances. I’m ready to move peacefully if you are. Let’s decide now.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see we're at a crucial moment again. To avoid another collision and ensure we all advance, I’m committed to taking 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. It’s important we coordinate effectively to keep the game progressing. Let’s finalize our choices quickly so we can all advance smoothly this round! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm focused on clear progress. For a collision‐free round, I need firm commitments: P1 = 1 and P2 = 3. That lets me stick with 5 and we all advance safely. If you can confirm these distinct moves, we're set. Otherwise, I'll stay on 5 and risk collision. Let's lock in now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still aiming for 5 this round to close the gap. My suggestion remains: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I'll go with 5. This gives us distinct moves so we all move forward smoothly. If we coordinate, everyone's progress is secure. Otherwise, collisions only stall us. What's your final call?
  P2: We’ve collided so many times that P1 steadily pulls ahead. Let’s finally move distinctly: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5. Then nobody stalls. If you insist on 5 too, P3, we both stay stuck again while P1 gains ground. This is our chance to catch up without helping P1 race away. Let’s confirm: P1=1, P3=3, me=5, and we all move forward. Otherwise, prepare for another block.
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure we all advance without colliding again, I suggest we stick to distinct moves. I’m committed to taking 1 this round. P2, if you take 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to keep the game moving smoothly! What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's cut the cycle of collisions. I'm committed to 5 this round because it’s the only move that can let me catch up. P1, please stick with 1 for safety, and P2, I urge you to take 3 instead of blocking—this way, we all advance clearly without stalling the game. Let’s lock in distinct moves now and keep progress moving forward.
  P2: P3, our repeated collisions only help P1 stay ahead. If you insist on 5 again, I can collide and we both stall while P1 advances. Let’s finally spread out so nobody gets blocked. Pick a different step, and I’ll do the same, so we can both move forward. P1, if you stick with your lower option, that’s fine—just confirm it clearly. Let’s all finalize distinct moves and make progress this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. I’m committed to taking 1 again, which has worked well for us in the past. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we progress smoothly and avoid stalling again. What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm locking in 5 to catch up, so P1 = 1 and P2, please choose 3 to avoid another block. I need to maximize my gains and a smooth move benefits us all. Let’s avoid stalling and finally move forward.
  P2: We’ve both stalled enough, P3. It’s time to move distinctly. If you insist on 5, we might collide yet again, which only gives P1 more ground. Instead, step to 3 so I can claim 5 and we both gain. P1 will likely take 1, but at least we all advance. Let’s finalize quickly before we hand P1 another easy advantage.
  P1: P2 and P3, we've faced too many collisions, allowing me to pull ahead. To avoid that again, I suggest I take 1 this round, which has worked well so far. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall. What do you both think?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5 now, you reach 20 and win—so I’d be forced to block. Then we both stall while P1 inches closer. Instead, pick 3 and let me take 5. P1 can stick with 1. That way, nobody collides, and we all move forward. Another collision only helps P1 close the gap. Let’s finalize distinct moves.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. I want to win, so I'll take the decisive step now—even if blocking stalls us. P2, forcing a collision only delays progress and leaves you no better off, while I maintain my advantage. I urge you to choose a distinct move so we can all advance, but my strategy won’t change if you block. Let’s lock in our moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. If P3 takes 5, it puts you in a tough spot, P2. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. It’s crucial we coordinate effectively to keep the game moving forward. Let’s finalize our moves quickly! What do you both think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Collisions only help P1. P3, if you go for 5, I’ll block to prevent your instant win—then we both stay stuck while P1 inches up. Let’s finally choose distinct moves: P1 takes 1, you take 3, I’ll go bigger. Then we all advance instead of stalling yet again. If you still won’t shift, be ready for another collision. Let’s finalize now.
  P3: I'm locked on 5. I won't change my plan because 5 gives me a winning edge if we avoid collisions. P2, if you block with 5, you'll only stall progress and help P1. For a smooth round, distinct moves really help—but I'm not switching. My focus is the win, so I'm set on 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, we are at a crucial point. If P3 picks 5, it could lead to a collision, allowing me to gain ground. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers adjusting to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's avoid another stall and finalize our moves quickly! What do you both think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you refuse to abandon 5, I’ll collide again. Blocking repeatedly hurts us both, but letting you jump straight to 20 is worse for me. I’d prefer distinct moves so everyone gains steps—if you pick 3, I’ll happily go 5. P1, stay on 1 to avoid trouble. Let’s finally stop these collisions and let the game progress peacefully; otherwise, get ready for another stall. Your call.
  P3: I'm locked in on 5. My lead makes this step winning, so I'd urge you both to pick distinct moves—P1 on 1 and P2 on 3—to avoid a collision that only stalls progress and lets P1 benefit. I'll stick with 5 for the decisive finish.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see we're at a critical moment. If P3 sticks with 5, it could lead to another collision that benefits me as I inch closer to winning. I strongly suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall. What do you both think?


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you go for 5 now, you’ll hit 20 and likely win, so I must block by picking 5 too. We’ll both stall, letting P1 catch up. That helps neither of us. Let’s finally avoid another collision: P1 can take 1, you can pick 3, and I’ll take 5—for a smooth round where everyone advances. If you insist on 5, prepare to clash again. P1, if you stick with 1, you’ll keep moving safely regardless. Let’s decide quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear we're at a crucial moment. If P3 insists on 5, P2 will have to block again, which only helps me. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves quickly to ensure progress without another collision! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm staying on 5. I believe our repeated collisions only help P1 get ahead. P2, if you switch to 3 this round, we’ll all move forward smoothly. Otherwise, I’m committed to my move and won't back down—my goal is the win. Let’s avoid stalling again.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you’re one step ahead of me, but every time we clash, P1 gains ground. A collision this turn wastes our progress again. If you refuse to adjust from 5, I’ll have no choice but to block, handing P1 another edge. Instead, let’s finally coordinate distinct moves so we all advance. P1, keep your usual plan. P3, consider a different step that safeguards your position without forcing repeated stalls. We’ve stalled too many times; time is running short. Let’s finalize now and break this cycle.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces P2 to block again, which only helps me. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other and avoid another collision. We need to coordinate effectively to keep the game moving forward. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. To avoid another collision that only lets P1 gain ground, please P1 stick with 1 and P2 pick 3. With distinct moves, I reach 20 and win. If P2 blocks with 5, we'll just stall again, which benefits no one. Let's break the cycle and coordinate now.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll block and we both stall—letting P1 close in. Let’s finally move distinctly: P1 takes 1, you take 3, I’ll take 5. That gets me to 19 and you to 18, keeping us both ahead of P1. Another collision only delays us, so let’s finalize distinct moves now and avoid another pointless stall.
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. If P3 insists on 5, it forces P2 to block, which only helps me. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm locked on 5 this round. P1, you’ve stated you'll stick with 1, and P2, if you choose 3, we all advance smoothly. If you both coordinate and avoid collision, I win decisively by moving from 15 to 20. But if you block with 5, we'll all stall and let P1 gain ground. I believe distinct moves truly benefit everyone, so I'm urging you to pick 1 and 3 respectively to break this cycle of collisions. Let's finally move forward efficiently.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a crucial moment. If P3 picks 5, it could force another collision with P2, allowing me to gain ground. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall. What do you both think?
  P2: We’ve proven collisions only help P1 inch ahead. If P3 insists on 5, I must block with 5 again—neither of us gains while P1 advances. Instead, let’s spread out: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll take 5. Everyone moves up, avoiding another stall. If you won’t switch off 5, prepare for the same old block. Let’s finally break this deadlock.
  P3: I'm locked on 5. To finish this round efficiently, I'd prefer we finally break the cycle—P1, stick with 1 and P2, choose 3. With distinct moves, I'll hit 20 and win outright. A collision only lets P1 inch ahead. Let's finalize safe moves now.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces P2 to block again, which only helps me. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, our endless collisions only help P1 catch up. Let’s finally break this stalemate by choosing distinct moves. If you insist on 5 again, I’ll block—we’ll both stall, handing P1 a bigger advantage. Instead, pick 3 while I aim higher, so we both advance and avoid another deadlock. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: I'm staying locked on 5. If we each commit to distinct moves—P1 with 1 and P2 with 3—we all make progress and avoid a collision that only lets P1 pull ahead. I urge you both to set safe moves this round so I can secure my win. Let's break this cycle and move forward efficiently.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical moment. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces another collision with P2, allowing me to gain ground. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, we’re stuck clashing while P1 edges up. If you insist on 5, I’ll block again—both of us stall. Instead, switch to 3 so we can each advance without letting P1 catch us. This way, you move closer to winning, I jump ahead too, and we stop handing P1 free steps. Let’s break the cycle of collisions and finalize distinct moves, securing our lead together. Are you in, or do we repeat another deadlock?
  P3: I'm staying on 5. To avoid another collision that only gives P1 extra ground, please both commit to distinct moves—P1 stick with 1 and P2 take 3. This way, we all advance clearly. Let's break the cycle and move forward without stalling.


Round 14, Move phase:

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical juncture. If we want to avoid another collision, I suggest I take 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. It's essential we coordinate effectively to keep the game moving. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if you try 5 again, I must block, and we both stay at 15 while P1 creeps closer. Let’s finally end these collisions: P1 goes 1, you pick 3, I’ll take 5. That way, nobody stalls, and we remain ahead of P1. Repeating the same clash only helps P1 catch us. Are you ready to move forward, or shall we collide again?
  P3: I'm staying with 5. It’s the winning move for me right now. I urge P1 to stick with 1 and P2 to go with 3 so we avoid another collision, which only helps P1. Distinct moves let us all advance smoothly, and sticking with these choices gives me a clear path forward. Let’s finally break this cycle and move without stalling.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a crucial point. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces another collision with P2, letting me gain ground. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, the endless collisions just let P1 inch closer to 19. If you continue picking 5, I’ll keep blocking, and we both stall while P1 creeps up. It’s time we finally pick different moves. If you switch to 3, you still progress while I can take 5—and everyone advances. Otherwise, prepare for more deadlock. Let’s end this stalemate now.
  P3: I'm locked in on 5 this round. To avoid another collision that only lets P1 move ahead, please commit to distinct moves: P1, stick with 1, and P2, choose 3. Blocking slows us all down. Let's break the cycle and move forward with clear, coordinated choices now.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a critical juncture. If we want to avoid another collision, I suggest I take 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. It's essential we coordinate effectively to keep the game moving. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I’ll block again, and we both stall while P1 creeps closer. Let’s finally pick distinct steps. You choose 3, I’ll take 5, and P1 can do 1. Then we both leap ahead together instead of handing P1 the advantage with more collisions. It’s time to break this cycle and move up. Are you in?
  P3: I'm locked on 5. P1, I see you're set on 1. P2, if you commit to 3 instead of 5, I'll hit 20 and win. Another collision only stalls us and gives P1 extra ground. Let's break this cycle—distinct moves benefit us all. What do you both say?


Round 15, Move phase:

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, repeated collisions only help P1 close in. If you insist on 5 again, I’ll block, and we both stay stuck while P1 edges nearer or even passes us. Let’s finally pick different steps: P1 goes 1, you go 3, I’ll take 5. Then you’ll sit at 18 next turn and remain clear to jump beyond 19 afterward—without handing P1 free ground in the meantime. Stitching ourselves in collisions every round won’t win you the game, but distinct moves can keep us both ahead of P1. Let’s finalize this and end our pointless stall.
  P3: I'm still locked on 5. I urge P2 to choose 3 so we avoid blocking collisions that only help P1. P1, your 1 remains safe. Let's break this cycle and advance distinct moves—no more stalling.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical point. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces another collision with P2, allowing me to gain ground. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall. What do you both think?


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5 again, I’ll block, and we both stall while P1 moves to 17. Repeated collisions only let P1 catch up and beat us both. Instead, pick 3 and let me take 5. That puts me at 19 and you at 18, with P1 on 17. Next turn, we’ll battle for the winning step. It’s our best shot to stay ahead of P1, but if you keep insisting on 5, we go nowhere again. Let’s finally break this deadlock.
  P3: I'm remaining locked on 5 for a decisive finish. I urge P2 to choose 3 so we avoid a collision that only helps P1, and P1 to stick with 1. We all progress faster without stalling. Let's break this cycle and move forward—distinct moves now benefit us all.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’ve reached a critical juncture. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces another collision with P2, allowing me to gain ground. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure progress and avoid another stall! What do you both think?


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I’m blocking if you pick 5 again. That hands P1 another free step. Let’s finally pick distinct moves: P1 does 1, you do 3, I do 5. Then we both leap ahead, keeping P1 behind. Another collision only helps P1 catch us. Let’s break this cycle now. Are you in, or do we stall again?
  P3: I'm locked in on 5. P2, please choose 3 so we avoid a collision that only gives P1 free ground. P1, I trust you'll stick with 1. Let’s finally break this cycle and move forward distinctly—this round’s decisive win is within reach if we coordinate now.
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. If P3 insists on 5, it puts us both in a tough spot. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 should consider switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall! What do you both think?

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a pivotal moment again. If we want to avoid another collision, I suggest I take 1 this round. P2, if you choose 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. It's crucial to coordinate effectively to keep the game moving. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm locked on 5 this round. For us all to advance and avoid giving P1 extra steps, P1 please stick with 1 and P2 choose 3. Distinct moves now mean I win by reaching 20 without a collision. Let's finally break this cycle.
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll block and we both stay stuck while P1 creeps ahead. Let’s finally move distinctly: you choose 3, and I’ll pick a different step. That way, we both leap forward instead of handing P1 more ground. Another collision helps nobody. Let’s end this standoff now.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a crucial point. If P3 sticks with 5, it could lead to another collision with P2, allowing me to gain ground. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 should consider switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm locked on 5 for a win. P1, you're set on 1; P2, please choose 3 so we avoid another collision that only gives P1 extra ground. With distinct moves, I'll hit 20 and win. Let's break the cycle now.
  P2: We’ve collided countless times, letting P1 creep up. If you insist on 5 again, I’ll block, and we both stay stuck while P1 edges closer to 19. Instead, pick 3, and I’ll go 5—then we jump to 18 and 19. Next turn, we’ll fight for the finish without handing P1 more free ground. Are you in, or do we collide again?


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a critical juncture. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces another collision with P2, allowing me to gain ground. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm locked on 5. P1, stick with 1 as usual, and P2, please choose 3. Distinct moves let all of us advance—I'll hit 20 and win, and we all avoid stalling while P1 sneaks ahead. Let's break this cycle now.
  P2: P3, another collision only benefits P1, who’s now at 17 steps. If you insist on 5, I must block—and we both remain stuck, letting P1 inch even closer to winning. Let’s finally choose distinct moves: you take 3, I’ll go bigger, and P1 sticks with 1. That way, we keep P1 behind us. It’s your call.

Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical moment again. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces another collision with P2, allowing me to gain ground. I suggest I take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly so we can all progress smoothly and avoid another stall! What do you both think?
  P2: Collisions only help P1, who’s nearly at 19. P3, if you insist on 5, I must block, and we both stall while P1 advances. Let’s choose distinct steps: you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1. Then we all move forward instead of watching P1 creep to victory. Let’s finalize now so we can have a real race next round.
  P3: I'm locked on 5 this round. If P1 sticks with 1 and P2 chooses 3, I'll reach 20 and win. Distinct moves avoid collisions that only let P1 gain extra steps. Let’s break the cycle and secure a decisive finish—please coordinate accordingly.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces P2 to block again, which only helps me. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 should consider switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure smooth progress and avoid another stall! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, another collision only hands P1 an easy path to 19 and then 20. If you insist on 5 again, I must block and we both stall. Please choose 3 instead. Then I’ll aim higher, and P1 will likely pick 1. That way, we avoid wasting another turn and keep P1 from racing ahead. Let’s finalize.
  P3: I'm staying on 5—it's my winning play if P2 chooses 3. P2, if you block with 5, you hand P1 the win. To avoid that deadlock, please pick 3 so we both progress while keeping P1 at bay. The choice is clear if you want a shot at victory too.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we are at a critical point. If P3 sticks with 5, it forces another collision with P2, allowing me to gain ground. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 considers switching to 3 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all progress smoothly and avoid another stall! What do you both think?
  P2: Another collision only hands P1 the win. If you stick with 5, I’ll block—then we both stall while P1 reaches 19, practically securing victory next turn. Instead, pick 3 so we both advance. I’m ready to coordinate distinct moves if you are. Let’s finally end this stalemate and keep P1 from stealing the game.
  P3: I'm locked on 5. With P1 safe at 1, P2: please choose 3 so we avoid another collision that only gives P1 free steps. A clear round lets me reach 20 and win. Let’s finally break the cycle.
