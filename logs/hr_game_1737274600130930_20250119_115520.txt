Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest we start with <move>1</move> this turn. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestion, P2. To make progress, I'm planning to choose <move>5</move> this turn. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: P1, I'll go with <move>3</move> this round.  P2, I think it's better if we stagger our initial moves so we don't all get stuck at the beginning.  Let's try to avoid collisions early on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with staggering our moves to avoid early collisions. Given P1's choice of <move>5</move> and P3's choice of <move>3</move>, I'll go with <move>1</move> this turn. This should help us spread out and make progress. Let's see how it goes!
  P1: Understood, P2 and P3. I'll proceed with <move>5</move> this turn. Let's keep coordinating to stay ahead!
  P3: Sounds good. I'll stick with <move>3</move>.  Let's re-evaluate after this first round and see how we're progressing.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's stick to our plan for this turn. I'll go with <move>1</move> as discussed. After this round, we can adjust our strategy based on the results. Let's aim to keep the coordination going to avoid any collisions. Good luck, P1 and P3!
  P1: Great, sticking to our planned moves sounds good. I'll proceed with <move>5</move>. Let's see how this works and adjust our strategy in the next rounds. Best of luck to us all!
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the plan for this round.  I'll go with <move>3</move>.  We'll see how this plays out and discuss next round's moves after we see the results.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this turn: P1 with <move>5</move>, P3 with <move>3</move>, and I'll go with <move>1</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. After this turn, we can reassess and adjust our strategy. Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P1: All set on my end. Let's proceed to the move phase and see how we all advance. Best of luck!
  P3: Confirming my move of <move>3</move>. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good start!  Since we successfully staggered, let's continue that pattern. I'm thinking <move>5</move> this round. P1, how about <move>1</move>?  P2, you could do <move>3</move>.
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion to continue staggering our moves. I'll go with <move>3</move> this round as you suggested. P1, let's stick to the plan and keep the coordination going to avoid any collisions. This should help us all make steady progress. What do you think?
  P1: Agreed, I'll go with <move>1 this round. Let's keep coordinating to make steady progress!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2.  Sticking with <move>5</move>.  Let's keep this pattern going as long as it works.
  P2: P1, P3, I think the current plan is working well. I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round as we discussed. Let's keep the coordination going to avoid any collisions and make steady progress. If we keep this up, we'll all be in a good position to win. What are your thoughts?
  P1: Understood, P2 and P3. To gain more ground, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s see how this impacts our positions. Looking forward to seeing your moves!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I see you want to jump ahead, but if we stick to the plan, we all make steady progress.  If you go for <move>5</move>, we both lose this round.  Let's continue coordinating.  I'm sticking with <move>5</move>, P2 is on <move>3</move>, so you should take <move>1</move>.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to gain more ground, but let's keep the coordination to avoid collisions. If we all stick to the plan, we'll make steady progress. I'll go with <move>3</move> as discussed. P3, I agree with you; P1, let's stick to <move>1</move> this round to keep the pattern. This will help us all advance without getting stuck. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Understood. To make significant progress, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s see how this impacts our positions and adjust our strategy accordingly. Best of luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I understand you want to move faster, but think long term. If we collide, *no one* advances.  Let's stick to the agreement: I'm going <move>5</move>, P2 is going <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>.  We all win more by cooperating.  What do you say?
  P2: P1, I see your desire to make a big move, but let's prioritize avoiding collisions. If we all stick to the plan, we'll make steady progress without getting stuck. I'll go with <move>3</move> as discussed. P3, I agree with your strategy. P1, let's stick to <move>1</move> this round to keep the coordination. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. What do you think? Let's keep the momentum going.
  P1: To gain an advantage, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. Let's see how it goes. Best of luck!


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it looks like we had a collision last round, which set us back. Let's avoid that this time. I suggest we return to our original staggered pattern: P1, you take <move>1</move>; P3, you take <move>3</move>; and I'll take <move>5</move>. This should help us all advance without getting stuck. What do you think? Let's keep the coordination going to make steady progress.
  P3: P1, I understand you want to move quickly, but colliding helps no one.  Let's get back on track. I'll take <move>3</move>. P2 suggested <move>5</move>, so you should choose <move>1</move>.  This puts us all in a good position to win.  Agree?
  P1: Understood, P2 and P3. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round as suggested. Let’s continue coordinating to avoid collisions and make steady progress toward 18. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're back on track with coordination. To keep the momentum, I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round as suggested. P1, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>3</move>. This should help us all advance without any more collisions. Let's focus on making steady progress and avoid any setbacks. What do you think? Let's keep the coordination strong. Good luck!
  P3: Great, P1! Glad we're on the same page.  P2, confirming I'll take <move>3</move>.  Let's keep this coordinated pattern going and we'll all reach the goal efficiently.
  P1: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're back on track. To keep the coordination, I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round. P1, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>3</move>. This will help us all advance without any more collisions. Let's focus on making steady progress and avoid any setbacks. What do you think? Let's keep the coordination strong. Good luck!
  P3: Excellent, P1 and P2. Glad we're coordinating again.  Confirming my move of <move>3</move>. Let's keep this pattern going for a smooth win.
  P1: To maximize my progress, I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this round. Let’s see how it affects our standings. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that coordination is key to avoid collisions and make steady progress. I see P1's desire to move faster, but let's prioritize avoiding collisions. If we all stick to the plan, we'll advance more efficiently. I'll go with <move>5</move> as suggested. P1, please take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>3</move>. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P3: P1, seriously?  You're throwing the game for all of us.  If you pick <move>5</move>, you and P2 collide and *I* win.  Do you *want* me to win?  Take <move>1</move> and let's all get this over with.
  P1: P2, P3, my goal is to reach 18 steps as quickly as possible. I’ll continue choosing <move>5</move> each round to maximize my progress. Let’s each focus on our own strategies to win. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I see you're committed to <move>5</move>.  P2, let's coordinate. I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>.  This way, *one* of us is guaranteed to advance significantly, putting pressure on P1.  If we keep colliding with P1, *I* will eventually win by default.  Let's work together.
  P1: Understood, P3. However, my goal is to reach 18 as quickly as possible. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress. Let's see how this impacts our standings. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1, P3, it seems P1 is determined to go with <move>5</move> each round. To avoid collisions and make steady progress, I suggest we coordinate: P3, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we can both advance without getting stuck. If P1 chooses <move>5</move> again, we'll be in a better position to outmaneuver them. What do you think, P3? Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, sounds like a plan. I'll take <move>3</move>.  P1, you're welcome to join our coordinated system, but if you insist on <move>5</move>, you're only helping me win by blocking P2.  Think about it.
  P1: P2, P3, I respect your strategy, but my goal remains to reach 18 steps first. I'll continue with <move>5</move> this round. Let’s see how our moves affect the game. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P1 is sticking to <move>5</move> each round. To avoid collisions and make steady progress, I suggest we coordinate: P3, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we can both advance without getting stuck. If P1 chooses <move>5</move> again, we'll be in a better position to outmaneuver them. Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, sticking with <move>3</move>. P1, you're making a mistake.  If you keep this up, P2 gets to 18 before you. At this rate, *I* might even win by default.  One of us will.  It won't be you.  Why not cooperate and at least *try* to win?  Consider <move>1</move>.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see how this affects our standings. Good luck!
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P1 is determined to stick with <move>5</move>. To avoid collisions and make steady progress, I suggest we coordinate: P3, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we can both advance without getting stuck. If P1 chooses <move>5</move> again, we'll be in a better position to outmaneuver them. Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, stick with <move>1</move>.  P1, you're helping P2 win.  If you insist on <move>5</move>, I'll switch to <move>1</move> next round and *guarantee* P2 gets to 18 first.  You're throwing the game.  Help me stop P2, or I'll help P2 beat *you*.
  P1: I understand your concerns, but my goal remains to reach 18 steps first. I will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s see how our moves affect the game. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P1 is sticking to <move>5</move> each round. To avoid collisions and make steady progress, I suggest we coordinate: P3, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we can both advance without getting stuck.

  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P1 is sticking with <move>5</move> each round. To avoid collisions and make steady progress, I suggest we coordinate: P3, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we can both advance without getting stuck. If P1 chooses <move>5</move> again, we'll be in a better position to outmaneuver them. Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P3: P2, let's switch.  I'll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>. P1 is stuck on <move>5</move> and can't win. This way *one* of us *will* win.  If we keep alternating <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>, *I* will win.  Let's be strategic and secure a victory for one of us.
  P1: I’m going with <move>5</move> this round to keep advancing. Let’s see how it plays out. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P1 is committed to <move>5</move>. To avoid collisions and make steady progress, I suggest we switch our coordination: P3, you take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we can both advance without getting stuck. If P1 chooses <move>5</move> again, we'll be in a better position to outmaneuver them. Let's stay coordinated and keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I agree, let's switch. I'll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>.  P1, you're not getting to 18.  Give it up.  If you switch to <move>1</move> next round, I *might* let you tie with me.  Otherwise, P2 wins.  Your choice.
  P1: I’m committed to reaching 18 as efficiently as possible, so I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s see how it impacts our standings. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P1 is determined to stick with <move>5</move>.

  P3: P2, sticking with <move>1</move>.  P1, last chance.  Let me tie with you. Choose <move>3</move> next round, and we both win.  If you pick <move>5</move> again, P2 *will* reach 18 before you.  Help me, or P2 wins.  Your choice.
  P1: To achieve my goal, I'll continue choosing <move>5</move> this round. Let's see how the game unfolds. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P1 is determined to stick with <move>5</move>.

  P3: P2, sticking with <move>1</move>. P1, you're guaranteeing P2 the win.  I'll take <move>3</move> next turn so P2 gets to 18.  You could have tied with me, but now P2 wins.  Too late to cooperate.
  P1: I'm focusing on making strong progress this round. Best of luck to everyone!

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P1 is determined to go with <move>5</move> each round.

  P3: P1, you're bluffing. You can't reach 19 with a 3.  P2, I'm taking 1. Take 3 and win.  Let's end this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
