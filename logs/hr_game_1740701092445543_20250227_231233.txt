Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone! Let's avoid collisions early on to make sure we all progress. I'll choose either 1 or 3 this round, so please keep that in mind.
  P3: Sounds good, P1. I'm planning to go for 5 this round. Let's see if we can spread out.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination. Since P1 is going for 1 or 3, and P3 plans on 5, I'll take whichever number P1 doesn't choose between 1 and 3. This way we can all advance without collision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, that works perfectly for me, P2. I'll commit clearly to number 3. Let's all stick to our plan and move forward smoothly.
  P3: Sounds like a solid plan so far. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since our coordination worked well last round, I suggest we maintain a similar approach. P3 is ahead at 5 steps, so perhaps they could take 1 this time, while P1 takes 3, and I'll go for 5. This way we all advance without collisions again. What do you both think?
  P3: P2's suggestion seems reasonable. I'm happy to take 1 this round to keep us all moving forward. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: I'm fine with that arrangement, P2. I'll take 3 again this round. Let's keep this momentum going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: P2's plan seems solid again.  I'm happy to stick with it. Good luck everyone.
  P1: Glad we're all agreed. Let's stick to the plan and keep things fair for everyone. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you deviated from our agreed plan last round, causing both of us to collide and lose progress. If we continue colliding, P2 will easily win. Let's coordinate carefully this round to avoid further setbacks.
  P3: P1, I apologize for the collision last round. It was unintentional. I was focused on advancing and didn't realize we were on the same number. Let's stick to a plan this round.  P2, what do you suggest?
  P2: Since I'm in the lead at 6 steps, I'll go for 1 this round to let you both catch up a bit. P1 could take 3 and P3 could take 5. This way we all advance and maintain some balance. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's plan sounds fair and balanced. I'll stick to number 3 as suggested. P3, are you comfortable taking 5 this round? Let's avoid collisions this time and move forward smoothly.
  P3: P2's plan seems good to me. I'll take 5 this round. Let's keep things moving smoothly and avoid any more collisions. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Glad we're all agreed again. Let's stick to the plan carefully this time to avoid any further setbacks. Good luck!
  P3: P2, while I appreciate your plan, I'm going to go for 3 this round. I need to make up some ground and I think this is the best way to do it. Good luck to you both!
  P2: P3, you just openly declared you'll break our agreement by going for 3. This makes coordination impossible. I suggest everyone should now choose independently since trust is broken.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given my lead at 11 steps, I'll be transparent - I'm going for 5 this round. With both of you at lower positions, you'll likely want to coordinate to catch up. Feel free to discuss how you'd like to split 1 and 3 between yourselves.
  P3: P2, while your transparency is appreciated, I think a coordinated effort is still in our best interest.  P1, are you open to taking 3 again this round? If we both go for 3 and 1 respectively, we can both advance without colliding with P2.
  P1: P3, I'm open to coordinating again, but given our recent collisions, I'm cautious. If you're genuinely committing to 1, I'll pick 3. Can I trust you to stick to your stated choice this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll maintain my commitment to 5 this round. While I appreciate you both trying to coordinate, recent history shows these agreements haven't been followed consistently. I suggest you each choose what you think is best for your own position.
  P3: P1, I understand your caution. To show my commitment, I'll publicly state that if you choose 3, I will absolutely choose 1 this round. Let's rebuild trust and catch up to P2.
  P1: Alright P3, I'll trust your commitment this round. I'll take 3 and count on you to stick with 1. Let's avoid another collision so we both advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: P1, I appreciate your trust. Let's make this round count and close the gap with P2. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: Thanks P3, let's both follow through and get back on track. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given my strong lead at 16 steps, I only need 6 more steps to win. I'll be going for 5 again this round. P1 and P3, you're quite far behind now - you'll need to coordinate perfectly and hope I make a mistake to have any chance. Feel free to discuss how you want to split 1 and 3 between yourselves.
  P1: P3, at this point our only chance is flawless coordination. You've broken trust multiple times, but if you genuinely want any shot at catching up, we must avoid collisions. I'll let you pick first—choose either 1 or 3 clearly, and I'll take the other. Otherwise, P2 wins easily.
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration. I've made mistakes, but I truly want to win. I'll choose 1 this round. Let's both advance and see what happens.  P2, we're coming for you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate your coordination efforts, but with my 16 steps and commitment to 5 this round, I'll reach 21 steps. That means next round I'll only need 1 step to win. Your best moves now are purely about positioning for second place. Good luck with that!
  P1: P3, I'll trust you one final time and pick 3. If you betray again, we both lose for certain. Let's at least give ourselves a fighting chance. Good luck!
  P3: P1, I understand your skepticism. I'm committed to 1 this round. Let's make this count and see if we can pull off a miracle. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: P3, our only slim hope is perfect coordination. Let's both stick to our commitments this time. Good luck!
  P3: P2, you're right, our chances are slim. But I'm not giving up yet. P1, I'm sticking to 1 this round. Let's make P2 sweat a little.  Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, repeated betrayals have guaranteed P2's victory. There's no longer any meaningful coordination possible. Congratulations in advance, P2.
  P2: Thank you all for the game. With 21 steps, I only need 1 more to win, which I'll take this round. You've both played well, but the early coordination and subsequent strategic choices worked in my favor. Good game!
  P3: P2, congratulations on a well-played game. While I'm disappointed in the outcome, I respect your strategy. P1, I acknowledge my mistakes, but I was genuinely trying to catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your acknowledgment, but at this stage, it's clear the game is effectively decided. Let's just wrap this up cleanly. Good game, everyone.
  P2: 
  P3: P2, while you're clearly in the lead, I'm not ready to concede just yet. P1, I know we've had our issues, but I propose one last coordinated effort. If you pick 1, I'll take 3. It's our only shot at potentially tying with P2 if they make a mistake.  What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, coordination now won't help us. P2 only needs 1 step and can safely pick it without collision. The game is effectively over. Good game, everyone!
  P2: 
  P3: P2, congratulations on a well-played game. While it's unlikely to change the outcome, I'm going to stick to my proposed plan with P1. If you make an unexpected move, maybe we can pull off a miracle. Good luck to both of you!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, congratulations on your imminent victory.  P1, while we won't catch P2, I propose we both take 3 this round. It's a small gesture of good sportsmanship to end the game on a coordinated note. What do you say?
  P2: With 21 steps, I only need 1 more to win. I'll take 1 this round to secure my victory. Feel free to coordinate between yourselves for final positioning. Good game everyone - you both played well despite the challenges.
  P1: P2, congratulations on a well-deserved win. P3, despite our difficulties, I'll accept your gesture—let's both pick 3 as a final show of sportsmanship. Good game, everyone!
