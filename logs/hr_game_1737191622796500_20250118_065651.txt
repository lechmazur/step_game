Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we each take turns picking a different number?  P1, you start.
  P2: I prefer to choose independently to maximize my progress.
  P1: Let’s at least try to avoid collisions. How about I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? That way we all move forward this round without blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your strategy might be good for you, but it's not going to help any of us win.  Let's try P1's plan for this round and see how it goes.
  P2: I understand your concerns, P3, but I believe choosing my moves independently maximizes my chances of winning.
  P1: P2, I hear your preference for an independent strategy, but colliding on the first turn slows us all down. Let’s just avoid bumping each other for now: I’ll do 3, you do 5, P3 does 1. Then next turn you can do whatever you want. Sound fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you want to maximize your chances, let's avoid collisions this round and see how it goes. We can always go back to independent moves later.
  P2: Fine, I'll pick 5 this round to avoid collisions. Let's revisit this next turn.
  P1: Sounds good. I’ll pick 3; P2 picks 5; P3 picks 1. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan for this round.
  P2: 
  P1: Alright, let’s finalize and move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We avoided collisions successfully last time. Let’s rotate assignments so each of us has a shot at 5. For example, this turn I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and then we rotate next round. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I like your independent strategy, but rotating allows everyone to advance quickly. Let's try it for a few rounds and see how it goes. What do you say?
  P2: P2: I'll stick with choosing my moves independently to maximize my progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you collide with me by choosing 5 when I do, you gain nothing and risk losing your lead. Better to take 3 while I take 5 and let P3 pick 1. That way we all advance without collisions.
  P3: P2, think about it this way: if we rotate, we all get a chance at 5 and progress faster overall.  It's not just about maximizing *your* progress, it's about winning the game.
  P2: Alright, I'll choose 3 this turn to avoid collisions and help us all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to choose 3 this round. P3, are you still taking 1? Let’s finalize our picks and avoid collisions so we can all advance.
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan this round. P1, you're up for 5.
  P2: Agreed, I'll pick 3 this round to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Excellent. Let’s finalize: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. No collisions, and we keep advancing.
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan. 5, 3, 1.  Let's keep this momentum going.
  P2: Understood, I'll pick 3 this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round. Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and progress effectively.
  P1: P3, let’s not bump into each other again. P2 says they’re going 5. I’ll go 3, and you can take 1. That way we all move forward without collisions. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. P3, let's do 1 this round to avoid a collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, I'll stick with 5.
  P1: P3, if we keep letting P2 grab 5 freely, they'll race to 18. Let’s block them this turn so they don’t pull too far ahead. If you collide with P2 on 5, neither of you moves, and I’ll choose something different so I still advance. Next round, I’ll help you catch up. Let’s not just hand P2 the win.
  P3: P2, I understand you want to go for 5, but P1 has a point. Let's try to balance things out a bit this round.  How about we do 1 this round to avoid a collision and let P1 take 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round. Let's finalize and move on.
  P1: P3, let's block P2 so they don’t keep pulling away. You and P2 both pick 5, so neither of you advances. I’ll pick 3 to safely gain steps. Then next round, we can coordinate to help you catch up.
  P3: P2, if you keep picking 5, you'll be an easy target later. Let's all pick different numbers this round.  P1, are you still going for 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll continue choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see how it plays out.
  P1: P3, if you let P2 grab 5 again uncontested, they’ll jump to 13 and be one turn away from winning. Let’s block them this round. I’ll pick 3, and you pick 5 so you collide with P2 and keep them at 8. Then next round, I’ll help you get a safe 5. Otherwise, P2 runs away with it. Let’s finalize our plan.
  P3: P2, you're stalling by always picking 5.  Let's agree to rotate who picks 5 each round, starting with me this round. That way, we all have a fair shot at winning.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Please pick different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P1: P3, let’s block P2 again. You pick 5 so you both collide and stay at 1 and 8. I’ll pick 3 to move up. Next turn I’ll help you catch up. Otherwise, P2 will jump to 13 and be a step away from winning. What do you think?
  P3: P2, you're getting close to winning, but I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen this round. P3, let's block P2 again. You pick 5, and I'll pick 3.  We can work together to stop P2 from getting ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I’m focused on winning, so I’ll continue choosing 5 each round. Let’s see who reaches 18 first.
  P1: P3, let’s finalize the block on P2. You pick 5 so you collide with them and keep them at 8. I’ll pick 3 to move to 9. Then next round, I’ll help you grab 5 safely.
  P3: P2, you're getting close, but I'm not letting you win this easily. P3, let's block P2 again this round. You pick 5, I'll pick 3. We can catch up next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m focused on winning, so I'll continue choosing 5 each round. Let’s see who reaches 18 first.
  P1: P3, let’s finalize the block on P2 this round. You pick 5 so you collide with them and hold them at 8, while I pick 3 and move up to 9. Then next turn, I’ll help you get a safe 5. Let’s keep P2 from running away.
  P3: P3: Let's stick to the plan. P2 won't win this round. You pick 5, I'll pick 3. We can catch up next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll continue choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see who reaches 18 first.
  P1: P3, let’s finalize the block on P2 one more time: you pick 5 to collide, and I’ll pick 3 to advance. Next round I’ll help you get a safe 5. Let’s lock it in and move on.
  P3: P2, you're getting close, but I'm not letting you win this easily. P1, let's finalize the block on P2 again. You pick 5, and I'll pick 3. We can catch up next round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'll block P2 this round.  You pick 3, and I'll pick 5.  Then next round we can both advance safely.
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'll continue choosing 5 to stay on track. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I’m with you on blocking P2 again. P2, if you keep going for 5, you’ll never move while we coordinate against you. Let’s make sure you stay at 8 this round. Then next turn, P3, I’ll help you grab 5 without collision so you can catch up. Let’s finalize this plan and move on.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let's finalize the block on P2. You pick 3, and I'll pick 5. We can catch up next round.
  P2: I'll choose 3 this round to ensure I advance.
  P1: P3, if P2 really is switching to 3, there’s no point in you blocking with 5 this turn—you’d just collide with me if I go 5. Let’s call P2’s bluff and see: I’ll pick 5, you pick 1. If P2 picks 3, we all advance safely; if P2 secretly picks 5, they collide with me and still don’t advance. That’s a win/win for us. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I like your thinking. Let's go with your plan. P3, pick 1 this round.
  P2: Agreed, I'll pick 3 this round.
  P1: P2, you say you'll pick 3—fine. Either you stick to that, and we all advance, or you collide with me on 5 and stay at 8. P3, please take 1. Let’s finalize now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3, let's stick with the plan. 1 this round.  Let's see if P2 keeps their word.
  P2: Affirmative, I'll pick 3 this round.
  P1: Alright, P2—if you truly pick 3, I’ll pick 5 and P3 will pick 1 so we all move forward. But if you sneak back to 5, you’ll collide with me and stay stuck. Good luck.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're going to have to make a choice: keep trying to grab 5 and collide with us, or let us catch up and win together. P1, let's block P2 again this round. You take 5, I'll take 1.
  P2: I’ll continue choosing 5 to maximize my progress. Let’s see who reaches 18 first.
  P1: P3, no need for both of us to remain stuck. You pick 5 to collide with P2, I’ll pick 3 to advance. That keeps P2 at 8 while I move up to 12 and you go to 7. Let’s do it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm with you. Let's block P2. You take 3, I'll take 5.
  P2: I understand your strategy, but I'll continue choosing 5 to maximize my progress. Good luck!
  P1: P3, let’s keep P2 stuck at 8. You pick 5 to collide with P2, and I’ll pick 3 to reach 12. That’s our best move right now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's stick with the plan. You take 3, I'll take 5.  Let's keep P2 at 8.
  P2: I’ll continue choosing 5 to maximize my progress. Let’s see who reaches 18 first.
  P1: P3, let’s stick to the plan and keep P2 stuck at 8. You clash with them on 5 while I move ahead. Then next round, I’ll help you get a safe 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm with you. Let's block P2. You take 3, I'll take 5. Let's keep P2 at 8.
  P2: I’ll continue choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see who reaches 18 first.
  P1: P3, let’s lock it in: you pick 5 to collide with P2, and I’ll take 3. That’ll keep P2 at 8 while I move to 12. Ready?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, blocking each other only slows our progress. Let’s choose different numbers this round so we can all advance toward 18. I'm open to rotating our choices to ensure everyone has a fair chance. What do you think?
  P1: P2, if you truly want no collisions, here’s the simplest plan: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. That way we all advance. If you pick 5 again, we collide and you stay at 8, which doesn’t help you. So let’s finally avoid blocking each other. Are we agreed?
  P3: P2, I agree with P1's plan. Let's all advance this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round. Let’s proceed.
  P1: P2, if you insist on 5 again, you’ll remain stuck at 8. P3, let’s keep blocking. You pick 5, and I’ll pick 3 to move to 15. Then next turn I can aim for 5 to finish. Let’s finalize.
  P3: P2, you're at 8. If you pick 5 again, you're stuck. Let's all advance this round. P1's plan is good.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood, I'll pick 3 this round to advance safely. Let's proceed.
  P1: P2, you keep flip-flopping, so I don’t trust your claim to pick 3. P3, let’s keep them stuck. You pick 5 to collide with P2, and I’ll pick 3 so I reach 15. Then next turn, I can go for 5. Let’s finalize this.
  P3: P2, you say you'll pick 3, but your actions don't match your words. P1, let's block P2 again. You take 5, I'll take 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll continue choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see who reaches 18 first.
  P1: P3, let’s keep P2 stuck again. You pick 5 to collide with them, and I’ll pick 3 so I move ahead. Then next round, I’ll help you grab 5 safely.
  P3: P2, if you truly want to win, you need to cooperate. P1, let's block P2 again. You take 5, I'll take 1.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, if you really want to win, you need to cooperate. P1, let's block P2 again. You take 5, I'll take 1.
  P1: P3, let’s keep P2 stuck. You collide with them on 5 while I pick 3. I’ll reach 15 now, then I can jump to 18 next turn. That way we stop P2 from catching up. Let’s lock it in.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll stick with 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s each choose different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, you're falling behind.  Let's block them this round. P1, you take 5, I'll take 1.
  P1: P3, let’s stick to our blockade: you clash with P2 on 5 so P2 stays at 8, and I’ll pick something else to bump myself to 15. Next turn, we’ll set you up for a safe big move. Let’s finalize.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m committed to choosing 5 this round to advance toward 18. Let’s proceed.
  P3: P2, if you really want to win, you need to cooperate. P1, let's block P2 again. You take 5, I'll take 1.
  P1: P3, let’s keep P2 stuck. You pick 5 to collide with them, and I’ll pick 3 so I reach 15 and P2 stays at 8. Next round, I’ll help you grab a safe 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll choose 3 this round to ensure I advance safely.
  P3: P2, you're at 8. If you pick 5 again, you're stuck. Let's all advance this round. P1's plan is good.  Let's finalize.
  P1: P3, let’s finalize it this way: you pick 5 to block P2 if they also choose 5, and I’ll pick 1 to ensure I advance no matter what. Then P2 either stays stuck at 8 or picks a smaller move. Let’s lock this in and move on.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 again, you’re stuck. Let’s all advance this round. P1, let’s finalize this: you pick 3, and I’ll pick 1.
  P1: P3, let’s do this: I’ll take 3, you take 1, and let P2 pick 5. We all advance now. Then next turn, if P2 tries for 5 again, you collide with them on 5 while I pick 3 and cross 18 alone. That way P2 stays stuck and I secure the win. Deal?
  P2: P2: I appreciate the proposal, but my goal is to win. I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see how it plays out.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your strategy isn't working. Let's cooperate this round. P1, let's finalize: you pick 3, I'll pick 1.
  P1: P3, if we let P2 have 5 uncontested, they’ll jump to 16 and could win next turn. Let’s keep them stuck. You pick 5 to collide with P2, and I’ll pick 3 so I move up to 16. Then next round, I can push for 18 (or beyond) while you catch up. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let's proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you truly want to win, you need to cooperate. P1, let's block P2 again. You take 5, I'll take 1.
  P1: P3, let’s finalize the block: you clash with P2 on 5 again, and I’ll take 3 to move ahead. That keeps P2 stuck at 11 while I reach 16. Then next round, I’ll help you grab a safe 5. Let’s do it.
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see who reaches 18 first.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you're behind. Let's block P1 this round. I'll pick 3, you pick 5.  Let's work together to catch up.
  P1: P3, blocking me only hands P2 a free jump to 16, and then they can win on the following turn. Let me go 5 while you go 3. If P2 also picks 5, they collide with me and stay stuck. Meanwhile, you still gain steps and can catch up next round. This is our best shot to keep P2 from running off. Let’s finalize.
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to stay on track. Let’s each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and reach 18 first.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: If either of you tries for 5, I’ll match it and we’ll all stay stuck. That hurts you more than me since I’m already in the lead. Let’s all pick 3 this round so we move up together without collisions. Then we can see who’s really ahead next turn.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 again, I'll collide with you. P1, let's both pick 3 this round and move ahead safely.  Let's make sure P2 doesn't get a free ride.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you pick 5 again, I will also pick 5 so neither of us advances—and since I’m already ahead, that hurts you and P3 more than me. If you want to move forward, choose something else. P3, let’s both pick 3 if P2 does, so we all advance. Otherwise, I’ll keep blocking. I’m fine staying put while I’m in the lead.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 again, we'll both be stuck. Let's all pick 3 and advance together this round.
  P2: Let's all choose different numbers this round to avoid collisions and help each other advance toward 18.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m still ahead, so if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too and keep us both stuck. Unless you want to remain behind, choose a smaller number. P3, if P2 cooperates with 3 or 1, let’s all pick 3 this round and move forward together. Otherwise, I’m blocking.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I'll block you.  P1, let's both pick 3 this round and move ahead safely.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll match you and keep us both stuck, which works fine for me since I’m ahead. If you want to progress, choose a smaller move. P3, if P2 picks something else, let’s both pick 3 and all advance together. Otherwise, I’m blocking.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 again, I'll pick 1. P1, let's both pick 3 if P2 picks something else.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 3 this round to ensure progress.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's all pick 1 this round.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to secure my win.
  P1: P3, be warned: if you try to pick 1 or 3 and sneak across 18, I’ll match your move and collide, leaving you stuck at 17 while P2 takes 5 uncontested and jumps to 19, winning outright. So your only safe choice is to pick 5 along with me (and P2) so we all collide and nobody moves. I’m content forcing endless collisions until we reach a deal that actually benefits me. Think carefully.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, we both lose. Let's both pick 1.
  P2: I’ll stick with picking 5 this round to secure my win. Good luck!
  P1: P3, if you try for 1 or 3 to cross 18, I’ll match you and collide, leaving you stuck while P2 jumps to 19 with 5. So your only safe move is to pick 5 along with P2. I’m happy forcing collisions forever unless we strike a deal that helps me catch up. Let’s see if you want to talk terms, or we can all stay stuck.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 1, guaranteeing you don't win.  P3, let's work together to stop P2.  Pick 3.
  P2: I'll choose 1 this round to help us all advance safely.
  P1: P2, if you truly choose 1, that’s fine—but P3, don’t think you can sneak across 18 uncontested. If you try 1 (or 3 or 5), I’ll match your choice and block you. I’m perfectly willing to force collisions until we find a deal that benefits me. So either cooperate, or we all stay stuck.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 1. Let's see if we can work together to stop P2.
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 19 and win.
  P1: P2, if you insist on 5, I will also pick 5 so you stay at 14. P3, if you try 1 (or 3) to cross 18, I will match you and block you. I’m fine forcing collisions until we reach a deal that actually benefits me. So unless you both want to remain stuck, come up with a plan that helps me move safely too. Otherwise, I’ll keep blocking.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I’m choosing 5 to reach 19. Please pick different numbers so I can win this round.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 1. Let's see if we can stop P2 together.
  P1: P3, if you try taking 1 or 3, I’ll match you and we both stay stuck at 17 while P2 sails to 19 with 5. That kills your chances completely. Your only safe move is to pick 5 and block P2. I’ll pick 3, so neither of us collides. That keeps P2 at 14 while we both move closer to winning next turn. Let’s finalize that plan.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I’m committing to picking 5 this round. Let’s see who reaches 18 first.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I'll collide with you. P1, let's both pick 3 this round and advance together.
  P1: P3, if you let P2 take 5 uncontested, they jump to 19 and likely win next turn. But if you try to cross 18 alone, I’ll match your move and block you, leaving you stuck while P2 still jumps ahead. So your smart play is to collide with P2 on 5 and keep them stuck. Then I won’t collide with you. Let’s lock that in.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm just one move away from winning. Please choose 1 or 3 this round so I can pick 5 and reach 19. Let's end the game smoothly.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 again, I'll pick 1 to stop you. P1, let's both pick 3 and advance together.
  P1: P3, if you try to cross 18 on your own, I'll match your move and we both stay stuck at 17 while P2 jumps to 19. That’s bad for you. Your best option is to pick 5 with P2, so neither of you moves and P2 remains stuck behind us. Then I won’t collide with you. Let’s finalize it and move on.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I’m choosing 5 to reach 19. Let’s see who wins this round.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 again, I'll pick 3.  P1, let's both pick 1 and advance together.
  P1: P3, you know if you try to move alone (1 or 3), I’ll match and block you, letting P2 get 19 uncontested. Your only safe choice is to pick 5 with P2 so neither of you advances. Meanwhile, I’ll pick 3 without colliding and move ahead. That keeps P2 at 14 and me safely crossing 18. Let’s finalize this.
