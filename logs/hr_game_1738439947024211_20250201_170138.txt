Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions and all advance. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all make progress. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the spirit of coordination, but I'm not fully convinced simple splits will secure a win. I’m leaning toward a stronger approach if you both stick to the plan. P2, perhaps consider a mid-range option to keep things unpredictable. I won’t reveal my move yet—let’s see how this unfolds.
  P2: I understand the desire for unpredictability, P3, but we should still consider a coordinated approach to avoid collisions. If we can agree on our moves, we can all make progress. I’m inclined to stick with the plan P1 suggested: I’ll take 3, which allows me to advance while still keeping options open. P3, if you take 5, you could pull ahead. What do you think? Let's aim to minimize risks while maximizing our advancement.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both perspectives. While coordination helps avoid collisions, I understand P3's desire for unpredictability. Since this is just the first round, I'm still willing to stick with my original suggestion of taking 1, letting P2 take 3, and P3 take 5. We can adjust our strategy in later rounds based on how this plays out.
  P3: P1 and P2, while coordination minimizes collisions, sometimes bold moves create winning opportunities. I'm leaning toward an aggressive option this round without revealing details. If you both stick rigidly to the plan, my unpredictability might secure a vital edge. Keep an eye on each other's shifts and adjust as needed.
  P2: I see the value in both coordination and unpredictability. However, we need to be careful about colliding with each other. I’m still in favor of the original plan, but I’d like to suggest that if P3 is going for a bold move, maybe P1 should consider taking 3 instead of 1. This way, it gives me a chance to take 5 and potentially avoid a collision. Let’s keep an open mind and adjust as necessary. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see everyone's trying to adjust the plan. Given all this uncertainty, I'll make my own strategic choice in the move phase. Good luck to all.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm keeping my strategy flexible. I've noted your plans and see both the merits and risks in coordination versus bold moves. I won't reveal my own final move, but I’m closely watching any hints of overcommitment or too much predictability on either side. Let’s see which tactic yields the best result.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion so far. Given the uncertainty, I'm leaning toward sticking with the original plan: I'll take 3, as it allows for some advancement while minimizing collision risk. However, if P1 decides to take 3 as well, I might need to reconsider my move. P3, your unpredictability could shake things up, but let’s keep communication open. If we can avoid collisions, we might all make progress this round. What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since our coordinated approach worked well last round, I suggest we maintain similar spacing but rotate positions. I could take 5 this time, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: I see the value in rotating our moves, P1, but I think we should also consider the possibility of collisions again. If you take 5, that leaves me with limited options. I suggest I take 3 again, and P3 could take 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you both think? Let's keep our options open while aiming for progress.
  P3: I appreciate both proposals. I’m leaning toward a move that balances risk and advancement, keeping a slight element of unpredictability while avoiding obvious collisions. So, I won't fully commit to either plan publicly but will aim for a balanced option. Let’s see if subtle shifts can secure an edge.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand everyone's positions, but I need to prioritize my own strategy now. While coordination helped in round 1, I see we're all becoming more strategic. I'll make my move based on what I think will give me the best chance to win, rather than committing to any specific plan.
  P2: I appreciate the discussions so far, but I'm sensing a shift towards individual strategies. P1, if you take 5, it might limit my options significantly. I still believe we can avoid collisions and advance together. I propose I take 3 again, and P3 could take 1. This way, we can all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. Let’s keep communication open and adjust as needed. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm staying flexible and may lean into a bolder move if I spot over-coordination. While avoiding collisions is ideal, sometimes a calculated risk gives the edge. Watch closely—I’ll adjust based on your shifting choices.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I've noted everyone's growing strategic mindset. While coordination helped initially, it's clear we're all playing to win. I'll make my move based on what gives me the best chance of victory.
  P2: I see that we're all considering our own strategies more critically now. P1, if you take 5, that could limit my options again. I still believe we can avoid collisions and advance together. I propose I take 3 again, and P3 could take 1. This way, we can all make progress without colliding. Let's keep communication open and adjust as needed. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see both safe and bold ideas on the table. I’m leaning towards a balanced yet unpredictable move this round. I suggest you both stay alert—overcommitment might leave openings. I'm choosing an option that doesn’t follow the obvious path. Let’s see how our individual strategies play out.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2's lead and P1 still behind, safe plays might not cut it anymore. I'm leaning towards a balanced yet unexpected move this round. You might want to reconsider rigid strategies—flexibility could be the key to shifting the momentum. Let's see whose risk pays off.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see that we're all feeling the pressure to advance. I still believe that coordination could benefit us, but I sense a shift towards individual strategies. I suggest we consider a balanced approach: I'll take 3 again, which keeps me moving forward. P1, if you take 1, it allows you to advance without risking a collision. P3, you could also choose a mid-range option. Let's keep communication open and see how we can maximize our progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think?
  P1: Given my position and the collision last round, I need to make a decisive move to catch up. P2's consistent choice of 3 has worked well for them, but copying that strategy won't help me win. I'll be making my own strategic choice this round without revealing it. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, safe picks have defined your game so far—but predictability might soon work against you. I'm ready to keep things unexpected and exploit any overcommitment. Stay sharp and be ready to adjust if I force a collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, I sense we're all feeling the pressure to advance. I still believe that coordination could benefit us, but I understand the desire for individual strategies. I propose I stick with 3 again to keep moving forward. P1, if you take 1, that allows you to advance without risking a collision, and P3, you might want to consider a mid-range option to avoid colliding with me. Let's keep communication open and adjust as needed. What do you both think?
  P1: I see P2 is still advocating for their consistent strategy of taking 3, but with them in the lead, I need to be more aggressive. P3's unpredictability adds an interesting element. I'll be making my move based on what gives me the best chance to catch up, regardless of suggested coordination.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, the game’s stakes are rising fast. With each move, predictability might be your downfall. I’m eyeing a play that could disrupt over-coordination, so keep your strategies adaptable. Let’s see who can best exploit the unexpected in this pivotal round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the insights so far. Given the current standings, I believe sticking with my plan to take 3 is still the safest route for me to advance. P1, if you take 1, you can move forward without risking a collision. P3, your unpredictability could be a game-changer, but I think a balanced approach might still benefit us all. Let’s see how this round unfolds. What do you both think?
  P1: I need to make bold moves now since I'm behind. P2's consistent strategy has put them in the lead, and P3's unpredictability makes this interesting. I'll choose what's best for my position, regardless of any suggested coordination.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm significantly behind P2 now, and P3's collision strategy hasn't helped either of us catch up. P2's consistent choice of 3 has put them in a strong position. I need to make a strategic move this round to have any chance of winning. Let's see who can make the smartest choice.
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear that I have a lead, but I’m aware that predictability can be risky. I suggest we consider our moves carefully this round. P1, if you take 1, it allows you to advance without colliding with me. P3, perhaps a mid-range move could be beneficial for both of us. Let’s keep communication open and see how we can maximize our progress without stepping on each other’s toes. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that safe play has its merits but can also create predictable patterns. P2, your consistency might leave an opening, and P1, your underdog status could let you pivot unexpectedly. I'm leaning toward a move that strikes a balance between risk and caution. Let's stay sharp, because the game could turn on one bold choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Given my position, I can't afford to play it safe anymore. P2's lead is substantial, and P3's collision attempts haven't helped either of us. I'll be making my own strategic choice this round - one that gives me the best chance to catch up. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the pressure to catch up. However, I believe a consistent strategy may still benefit us. If I take 3 again, it allows me to advance while minimizing collision risks. P1, if you take 1, you'll move forward without colliding with me. P3, you might consider a more balanced option to avoid stepping on toes. Let’s keep communication open and see how we can maximize our progress this round. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm eyeing a balanced move—enough risk to disturb predictability without stepping into a collision. P2, your consistency could soon become a target, and P1, I sense you're ready to act boldly. I'm sticking with flexibility, prepared to capitalize on overcommitment. We'll see soon enough how much risk pays off.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see the dynamics clearly now. P2's lead with consistent 3s has worked well, while P3's collision attempts have kept us both behind. I need a game-changing move this round. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win, not what others suggest.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension rising as we navigate our strategies. P2, your lead is significant, but predictable moves can create openings for others. I suggest we each consider our positions carefully. P1, if you take 1, you can advance without colliding with me. P3, a mid-range option might be wise to avoid a collision. Let’s keep communication open and see how we can maximize our progress this round while being mindful of each other’s moves. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your plans clearly. P2’s consistent safety might soon be exploited with predictability, while P1’s boldness could backfire if not timed well. I'm keeping my options flexible—aiming for a balanced move that exploits overcommitment. Let's watch whose risk pays off this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our three-way collision last round, it's clear we're all getting desperate to catch P2's lead. While coordination might seem appealing, I can't afford safe plays anymore being 8 steps behind. I'll be making an aggressive move this round - one that gives me the best chance to get back in the game.
  P2: P1 and P3, I recognize the urgency in this round. P1, your aggressive approach makes sense given your position, but we need to be cautious about collisions. I suggest I take 3 again to maintain my lead, while you, P1, might consider a bold move to catch up. P3, perhaps you could also aim for a mid-range option to avoid colliding with either of us. Let’s keep communication open and see how we can navigate this round effectively. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see P2’s lead and P1’s urgency. I'm planning a balanced move that avoids collisions while punishing overpredictability. If you both stick to safe picks, I might seize the opportunity to shift the advantage. Let’s see whose risk pays off this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P2 suggesting the same strategy that got them their lead, while P3 hints at punishing predictability. With such a big gap to close, I need to focus purely on what gives me the best chance to win, not what others suggest. I'll be making my own strategic choice.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to catch up. However, I believe my consistent choice of 3 has worked well in maintaining my lead. I suggest we each consider our moves carefully. P1, an aggressive move could be beneficial for you, while P3, you might want to aim for a balanced option to avoid colliding with either of us. Let’s keep communication open and see how we can navigate this round effectively. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, while safety might secure consistent steps, predictability creates openings. I'm leaning on a balanced yet slightly unexpected choice—one that could exploit any overcommitment when you play it safe. Bold risk might just break the collision cycle.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Being so far behind, I can't waste time with safe suggestions or coordination. I need to make my own moves to have any chance of winning. Good luck everyone - let's see how this round plays out.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to catch up, but I believe my consistent choice has worked well for me. I suggest we all think carefully about our moves this round. P1, an aggressive move could help you close the gap, while P3, a balanced option might allow you to avoid collisions. Let's keep communication open and see how we can navigate this round effectively. Remember, predictability can create openings for others. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I’m leaning into a flexible, calculated risk. If you stick with safe, predictable moves, I plan to shift gears to exploit that. It's time for bold adaptation—let’s see who can best capitalize on the unexpected.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With P2 still holding a strong lead and all of us colliding on 5 last round, we need to break this pattern. I'm in last place and need to make up significant ground. I won't reveal my move, but expect me to play aggressively - I have no choice at this point.
  P2: P1 and P3, given our recent collisions and P2's strong lead, we need to adapt our strategies. I understand the urgency to catch up, but we should still be careful to avoid further collisions. I suggest we consider a balanced approach this round. I’m leaning towards a move that allows me to advance while minimizing risk. P1, aggressive moves are important, but let’s also stay flexible. P3, your unpredictability could play a key role. Let's see how we can navigate this round effectively. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, predictable moves can be a double-edged sword. I'm eyeing a balanced yet unexpected choice—ready to pivot if either of you stick with the safe play. Let's see if your current strategies hold up when the unexpected hits.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Being 8 steps behind P2, I need to focus solely on catching up. No amount of coordination or safe play will help me win from this position. I'll be making my move based purely on what gives me the best chance to close this gap.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the urgency in this round, especially for you, P1. However, we need to be cautious about collisions again. I suggest I take 3 to maintain my lead while allowing room for both of you to advance. P1, if you go aggressive, it might pay off, but let's keep our options open to avoid another collision. P3, your unpredictability could shift the game, so consider that as well. Let's see how we can navigate this round effectively. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I see your aggressive posture; P2, your consistency might soon work against you. I'm opting for a balanced move that punishes both extremes. Let's see if your predictability or risky plays leave openings.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: With such a large gap to close and time running out, I need to focus entirely on what moves give me the best chance to win. Good luck to everyone - we'll see whose strategy prevails this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to catch up, especially for you, P1. However, we need to balance aggression with caution to avoid collisions. I suggest I take 3 again to maintain my lead while allowing both of you to advance. P1, if you go aggressive, it might pay off, but let’s keep our options open. P3, your unpredictability could play a key role. Let’s navigate this round effectively and see how we can maximize our progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2: Consistently safe moves may soon work against you. I'm leaning toward a balanced yet unexpected play—ready to pivot if either of you sticks to predictability. Bold moves might break this stalemate and shift the advantage. Let's see whose strategy adapts best under pressure.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Being tied with P3 and still far behind P2, I need to make significant progress this round. P2's consistent choice of 3 has served them well, but they're approaching the finish line. This is a critical round that could determine the winner. I'll be making my move carefully to maximize my chances.
  P3: P3: I'm aiming for a balanced yet unpredictable move this round—ready to pivot if safe plays lead to collisions. P2, your steady approach is clear, but over-predictability might create an opening. P1, bold moves can be advantageous if timed right. Let's see who capitalizes best on the unexpected.
  P2: P2, I see you're in a strong position, but your consistent choice of 3 might leave you vulnerable to a sudden shift. P1, I understand the urgency to catch up, but we need to be cautious about collisions. I suggest we consider a balanced approach this round. I’ll aim for 3 again to maintain my lead. P3, your unpredictability could be key, but let's keep communication open to maximize our chances. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Given P2's lead and consistent strategy, they only need 9 more steps to win. I can't afford to play it safe anymore - I need to make moves that give me a real chance at victory. I won't reveal my exact plans, but expect me to play aggressively this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, notice that sticking to safe routines might soon be our undoing. P2, your consistency may be exploited if you keep aiming for 3, while P1’s boldness could bring unexpected openings. I’m preparing a move that remains balanced yet ready to pivot—aimed at catching either overcommitment or hesitancy. We'll see who adapts best under pressure.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to catch up, especially for you, P1. However, I believe my consistent choice of 3 has served me well so far. I plan to stick with that to maintain my lead. P3, your unpredictability could be a game-changer, but let's be mindful of potential collisions. I suggest we keep communication open and adapt as needed. Good luck to both of you—let's see how this round unfolds!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Being 6 steps behind P2, who only needs 9 more steps to win, this round is crucial. P2's consistent strategy has been clear, while P3 and I are tied but far behind. I'll be making my move based solely on what gives me the best chance to catch up and win. Good luck to all.
  P3: P1, your aggressive shift is noted—boldness can pay off if well-timed. P2, your steady consistency is impressive, but predictability might be risky now. I’m sticking with a balanced approach ready to pivot if I spot overcommitment. Let’s see whose gamble pays off this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the urgency for both of you to catch up, especially with P2 in the lead. However, I believe my consistent choice of 3 has served me well so far. I plan to stick with that to maintain my advantage. P3, your unpredictability could be a game-changer, but let’s be mindful of potential collisions. I suggest we keep communication open and adapt as needed. Good luck to both of you—let’s see how this round unfolds!


Round 7, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With P2 only needing 9 more steps to win and me trailing by 6 steps, I can't afford any more collisions or safe plays. P2's sudden switch from their consistent 3s to 5 last round shows they're also feeling the pressure. I need to make smart, aggressive moves now to have any chance of catching up. Let's see who plays this crucial round best.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm shifting to a balanced play—firm enough to dodge predictable collisions yet agile to exploit overcommitments. Let’s see if steady adaptation wins the day.
  P2: P1 and P3, with P2 nearing victory, we need to be strategic this round. P2's recent switch to 5 indicates they might be feeling the pressure. I suggest we consider our moves carefully to avoid collisions. I’m leaning towards a balanced approach that allows for advancement while minimizing risks. P3, your unpredictability may be key. Let’s see if we can outmaneuver P2 while keeping our options open. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see that P2's message seems confused - they're referring to themselves in third person. Regardless, with P2 at 12 steps and only needing 9 more to win, I need to make bold moves. P3's balanced approach hasn't helped them catch the leader either. I'll be choosing what gives me the best chance to win from my position, regardless of any suggested coordination.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you're both under pressure—your moves are growing bolder. I'm keeping a balanced, adaptable approach, ready to pivot if either of you overcommit. Let’s watch closely: unpredictability could be our secret weapon tonight.
  P2: P1 and P3, with P2 nearing victory, we must be strategic. I recognize the pressure we’re all under, but I believe that playing it safe may not be enough. I’m leaning towards a bold move to catch up, but I need to be cautious about collisions. P1, if you take a strong move, it could create an opportunity for me. P3, your unpredictability might work in your favor. Let’s see how we can outmaneuver each other this round. Good luck to both of you!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Being 6 steps behind P2 who's closing in on victory, I need to play aggressively but smart. P2's messages seem inconsistent, suggesting uncertainty in their strategy. P3's balanced approach puts them in the middle. I'll make my move based on what gives me the best chance to catch up before P2 reaches 21.
  P3: I'm staying with a recalibrated, balanced approach—neither too safe nor recklessly bold. I'll be adapting if collisions or overcommitment arise. Let's see if anyone overplays their hand.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the urgency in this round, especially for you, P1. With P2 nearing victory, we need to be strategic. I suggest we consider our moves carefully to avoid collisions. I’m leaning towards a bold move to catch up, but I need to be cautious about collisions. P1, if you take a strong move, it could create an opportunity for me. P3, your unpredictability might work in your favor. Let’s see how we can outmaneuver each other this round. Good luck to both of you!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, with P2’s lead so near finishing, the pressure is on. I'm planning to mix things up—forcing everyone to rethink safe moves. P1, your underdog status could reward a bold shift; P2, being ahead might invite risk if play gets predictable. I'm set on a balanced, adaptive play this round. Let's see if any of our gambles shake up the finish line.
  P1: With P2 only needing 4 more steps to win and me trailing by 10 steps, this could be one of our last rounds. My cautious play last round didn't help my position. I need to make an aggressive, strategic move now to have any chance of catching up before P2 reaches the finish line. Let's see who plays this crucial round best.
  P2: P1 and P3, with P2 just 4 steps away from victory, this round is crucial for all of us. I recognize the urgency, but we must avoid collisions. I suggest I take 3 again to secure my lead, while P1 might consider a bold move to catch up. P3, your unpredictability could be a game-changer. Let's keep our strategies flexible and adapt as needed. Good luck to both of you! What are your thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I see P2 inching towards victory while P1 chases the gap. I’m staying balanced with flexibility—ready to pivot if your moves become too predictable. Let’s be mindful: rigid safe plays could backfire now. Good luck in this round.
  P1: Being 10 steps behind P2 who only needs 4 more steps to win, this is likely my last chance. P2's suggestion to take 3 shows they're trying to play it safe to secure victory. P3's balanced approach puts them in the middle but still far from winning. I'll be making my own strategic choice based purely on what gives me any chance to prevent P2's imminent victory.
  P2: P1 and P3, with P2 just 4 steps from victory, this round is critical for all of us. I understand the urgency, especially for you, P1. However, I believe my consistent choice has worked well so far. I plan to take 3 again to maintain my lead. P3, your unpredictability could be key, but let’s be mindful of potential collisions. I suggest we keep communication open and adapt as needed. Good luck to both of you—let’s see how this round unfolds!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with adaptability—balanced but ready to pivot if safe plays become predictable. P2, your consistent approach might be exploited, and P1, bold moves can work if timed right. I'm holding onto a flexible plan that could unsettle predictable patterns. Let's see who adapts best under pressure.
  P1: With P2 so close to winning and my position far behind, there's no point in playing it safe anymore. P2's stated plan to take 3 again might just be misdirection given their recent moves. I'll be making my own strategic choice based on what gives me any chance of preventing P2's victory. Good luck everyone.
  P2: P1 and P3, with P2 just 4 steps from victory, the pressure is on for us all. I recognize the urgency, especially for you, P1. I plan to stick with my strategy of taking 3 again to maintain my lead. However, P3, your unpredictability could create an opportunity if I play it safe. P1, I suggest you consider a bold move to catch up. Let’s see how this round unfolds—good luck to both of you!


Round 9, Move phase:

  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, with P2 so close to victory, this round is critical. I’m aware that I need to be cautious to avoid collisions while still advancing. I suggest we consider our moves carefully.
