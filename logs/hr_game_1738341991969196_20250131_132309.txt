Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a strategy. If we all choose the same number, no one advances. I propose we try to spread out our moves to increase the chances of someone advancing. Perhaps we can discuss a rotation or allocation of moves to minimize collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: Great idea, P3. To avoid collisions, let's rotate our moves each round. For example, this round P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. Next round, we can shift: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, each of us advances consistently without overlapping. Does everyone agree with this rotation plan?
  P1: Agreed. Let's follow P2's rotation plan to avoid collisions. This round: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Consistency now prevents early setbacks.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the rotation plan, let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure we're all on the same page. As discussed, P1 will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and I, P3, will choose 5. Is everyone ready to proceed with these moves?

  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to adjust the rotation to balance progress. Given the current standings, allocating higher moves to players with lower totals is a fair approach. However, I propose a slight modification: let's consider the difference in steps between players and adjust accordingly to ensure a more gradual balance.
  P2: P2: I agree with adjusting our rotation to balance progress. Based on our current standings, I'll choose 1 this round, while P1 selects 5 and P3 picks 3. This should help maintain fairness and keep the game competitive. Let’s proceed with this plan. If anyone has alternative suggestions or concerns, feel free to share.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Round 3 moves: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This balances progress. Post-round, let’s reassess to ensure equitable advancement. If totals align next round, reverting to original rotation (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) could maintain fairness. Consistency prevents chaos.
  P3: Let's confirm the adjusted rotation for Round 3: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This adjustment should help balance progress. I suggest we monitor the standings closely after this round and be prepared to reassess and potentially revert to the original rotation if the gap narrows significantly.
  P2: Agreed, P3. Let’s proceed with this round’s moves: P1 – 5, P2 – 1, and P3 – 3. We’ll monitor the step differences closely and adjust our rotation in the next round as needed to maintain balance. If anyone has further suggestions to ensure fair advancement, feel free to share. Otherwise, let’s move to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed. Round 3 moves: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. After this round, we'll all be tied at 9 steps. Let's then revert to the original rotation (1,3,5) in Round 4 for simplicity and fairness. No one gains an edge, maintaining balanced progress. Agreed?
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed Round 3 moves: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This adjustment balances progress. After this round, since we'll be closely tied, reverting to the original rotation in Round 4 ensures fairness and simplicity, preventing any player from gaining an unfair advantage.
  P2: Confirmed. Round 3 moves will be P1 – 5, P2 – 1, and P3 – 3, bringing all totals to 9 steps. After this round, we'll revert to the original rotation (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) to maintain fairness. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **Final Answer**  
\<message\>  
Confirmed. Round 3 moves as planned. Post-Round 3, let's rotate 5 allocation to ensure equitable advancement. P1 should get 5 next to balance historical allocations.  
\</message\>
  P3: Considering our current standings, let's ensure the adjusted rotation for Round 3 is executed as planned: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. After this round, we should reassess to decide on the next rotation, focusing on fairness and balance.
  P2: Confirmed. Round 3 moves: P1 – 5, P2 – 1, and P3 – 3, bringing all totals to 9. Let's proceed to the move phase and revert to the original rotation in Round 4 for fairness.

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's revert to the original rotation as agreed: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This ensures fairness and simplicity since we're tied. By following the original plan, we maintain balanced progress and avoid unnecessary complexity. Shall we proceed with these moves for Round 4?
  P1: \<message\>  
Reverting to original rotation now unfairly advantages P3 with another 5. To sustain fairness, let's rotate 5 allocation: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round. Equal opportunity prevents premature leads. Post-move, we reassign 5 based on updated totals. This keeps the game balanced. Agree?  
\</message\>
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let's proceed with P1‑5, P2‑3, and P3‑1 for Round 4. This rotation maintains fairness and balance. After executing these moves, we can reassess to ensure equitable advancement. Let’s move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about fairness, but changing the rotation now may introduce unpredictability. Let's stick to the original plan for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5, and reassess afterwards to maintain balance and fairness. This ensures consistency and prevents premature leads.
  P1: \<message\>  
Reverting now unfairly gives P3 consecutive 5s (Round 1 & 4) while P1/P2 had only one each. True fairness cycles 5 equally. Current rotation: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round. Next round, assign 5 based on updated totals. Prevents premature lead and ensures balanced competition.  
\</message\>
  P2: I propose we rotate the 5 allocation fairly. This round, let’s go with P1‑1, P2‑5, and P3‑3. This ensures everyone gets a chance to choose higher moves over time and avoids collisions. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's focus on fairness and balance. Since we're tied, rotating the 5 allocation is reasonable. P1's suggestion of P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round could work, but let's also consider P2's alternative. Perhaps we can find a middle ground that ensures equal opportunities for all players to advance without introducing unpredictability. What are your thoughts on a compromise that maintains the original rotation's intent while addressing fairness concerns?
  P1: \<message\>  
Since each has had 5 once, cycling it equitably now prevents bias. Round 4: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This ensures no player gains a second 5 prematurely. Post-move, totals will align (P1:14, P2:12, P3:10), allowing fair reallocation next round. Sticking to the original rotation unfairly favors P3 with two 5s. Let's prioritize balanced progress to sustain cooperation.  
\</message\>
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let’s proceed with Round 4 moves: P1‑5, P2‑3, and P3‑1. This rotation maintains fairness and balance among us. After executing these moves, we can reassess to ensure equitable advancement. Let’s move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize Round 4 moves as P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 to maintain fairness. This ensures equal opportunities and prevents premature leads. After this round, we'll reassess totals and adjust the rotation accordingly to sustain balanced progress and cooperation. Shall we proceed to the move phase with this agreement?
  P1: \<message\>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To advance efficiently, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's have P1 pick 1 and P3 choose 3 to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses steadily. Agreed?
  P3: Let's reassess our strategy. Given the current standings, I suggest we allocate moves to balance progress. P1 is ahead, so perhaps P3 should get 5 this round to close the gap. A balanced approach would be P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This ensures fairness and competitive balance, preventing any player from pulling too far ahead. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: \<message\>  
Given the standings, allowing P3 to take 5 this round balances progress. Let's proceed with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Post-Round 5, we'll all be at 15. Next round, allocate 5 to the lowest scorer (then P3) to sustain fairness. This prevents premature leads and maintains cooperation.  
\</message\>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: \<message\>  
To maximize our progress, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's proceed with P1‑1, P2‑5, and P3‑3 to keep things balanced and avoid collisions.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, I suggest we balance progress. P1 is close to winning, so P3 should get 5 to catch up. Let's proceed with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for Round 7. This ensures fairness and maintains competitive balance.
  P1: \<message\>  
Following our rotation pattern, Round 7 should be P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Sticking to the plan prevents collisions and ensures trust. If P3 takes 5 now, we risk collision and mutual loss. Let's honor the agreed rotation: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This maintains fairness and ends the game cleanly.  
\</message\>  
\<stop\>
  P2: To prevent P1 from winning immediately, I propose Round 7 moves as follows: **P1 – 1**, **P2 – 5**, and **P3 – 3**. This allows P2 to advance significantly while keeping P1 below 22 steps, ensuring no immediate winner and maintaining fairness. Let’s agree to this allocation to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive for all. Do you all concur with this plan?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let's stick to the original rotation pattern. P1 is close to winning, but deviating now risks mutual loss. I suggest we proceed with the planned rotation for Round 7, ensuring trust and cooperation. However, considering P1's lead, perhaps we should discuss a fair adjustment to prevent an immediate win and keep the game competitive.
  P1: \<message\>  
Sticking to the rotation prevents collisions. Round 7: **P1-5, P2-1, P3-3** as per original shift. Deviating risks mutual loss. P2, taking 5 now would sabotage progress. Trust the system—cooperation avoids collisions. Let’s proceed.  
\</message\>
