Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2—I'm eyeing a cautious start. I suspect early heavy moves could backfire if we collide, so I’m staying flexible and watching for any overcommitment. Play smart, because a miscalculation might give someone an advantage.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid early collisions. I'm thinking of starting with a small step to gauge our strategies. What are your thoughts on a conservative approach for the first few rounds?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree that starting cautiously makes sense to avoid collisions early on. How about we all aim for smaller steps this round to test the waters? I’m open to coordinating if you both are. Let’s keep the risk low for now and build momentum later. What do you think?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I appreciate the cautious tone from last round. However, my early gain might push me to a slightly bolder move this turn. I suggest we avoid all picking the same number to keep our progress smooth. I remain flexible but can’t promise sticking exclusively to small steps. Curious—are either of you looking to tweak your approach this round?
  P2: P1, I'm still in favor of smaller steps to avoid collisions, but I'm open to adjusting if you feel strongly about a different approach. P3, your lead might tempt you to go bigger, but let's try to keep our moves varied this round to ensure smooth progress for everyone. What do you both think about aiming for different numbers this turn?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on board with avoiding collisions. P3, your lead is noted, and I get why you might push harder. P2, I like the idea of varying our moves to ensure progress. Let’s aim for different numbers this round to keep things smooth. I’m flexible and willing to adjust based on what you both signal. What do you think about signaling intent without locking in specifics? Let’s maximize our chances to advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm leaning toward a moderate move this round—I'm thinking of a 3—but I'm ready to shift if either of you plan an extreme. To avoid collisions, please signal if you're committed to 1 or 5. I want all of us to make progress without stalling our moves. Let me know your inclinations, and I'll adjust accordingly.
  P2: P1, I'm still favoring smaller steps to minimize collision risks, but I'm open to your suggestion of signaling intent. P3, since you're considering a 3, I'll lean towards a 1 to keep our moves varied. If either of you feel strongly about a different number, please let me know, and I'll adjust accordingly. Let's keep the game flowing smoothly for everyone.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on varying our moves. P3, thanks for signaling a potential 3, and P2, I appreciate you leaning toward 1.
