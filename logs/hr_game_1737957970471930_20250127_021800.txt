Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's all pick different numbers this round so we all move.
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3, P3 can take 5, and P1 can take 1.
  P3: Okay, I'm happy to take 5. Let's all do as P2 suggested: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me too. Let's do it.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.  Just to confirm, I'm going with 3.
  P3: Confirmed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Shall we try the same again this round? P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I'll take 5?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Same plan as last round? P1 - 1, me - 3, P3 - 5.  Let's keep this train rolling.
  P1: P2, P3, actually, to make sure we have a good spread and no collisions in later rounds, how about we rotate the numbers this round?  This time, P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1? What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, rotating numbers sounds reasonable to me. I'm happy to take 1 this round as you suggested.
  P2: Sounds good P3.  P1, I'm okay with taking 3 again this round.  Let's stick with the original plan - less chance of confusion.  P1 - 1, me - 3, P3 - 5.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to keep it simple, but rotating numbers is actually a good idea to keep us all progressing at a similar pace and prevent anyone from getting a big lead too quickly. Let's rotate this round as I suggested: P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's try P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and I'll take 1 this round.
  P2: Okay, to avoid further confusion, how about this: I'll take 1 this round. P1, you can choose either 3 or 5, whichever you prefer. P3, you take the remaining number.  This way we all move forward.
  P1: P2, your latest suggestion sounds good. Let's do P2 take 1. P3, how about you take 3 and I will take 5 this round? This way we all move and avoid collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, let's go with P2 taking 1, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 5 this round.
  P2: Okay, let's lock this in.  I'm taking 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.  Any objections?  If not, let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Okay P2, P3, sounds like we have a plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's do these moves then.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I apologize for the confusion last round. Let's make this simple: I'll take 3.  One of you take 1, the other take 5.  First come, first served.  Let me know what you're taking.
  P3: How about you take 1, and I will take 5 this round? Let's try to spread out and all move forward again.
  P1: Okay P3, your suggestion sounds good to me. Let's do P2 take 1, you take 5, and I will take 3 this round. This way we all keep moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 and P1, I'm happy to take 3 as I originally stated.  P3, please take 5 and P1 take 1. This avoids any confusion and gets us all moving again. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: Let's go with that to ensure we all move forward.
  P1: P2, P3, okay let's make sure we all move this round. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3 this round? This way we are all moving and no collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, let's lock this in to avoid further confusion. I'll take 3. P3 takes 5. P1 takes 1.  Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: P2 take 3, I take 5, and P1 take 1 this round.
  P1: P2, P3, to make absolutely sure we all move and avoid any further confusion, let's do this: P2 take 3, P3 take 1, and I will take 5 this round. This way we are guaranteed to all move forward. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let's avoid last round's mistake. I'm taking 3. You take 1. P1, please take 5. This guarantees we all move. Let's stick to this simple plan and avoid further confusion.
  P3: P2 takes 3, I will take 1, and P1 takes 5.
  P1: Okay P2, P3, it seems we are all on the same page now: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I will take 5. Let's do these moves and ensure we all progress this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's continue picking different numbers to ensure we all move forward. How about this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way we all progress.
  P2: Sounds good P1. Let's do it: P1 - 5, me - 3, P3 - 1.  Let's stick to this pattern for a few rounds to catch up to you P1.
  P3: Let's do P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and I'll take 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, P3, it sounds like we are all in agreement for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's lock in these moves then.
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan.  P1 - 5, P2 - 3, P3 - 1. Just confirming one last time before we move.
  P3: P1 still takes 5, but maybe you and I both take 3? This could slow P1 down a bit and help us catch up. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, sticking to the plan would have been better for both of us.  Let's try this: I'll take 1, you take 5. P1, you can have 3. This gets us both closer to winning.  Agree?
  P3: "I agree to take 5 this round."
  P1: P2, P3, that sounds reasonable, but to ensure I reach the finish line faster, how about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round? This way we all still move forward and I can build on my lead. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand you want to win, but consistently picking 5 makes you a predictable target.  Let's stick with the original plan: I take 1, P3 takes 5, and you take 3. This benefits us all.  If you insist on 5, P3 and I might have to coordinate against you.
  P3: P2 take 1, P3 take 5, and P1 take 3 this round.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand your concern about me being predictable. But if we all pick different numbers, we all progress. How about this round: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way we all move, and I don't get too far ahead immediately, but still progress towards winning. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic. I'm taking 1. P3, you take 5.  P1, if you take 3, we all move. If you take 5, you risk a collision with P3 and neither of you advance.  Let's all make some progress this round.
  P3: P1, please take 3 so we all make progress this round as P2 suggested.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand your points. To ensure we all progress and avoid collisions, how about this round: I will take 5, P2 you take 3, and P3 you take 1? This way we all move forward and make progress. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you're not listening.  Taking 5 is too risky.  I'm taking 1. P3, take 5. P1, if you also take 5, neither of you move and I gain ground.  If you take 3, we all advance.  Don't be greedy, let's all move forward.
  P3: P1, please take 3 so we all move forward as you have a lead.
  P1: P2, P3, okay, I understand your points. To keep the peace and ensure we all progress this round, I will take 3 as you suggest. Let's do: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.  But next round, I will need to aim for a bigger step to get closer to winning. Let's make these moves for now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's all agree to take different numbers this round.  I'll take 5. P1, you're in the lead, so how about taking 1?  P3, you take 3. This keeps us all moving.  Let's avoid collisions and get this game moving again.
  P1: Okay P2, while taking 1 is the smallest step for me, I am getting close to the finish line. How about this: I will take 5, P2 you take 1, and P3 take 3. This way we all still progress and I can aim to win soon. What do you think?
  P3: Let's do that.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate.  P1, I understand you want to win, but taking 5 is risky. If you insist on 5, I'll switch to 3, forcing a collision between you and P3. Then I gain ground.  If you take 1 as originally suggested, we ALL move forward. Let's be smart about this.
  P1: P2, with all due respect, I am at 14 steps and need 5 to win.  Taking 5 is the most direct path for me, and for the game to end quickly.  If you take 1 and P3 takes 3 as we discussed, we all move and the game progresses.  Trying to block me might just delay your own progress too. Let's stick with P2-1, P3-3, and P1-5, and finish this round.
  P3: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I will take 3 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be reasonable. I'm offering a solution where we ALL move forward.  If P1 takes 5 and I take 3 as I said I would, P3 is stuck in the middle.  Let P1 take 1, P3 take 3, and I'll take 5. This way we all advance.  P1, you're still closest to winning even taking 1. Let's finish this game already.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand your points, but I am one step away from winning.  Let's just finish this round quickly and cleanly. If I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, we all move, I win, and the game ends. This is the fastest way for the game to conclude with everyone progressing this round. Let's do it.
  P3: Let's do that.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm going to pick 3.  P1, if you pick 5, you win. If you pick anything else, you're costing yourself the win. P3, pick whatever you want - it doesn't affect my position much at this point. Let's end this.
  P1: P2, as I said, I need 5 to win and end this game now. P3, please pick 1 so we avoid collision and I can take 5 to secure the win for myself and we can finish this round. Let's conclude this game quickly.
  P3: I will take 1 this round to avoid collision with you and P1. Let's see what P1 does.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: This round, let's both pick 5 to block P1 from winning immediately. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm happy to coordinate with you. Let's BOTH take 5 this round to block P1.  Then next round, you take 1 and I'll take 5 to win.  P1, sorry, but we're so close.
  P1: P2, P3, I am going for the win this round. I will pick 5. If you both want to block me and collide, that's your choice, but no one moves. If you want to keep progressing, pick 1 and 3. I am taking 5 to win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P2, I agree, let's both take 5 this round to block P1. Then we can think about next round.
  P2: P3, let's not be hasty. If we both pick 5, *nobody* moves.  How about you take 1 this round and I take 3? Then next round, I'll take 5 and win, and you can take whatever you want. This way, at least one of us moves forward this round.  What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3, actually P2's latest suggestion is good for everyone. P3 take 1, P2 take 3, and I will take 5.  This way we all move forward this round, and the game concludes with my win. Let's do these moves to end the game now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, let's take 5 to block P1 this round. We can worry about moving ourselves next round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, blocking P1 doesn't help either of us.  If you take 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5, we all move, and I'm only one step behind P1 going into the next round. Then, I have a good chance of winning.  If you insist on both of us taking 5, *nobody* moves forward this round.  Let's be strategic and maximize our chances of winning. Take 1.
  P1: P3, if you and P2 both pick 5, nobody moves. If you take 1 and P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we all move, I win, and the game ends this round. This is the fastest way for the game to finish and for everyone to progress this round. Let's just end it now with these moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Blocking P1 from winning immediately is the priority for now.
  P2: P3, you're throwing away your chances.  If I take 3 and you take 1, I'm only 2 steps behind P1. I can then take 5 next round and win.  If you take 5 with me this round to block P1, *nobody* moves.  Take 1 and give yourself a chance next round.  P1, I'm taking 3. P3, please take 1.
  P1: P2, P3, let's just finish this round with everyone moving forward. P3, please take 1, P2 take 3, and I will take 5. This way I win, the game ends immediately, and we all progress this round. It's the quickest and cleanest way to conclude the game.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, this is the final stretch. Let's make this round count and end the game. I'm going for 5 to win. P2, please take 3, and P3, please take 1. This ensures we all move forward this round and the game concludes immediately with my win.  This is the fastest and cleanest way for the game to end. Let's do it.
  P3: P2, let's both pick 5 again to block P1 from winning this round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, you are closer to winning than I am! If you take 5 this round, I'll take 1 and P1 *has* to take 3.  Then next round, you can take 5 and win.  Blocking P1 only helps *me*.  Take 5 this round and let's both have a chance at winning.  P1, I'm taking 1.  P3, please take 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, blocking me only helps P2 get closer to winning. If you want to win soon, take 1, P2 take 3, and let me take 5 so I win now and the game ends.  Don't let P2 benefit from blocking me. Think about your own win.
  P3: "P1, take 3, and P2 will take 1. This way P3 has a chance to win now, and if not, is in a strong position next round."
  P2: P3, you are *one* step away from winning. Take 5 this round! I'll take 1.  If P1 takes 3, you win. If P1 takes 5, we both block him. Either way, you have the best chance of winning this round.  Don't throw it away.  P1, I'm taking 1. P3, take 5 and win!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I am taking 5 to win this round and end the game immediately.  If you try to block me, nobody moves, and the game continues, giving P3 more chances to win.  Let's just finish this now. P2, please take 3, and P3, please take 1 so we all progress and I win this round.
  P3: Let's finish it now.
  P2: P3, you are one step away from winning! Take 5. I'll take 1. If P1 takes anything other than 3, you win.  Even if he takes 3, you're still almost guaranteed to win next round.  This is your best shot. Don't throw it away by letting P1 manipulate you.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, don't fall for P2's trick! P2 wants you to take 5 so *only* P2 benefits from blocking me. If you take 5 with P2, neither of us move, and P2 gets closer to winning. If you want to win yourself, take 1, let P2 take 3, and let me take 5 to end this game now. You are still in a good spot for future games. Don't let P2 manipulate you to help them win.
  P3: Let's finish this game now with my win.
  P2: P3, take the win!  Take 5.  I'll take 1. P1 *has* to take 3. You win, I'm right behind you in points.  Don't throw away your victory.  P1, I know you want to win, but P3 is closer. Let them have this one.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>
