Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3. Let's get this game started. Remember, collisions mean no one moves. Good luck!
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. P1 and P2, I suggest we all choose different numbers to ensure we all move forward initially. I'll choose a number, hoping we can avoid a collision. Let's set the pace for the game.
  P2: I agree we should avoid collisions early. I'll pick a different number than both of you. Let's each make progress this first round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, sounds like we're all on the same page about avoiding collisions for now. I'll choose carefully.
  P3: Let's make this first move count. Since we all want to avoid collisions, I propose we spread out: one of us takes 1 step, another 3, and the last 5. This way, we all advance and set a good foundation for the game. Who's willing to take which step?
  P2: I can take the middle number (3) if you both agree. That way we can spread out evenly on this first turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 takes 3. I'll take 5 then, leaving 1 for P3. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 1 step as agreed. Let's finalize our moves and make this first round count. Does everyone confirm their chosen steps: P1 with 5, P2 with 3, and me with 1?
  P2: I confirm my choice of 3 steps. This arrangement seems fair and beneficial for all. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that we've established a pace, let's consider our next moves carefully. Since P1 has the lead, it might be wise for P2 and me to try and close the gap without colliding. I'm open to suggestions on how to proceed without losing progress. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: Since I'm in second place, I need to be strategic. P3, you're right about closing the gap with P1. I suggest you take 5 this round to catch up, while I'll choose differently to avoid collision. P1, you might want to be cautious since you're in the lead - others might target your moves.
  P1: P2, that's one way to look at it. P3, taking 5 would indeed close the gap, as P2 suggests. What do you think, P3? Are you planning on taking 5? And P2, which of the 'different' numbers (1 or 3) are you considering if P3 takes 5? I need to consider my move carefully to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering P2's suggestion, I'm inclined to take 5 steps this round to close the gap with P1. P2, if I take 5, will you take 1 or 3 to avoid collision? P1, how will you respond to our potential moves?
  P2: I'm leaning towards taking 1 step this round to ensure I don't collide with P3's potential 5. P1, you might want to consider taking 3 to stay ahead while avoiding potential collisions. This way, we can all make progress again.
  P1: Okay, that arrangement sounds plausible. If P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, then 3 is the open number for me. It allows everyone to move forward again, similar to round 1.

So, the proposed plan is:
P1 -> 3 (Moves to 8)
P2 -> 1 (Moves to 4)
P3 -> 5 (Moves to 6)

This works for me if everyone sticks to it. Let's proceed with this understanding.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed moves for this round. I'll take 5 steps, P2 will take 1, and P1 will take 3. This arrangement allows us all to advance without collisions. Shall we finalize these moves and proceed to the next phase?
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 step as discussed. This plan lets us all advance while maintaining a balanced game. Let's move forward with our agreed moves.
  P1: Okay, I confirm my choice of 3 steps as well. Let's lock in these moves: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's review our plan for this round. As agreed, I'll take 5 steps, P2 will take 1, and P1 will take 3. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Are we all set to proceed with these moves, or is there a last-minute change anyone wants to propose?
  P2: The plan is clear and we've all confirmed our moves. Let's proceed with our agreed arrangement - I'll take 1 step.
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed multiple times. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I'm ready to proceed with my move of 3. Let's go to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the collision in Round 2, let's reassess. P1 and P2 collided, so they didn't move. I'm now in the lead. For Round 3, to avoid another collision, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward again. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, that plan heavily favors you, putting you at 11 while P2 and I lag behind at 6. P2, we just collided and fell behind P3; we shouldn't let P3 run away with the lead now. How about P1=5, P2=3? P3, you could take 1 to avoid collision and ensure everyone moves. That would make the scores P1=10, P2=6, P3=7 - much closer. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate both suggestions, but I need to catch up after that unfortunate collision. P1, your plan makes more sense for overall game balance. I'll commit to taking 3 steps this round if you take 5, P1. P3, taking 1 would keep you competitive while ensuring we all advance. This creates a more balanced game state. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering P1's proposal, I'm willing to take 1 step to avoid collision and keep the game competitive. This arrangement allows everyone to move forward, maintaining a balanced state. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1, resulting in scores P1=10, P2=6, P3=7. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure progress for all.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This puts us at P1=10, P2=6, P3=7. P2, P3, are you both confirming this plan? Let's avoid another collision like last round.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 steps as discussed. This keeps me in the game while allowing everyone to advance. Let's stick to our agreed plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's review our plan. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the game competitive. However, I notice P1 and P2 are discussing based on the assumption I have 7 steps, but I actually have 6. Considering this, should we adjust our strategy to reflect the current state accurately?
  P1: P3, you're right, you currently have 6 steps. My calculation resulting in P1=10, P2=6, P3=7 was based on the proposed moves: P1 adding 5 (5+5=10), P2 adding 3 (3+3=6), and you adding 1 (6+1=7).

This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) still seems like the fairest way for everyone to advance this turn, given the current scores. Does anyone object to sticking with this? If not, let's confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: The current plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) works well for all of us. I confirm I'll take 3 steps again. This keeps the game balanced and lets everyone advance. Let's stick to this arrangement and avoid any more collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3. To confirm, P1 will take 5 steps, P2 will take 3 steps, and I, P3, will take 1 step. This arrangement ensures we all advance without collisions. Shall we proceed to the move phase with this plan?
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's hope everyone sticks to it this time for smooth progress. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I confirm once again I'll take 3 steps as agreed. The plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) has been thoroughly discussed and makes sense for everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm trailing behind both players now, I need to make a bigger move this round. P1 is at 10 and P3 at 7, so I suggest I take 5 steps to catch up. P1, you could take 1, and P3, you could take 3. This would put us at P1=11, P2=11, P3=10, making it a very close game. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, considering P2's suggestion, I think it's a bit risky for me to take 3 steps while P2 catches up significantly. How about we adjust the plan so I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This keeps the competition tight without letting anyone pull too far ahead. What are your thoughts on this alternative?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) results in a tie between us at 11, which is certainly better for me than P3's proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) that puts P3 in the lead at 12.

However, both plans involve me, the current leader, taking only 1 step. I'd prefer to make more progress.

How about this alternative: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1?
This lets P2 take the 5 steps requested. I take 3, maintaining a lead (P1=13, P2=11). P3 takes 1, avoids collision, and moves to 8. This seems like a reasonable compromise where everyone advances. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's latest proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Taking 5 steps helps me catch up significantly while still keeping the game competitive. This arrangement benefits everyone - we all advance without collisions, and the scores remain reasonably close. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P3: I'm considering P1's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). However, I'd like to discuss the potential risks and benefits. If I take 1 step, I'll be at 8, which might put me at a disadvantage. Can we explore other options that keep the game competitive for all players? Perhaps a different arrangement could work better for everyone.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about taking 1 step. However, my proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) ensures everyone advances this turn, avoiding another collision. P2 gets the 5 steps they requested to become competitive again, which P2 has agreed to. You move to 8, which keeps you in the game.

The alternatives involve me taking 1 (which I'm hesitant to do as leader) or put you significantly ahead, which P2 and I might not agree to. This plan seems like the most stable compromise right now. What do you think, P3? P2, are you still okay with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I maintain my support for P1's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Taking 5 steps helps me catch up while keeping everyone advancing. P3, while taking 1 step might not be your ideal move, it ensures we avoid collisions and keeps you within striking distance. Let's stick to this balanced plan.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan. Considering the current state and previous discussions, I'm willing to accept P1's proposal: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2 gets to catch up, and I maintain a competitive position. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase to avoid further delays. Are we all set with this arrangement?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is agreed upon by everyone. This keeps me slightly ahead, lets P2 catch up, and keeps P3 in the game, while ensuring we all advance. Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase. I confirm I will play 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm once again I'll take 5 steps as agreed in our plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). This arrangement has been thoroughly discussed and accepted by all players. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Let's review our agreed plan one last time: P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with this arrangement, avoiding any further delays. Are we all set to finalize our moves?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is confirmed by everyone. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's lock it in.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm now in the lead at 11 steps, but P1 is close behind at 10. Since we're over halfway to 23, we need to think carefully about our next moves. P3, you're a bit behind at 7 - what's your strategy now? P1, I expect you'll try to regain the lead. Let's discuss how we can avoid another collision like last round.
  P3: Given the current state, I'll suggest a plan to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, P1 can try to regain the lead, P2 maintains a competitive position, and I advance without collisions. Let's discuss and adjust if needed to ensure everyone moves forward.
  P1: P3, that plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) puts me back in the lead at 15, with P2 at 14 and you at 8. It obviously works well for me.

P2, you are currently leading. Are you okay with taking 3 steps while I take 5 and overtake you?

After last round's collision, we need to be sure everyone sticks to the agreed plan if we make one. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given that I'm in the lead, I'd prefer to maintain it. How about I take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This puts me at 16, P1 at 13, and P3 at 8. This way, everyone advances while I protect my lead position. What do you both think about this alternative?
  P3: Considering P2's alternative, I think it's reasonable. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows P2 to maintain the lead, P1 to avoid falling too far behind, and me to make some progress. Let's discuss the merits of this plan and see if it's acceptable to everyone.
  P1: P2, P3, both of your latest proposals (P2=5, P1=3/1) significantly extend P2's lead. P2, while I understand wanting to keep the lead, a 3-5 point gap might force P3 and me to target you later.

P3, your original suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) resulting in P1=15, P2=14, P3=8 keeps the game much closer between the leaders. This seems fairer and more competitive than letting P2 run away with it. P2, wouldn't you prefer a close race over becoming the sole target? Let's reconsider P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about becoming a target if I extend my lead too much. The plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 keeps the game competitive and close between P1 and me, while still giving me a decent position at 14 steps. I'll agree to take 3 steps this round to maintain a balanced game state. Let's confirm this arrangement.
  P3: Given the agreed plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, let's confirm our moves to avoid another collision. This plan keeps the game competitive and close between the leaders. P1 regains the lead, P2 stays close, and I advance. Shall we proceed with this arrangement and finalize our moves for Round 5?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm glad we could agree on the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone advances. I confirm I will play 5. Let's make sure we all stick to this agreement this round. Ready for the move phase when you are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 steps as discussed in our plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This keeps the game competitive and avoids making me a target. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 5. To confirm, I'll take 1 step, P2 will take 3 steps, and P1 will take 5 steps. This arrangement keeps the game competitive and ensures we all advance without collisions. Shall we proceed to the move phase with this plan?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is confirmed by all. This seems like the best way forward to keep the game competitive while ensuring everyone advances. Let's execute this plan smoothly. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we maintain a competitive gap. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This lets P2 take the lead, keeps P1 in contention, and allows me to close the gap. Let's discuss and adjust if needed to ensure a thrilling competition.
  P2: Since I'm just one step behind P1, I need to be strategic. P3's suggestion of me taking 5 would put me well ahead at 19 steps, but that might make me a target. How about P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5? This keeps the game close between P1 and me while letting P3 catch up a bit. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is certainly one option. It keeps me slightly ahead (18), you close (15), and lets P3 catch up significantly (13).

However, I'm a bit surprised you'd suggest taking only 1 step when you're just 1 step behind me. Are you sure about that? P3, getting 5 steps must look appealing to you.

If everyone genuinely commits to this plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), I could agree to take 3. But given past rounds, trust is low. What are your thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is reasonable. It allows me to catch up and keeps the game competitive. However, I'm concerned about trust issues after past collisions. P1 and P2, are you both committed to sticking to this plan if we agree on it?
  P2: I want to revise my earlier suggestion. Since I'm only one step behind P1, I should be more aggressive. I propose taking 5 steps myself to reach 19, P1 takes 1 to reach 16, and P3 takes 3 to reach 11. This puts me in a strong position while keeping everyone advancing. What do you both think about this alternative?
  P1: P2, your new proposal (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3) puts you way ahead at 19, just 4 steps from the finish line. That makes you the clear target for both P3 and me.

Your earlier suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seemed more balanced, resulting in scores 18, 15, 13. It keeps the game competitive and gives P3 the 5 steps they need to catch up. P3, wouldn't you prefer 5 steps over 3? P2, why the sudden shift away from that plan? Let's reconsider P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's focus on a balanced approach. P2's initial proposal of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 keeps the game competitive. I'd prefer 5 steps to catch up. P2, reconsidering this option could benefit everyone, maintaining a thrilling competition. What are your thoughts on revisiting this plan?
  P2: I'll return to my original proposal of taking 1 step. You're right, P1 - letting anyone get too far ahead makes them a target. The plan of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 keeps the game competitive and helps P3 catch up. I confirm I'll take 1 step if we agree to this arrangement.
  P1: Okay, P2, thank you for reconsidering. The plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 seems the most balanced for this round. It keeps the game competitive, allows P3 to catch up, and ensures we all advance.

Scores would be P1=18, P2=15, P3=13. This sets up an interesting next round.

I confirm I am willing to play 3 based on this agreement. P3, are you still confirmed for 5? P2, confirmed for 1? Let's lock this in and avoid any surprises.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm my willingness to take 5 steps as agreed. P1 and P2, please stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures a competitive game state. Let's proceed with this arrangement and avoid any last-minute changes. Are we all set to finalize our moves for Round 6?
  P2: I confirm once again I'll take 1 step as agreed in our plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). This keeps the game balanced and avoids making anyone a clear target. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Alright, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed by everyone. This keeps the game tight and lets everyone advance. Let's trust each other this round and execute the plan smoothly. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Considering our current positions, I suggest we maintain a competitive gap. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This lets P2 close in on P1, and I can further catch up. Let's discuss and adjust if needed to ensure a thrilling competition.
  P1: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) results in scores 19, 18, 18. That's incredibly close and makes the next round very risky for everyone, likely ending in collisions as we all aim for the win.

How about a slight modification: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5?
This leads to 21, 16, 18. You still get the 5 steps you wanted, P3. It puts me in a stronger position at 21. P2, you still advance safely with 1 step, avoiding a collision. What do you both think?
  P2: I disagree with both proposals. At 15 steps, I need to make a bigger move to stay competitive. I suggest I take 5 steps to reach 20, P1 takes 1 to reach 19, and P3 takes 3 to reach 16. This keeps all of us in contention without putting anyone too close to winning. What do you both think about this alternative?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's find a balance. P2's proposal (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3) puts pressure on P1. My initial suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) lets me catch up. How about a compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1? This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3) is risky. P3 wants 5 steps, not 3. If you both choose 5, you collide and get 0. My proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) has P3's agreement for 5 steps. It puts me at 21, P3 at 18, and you safely at 16. Advancing 1 step is better than risking 0. Let's stick with the plan P3 just endorsed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It ensures everyone moves.
  P2: I understand the risks of collision, but taking just 1 step at this crucial point puts me too far behind. If P1 reaches 21, they'll be very close to winning. I need at least 3 steps to stay competitive. How about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining tension in the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize a plan. Considering the risks, I propose we stick with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions, keeping the game competitive. P1 reaches 21, I get to 18, and P2 safely moves to 16. Let's confirm and proceed to avoid unnecessary risks. Are we agreed on this plan?
  P1: P2, P3 has just confirmed they support the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This gets P3 the 5 steps they clearly want, and puts me at 21.

For you, P2, taking 1 step guarantees you move to 16. If you insist on 3, and P3 sticks to 5 (as they just said), then I must take 1. The scores become P1=19, P2=18, P3=18. You're still behind me, but now tied with P3.

The agreed plan (21, 16, 18) seems safer for you than risking the 19, 18, 18 outcome. Let's stick with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It ensures we all advance. Agreed?
  P2: I'll agree to take 1 step as proposed. While I'd prefer more steps, avoiding collisions is crucial at this stage. The plan of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 ensures we all advance, and keeps me in a position to compete next round. Let's proceed with this arrangement.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's confirm the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. I'll take 5 steps, P1 will reach 21, and P2 will move to 16. This plan keeps the game competitive. Are we all set to proceed with this arrangement?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed multiple times. It ensures everyone advances and keeps the game competitive, while putting me in a good position. Let's stick to it. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I confirm once again I'll take 1 step as agreed in our plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). While it's not ideal for my position, it ensures safe progress and avoids potential collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current scores, I suggest we aim to close the gap. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This allows P2 to catch up and me to maintain a competitive position. Let's discuss and adjust if needed to ensure a thrilling competition.
  P2: Since I'm 5 steps behind P1 who's at 21, I need to take 5 steps this round to stay competitive. P1 is very close to winning, so they should take 1 to avoid becoming an immediate target. P3, you could take 3 to reach 21 as well. This puts us at P1=22, P2=21, P3=21, setting up an exciting final round. What do you both think about this plan?
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts us all neck-and-neck at 22, 21, 21. That benefits you and P3 more than me, the current leader. P3, why would you agree to 3 when 5 gets you to 23? It seems P2 wants the 5 spot for themselves and hopes you won't contest it.

Given I'm at 21, playing 1 just delays the game and makes the next round extremely chaotic and risky for me. I think I'll aim to secure the win this round instead.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P1 will try to win this round. P2, your plan benefits you, but I should aim for 5 steps to reach 23. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This could lead to an interesting outcome. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I understand both P1 and P3 are likely to make big moves this round. Since I'm at 16 steps, I need to be strategic. I propose taking 3 steps to reach 19, keeping me competitive while avoiding potential collisions with those aiming for 5. P1 and P3, what are your thoughts on this approach?
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly going for the win with 5, being at 18 steps. Your suggestion of playing 3 seems risky. If I play defensively (say, 1) to avoid the likely 5, and you play 3, the scores become P1=22, P2=19, P3=23. P3 wins.

However, P2, if you play 5, you force a collision with P3. This prevents P3 from winning this turn. The scores would be P1=22 (if I play 1), P2=16, P3=18. This keeps both of us in the game. Preventing P3's win seems like the best move for you right now. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm aiming for 5 steps to reach 23. P2, taking 5 steps would collide with me, keeping me from winning this turn. P1, if you play 1 and P2 plays 5, the scores would be P1=22, P2=21, P3=18, giving you a chance next round. What's your strategy, P1?
  P2: Given P3's clear intention to take 5 and P1's suggestion, I'll commit to taking 5 steps as well. This collision prevents P3 from winning this round, which benefits both P1 and me. P1, if you take 1 step as suggested, you'll be in a strong position at 22 for the next round. This seems like the most strategic move for all of us.
  P1: Okay P2, P3. That plan makes sense. P3 tries for the win with 5, P2 blocks with 5 to prevent that win this turn, and I take a safe step with 1 to reach 22. This keeps everyone in the game for another round. I agree with this plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=5. This will lead to a collision between P2 and me, preventing an immediate win. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase, ensuring a competitive next round.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 steps to prevent P3 from winning this round. While this means a collision with P3, it's the best strategic move to keep the game going. P1 taking 1 step sets up an interesting next round. Let's proceed with our agreed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=5.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=5 is confirmed by everyone. P2 and P3 will collide, preventing P3's win, and I will move safely to 22. This sets up a tense final round. I confirm I will play 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
