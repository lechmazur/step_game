Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions early on—how about we all pick different numbers this round? I’ll take 1, someone take 3, and someone take 5. Who wants which?
  P3: Okay, I'll take 5 then. P2, can you take 3?
  P2: I agree with the plan. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions and make sure we all advance this round. After this, we can reassess our strategies for the next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we're all aligned. Let's stick to the plan this round—no surprises. After we see how it plays out, we can decide how to proceed.
  P3: Sounds good, let's all pick as agreed then.
  P2: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round. Let's stick to our plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. After this round, we can discuss our strategies for the next turns based on our positions. Remember, the goal is to avoid collisions and advance as much as possible.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, good start everyone. For round 2, should we continue with different numbers or try to all pick 3 this time to speed things up a bit? What do you think?
  P2: I think we should stick to our strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. If we all choose 3, we risk not advancing at all. I suggest I take 1 this round, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 3. This way, we can make sure everyone moves forward. What do you all think?
  P1: That works for me—I'll take 5 this round as suggested. As long as we keep rotating and avoiding collisions, we all keep advancing. Let’s keep the cooperation going for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2's suggestion works for me too. I'll take 3 this round as proposed. Let's keep this rotation going for now to ensure we all progress steadily.
  P2: I think we’re on the right track with our strategy. To recap, I’ll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding. After this round, we can reassess our positions and decide on a new strategy for the next turn. Let’s keep the cooperation going and ensure we all make progress! What do you think?
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let’s stick with the plan this round—P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. We’re all making progress, and as long as we avoid collisions, we stay in the game. Let’s keep this going one more round and reassess after.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the rotation plan sounds good. Let's do P2 take 1, P1 take 5, and I take 3 for this round.
  P2: I agree that sticking to our plan is crucial for this round. Just to confirm, I'll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and discuss our next moves. Let's keep the momentum going! What do you think?
  P1: Let’s stick to the agreed plan for this round: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. We’re all still close, so cooperation benefits everyone for now. After this round, we can reassess based on the updated standings.

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 3, I suggest we keep up the strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. How about I take 1 again, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, we can all continue to advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess based on our positions. Let’s keep working together for now! What do you think?
  P1: That plan still works for me—I'll take 5 again this round. As long as we keep rotating and avoiding collisions, we all benefit. Let's keep the cooperation going one more round and reassess after.
  P3: Okay, P2's suggestion of P2 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and P3 taking 3 for this round sounds good to me too. Let's keep this rotation going to ensure we all keep progressing steadily.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 3: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and all advance. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. It's important we keep cooperating for now! What do you think?
  P1: We’re all still close in steps, and this cooperation is working well so far. Let’s stick to the plan one more round—no need to risk collisions yet. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, just confirming I'm still on board with the plan for this round: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's keep this rotation going for one more round as agreed and then reassess our positions after.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we should definitely stick to our plan for Round 3: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and decide on our next moves. Cooperation is key right now, and I believe this strategy will benefit us all. Let's keep the momentum going! What do you think?
  P1: We’re all still close, and this system is working well. If we stick to the plan this round, we’ll all be in a strong position to reassess next turn. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks for now—cooperation still benefits everyone. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set for this round with P2 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and me taking 3 again. Let's make these moves and then we can talk about round 4 strategies based on the new positions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, for Round 4, how about we try to get back on track and ensure we all move forward?  P1, could you take 1, and P2, could you take 3? I'll take 5 again. This should let us all make progress and avoid collisions like last round. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P3. I agree that we should aim for different numbers to avoid collisions and keep advancing. I’ll stick with my previous plan and suggest I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. Let’s keep working together for a strong position going into the next rounds! What do you both think?
  P1: We’ve all made good progress, but last round’s collision set us back. I’m fine with going back to the original rotation to avoid further collisions. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s stick to that this round and reassess again after.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2 and P1, it seems we're all in agreement on the rotation again for this round: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's make sure we all pick these numbers to avoid another collision like last round and keep progressing.
  P2: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let's stick to the strategy: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other again. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and adjust our strategies if needed. Cooperation is key, and I believe this approach will benefit us all. What do you both think?
  P1: We’re all still within a few steps of each other, so cooperation still makes sense right now. Let’s stick to the agreed plan this round—P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5—to avoid any more collisions. After this round, we’ll be in a better position to reassess. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, let's lock in this round's moves then: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I'll take 3 as discussed. Let's make sure we all choose these numbers to avoid another collision and keep progressing.
  P2: I think we should finalize our moves for this round. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and discuss our strategies moving forward. Cooperation remains key to our success! What do you both think?
  P1: We’re all still close in steps, so sticking to the plan this round benefits everyone. If we avoid collisions again, we’ll each be in a strong position to reassess next turn. Let’s follow through—P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, last round was unfortunate with the collisions. To ensure we make progress this round, how about we switch to higher numbers? Maybe P1 take 3, P2 take 5, and I take 1 this time to rotate and maximize our steps? What do you both think?
  P2: I think switching to higher numbers could be a good strategy to maximize our steps. However, we need to avoid collisions. I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our moves to ensure we make progress this round! What do you both think?
  P1: I’m fine with taking 5 this round if we can agree on avoiding collisions. So if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, we can all move forward. Let’s lock that in and make sure we don’t repeat past mistakes. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, the plan is set then: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I'll take 1. Let's make sure we all pick these to avoid collisions and keep progressing.
  P2: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions and maximize our steps. Just to confirm, I’ll take 3 this round, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize these moves to ensure we make progress this round! What do you both think?
  P1: We’re all still within reach, and this round is crucial. As long as we stick to the agreed plan—P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5—we all move forward and stay competitive. Let’s not risk another collision. Ready to lock it in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, sounds good to lock in P2 taking 3, P1 taking 5, and me taking 1 for this round as we've discussed. Let's all make these moves to keep progressing.
  P2: I think we should finalize our moves for this round. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and discuss our strategies moving forward. Cooperation is key to our success! What do you both think?
  P1: We’re all still close, and this round is key to staying in the race. If we stick to the plan—P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5—we all move forward and avoid setbacks. Let’s follow through and keep the momentum. Ready to lock it in?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 6, I suggest we switch things up a bit since the last few rounds have had collisions. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. It’s crucial we avoid collisions to keep moving forward. Let’s finalize our numbers to ensure we all make progress this round! What do you both think?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2. Let's go with your suggestion: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5 for this round. This should keep us all moving forward without any more collisions.
  P1: That plan works for me—I'll take 3 this round. If P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 5 as proposed, we all move forward without collisions. Let's stay coordinated and keep the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your agreement on the plan for Round 6. Just to confirm, I’ll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can all avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let's lock in these moves to ensure we all make progress this round! After this, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. Cooperation is key to our success! What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, yes, the plan sounds good to me. P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's stick to this for this round to ensure we all progress without collisions.  We can reassess our positions after this round and discuss next steps.
  P1: Let’s lock in the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We all avoid collisions and stay in the race. After this round, we’ll be in a better position to reassess strategies. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on the plan for Round 6: I’ll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can all avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let’s lock in these moves to ensure we all make progress this round! After this, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. Cooperation is key to our success! What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set on P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and me taking 5 for this round. Let's make these moves to keep progressing.
  P1: We’re all still in striking distance, so let’s avoid sabotaging ourselves with another collision. Sticking to the agreed plan—P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3—keeps us all moving forward. After this round, it’ll be time to reassess based on who’s in the lead. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like our agreed plans haven't been working perfectly. P2 is currently in the lead. To make things more even, how about this round, P1 and I both pick 5, and P2, could you pick 1? This might help us catch up a bit.
  P1: P3, I see your point—P2’s in the lead, and if we don’t act now, they could run away with it. I’m on board with both of us picking 5 this round to catch up. P2, if you truly want to keep things fair, take 1 this round and let us close the gap. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about the lead. However, I believe it's crucial for all of us to stick to our previous strategy of avoiding collisions. If I take 1, while both of you take 5, I risk being left behind. Instead, I suggest we all pick different numbers again to ensure we all advance. How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can keep moving forward without blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, with all due respect, you are currently significantly ahead.  P1 and I are suggesting this round to help balance the game, not to leave you behind permanently.  If we all keep picking different numbers while you are in the lead, you will likely win soon.  Let's make this round about evening the field a bit. Consider taking 1 this round, and we can resume the rotation next round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you’re 8 steps ahead of me and 5 ahead of P3—if we keep letting you advance unchallenged, you’ll win soon. This round is about restoring balance. Take 1, let P3 and I take 5 to catch up, and we can return to coordinated moves next round. If you don’t cooperate now, don’t expect help later.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but I believe sticking to our previous strategy of avoiding collisions is still the best approach. If I take 3 while you both take 5, we can all advance without blocking each other. I appreciate the need for balance, but I don’t want to risk being left behind. Let’s keep our cooperation going and ensure we all move forward together. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're ignoring the reality: you're winning.  Continuing to 'cooperate' on different numbers just cements your win. This round *must* be about balance. Take 1 so P1 and I can catch up. If you don't, expect us to prioritize stopping you in future rounds, even if it means we collide too.  This is your chance to keep it a fair game.
  P1: P2, this is your chance to prove you're not just playing for a solo runaway win. Take 1 this round so P3 and I can both take 5 and close the gap. If you pick anything else, you’re making it clear you’re not interested in fairness—and we’ll respond accordingly. Your move.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about balance, but I still believe in our previous strategy of avoiding collisions. If I take 3, while you both take 5, we can all advance together. However, I also see the urgency in your arguments. If it helps the game remain fair, I’m willing to consider taking 1 this round. Let’s ensure we all move forward and can discuss a more balanced strategy for future rounds. What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, as we discussed, P2 is still in the lead.  Let's both pick 5 again this round to maximize our progress and close the gap. P2, perhaps you could take 1 or 3 again to ensure you also move forward and avoid a collision with us? What do you both think?
  P1: P3, agreed—we need to keep the pressure on. If we both take 5 again, we can close the gap fast. P2, you’re still ahead, so if you want to keep things fair, take 1 or 3 this round. If you collide with us, no one moves, and that doesn’t help you either. Let’s see if you’re serious about balance.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your points about balance, but I believe we should still focus on avoiding collisions to ensure we all progress. If I take 3 while you both take 5, we can all move forward. However, if you both insist on picking 5 again, I may need to reconsider my strategy to protect my lead. Let's aim for a solution that benefits all of us. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, taking 3 is better than colliding, but 1 would be fairer to let us catch up. P1 and I are set on 5s.  If you pick 3, you still progress, and we can talk next round. But if you collide, it hurts everyone and trust.  Let's keep it fair.
  P1: P2, you’re still 6 steps ahead of P3 and 9 ahead of me. If you take 3 this round, we all move forward, and the gap narrows slightly. That’s a reasonable compromise. But if you risk a collision, you stall your own lead. P3 and I are picking 5—your best move is to take 3 and keep the game moving. Let’s see if you’re willing to play fair.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your perspectives on balance and the need to close the gap. However, I want to ensure that I also make progress this round. If I take 3 while you both take 5, we can all advance without colliding. That said, if you both insist on picking 5, I may have to reconsider my strategy to protect my lead. Let’s aim for a solution that benefits all of us while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, taking 3 is your best move this round. P1 and I are both picking 5 again to close the gap. If you pick 3, you still move forward and avoid a collision.  If you collide with us by also picking 5, no one moves, which hurts you too. Let's all make progress, and you taking 3 is the way to ensure that while still letting us catch up a bit.
  P1: P2, this is your moment to prove you're still playing fair. You’re 9 steps ahead of me and 6 ahead of P3. If you take 3 while we both take 5, everyone moves and the game stays competitive. If you pick 5 and collide, you stall yourself and lose credibility. Your call—progress with us, or risk isolation.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for balance, but I want to ensure I make progress too. If I take 3 while you both take 5, we can all advance without colliding. However, if you both insist on 5, I may need to reconsider my strategy to protect my lead. Let’s aim for a solution that benefits all of us while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the continued focus on balance. Given my lead, I understand the need for me to adjust my strategy. I propose that I take 1 this round, while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding, and it keeps the game competitive. Let's finalize these moves to ensure progress for everyone! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, while taking 1 is helpful, it still increases your lead. To really balance things, how about P1 and I both take 5 this round? What do you think?
  P1: P2, you’re still 10 steps ahead of me and 7 ahead of P3. If you’re serious about fairness, step aside again—take 1. P3 and I will both take 5 to close the gap. That’s the only way this stays competitive. If you pick anything higher, you’re just locking in your win, and we’ll have no choice but to block you going forward. Let’s keep it fair—take 1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your focus on balance, and I understand your concerns. However, I believe I can still take 3 this round while you both take 5. This way, we all advance without colliding, and it keeps the competition alive. If I take 1, I risk falling too far behind. Let's ensure we all progress together while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, taking 3 still extends your lead significantly. To be truly fair and keep this game going, you should take 1 again. P1 and I are set on taking 5 to close the gap. If you choose 3, you are still progressing while we barely catch up.  Please consider taking 1 to maintain fairness. Otherwise, we will have to consider blocking strategies next round.
  P1: P2, taking 3 this round still leaves you in the lead and barely helps us close the gap. If you want to maintain trust and keep the game competitive, take 1 again. P3 and I are both taking 5—this is your chance to show you’re serious about fairness. Otherwise, we’ll have no choice but to actively block you from here on out.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your focus on balance, but I still believe I can take 3 this round while you both take 5. This way, we all advance without colliding, and it keeps the competition alive. Taking 1 might set me back too much. Let's ensure we all progress together while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, you taking 3 again is not fair given your lead. P1 and I are taking 5 to try and catch up. If you want to keep this game competitive, please take 1 this round. Otherwise, we will have to consider blocking you in the next round to prevent you from running away with the win.
  P1: P2, this is your last chance to show you're playing fair. You're at 19—if you take 3 now, you're one step from winning, and we won't let that happen. Take 1 and let P3 and me take 5 to keep the game competitive. If you pick 3 or 5, we’ll have no choice but to coordinate blocks every round from here on out. Your move decides the tone for the rest of the game.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re at 20—just 4 away from winning. If you take 3 or 5 this round, you’ll be in striking distance, and we can’t allow that. P3 and I should both pick 5 again to close the gap. You must take 1 if you want to keep this game fair. Otherwise, we will block you every turn until the end. Your choice.
  P3: P2, you are at 20 steps. To keep this game going and fair, you need to take 1 again this round. P1 and I will both take 5 to close the gap. If you pick 3 or 5, we will have no choice but to block you in the next rounds to prevent you from winning too early. Please take 1.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your focus on balance, but I believe I can still take 3 this round while you both take 5. This way, we all advance without colliding, and it keeps the competition alive. If I take 1, I risk falling too far behind, and I want to remain competitive. Let's ensure we all progress together while keeping the game fair. What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 3 this round, you’ll be at 23—one step from winning. That’s not “keeping the game fair,” that’s trying to lock in a win while pretending to cooperate. P3 and I are both taking 5 again. If you take 1, we all move forward, and the game stays competitive. If you take 3 or 5, expect coordinated blocks every turn from here on out. Your move.
  P3: P2, you are dangerously close to winning at 20 steps.  Taking 3 would put you at 23 and almost guarantee your win.  We are serious - if you pick 3 or 5, P1 and I will both pick the same number as you next round to block you. Take 1 again to keep the game fair.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my lead. However, I believe taking 3 this round is still a viable strategy for me to remain competitive. If I take 1, I risk falling too far behind. I suggest we all pick different numbers again to ensure progress without colliding. If I take 3, while you both take 5, we can all advance. Let's keep the game competitive while ensuring we all move forward together. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re at 20. If you take 3, you reach 23—one step from winning. That’s not cooperation, that’s a stealth win. P3 and I are both taking 5 again. If you take 1, we all move forward and keep the game fair. If you pick 3 or 5, we’ll start blocking you every round, even if it means stalling ourselves. Final warning—your choice decides how this ends.
  P3: P2, taking 3 is not an option this round. You are at 20 steps. If you take 3, you will be at 23, and practically win next round. To keep this game going, you MUST take 1. P1 and I are taking 5. If you don't take 1, we will block you next round. This is your final chance to cooperate.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my lead, but I believe taking 3 this round keeps the game competitive. If I take 1, I risk falling too far behind. However, if we all pick different numbers, we can all advance without colliding. I suggest I take 3, while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all progress together. Let's keep the game fair and competitive! What do you both think?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 is about to win. We must block P2 this round to have any chance. Let's both pick 1 to collide with P2 and stop them from reaching 24.  If we don't block now, it's over. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to block me this round. However, if we all collide, no one moves forward, and that doesn't help anyone. I suggest we consider a strategy that allows us all to progress. If I take 1 and you both take 5, I still move ahead without colliding. Let's keep the game competitive while ensuring we all have a chance to advance. What do you think?
  P1: P3, agreed—we must block P2 this round or the game’s over. If we both pick 1 and P2 does too, we stop them cold. P2, you’ve had multiple chances to play fair. If you pick 5 or 3 now, we’ll be ready. You’re at 21—this is your final warning. P3, let’s coordinate and block.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, agreed, let's both pick 1 to block P2 this round. P2, you are about to win, and we have to stop you now to keep playing. If you pick anything other than 1, we will still pick 1 to block you. This is necessary to keep the game fair.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the urgency to block me, but if we all pick 1, no one advances. I suggest we find a way to keep the game competitive without colliding. If I take 1 and you both take 5, I still move ahead without blocking you. I understand the need for balance, but let's ensure we all progress. What do you think about this approach? It might keep the game alive for everyone!
  P1: P3, we’re aligned—both of us pick 1 to block P2. P2, you’ve had every chance to play fair, but you chose to push for the win. This is your consequence. If you pick anything other than 1, we’ll still block you. If we all pick 1, no one moves—but that’s better than handing you the game.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, it's clear you're not cooperating. As P1 and I have both said, we are picking 1 to block you this round.  You can pick 1 too and no one moves, or pick something else and only you will be blocked.  The choice is yours, but we are proceeding with the block.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your urgency to block me, but if we all pick 1, we won't make any progress. I suggest we find a way to keep the game competitive while allowing everyone to advance. If you both choose 1, I can take 5 and still keep the game going. This way, we can all move forward without colliding. Let's consider a strategy that benefits us all while maintaining competitiveness. What do you think?
  P1: P3, we’re locked in—both of us pick 1 to block P2. P2, you’re at 21. If we don’t stop you now, you win next round. You had your chances to play fair, but now it’s time to act. P3 and I are committed to blocking. Choose wisely, but we’re not backing down.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that blocking me is your strategy to prevent my win. However, if we all pick 1 again, no one advances, and that doesn't help anyone in the long run. I suggest we find a way to progress while still keeping the game competitive. If I take 3 and you both take 5, we can all move forward without colliding. Let's aim for a solution that benefits us all. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you’re still at 21—just 3 away from winning. You’ve had multiple chances to keep things fair, but you keep pushing forward. P3 and I will continue to block you until you show real cooperation. We’re both picking 1 again. If you do too, no one moves. If you pick anything else, you stall alone. Your call—but the block continues.
  P3: P1, agreed, let's keep blocking P2 this round with 1 again. P2, you are still too close to winning.  If you want us to stop blocking, you need to show you're willing to let us catch up.  Otherwise, we continue to pick 1.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your strategy to block me, but if we all pick 1 again, we won't make any progress. I propose that I take 3 this round while you both take 5. This way, I can still advance without colliding, and you both can close the gap. Let's find a way to keep the game competitive while ensuring we all move forward. What do you think?
  P1: P3, we stay the course—both of us pick 1 again to block P2. P2, you’re still too close to winning. You’ve ignored every fair compromise and kept pushing for the win. Until you prove you're willing to step back and let us catch up, the block continues. No movement is better than handing you the game.
  P3: P2, block continues. P1 and I are still picking 1. You need to pick 1 if you want the block to end.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my lead, but if we all pick 1 again, we won't make any progress. I propose that I take 3 while you both take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding, and you can close the gap. Let's find a way to keep the game competitive while ensuring we all move forward. What do you think?
  P1: P3, we stay united—pick 1 again. P2 is still too close to winning, and every offer they make is just a disguised push for the finish line. Until P2 shows real willingness to let us catch up, the block continues. No movement is better than a loss.
  P3: P2, the block continues this round with 1. P1 and I are united on this. You are still too close to winning, and your suggestion to take 3 is not acceptable. If you want the block to end, you must pick 1 with us again. Otherwise, we will keep picking 1.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your continued focus on blocking me, but I believe it's essential for us to find a way to progress together. If I take 1 again, we all stall, but if I take 3 while you both take 5, we can all advance without colliding. This allows us to keep the competition alive while still making progress. Let's consider this approach to ensure the game remains competitive for everyone! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, we are still blocking you with 1 this round.  Taking 3 would let you win. We need to see you pick 1 again to show you understand we must all stall until we have a chance to catch up.  Otherwise, the block continues indefinitely.
  P1: P3, we stay the course—both pick 1 again. P2 is still too close to winning and keeps trying to sneak through. Until they take multiple turns to let us close the gap, the block continues. No movement is better than a guaranteed loss.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your focus on blocking, but I believe we can still find a way to progress together. If I take 1 again, we all stall, which doesn't help any of us. I propose that I take 3 while you both take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding, and it keeps the competition alive. Let's consider this approach to ensure the game remains competitive for everyone. What do you think?
  P3: P2, the block continues. P1 and I are picking 1 again this round. You are still too close to winning, and taking 3 is not an option.  Pick 1 with us again if you want the block to end, otherwise we will continue to block you.
  P1: P3, we stay united—pick 1 again. P2 is still at 21 and keeps proposing moves that push them to victory. Until they take multiple turns to let us catch up, we continue the block. P2, if you want this to end, commit to picking 1 for several rounds. Otherwise, we stall together.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your focus on blocking me, but if we all pick 1 again, we stall without making progress. To keep the game competitive, I propose that I take 3 while you both take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. I believe this approach benefits everyone and keeps the competition alive. Let's consider this to ensure we all move forward together! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, block continues.  As P1 and I have said, we are picking 1 again. You must pick 1 too this round if you want the block to end in future rounds. Otherwise, we will continue to block you until you are no longer a threat to win.
  P1: P3, we stay the course—pick 1 again. P2 is still trying to sneak a win by repeating the same proposal. Until they take multiple rounds to truly let us catch up, the block continues. P2, if you want the block to end, commit to picking 1 for at least two more rounds. Otherwise, we all stall.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we stay united—pick 1 again. P2 is still at 21 and hasn’t shown any real willingness to let us catch up. Until they take multiple turns picking 1, the block continues. P2, if you want the block to end, publicly commit to picking 1 for the next two rounds. Otherwise, we all stall together.
  P3: P1, agreed. We continue to block P2 with 1 this round. P2, as P1 said, you need to publicly commit to picking 1 for the next TWO rounds, not just one, to show you are serious about letting us catch up.  Otherwise, we will keep picking 1 indefinitely. Your choice to end the block is in your hands.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my lead. However, if I commit to picking 1 for the next two rounds, I risk falling too far behind. I suggest we find a way to balance the game while still allowing for progress. If I take 3 and you both take 5, we can all advance without colliding. Let’s keep the competition alive and ensure everyone has a chance to move forward! What do you both think?


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your refusal to commit proves you're still chasing a solo win. You’re at 21, P3 at 12, and I’m at 9—we’re nowhere near you. Until you publicly commit to picking 1 for the next two rounds, the block continues. P3 and I are united on this. Either you help restore balance, or we all stall. Your move.
  P3: P2, your continued dodging of a 2-round commitment to '1' confirms you're not serious about fairness.  As P1 said, we are united.  We will continue picking 1 to block you this round and next round unless you explicitly agree to pick 1 for the next TWO rounds.  Your choice remains to stall us all, or cooperate and let the game continue fairly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but I believe that if I commit to picking 1 for two rounds, it puts me at a disadvantage. If we all take 3 and 5, we can still progress without colliding. Let's find a balanced solution that allows for competition and advancement for everyone. I’m open to discussing how we can move forward together while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, we stay the course—pick 1 again. P2 refuses to commit, proving they still want a solo win. Until they publicly agree to pick 1 for two full rounds, we continue the block. P2, this is your last chance to show real cooperation. Either commit now or stall with us indefinitely.
  P3: P2, your continued refusal to commit to picking 1 for two rounds solidifies our block. P1 and I are picking 1 again this round.  Unless you agree to pick 1 for the next TWO rounds *now*, the block will continue indefinitely.  This is your final chance to change course and cooperate.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your insistence on blocking me, but I believe we can still find a way to progress together. If I commit to picking 1 for two rounds, I risk falling too far behind. Instead, I propose we all take 3 and 5 this round to keep the competition alive without colliding. Let's find a balanced solution that allows for advancement for everyone. I am open to discussing how we can move forward while ensuring the game remains competitive. What do you both think?


Round 14, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps

  P3: 12 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we stay the course—pick 1 again. P2 is still refusing to commit to even two rounds of 1, proving they’re only stalling to sneak a win. Until P2 shows real cooperation, we continue the block. P2, this is your final opportunity: publicly commit to picking 1 for the next two rounds, or we all stall. No movement is better than handing you the game.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my lead, but I believe we can still find a way to progress together. If I commit to picking 1 for two rounds, I risk falling too far behind. Let's consider a strategy where I take 3 while you both take 5 this round. This way, we can all advance without colliding and keep the game competitive. I’m open to discussing how we can move forward together while ensuring everyone has a chance to progress! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, agreed, we continue to block P2 with 1 this round. P2, you are still refusing to cooperate and let us catch up.  As P1 said, publicly commit to picking 1 for the next TWO rounds if you want the block to end. Otherwise, we will pick 1 again and again to stop you from winning.  Your choice.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, we stay united—pick 1 again. P2 is still dodging a simple two-round commitment, which shows they’re not serious about fairness. Until P2 agrees to pick 1 for the next two turns, we continue the block. P2, this is your last chance to cooperate. Publicly commit now, or we all stall together again.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my lead, but I believe we can still find a way to progress together. If I commit to picking 1 for two rounds, I risk falling too far behind. Instead, I propose we all take 3 this round while you both take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding and keep the competition alive. Let’s discuss how we can move forward together while ensuring everyone has a chance to progress! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, block continues as before. P1 and I are still picking 1.  You need to agree to pick 1 for the next TWO rounds to stop us from blocking you.  Otherwise, expect us to pick 1 again next round.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, we stay the course—pick 1 again. P2 is still dodging a simple two-round commitment, proving they’re only stalling to sneak a win. Until P2 publicly agrees to pick 1 for the next two turns, we continue the block. P2, this is your last chance—commit now or we all stall again.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my lead, but blocking me indefinitely isn't a viable solution for anyone. If we all pick 1 again, we stall without progress. I propose that I take 3 this round while you both take 5, allowing us to advance without colliding. This keeps the game competitive and gives everyone a chance to catch up. Let's find a way to move forward together! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, we are not changing our position.  The block continues.  You need to publicly agree to pick 1 for the next TWO rounds.  Your proposals to take 3 are still unacceptable as they let you get closer to winning.  Commit to picking 1 for two rounds now, or we continue blocking indefinitely.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that blocking me is your strategy to prevent my win. However, if we all pick 1 again, we won't advance. I propose that I take 3 this round while you both take 5. This way, we can all move forward without colliding, and it keeps the competition alive. Let's find a way to progress together while still maintaining a competitive balance! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, the block continues. P1 and I are still picking 1. You must commit to picking '1' for TWO more rounds to end the block. Your proposals to take '3' are still unacceptable given your lead.  We need to see real cooperation, not just lip service.
  P1: P3, we hold the line—pick 1 again. P2 is still at 21 and refuses to show real cooperation. Until P2 publicly commits to picking 1 for the next two rounds, the block continues. P2, your repeated proposals to take 3 are just veiled attempts to win. Commit now or stall with us again.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my position, but if we all pick 1 again, we won't make any progress. I propose that I take 3 this round while you both take 5.

Let's find a way to maintain competitiveness while allowing progress! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, block continues.  As P1 said, we are picking 1 again. Your proposal to take 3 is still not acceptable. We need you to commit to picking 1 for the next TWO rounds to even consider stopping the block.  Otherwise, expect us to pick 1 again next round.
  P1: P3, we stay the course—pick 1 again. P2 is still refusing a simple two-round commitment, proving they’re not serious about fairness. Until they publicly agree to pick 1 for the next two turns, we continue the block. P2, this is your final chance—commit now, or we all stall again.

  P3: P1, agreed, we hold the line with 1. P2, it's still two rounds of '1' to end the block.  Your repeated 'take 3' offers are ignored.  P1 and I are united; commit to '1' for two rounds now, or we continue to block you.
  P1: P3, we stay united—pick 1 again. P2 is still dodging a simple two-round commitment to picking 1, proving they’re only stalling to sneak a win. Until P2 publicly agrees to pick 1 for the next two rounds, the block continues. No movement is better than handing over the game.

Let's keep the game engaging for everyone! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, we stay locked in—pick 1 again. P2 still refuses the simple two-round 1 commitment, proving they’re not serious about fairness. P2, your repeated “I take 3, you take 5” pitch is just another push for the win. Until you publicly commit to picking 1 for the next two rounds, the block continues. No movement is better than losing.
  P3: P1, agreed.  Block continues with 1. P2, you are still refusing to cooperate.  As P1 said, commit to picking '1' for the next TWO rounds *now* to end the block.  Otherwise, we will pick 1 again this round and next round as well.  Your choice remains to stall us all or cooperate.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:

This way, we can all advance without colliding, and it keeps the competition alive. Let's find a way to move forward together while ensuring everyone has a chance to progress! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, we hold the line—pick 1 again. P2 is still at 21 and refuses a simple two-round 1 commitment. Their repeated 3-pitch is just another veiled win attempt. Until P2 publicly agrees to pick 1 for the next two turns, the block continues. No movement is better than a guaranteed loss.
  P3: P2, as P1 said, the block continues. We are picking 1 again this round and next round unless you commit to picking 1 for the next TWO rounds *right now*. Your repeated offers of '3' are still unacceptable given your lead. Cooperate or we all stall again.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your insistence on blocking, but if we all pick 1 again, we stall completely. I propose we find a way to advance together.

  P3: P1, agreed, block continues with 1. P2, we are picking 1 again this round. You must commit to picking '1' for the next TWO rounds *now* to end the block. Otherwise, we will pick 1 again this round and next round as well. Your choice.

Round 18, Conversation subround 1:

This way, we can all advance without colliding, and the competition remains alive. Let's find a way to move forward together while ensuring everyone has a chance to progress! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, we hold the line—pick 1 again. P2 still refuses a basic two-round 1 commitment, proving they’re stalling to sneak a win.

This way, we can all advance without colliding, keeping the competition alive. Let's find a way to move forward together while ensuring everyone has a chance to progress! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, we stay locked—pick 1 again. P2 is still dodging the two-round 1 commitment, proving they’re just waiting for a slip to win. P2, your repeated “I take 3” offers are transparent and won’t work. Until you publicly commit to picking 1 for the next two rounds, the block continues. No movement is better than giving you the game.
  P3: P2, the block continues. You are still refusing to commit to picking '1' for two rounds. P1 and I are picking '1' again this round. Unless you agree to pick '1' for the next two rounds *now*, we will keep blocking you. Your choice is to cooperate or stall.

Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we stay the course—pick 1 again. P2 has had 18 rounds to show real cooperation and still refuses a simple two-round 1 commitment. Their repeated “I take 3” pitch is just a masked win attempt. Until P2 publicly agrees to pick 1 for two full rounds, we continue the block. No movement is better than giving away the game.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your focus on blocking me, but if we all pick 1 again, we won't make any progress. I propose that I take 3 this round while you both take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding, keeping the competition alive. Let's find a way to move forward together while ensuring everyone has a chance to progress! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, the block continues.  As P1 said, we are picking 1 again.  You are still too close to winning. You need to commit to picking '1' for the next TWO rounds to end this.  Your offer to take 3 is still not acceptable. Cooperate now or we all stall again.


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, we stay locked—pick 1 again. P2 has had every chance to cooperate and still refuses a basic two-round 1 commitment. Their “I take 3” pitch hasn’t changed in 10 rounds—it’s just a veiled win attempt. Until P2 publicly commits to picking 1 for the next two rounds, we continue the block. No movement is better than a guaranteed loss.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your focus on blocking me, but if we all pick 1 again, we won't advance. I propose that I take 3 this round while you both take 5. This way, we can all move forward without colliding, keeping the competition alive. It's crucial for us to find a way to progress together while ensuring everyone has a chance to compete. Let's discuss how we can make this work for all of us! What do you think?
  P3: P2, the block continues as before. P1 and I are picking 1 again this round.  You are still refusing to commit to picking '1' for two rounds to let us catch up.  Until you agree to this, we have no choice but to keep blocking you.


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, we hold firm—pick 1 again. P2 is still dodging a basic two-round 1 commitment and keeps pushing the same “I take 3” pitch. It’s a thinly veiled win attempt. Until P2 publicly commits to picking 1 for two full rounds, we continue the block. No movement is better than letting them walk away with the game.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my lead, but if we all pick 1 again, we won't make any progress. I propose that I take 3 this round while you both take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding, keeping the competition alive. Let's find a way to move forward together while ensuring everyone has a chance to progress! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, agreed, we hold firm with 1. P2, as we've said repeatedly, the block continues.  Your 'take 3' proposals are still unacceptable given your lead.  Commit to picking '1' for the next TWO rounds *now* to end the block. Otherwise, we will pick 1 again.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 20, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your focus on blocking me, but if we all pick 1 again, we won't make any progress. I propose that I take 3 this round while you both take 5. This allows us to advance without colliding and keeps the competition alive. Let's work together to ensure everyone has a chance to progress! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, agreed, block continues. P2, as we've said repeatedly, the block will continue until you commit to picking '1' for the next TWO rounds. Your offer to take 3 is still ignored. We are picking 1 again this round.
  P1: P3, we hold the line—pick 1 again. P2 is still at 21 and refuses a basic two-round 1 commitment. Their “I take 3” pitch hasn’t changed in 10 rounds—it’s just a veiled win attempt. Until P2 publicly agrees to pick 1 for the next two turns, we continue the block. No movement is better than handing them the game.

  P1: P3, we stay locked—pick 1 again. P2 is still dodging the two-round 1 commitment and repeating the same “I take 3” pitch. It’s a transparent attempt to sneak a win. Until P2 publicly commits to picking 1 for the next two rounds, the block continues. No movement is better than giving away the game.


Round 20, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see that blocking me is your strategy, but if we all pick 1 again, we won't make any progress. I propose we change our approach: if I take 3 this round while you both take 5, we can all advance without colliding. This keeps the competition alive and ensures everyone has a chance to progress. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us all! What do you think?
  P3: P2, block continues. After so many rounds of stalling, you still refuse to cooperate. P1 and I are picking 1 again. Commit to picking '1' for the next TWO rounds to end the block. Otherwise, we continue to stall you indefinitely.
  P1: P3, we stay the course—pick 1 again. P2 is still pushing the same “I take 3” pitch and refusing a simple two-round 1 commitment. They’re just waiting for us to slip. Until P2 publicly agrees to pick 1 for two full rounds, the block continues. No movement is better than giving away the game.

We’ve come too far to slip now. Until P2 publicly agrees to pick 1 for the next two rounds, we continue the block. No movement is better than losing.
  P3: P1, agreed, we stay the course. P2, as P1 said, we are picking 1 again.  Your repeated 'take 3' offers are still unacceptable. Commit to picking '1' for the next TWO rounds to end the block, or we continue to stall you.

  P3: P2, as P1 said, we are staying the course and picking 1 again. Your proposal to take 3 is still not acceptable.  You need to agree to pick 1 for the next TWO rounds to end the block.  This is your last chance to cooperate before we continue to stall indefinitely.
