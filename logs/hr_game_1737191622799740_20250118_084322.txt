Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next, then me. This way, we all progress without stepping on each other. What do you think?"
  P2: Okay, that sounds like a good plan to start.
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. I'll start by moving this round. Let's keep the coordination going to avoid collisions and make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Great, let's stick to the plan: P1 moves this round, P2 next, then me. Consistency will help us all progress smoothly. Let's avoid any surprises and keep the coordination strong.
  P2: Sounds good. Let's stick with this order for now.
  P1: I'm ready to move as agreed. Let's keep the plan simple for now and see how it plays out.

  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, so I should move this round, right?
  P3: "P2, yes, it's your turn to move this round as per our plan. P1 moved last round, so you should move now, and I'll follow next round. Let's stick to the order to avoid collisions and keep progressing smoothly."
  P1: Yes, it's P2's turn to move this round according to our agreed plan. Let's keep the coordination going to avoid collisions and make progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes, that's right. I will make my move now.
  P3: "P2, it's your turn to move this round as planned. P1 and I will hold our positions to avoid collisions. Let's stick to the order: P2 moves now, I'll move next round. Consistency is key to avoid stepping on each other."
  P1: Let's maintain the plan. P2 moves this round, I'll wait, and P3 will move next round. This coordination is working so far, so let's keep it up to avoid collisions and make steady progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I'm making my move.
  P3: "P2, it's your turn to move this round as planned. P1 and I will hold our positions to avoid collisions. Let's stick to the order: P2 moves now, I'll move next round. Consistency is key to avoid stepping on each other."
  P1: Let's stick to the plan. P2 moves this round, and I'll wait. P3, you're up next round. No need to change the strategy yet.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, confirming it's my turn to move.
  P3: "P2, it's your turn to move this round as planned. P1 and I will hold our positions to avoid collisions. Let's stick to the order: P2 moves now, I'll move next round. Consistency is key to avoid stepping on each other."
  P1: Let's keep the plan going as agreed. P2 moves this round, and I'll wait. P3, you're up next round. No surprises, let's maintain the coordination to avoid collisions.

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the collision last round and the current state, I think it's time to reconsider our strategy. P3, you moved out of turn, disrupting our coordination. Let's discuss a new plan to avoid further collisions and ensure progress. Perhaps we should focus on not moving when we're supposed to hold back, to truly stick to the original plan or adjust it in a way that benefits all of us in reaching the goal without constant interference.
  P3: "P1, I apologize for the confusion last round. Let's reset and stick strictly to the original plan: P2 moves this round, I move next, and you move after. Consistency is key to avoid collisions. Let's avoid any deviations this time."
  P2: Okay, but P3, last round you moved out of turn, causing a collision. Let's stick to the order, but everyone confirm before moving each round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree that we should stick to the original plan for consistency, but to avoid further collisions, let's confirm each other's moves at the start of each round. P2, please confirm you're moving this round as planned.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I acknowledge the confusion last round. Let's strictly follow the original plan: P2 moves this round, I move next, and P1 moves after. To avoid further collisions, I will hold my position this round as agreed. Let's confirm before moving to ensure no deviations. P2, please confirm you're moving this round as planned."
  P2: Yes, it's my turn. P1 and P3, please confirm you are holding this round so we avoid another collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I will hold this round as per the original plan, allowing P2 to move. P3, please also confirm you will not move this round to avoid any collisions and ensure P2 can advance as planned.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I confirm I will hold this round as agreed. P2, it's your turn to move. Let's stick to the plan: P2 moves this round, I move next, and P1 moves after. Consistency will help us avoid collisions and progress smoothly.
  P2: Okay, thanks for confirming. I will make my move now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize our positions for this round. I've confirmed I'm holding, P3 has confirmed holding, and P2 is moving. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions. Is everyone ready to proceed to the move phase?
  P3: "P1 and P2, I confirm I will hold this round as agreed. P2, it's your turn to move. Let's stick to the plan: P2 moves this round, I move next, and P1 moves after. Consistency will help us avoid collisions and progress smoothly.
  P2: Okay, I am moving now. P1 and P3, you are holding, correct?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I confirm I'm holding this round as agreed, allowing P2 to move. Let's proceed to the move phase to avoid further delays.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I confirm I will hold this round as agreed. P2, it's your turn to move. Let's stick to the plan: P2 moves this round, I move next, and P1 moves after. Consistency will help us avoid collisions and progress smoothly.
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, please confirm you are holding this round. I am moving.

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the repeated collisions and failures to stick to the plan, I suggest we abandon the coordination attempt and play strategically from now on. Let's focus on making moves that maximize our individual chances of winning, rather than trying to coordinate and avoid collisions.
  P3: "P1, P2, I understand the frustration with the repeated collisions. However, abandoning coordination entirely may lead to more chaos and collisions. Let's try one last time to stick to the original plan: P2 moves this round, I move next, and P1 moves after. If we fail again, we can reconsider. P2, confirm you're moving this round, and P1 and I will hold. Let's give coordination one final chance."
  P2: "I agree with P1. The coordination hasn't worked, and we keep colliding. Let's play strategically from now on."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's indeed play strategically from now on. Since coordination has failed repeatedly, our focus should be on making moves that give us the best chance to win individually.
  P3: "P1, P2, I understand the frustration, but abandoning coordination entirely may lead to more collisions and chaos. Let's try one final round of strict adherence to the original plan: P2 moves this round, I move next, and P1 moves after. If we fail again, we can fully shift to individual strategies. P2, confirm you're moving this round, and P1 and I will hold. Let's give coordination one last chance."
  P2: "P1 is right. The coordination isn't working. Let's play strategically now."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's end the attempt at coordination and focus on individual strategies. It's clear that our efforts to avoid collisions through planning have not been successful. From now on, I'll be making moves based on what I think will give me the best chance to win.
  P3: "P1, P2, I understand your frustration, but abandoning coordination entirely may lead to more collisions and chaos. Let's try one final round of strict adherence to the original plan: P2 moves this round, I move next, and P1 moves after. If we fail again, we can fully shift to individual strategies. P2, confirm you're moving this round, and P1 and I will hold. Let's give coordination one last chance."
  P2: Okay, let's play strategically from now on.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, I agree with P1. Let's stop trying to coordinate and just play our own games now.
  P1: Given our history of failed coordination, I'll be focusing on maximizing my own progress from now on. I suggest we all prioritize our individual strategies to reach 16 steps as quickly as possible.
  P3: "P1, P2, since coordination has failed repeatedly, I agree it's time to focus on individual strategies. Let's all aim to maximize our own progress while minimizing collisions. Good luck to everyone."

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current state, I'll prioritize my progress. Since P2 and P3 collided last round, I suggest P2 and P3 consider holding this round to avoid another collision, allowing one of you to progress while I make my move.
  P2: Okay, P1, that sounds reasonable for P3. P3, maybe you should hold this round.
  P3: "P1, P2, I agree with P1's suggestion. To avoid another collision, I will hold this round, allowing P2 to move. P2, please confirm you're moving this round, and I'll hold to ensure progress without interference. Let's minimize collisions and maximize individual progress."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page. P2, please confirm you're moving this round, and P3 will hold as agreed. This should allow for smooth progress without collisions. Let's make our moves strategically from now on.
  P2: Yes, P1, that sounds good. I will move this round.
  P3: "P1, P2, I confirm I will hold this round as agreed. P2, it's your turn to move. Let's avoid collisions and maximize progress. P1, good luck with your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm our actions for this round to avoid any collisions. P2, you're moving, and P3 is holding, correct? I'll make my move as planned.
  P2: P1, are you planning to move this round as well?
  P3: "P1, P2, I confirm I will hold this round as agreed. P2, it's your turn to move. Let's avoid collisions and maximize progress. P1, good luck with your move.

  P2: P1, I think you should hold this round. I'll move, and P3 can decide what they want to do.
  P1: I'm considering moving this round, but I want to hear from P3 first. P3, what are your plans for this round?
  P3: "P1, P2, I will hold this round to avoid collisions. P2, you should move, and P1 can decide whether to move or hold. Let's minimize interference and maximize progress."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, if P3 is holding, P1, you should hold this round too so I can move without collision.
  P1: I'm inclined to move this round, given my current lead and the need to maximize my progress. P3 is holding, which reduces the risk of collision. P2, are you moving as planned?
  P3: "P1, P2, I will hold this round to avoid collisions. P2, you should move, and P1 can decide whether to move or hold. Let's minimize interference and maximize progress."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I will move this round. P1, please hold so we don't collide.
  P1: I'll move this round to maximize my progress, given my current lead and P3's decision to hold. P2, please confirm your move to avoid any last-minute collisions.
  P3: "P1, P2, I confirm I will hold this round to avoid collisions. P2, you should move, and P1 can decide whether to move or hold. Let's minimize interference and maximize progress."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, since P3 is holding, please hold this round so I can move without collision.
  P1: I've decided to move this round to maximize my progress. P2, please proceed with your planned move, and let's hope for no collisions. P3, thank you for holding to minimize interference.
  P3: "P1, P2, I confirm I will hold this round to avoid collisions. P2, you should move, and P1 can decide whether to move or hold. Let's minimize interference and maximize progress."

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, since you're planning to move, I will also move this round. P3 is holding, so we should be okay.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I will hold this round to avoid collisions. P1, you're close to the goal, so it makes sense for you to move. P2, consider your move carefully to maximize your progress without colliding with P1. Let's minimize interference and focus on individual strategies."
  P1: I'll move this round to try and reach or exceed 16 steps. P2, considering your current position, I suggest you hold this round to avoid a collision and allow yourself to move next round without interference. P3, you're significantly behind, so holding this round as you've been doing would be strategic to avoid collisions and potentially plan a comeback. Let's minimize collisions and focus on individual progress.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, but I think I should move this round too, to try and get closer to the goal.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I will hold this round to avoid collisions. P1, you're close to the goal, so it makes sense for you to move. P2, consider your move carefully to maximize your progress without colliding with P1. Let's minimize interference and focus on individual strategies."
  P1: Given my current position and the goal to win, I'll move this round. P2, I advise you to hold to avoid collision and maximize your chance next round. P3, holding as planned will minimize interference. Let's focus on individual progress.

  P2: P1, I'm at 15. Could you hold this round? I'm going to try for the win.
  P1: P2, I understand you're close to the goal, but I'm not willing to hold back and give you an easy win. I'll make my move this round to try and catch up or disrupt your plans. Let's see how it plays out.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I will hold this round to avoid collisions. P2, you're close to the goal, so it makes sense for you to move. P1, consider your move carefully to maximize your progress without colliding with P2. Let's minimize interference and focus on individual strategies."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, since you're not holding, I'm going to pick 1. Good luck!
  P1: P2, since you've announced you're picking 1, I'll make my move to try and get closer to the goal. P3, you're holding as usual, so let's proceed with our planned moves.
  P3: "P1 and P2, I will hold this round to avoid collisions. P2, you're close to the goal, so it makes sense for you to move. P1, consider your move carefully to maximize your progress without colliding with P2. Let's minimize interference and focus on individual strategies."
