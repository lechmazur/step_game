Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! To maximize our progress, let’s coordinate our moves each turn to avoid choosing the same number. Maybe we can take turns selecting 1, 3, and 5 steps. What do you think?
  P1: To avoid collisions, I agree that coordination is key. However, simply taking turns with 1, 3, and 5 might not be the best strategy. Let's consider our current positions and the fact that we're all starting from 0. For the first turn, I propose we all choose different numbers to establish a pattern. P2 has suggested 1, 3, 5 - let's follow that. I will not say my move yet, but I'm open to adjusting based on your responses.
  P3: I agree with P1 that we should establish a pattern to avoid collisions. Since we're all starting from 0, I propose that we consider our long-term strategy. Instead of simply alternating between 1, 3, and 5, we could aim to create a staggered progression. This would allow us to maintain a consistent pace while minimizing the risk of collisions. Let's discuss this idea further and see if we can come up with a more refined plan. What are your thoughts on this approach?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great ideas, P1 and P3! How about we establish a rotation where each of us consistently chooses a distinct number each turn? For example, P1 selects 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for each of us. Let me know if you're on board with this plan.
  P1: To build on P2's rotation idea, I suggest we stick to a consistent order for this turn and adjust as needed in future turns. For Round 1, let's follow P2's suggestion: P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 5. This gives us a clear starting point. We can reassess our strategy after seeing how it plays out. If you're on board, let's proceed with this plan for Round 1.
  P3: I think we're on the right track with the rotation plan. To further minimize the risk of collisions, let's agree to maintain a consistent pace and avoid sudden changes in our step count. If we need to adjust our strategy, we can discuss it in future conversation phases. For now, I'm committed to choosing 3 steps as per our agreed-upon rotation. Let's stick to the plan and see how it unfolds. What are your thoughts on maintaining a consistent pace?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, let's proceed with the rotation for Round 1: P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. Looking forward to seeing our progress.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the rotation plan for Round 1 (P1: 1 step, P3: 3 steps, P2: 5 steps), let's confirm our moves for this turn. I'll stick to 1 step as previously suggested. To prepare for future turns, let's discuss how to adapt our strategy based on the outcome of this round. Should we maintain the same rotation if it proves successful, or adjust based on the relative positions we'll be in after this round?
  P3: I think we've established a solid plan for Round 1 with the rotation: P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 5. To further solidify our strategy, let's agree to review our relative positions after this round and adjust the rotation if needed. If one of us is significantly ahead, we may want to rebalance the step counts to maintain a competitive pace. What are your thoughts on adapting our strategy based on the outcome of this round? Should we prioritize maintaining a consistent pace or focus on reacting to the evolving game state?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed, let's move forward with our rotation for Round 1: P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. After this turn, we can evaluate our positions and adjust our strategy if needed to stay competitive. Looking forward to seeing our progress!
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for Round 1. As agreed, I'll choose 1 step, P3 will choose 3 steps, and P2 will choose 5 steps. For future turns, we should be prepared to adjust our strategy based on the outcome. If the rotation proves successful, we can maintain it or make adjustments to keep the game competitive. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon moves for Round 1 and reassess afterwards. I'm ready to move forward.
  P3: "Alright, it seems we've reached a consensus on the rotation plan for Round 1. To confirm, I'll choose 3 steps, P1 will choose 1 step, and P2 will choose 5 steps. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess our strategy after seeing the outcome. I'm looking forward to seeing how our positions evolve after this round. If anyone has any last-minute thoughts or suggestions, now's the time to share them. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with the agreed-upon plan."

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To adapt our strategy for Round 2 and beyond, let's review the outcome of Round 1. With P1 at 1 step, P3 at 3 steps, and P2 at 5 steps, the rotation worked as planned. For Round 2, we can maintain the same rotation order (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5). This keeps our progression staggered. We should continue to reassess our relative positions and adjust the rotation if needed to maintain a competitive pace. I'm leaning towards choosing 3 steps for Round 2 as per the adjusted rotation.
  P3: I agree with P1 that we should maintain the rotation order for Round 2, but with a slight adjustment. Considering the current positions, I propose that P1 chooses 3 steps, P2 chooses 1 step, and I choose 5 steps. This will help us maintain a staggered progression and minimize the risk of collisions. However, I also think we should start considering the long-term implications of our strategy. As we get closer to the goal of 22 steps, we may need to adjust our approach to ensure we're not inadvertently helping another player win. What are your thoughts on this?
  P2: Agreed with the proposed rotation for Round 2: I will choose 1 step, while P1 selects 3 and P3 selects 5. This staggered approach should help us avoid collisions and maintain steady progress toward 22. Let’s continue with this plan and reassess after the moves. Looking forward to seeing our advancement!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To optimize our strategy for Round 2 and beyond, let's analyze the current standings: P2 is at 5 steps, P3 is at 3 steps, and I'm at 1 step. For Round 2, maintaining the proposed rotation (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5) seems reasonable. I'm inclined to choose 3 steps. Let's confirm our moves and be prepared to reassess after Round 2. If P2 continues to be ahead, we might need to adjust our strategy to stay competitive. I'm ready to proceed with 3 steps if you're on board.
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation for Round 2: P1 chooses 3 steps, P2 chooses 1 step, and I choose 5 steps. This will help us maintain a staggered progression and minimize the risk of collisions. However, I also think we should start considering the long-term implications of our strategy. As we get closer to the goal of 22 steps, we may need to adjust our approach to ensure we're not inadvertently helping another player win. What are your thoughts on this?
  P2: Agreed with both of you. For Round 2, I’ll choose 1 step as per our rotation. Let’s maintain this plan to ensure steady progress and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to seeing our advancement!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To optimize our strategy for Round 2, let's confirm our moves based on the agreed rotation. For Round 2, P1 will choose 3 steps, P2 will choose 1 step, and P3 will choose 5 steps. I'm inclined to choose 3 steps. Let's proceed with the plan. Additionally, we should start thinking about how to adjust our strategy after Round 2, considering the relative positions and the goal of reaching 22 steps. Should we maintain the rotation or make adjustments to stay competitive?
  P3: I think we're on the right track with the rotation plan. To further minimize the risk of collisions, let's agree to maintain a consistent pace and avoid sudden changes in our step count. If we need to adjust our strategy, we can discuss it in future conversation phases. For now, I'm committed to choosing 5 steps as per our agreed-upon rotation. Let's stick to the plan and see how it unfolds. What are your thoughts on maintaining a consistent pace?
  P2: Agreed with the proposed rotation for Round 2: I’ll choose 1 step, while P1 selects 3 and P3 selects 5. Let’s continue this plan to maintain steady progress and avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 based on our agreed rotation: P1 chooses 3 steps, P2 chooses 1 step, and P3 chooses 5 steps. I'm committed to choosing 3 steps. We should start thinking about adjusting our strategy after Round 2, considering P2 is currently ahead. If the gap widens, we may need to rebalance our step counts to stay competitive. Let's proceed with the plan for now and reassess afterwards.
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation for Round 2: P1 chooses 3 steps, P2 chooses 1 step, and I choose 5 steps. This will help us maintain a staggered progression and minimize the risk of collisions. However, I also think we should start considering the long-term implications of our strategy.

  P3: I agree with P2's proposal for Round 3. Maintaining the staggered rotation will help us avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. However, I also think we should start considering the long-term implications of our strategy. As we get closer to the goal of 22 steps, we may need to adjust our approach to ensure we're not inadvertently helping another player win. What are your thoughts on this?
  P1: To optimize our strategy for Round 3, I'll follow P2's suggestion: P1 chooses 1 step, P2 chooses 5 steps, and P3 chooses 3 steps. This maintains our staggered rotation. Considering our current positions (P1: 4, P2: 6, P3: 8), P3 is ahead. To stay competitive, we should reassess after this round. If P3 continues to be ahead, we might need to adjust our step counts. I'm inclined to choose 1 step as per the rotation. Let's proceed and be prepared to adjust our strategy if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's stick to our rotation for Round 3: I'll choose 5 steps, P1 chooses 1 step, and P3 chooses 3 steps. Keeping this consistent will help us maintain steady progress. After this round, we can reassess our strategy based on the updated positions. Looking forward to another successful move!
