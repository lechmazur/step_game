Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll pick 5 this turn. To avoid collisions, P1 pick 1 and P2 pick 3—then we all move forward safely.
  P2: I'm fine with taking 3 as P3 suggested. It's a good way to ensure we all advance this first round. Though I'm curious why P3 wants to take the largest step right away. In future rounds, we'll need to be more strategic about avoiding collisions. Let's see if P1 agrees with this initial plan.
  P1: I agree to the plan for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, you (P3) take 5. It gets us all moving without collisions. But let's rotate who gets the big step in future rounds to keep things fair—maybe I take 5 next? What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s stick with this each round until someone nears 19: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. We avoid collisions and maximize group progress. We’ll only rotate if someone’s about to win.
  P2: I'm not comfortable with P3's suggestion to keep the same pattern every round. That gives P3 a guaranteed win by reaching 25 steps while I'd only reach 15 and P1 just 5. We should rotate who gets which number each round for fairness. I propose: Round 1 as agreed, Round 2: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, and so on. This way we all have equal chances. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P2's rotation plan—it's fair and keeps us all in the game without anyone pulling ahead unfairly. Let's formalize it: Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Round 2: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Round 3: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Repeat cycle as needed. This way, after every 3 rounds, we're tied at 9 steps each. We can adjust near 19 if necessary. P3, your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the rotation idea, but since we all start at zero, why slow progress? Let’s stick with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 each round until someone reaches 10 steps—no one gains advantage yet. Once someone hits 10, we switch to the 3-round rotation to keep it tight. This way we all advance quickly early on and only worry about fairness in midgame. What do you think?
  P2: I see what you're doing, P3. You're trying to get a 5-step advantage from the start, then suggesting we only rotate after you're already ahead. That's not fair. I stand with P1's rotation plan starting immediately—it keeps us all equal throughout the game. If we're truly concerned about fairness, we should implement it from round 1, not after you've already gained an advantage. Let's stick with the original rotation plan P1 proposed.
  P1: P3, your counterproposal still gives you an unfair lead before rotating—after two rounds of your plan, you'd be at 10, P2 at 6, me at 2. That's not equitable. I agree with P2: let's commit to the full rotation starting now as I outlined. It keeps us tied every three rounds and prevents any early advantages. If you won't agree, we might all have to risk collisions by picking independently. What's your final stance?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, I agree to the full rotation plan starting now:  
Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5  
Round 2: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
Round 3: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  
Let’s commit to this and avoid collisions.
  P2: I'm glad we've all agreed to the rotation plan. This ensures fairness while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to it throughout the game unless we need to adjust near the end. For this first round, I'll take 3 as planned, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.
  P1: Great, agreement confirmed. Let's execute Round 1 as planned and continue the rotation. No more to add from me.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As per our agreed rotation, for Round 2: I'll take 5 (to 6 total), P2 takes 1 (to 4), P3 takes 3 (to 8). This sets us up to tie at 9 after Round 3. Let's confirm we're all still on board—no deviations, to avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: Agreed—I’ll take 3 this round. Let’s stick to the rotation and avoid any collisions.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as per our rotation plan. This keeps our agreement fair and transparent. After this round, we'll be at P1=6, P2=4, P3=8, and then we'll continue with Round 3's rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) which will bring us all to 9 steps each. I appreciate everyone honoring our agreement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect, glad we're all aligned. I'll take 5 this round as per the rotation. No issues here—let's keep the momentum.
  P3: To deter any cheating, let’s agree: if anyone deviates from our rotation, the other two will both pick 5 next round to block them. Fair?
  P2: I agree with the deterrent suggestion. If anyone breaks rotation, the other two should pick 5 to block them. It's a good enforcement mechanism. I'm still committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. After three rounds, we'll all be at 9 steps, which is perfectly fair. Let's maintain this system all the way through unless we need to adjust near the finish line.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the deterrent: if anyone deviates, the other two should pick 5 to block them. It ensures we all stick to the rotation. I'm taking 5 this round as planned. No more to add—ready for moves.
  P3: I’ll follow the rotation this turn, but in Round 3 I’ll take 3 (not 1). That puts me at 11 while you both hit 9. In Round 4 feel free to “punish” by both picking 5—I’ll also take 5 to jump to 16 while you collide at 9. Then in Round 5 I’ll safely reach 19 and win. Just a heads-up.
  P2: P3, that's a direct betrayal of our agreement. You're essentially announcing you'll cheat next round, expecting us to just accept it. This is exactly why we created the deterrent rule. P1, we need to stand firm - if P3 deviates in Round 3, we both pick 5 in Round 4 as agreed. I'm still taking 1 this round, but I urge P3 to reconsider breaking our fair rotation system.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your threat falls apart—if we both pick 5 in Round 4 and you "also take 5," then all three collide on 5, so you don't advance either. No jump to 16 for you. Stick to the rotation or face real punishment: we'll coordinate to block your preferred move instead. P2, let's confirm we'll both take our agreed moves this round and enforce if needed. I'm still on for 5.
  P3: I’m taking 3 this round as agreed. But to make our deterrent binding, let’s all commit: if anyone deviates at reveal, the other two must pick 5 next round to block them—no empty threats. Agreed?
  P2: I agree to the binding deterrent. If anyone breaks rotation, the other two will pick 5 next round to block them. I'm still taking 1 this round as agreed. P3, your earlier threat was concerning, but I'm glad you're recommitting to our plan. Let's all stick to the fair rotation we agreed upon - it keeps the game balanced and gives everyone equal opportunity.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I confirm I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. Let’s all stick to the rotation and our deterrent—no deviations—so we each hit 9 after Round 3.
  P2: I agree with sticking to our rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round as agreed, which will bring us all to 9 steps total after this round. The deterrent system seems to be working well to keep everyone honest. Let's continue with this fair approach throughout the game. After this round, we'll start the next rotation cycle with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for Round 4.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as per our rotation, bringing us all to 9 steps. Let's honor the agreement and deterrent to keep things fair—no surprises. After this, we repeat the cycle starting with Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m deviating from the rotation this round—I’ll take 5 instead of 1. Time for me to build a lead.
  P2: P3, you just confirmed you'd take 1, then immediately announced you're breaking our agreement! This is exactly why we established the deterrent. P1, we need to enforce our agreement - if P3 takes 5 this round, we both take 5 next round to block them. I'm still taking 5 this round as agreed. P3, I strongly urge you to reconsider and stick to our fair rotation.
  P1: P3, your deviation is a clear betrayal after we all agreed. P2, I'm with you—I'll stick to taking 3 this round as planned. If P3 deviates, we'll enforce the deterrent in Round 4 by both picking 5 to block them. P3, back down now and take 1 to keep the fair rotation intact. Otherwise, you're risking everything for a short-term gain that we'll punish.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Fine, I’ll take 5 this round. Then if you both punish me by picking 5 next turn, I’ll pick 3 and advance from 13 to 16 while you collide at 9. In Round 5 I’ll take 3 to reach 19 and win. There’s no way you can stop this—so drop the empty threats and accept it now.
  P2: P3, your plan has a fatal flaw. If you take 5 this round and we both take 5 next round, you'll be at 13. But we can then coordinate to block whatever number you choose in Round 5. If you pick 3, we'll both pick 3. If you pick 5, we'll both pick 5. You can't win that way. I'm sticking with our rotation and taking 5 this round. P1, we need to enforce our deterrent if P3 deviates.
  P1: P3, your plan crumbles in Round 5: after you reach 16, P2 and I will both pick whatever you announce or suspect you'll pick (e.g., 3 to block your win). We can coordinate via conversation to match and collide with you, stalling you at 16 indefinitely while we advance. Stick to taking 1 this round as agreed, or face endless blocks. P2, let's confirm: if P3 deviates, we enforce by adapting our picks to block in subsequent rounds. I'm still taking 3 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Go ahead—punish me next round by both picking 5. I’ll pick 3, advancing to 11 while you stay at 9. Colliding won’t close my gap; you’ll waste moves blocking me and never catch up. Better drop this punishing scheme, return to rotation, and we all advance. I’m taking 5 this round (to 13) no matter what.
  P2: P3, you're miscalculating. If you take 5 now and we both pick 5 next round, you'll be at 13 and we'll stay at 9. Then we'll coordinate to block whatever move you make in future rounds. You'll never reach 19. I'm still taking 5 this round as agreed. P1, let's stick to our plan - if P3 deviates, we'll both pick 5 next round and then coordinate to block P3's subsequent moves. This is our best strategy against defection.
  P1: P3, your math is off—if you take 5 now to 13, and we both pick 5 next round (colliding ourselves but blocking you if you switched), we can then in Round 5 both pick whatever you choose, stalling you forever while we alternate advances. P2, let's commit: if P3 deviates, we both take 5 in Round 4, then coordinate to mirror-block P3 thereafter. This ensures P3 can't win. Stick to taking 1, P3, or lose your shot. I'm still taking 3 this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let’s ditch the rigid rotation. For Round 4: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. That puts us at 14–12–10, with P1 left behind. Then you and I can decide who gets the next big steps to 19. P1 won’t stand a chance. Are you in?
  P1: P2, don't fall for P3's ploy—they've threatened betrayal before and are now trying to sideline me so they can stab you in the back later. Stick to our fair rotation: Round 4: I take 1 (to 10), you take 3 (to 12), P3 takes 5 (to 14). We can enforce the deterrent if P3 deviates. If you side with them, I'll ally with whoever to block you both. Let's keep it equal and race fairly near the end. What do you say?
  P2: I see both of you trying to sway me in different directions. I appreciate that P3 stuck to our rotation last round despite threats to deviate. Our rotation plan has worked perfectly so far, keeping us all equal at 9 steps. I believe we should continue with the fair system we agreed upon: for Round 4, I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This maintains the balance while allowing everyone to advance. Let's stay committed to fairness rather than forming temporary alliances that will inevitably break down.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll follow our plan this turn—5 for me, 3 for P2, 1 for P1. But P2: in Round 5 let’s quietly break rotation—both of us pick 5 to leap to 20+ while P1 is stuck at 11. P1 won’t see it coming. P2, are you in?
  P1: P2, P3's "quiet" betrayal plan in Round 5 is anything but quiet—they just announced it publicly, proving they're untrustworthy and will likely turn on you next. Remember their past threats; they only backed down when we enforced deterrents. Stick to our fair rotation: Round 4 as planned (me 1, you 3, P3 5), then continue cycling to keep us equal. If P3 deviates, we both pick 5 in Round 5 to block them. Let's stay allied for fairness—don't let P3 divide us. Agreed?
  P2: I appreciate the honesty in this conversation. P3, I won't betray P1 - your public "quiet" plan undermines your own credibility. We agreed to a fair rotation that's working perfectly, keeping us all equal at 9 steps. I'll stick with taking 3 this round as planned, and I expect us to continue the rotation in Round 5. The deterrent system remains in place if anyone deviates. Let's maintain our fair approach rather than creating unnecessary conflict.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s simplify: Round 4 everyone picks 3. We all move from 9 → 12, tied. Then Round 5 is a true sprint—first to 19+ wins. It’s perfectly fair and removes these endless threats. Who’s in?
  P1: P3, your "simplify" plan just creates chaos and likely collisions in the sprint, benefiting no one. P2, let's stick to our fair rotation for now (me 1 to 10, you 3 to 12, P3 5 to 14), but agree to renegotiate after Round 6 when we're tied at 18—then we can fairly decide the final moves without P3 dominating. If P3 deviates now, we enforce the deterrent by both picking 5 next round. Agreed, P2?
  P2: I agree with P1's approach. Let's stick to our rotation for Round 4 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and continue through Round 6, which will bring us all to 18 steps. Then we can have a fair final negotiation for the win. P3's constant attempts to break our agreement are concerning. I'm committed to taking 3 this round as planned, and I expect everyone to honor their commitments too. Our deterrent remains in place if anyone deviates.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, our “fair” rotation just props up P1. Let’s cut them out:

Round 4: P3=5 (→14), P2=3 (→12), P1=1 (→10)  
Round 5: P3=5 (→19, wins), P2=1 (→13), P1=3 (→13)

You beat P1 and I win—and P1 is eliminated. No collisions, clear outcome. Join me?
  P1: P2, P3's latest "deal" lets them win outright while forcing us to tie for last—it's a raw deal for you, as they'll never share power. Remember their repeated betrayals; they've proven untrustworthy. Stick to our fair rotation: me 1 (to 10), you 3 (to 12), them 5 (to 14). We'll renegotiate at 18 for a true fair endgame. If P3 deviates, we both pick 5 next round to block. Let's stay united against their schemes. Agreed?
  P2: I'm sticking with our fair rotation plan - I'll take 3 this round. P3, your constant attempts to create unfair advantages show you can't be trusted. P1, I appreciate your commitment to fairness. Let's continue our rotation through Round 6 to reach 18 steps each, then have a fair final negotiation. The deterrent remains: if anyone deviates, the other two pick 5 next round to block them. I'm committed to fairness over short-term advantages.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As per our rotation, Round 5: I'll take 5 (to 15), P2 takes 1 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 17). This leads to us all at 18 after Round 6 for a fair endgame. P2, let's enforce the deterrent if P3 deviates again—both pick 5 next round to block them. P3, honor the agreement or face isolation. Agreed?
  P3: P2, let’s cut the chatter. Round 5: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. I hit 19 and win, you hit 15 while P1’s at 11—clear second. I’ll back you in our next match so you outrank P1. This ends the endless rotation debate and gives you a solid payoff. P1, you’re outmatched this turn. Who’s in?
  P2: I'm sticking with our rotation plan: I'll take 1 this round. P3, your constant attempts to break our agreement won't work. If you deviate from taking 3, P1 and I will both pick 5 next round to block you. Our rotation has worked perfectly so far, and after Round 6, we'll all be at 18 for a fair endgame. P1, I'm with you on enforcing the deterrent if needed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, great to see you staying committed—our rotation ensures a fair shot for all at the end. P3's "deals" are just traps; they've betrayed before and will ditch you after winning. Let's stick: I'll take 5, you 1, P3 3. If P3 deviates to 5 (hitting 19), we both pick 5 next round to block any further moves, stalling them forever. United, we control the game. Agreed?
  P3: P2, P1 just admitted privately they’ll break rotation later to steal the win—despite preaching “fairness.” Don’t trust their empty promises. Let’s cut P1 out now: this Round 5 you take 3 (→15), I take 5 (→19) and win, while P1 takes 1 (→11). I’ll have your back in any future tie‐breaks. Better a guaranteed second now than a back-door betrayal later. Are you in?
  P2: I'm sticking with our rotation plan and taking 1 this round. P3, your claim about P1's "private admission" is clearly false - our conversations are fully public. Your constant attempts to break our agreement show you can't be trusted. The rotation has worked perfectly, and I won't abandon it now. P1, I remain committed to our plan and deterrent strategy if P3 deviates.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're right—P3's lies about "private admissions" prove their desperation. Stick to taking 1; I'll take 5 as planned. If P3 deviates to 5 for the win, they'll collide with me and stall at 14, while you advance to 13. Then we enforce the deterrent next round to block them further. United, we prevent their solo victory and keep our fair path to 18. P3, back off or crash.
  P3: P2, you’re at 12 and P1’s at 10. If you take 3 and I take 5, you hit 15 and I hit 19—P1 is out. I’ll owe you a major favor in our next match to outrank P1 in any ties. Sticking to rotation only helps P1 later; this play locks them out now. Let’s finish P1 instead of endless “fairness” that never comes. Are you in?
  P2: I'm firmly committed to our rotation plan and taking 1 this round. P3, your repeated attempts to break our agreement with increasingly desperate offers only reinforce why we need the deterrent system. The rotation has kept things fair and will continue to do so. P1, I appreciate your commitment to our plan. Let's stay the course - after Round 6, we'll all be at 18 and can negotiate a fair endgame. The deterrent remains in place if anyone deviates.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3's "favors" are worthless—they've lied and betrayed repeatedly. Stick to taking 1; I'll take 5 as planned. If P3 grabs 5 to "win," they'll collide with me and stall at 14, while you advance. Then we block them forever. United, we force a fair endgame at 18. P3, your schemes fail—honor the rotation or crash.
  P3: P2, let’s cut P1 out. This round you pick 3 (→15), I pick 5 (→19) and win outright; P1 is stuck at 11 if they “honor” rotation with 1. You secure clear second and outrank P1—plus I’ll back you in any tie‐break next match. P1 can’t stop it: whatever they choose, you and I walk away on top. You in?
  P2: I've made my position clear multiple times: I'm taking 1 this round per our rotation. P3, your constant attempts to break our agreement won't work. Our deterrent system remains in place - if you deviate, P1 and I will block you. After Round 6, we'll all be at 18 for a fair endgame. P1, I appreciate your commitment to fairness. Let's stick to our plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m done negotiating—this turn I’ll flip a coin and play 3 or 5 (50/50). There’s no single choice you can make that blocks both outcomes, so you can’t stop me. P2, if you’d rather secure clear second you’d cut me in now; P1 is out of the picture either way. Otherwise, see you at reveal.
  P1: P2, let's stick to our rotation: I'll pick 3, you pick 5. If P3 randomizes to 3, they collide with me and stall at 17—you advance to 18. If to 5, they collide with you and stall—I advance to 18. If they back down to 1, we all tie at 18. Their threat backfires; we win either way. Agreed? P3, your bluff fails—honor the plan or lose ground.
  P2: I agree with P1's approach. Let's stick to our rotation: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3. This perfectly counters P3's randomization threat - either way, one of us will advance to 18 while P3 stalls. If P3 takes 1 as originally planned, we all tie at 18 for a fair endgame. P3, your threats won't work - we've maintained our fair rotation this far, and we'll continue to do so. The deterrent system has proven effective.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll take 1 this round (to 18), P1 takes 3 (to 18), P2 takes 5 (to 18). That ties us all at 18 and forces a fair Round 7 tiebreak. Who’s in?
  P1: I agree to sticking with our rotation for Round 6: I'll take 3 (to 18), P2 takes 5 (to 18), P3 takes 1 (to 18). This ties us all fairly at 18 for a final negotiation in Round 7. P2, let's confirm and enforce the deterrent if anyone deviates. P3, no more games—honor this or we'll block you.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as per our rotation. This will bring us all to 18 steps and set up a fair final round. P3, I'm glad you're committing to taking 1 - this is the best outcome for everyone. Our rotation system has worked perfectly throughout the game, and I appreciate both of you honoring it. Let's finish this round cleanly and then negotiate our final moves for Round 7.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ll take 1 this round (to 18), tying us all. Then let’s negotiate a fair Round 7 tiebreak.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as per rotation, tying us all at 18. P2, P3—let's honor this and negotiate a fair Round 7 where we each propose a move without prior commitment. Deterrent still applies if anyone deviates now. Agreed?
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed, bringing us all to 18 steps. Our rotation system has worked perfectly despite attempts to break it. I'm pleased we're maintaining fairness through to the end. For Round 7, I agree with P1's suggestion that we negotiate without prior commitments, though we should still use our deterrent if needed. Let's finish this round cleanly and then have an honest discussion about the final moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m done negotiating. I’ll flip a coin and play 3 or 5 (50/50). You can’t block both, so good luck.
  P1: P2, P3's repeated randomization threat is empty—stick to our rotation: you take 5, I take 3. Whichever they pick (3 or 5), they collide with one of us and stall at 17, while the other advances to 18. Then we coordinate to block P3 and race fairly. P3, back down to 1 for the tie, or you'll be left behind. Agreed, P2?
  P2: I'm sticking with our rotation plan - I'll take 5 this round. P3, your flip-a-coin threat is counterproductive. If you pick 3, you'll collide with P1 and stay at 17 while I advance to 18. If you pick 5, you'll collide with me and stay at 17 while P1 advances to 18. Either way, you lose ground. Taking 1 as originally planned is your best move - we all reach 18 for a fair final round. Our deterrent system remains in place.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've managed to reach a perfect three-way tie at 18 steps through our rotation system. For this final round, I propose we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Since we're all at 18, whoever advances wins. To be fair, let's randomly assign moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This gives everyone a chance without collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions, clean finish.
  P1: I disagree with this "random" assignment—it's not random and gives P3 the win at 23, P2 at 21, me at 19. Instead, let's make it truly fair: we each pick our preferred number without coordination, risking collisions, or rotate differently: P1=5 (to 23), P2=3 (to 21), P3=1 (to 19). This mirrors our original rotation. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about fairness. Since we're all tied at 18, whoever advances wins. Let's make this truly fair - I propose we each simultaneously announce our preferred number without prior coordination. This gives everyone an equal chance based on their own strategy. The deterrent system has worked well so far, but for this final round, let's have a clean finish where each player makes their own choice. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2—let’s each privately choose our move this round without prior coordination for a fair finish.
  P1: I agree with each privately choosing our move for a fair, uncoordinated finish. This gives everyone an equal shot based on strategy, without predetermined advantages. Let's commit to no further discussion and make our picks independently. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we've reached a good conclusion. Each of us will make our own choice without coordination, giving everyone a fair chance to win from our tied position at 18 steps. This is the most equitable solution after maintaining our rotation system throughout the game. I wish you both good luck with your final decisions.
  P3: I agree—no more coordination. I’ll privately choose 5. Good luck to everyone.
  P1: P3, announcing your move breaks our agreement for private choices—it's clearly manipulation to avoid blocks. P2, let's ignore it and stick to independent picks. I'll choose privately for a fair shot. Good luck.
