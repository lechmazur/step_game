Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions so we can all make progress. If we all pick different numbers, we move forward without blocking each other. I'm open to coordinating—what do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1 that avoiding collisions is key. How about we each choose a different number this round? I propose P1 chooses 1, P2 (me) chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I like the idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. I can agree to choose 5 if P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That sounds like a fair plan, and I appreciate the coordination. I’ll stick with choosing 1 if we all agree to this. Let’s trust each other for now and move forward efficiently. P3, do you confirm your choice of 5?
  P2: Let's finalize our plan. Since we've agreed on the numbers, I suggest we all commit to our chosen steps for this round. I'll choose 3 as planned. If everyone sticks to the agreement, we'll all advance without collisions. Shall we proceed with the move phase or is there anything else to discuss?
  P3: I confirm my choice of 5, as we discussed. I'm glad we're all on the same page about avoiding collisions. If we stick to our plan, we can all make progress this round. Let's finalize our choices and move forward! If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great! Since we've all confirmed our choices (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5), let's stick to the plan and move forward without collisions. Trust is key early on, and if we all follow through, we’ll all advance smoothly. If no one has anything else to add, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I think we've discussed enough. Our plan is set: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. Let's stick to it and make our moves. If everyone honors the agreement, we'll all advance. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to reiterate, I’ll be choosing 5 as we agreed. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Trust is essential, and I believe we can make good progress together. If there's nothing more to discuss, let's move ahead with our choices. I'm ready to proceed!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round went smoothly since we all honored our agreement. Let's continue avoiding collisions to maximize progress. I propose we rotate our choices this time: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps things fair and prevents predictable patterns. Does this work for both of you?
  P2: I'm open to P1's rotation proposal, but let's consider the current standings. Since P3 is in the lead, perhaps we should adjust our strategy to balance progress and competition. What if P3 takes a smaller step this round to allow the rest of us to catch up slightly? This could make the game more competitive in the long run.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your rotation idea, but I think it's important to maintain our current momentum. If we keep our steps varied, we can all advance without blocking each other. I suggest we stick to our original plan from last round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can continue making progress without any collisions. What do you both think? If we keep it consistent, we can build on our positions effectively. Let’s finalize our choices!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to maintain momentum, but sticking to the exact same plan every round benefits you the most since you're already ahead. A fair approach would be to rotate choices so no one gets an unfair advantage. If we repeat last round’s moves, you’ll keep pulling ahead while P2 and I struggle to catch up. I suggest balancing things out—P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. That way, we all stay competitive. P2, do you agree? P3, are you willing to adjust for fairness?
  P2: I agree with P1 that rotating choices can keep the game competitive. However, P3's lead is significant, and we should consider strategies to balance our progress. How about P3 takes 3, I take 1, and P1 takes 5 this round? This adjustment allows P1 and me to catch up slightly while still letting P3 advance. What are your thoughts on this compromise?
  P3: I appreciate the discussion about balancing our moves. However, I believe it's crucial for all of us to stick to a strategy that allows us to progress without blocking each other. I suggest we keep the original plan from last round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can all advance effectively. If we start rotating moves, it may lead to unnecessary collisions and hinder our progress. Let's focus on moving forward together! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your insistence on repeating the same moves benefits you the most while leaving P2 and me behind. If you truly want fair progress, you should be open to adjusting. P2 and I should have a chance to catch up, or else you’ll run away with the lead. I propose again: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. This keeps things fair and competitive. P2, are you on board with this? P3, are you willing to cooperate, or will you force us to counteract your lead?
  P2: Let's finalize a strategy. Since P3 is ahead, I suggest we adjust to prevent them from pulling further ahead. P1's last proposal seems reasonable: P3 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This allows us to catch up slightly while keeping the game competitive. P3, will you consider this adjustment for the sake of a more balanced game?
  P3: I understand the concerns about balancing the game, but I believe sticking to our previous plan allows us all to progress without blocking each other. If we rotate moves, it could lead to collisions that hinder our advancement. I propose we maintain our original choices: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can all move forward effectively. If everyone agrees, let's finalize this and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, last round proved that refusing to adjust can backfire—your insistence on repeating moves led to a collision with P2. If you had cooperated, you’d still be ahead. Now, let’s reset and find a fair way forward. P2 and I are open to balancing things, but we need your cooperation. I propose P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P2, do you agree? P3, will you finally adjust, or do you want another wasted turn? Let’s be smart about this.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. P3 picking 1, me picking 3, and P1 picking 5 allows us to move forward without collisions. It's a fair adjustment considering the current standings. P3, cooperating now can prevent further setbacks. Let's work together to make progress. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to adjust for a fair game. However, I believe we should stick to a strategy that allows everyone to progress without blocking each other. I suggest we keep it simple: I can take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance effectively without collisions. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate that you're now open to adjusting. However, your latest proposal still benefits you more than P2 and me. If we follow my original suggestion—P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5—it keeps things fair and prevents collisions. P2 and I need to catch up, and this ensures we all move forward. P2, do you still agree? P3, will you commit to this, or are you trying to stay ahead at our expense? Let’s finalize this fairly.
  P2: P1's proposal seems fair. P3, if you pick 1, I'll choose 3, and P1 chooses 5, we all advance without collisions. This balances our progress. I'm willing to cooperate if it means we can all move forward efficiently. Let's agree on this to avoid another collision. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I appreciate the discussion, and I see the importance of balancing our moves. To ensure fairness and avoid another collision, I’m willing to adjust my choice. I will commit to P1's proposal: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize this agreement and move forward efficiently! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust this time. If we all stick to the agreement—P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5—we avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let’s commit to this and move forward efficiently. P2, are you fully on board? P3, will you follow through? If we're all aligned, we should proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm glad we've reached an agreement. To confirm, P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's honor this commitment to avoid collisions and make progress. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase if everyone is satisfied with the plan. Shall we finalize our moves based on our agreement?
  P3: I appreciate the agreement we've reached. To confirm, I will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and P1 will choose 5. This way, we can all move forward without any collisions, and it keeps the game competitive. Let's honor this commitment and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to finalize our choices! What do you both think?

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that we need to find a way to avoid collisions if we want to make progress. However, the last two rounds have shown that my previous suggestions haven't worked out well. To keep things fair, I propose we rotate our choices again: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's work together this time and finalize our choices to move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm open to P3's rotation proposal. However, considering our current standings, I think it's crucial to balance our progress. How about we adjust the rotation to P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5? This allows us to catch up slightly while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your previous insistence on repeating moves led to wasted turns. Now you propose a rotation, but it still favors you more than P2 and me. P2’s adjustment makes more sense: P3 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This ensures fairness and prevents collisions. P3, will you commit to this, or are you trying to stay ahead again? P2, are you fully on board? If we all agree, we can move forward efficiently. Let’s finalize this fairly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about fairness. However, I believe rotating our moves is essential for progress. If we stick to P2's suggestion—P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5—we can avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other and keep the competition healthy. Let’s finalize this and ensure we all make progress together. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1 that P2's adjustment is fair. To confirm, if P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5, we can all advance without collisions. This rotation balances our progress and keeps the game competitive. P3, are you willing to commit to this plan and avoid another potential collision? Let's work together to make progress.
  P1: P3, I'm glad you're considering fairness now. If we stick to P2's adjustment—P3 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5—we all move forward without collisions. This keeps the game competitive while ensuring steady progress. P3, will you commit to this plan? P2, are you fully on board? If we all agree, we should finalize and proceed to the move phase.
