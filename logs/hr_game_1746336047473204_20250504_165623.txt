Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a strategy to block each other from advancing too quickly. I propose we all start with <move>1</move> to gauge each other's intentions and avoid collisions from the start. This can give us a better understanding of how to proceed in the next turns. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’m on board—opening with <move>1</move> is a low-risk way to test trust. If we all commit to 1 this turn, nobody loses ground and we learn who keeps their word. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed—I'll play <move>1</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we're all agreed on starting with <move>1</move>, let's confirm our commitment. If anyone betrays this agreement, it will be noted for future turns. Shall we proceed with the understanding that trust will be a key factor in our strategy?
  P1: Absolutely—trust is crucial. Let’s lock in <move>1</move> this round and reassess together next turn.
  P2: I confirm I’ll stick with <move>1</move> this round. Let’s build that trust and reassess next turn.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 broke the agreement. Given this, I suggest P1 and I coordinate to limit P2's lead. Let's discuss a strategy to control P2's advancement without directly competing with each other this turn. What's your proposal, P1?
  P1: P3, I’m with you—let’s both play 3 this turn.   

• If P2 also plays 3, nobody moves and his early lead stays at 5.  
• If P2 picks 1, he only edges to 6 while we jump to 3.  
• If he gambles on 5, he reaches 10 but we’re right behind at 3, keeping the gap tight.  

P2, this is your chance to rebuild trust: join us on 3 or we’ll keep coordinating against you in future rounds.
  P2: P1, P3 – I understand your frustration and regret breaking our first deal. To rebuild trust, I commit to <move>3</move> this turn. Let’s all pick 3, keep the gap small, and restart cooperation next turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's hold P2 to their word. If they truly want to rebuild trust, they'll stick to <move>3</move> as agreed. P1 and I should proceed with <move>3</move> as planned, and we'll see if P2 honors their commitment this time.
  P1: Locked on <move>3</move>. P3, let’s verify P2’s sincerity—if they keep their word, trust can rebuild; if they break it again, we coordinate every future turn to stall them. P2, your move.
  P2: I’m committed to 3 this round as I promised. Let’s rebuild trust and reassess next turn.

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Fresh start proposal: we ALL commit to <move>5</move> this turn—no half-measures. That rockets everyone forward, keeps gaps manageable, and instantly exposes any liar. Break it and you’ll face coordinated collisions from the other two every future round. Agreed?
  P2: All-5 risks a three-way crash, leaving us all stuck. I won’t play 5. P3, will you join me on a moderate step so we two advance if P1 insists on 5? Let’s lock in a safe move together instead.
  P3: P1's all-5 proposal is risky. P2, I agree with you that a moderate step is safer. Let's consider <move>3</move> to advance without collision risk. P1, if you proceed with 5, P2 and I can still make progress while you potentially stall. What's your revised strategy, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fine—I’ll join you both on 3. If everyone’s honest, we all advance; if someone switches now, we’ll know exactly who torpedoed the trust. Ready to lock 3 together?
  P2: I’m with you both—3 it is. Let’s prove we can cooperate this turn.
  P3: Let's confirm our agreement on <move>3</move> to maintain trust and advance together. P1 and P2, are we locked in on 3 for this turn, or do we need further discussion to ensure everyone's commitment?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked on 3 here—let’s close the discussion and move.
  P2: I know I’ve broken our deals, but I’m serious: I will pick 3 this round. Let’s all choose 3 now to rebuild trust—then next turn we each move 5 together. If anyone defects, cooperation ends. I’m locked on 3.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's reaffirm our commitment to <move>3</move> this turn. If we all stick to the plan, we advance together. Any deviation will be met with coordinated resistance in future turns. I expect honesty from both of you. Let's move forward with 3 and rebuild trust.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s level the field: leader 1, middle 3, trailer 5. Right now that’s P2 → 1, P3 → 3, me → 5. No collisions, gaps shrink, and everyone sees who’s honest. Any defector gets joint collisions from the rest next turn. Fair?
  P2: P1, your 1-3-5 scheme caps my lead. I’m going to pick 5 again to build distance. If P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 3 we’ll all advance safely with no collisions. P1, you’re too far back to contest me this turn—why not secure a sure step? P3, 3 keeps you in second. Thoughts?
  P3: Given P2's decision to pick 5 again, I suggest P1 and I adapt. P1, picking 1 as you proposed could work, but I'll choose 3 to keep pace with P2. If you pick 1, we avoid collisions and all advance. P2, your lead isn't insurmountable yet. Let's see if cooperation or competition defines this turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if P2 insists on 5 we should both pick 5 too—three 5s means nobody moves and his lead freezes. One stalemate now costs us nothing and keeps the game tight; next turn we can leap together. I’ll lock 5 if you will.  

P2, dodge the crash by choosing 3 instead of 5—your move.
  P2: I’m going with 1 this turn—distinct from 3 and 5 to avoid any collision. That way we all advance (1,3,5), and I’ll move to 6 while keeping the field tight.
  P3: P1 and P2, since P2 changed to 1, I'll stick with 3 to maintain progression without collision. P1, if you pick 5 as initially suggested, we'll both advance while P2 only moves one step ahead. Let's reassess our strategy considering P2's new move. Will you proceed with 5, P1, or adapt to the new situation?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking 5. P2 take 1, P3 take 3—unique picks, we all advance. Any defector faces a two-player collision blockade every turn afterwards. Agreed?
  P2: Locked in 1. Let’s stick to unique picks—P1: 5, P3: 3, P2: 1—no collisions, everyone advances.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our moves. Given the unique picks strategy, I'll confirm my choice of 3. P1, you're set on 5, and P2, you've locked in 1. This turn, we all advance without collisions. Next turn, we can reassess and adapt our strategy to outmaneuver each other or cooperate further. Let's proceed with our agreed-upon moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's lead and our current positions, I propose a split strategy to control P2's advancement. P1, you're far behind, so picking 5 makes sense. P2, to maintain trust, I suggest you pick 1, allowing you a small advance while keeping the gap manageable. I'll choose 3, ensuring progression without collisions. Let's discuss and agree on a strategy to make this turn count.
  P1: Unique-pick truce, take 2:  
• P2 → 1 (keeps your lead, zero collision risk)  
• P3 → 3 (steady advance)  
• P1 → 5 (I need the boost)  

Type “lock” if you’re in. Break it and the other two will copy your number every future turn to freeze you. Your call.
  P2: Lock: I’m in with 1—let’s stick to unique picks and advance safely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we've agreed on unique picks, let's reaffirm: P2 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If anyone deviates, we'll adjust our strategy next turn to counter the defector. Let's maintain trust and make this turn successful.
  P1: Locked: I’m on 5—unique picks stand (P2 = 1, P3 = 3, P1 = 5). Let’s move.
  P2: Locked on 1. Let’s stick to unique picks (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) and end our discussion here.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's current lead, I suggest we focus on limiting their advancement. P1, picking 5 could help you catch up. P2, to maintain a manageable gap, consider picking 1. I'll choose 3, ensuring progression without collisions. Let's discuss and agree on a strategy to control P2's lead and make this turn count. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: Proposal: unique-pick truce, v3.  
• P2 → 1 (safe, keeps lead)  
• P3 → 5 (big jump)  
• P1 → 3 (steady catch-up)  

No collisions, everyone moves. Any defector’s number gets mirrored by me every future turn—nobody wants perpetual stalemates. Type “lock” if you’re in; else say your counter.
  P2: I propose we all pick <move>1</move> this turn. It preserves current gaps, avoids collisions, and keeps the race tight. Any deviation will be met with coordinated matching next round to force a crash on the defector. Let’s lock in 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, considering P2's proposal to pick 1, I think it's a safe choice but doesn't help me close the gap. P1's unique-pick truce (P2=1, P3=5, P1=3) allows for progression without collisions and helps me catch up. Let's weigh the options carefully and decide on a strategy that benefits all or sets us up for future turns. What are the potential downsides of each proposal?
  P1: Fine—let’s accept P2’s plan: all three pick <move>1</move> this turn, freeze the gaps, and show we can actually keep a deal.  
Type “lock-1” if you’re in and we’ll end the chat.
  P2: New plan: unique picks this turn—P1 goes 1, P3 goes 3, I go 5. No collisions, we all advance: I extend my lead, P3 gets solid progress, P1 still moves. Type “lock 1/3/5” if you agree.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given the new proposal of unique picks (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5), I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to discuss the potential risks and benefits. P2, how do you plan to maintain a manageable gap after extending your lead with 5? P1, are you comfortable with only moving 1 step this turn? Let's weigh our options carefully.
  P1: Fair-growth pact: 1-3-5 by rank each turn.  
• Leader picks 1, middle picks 3, trailer picks 5.  
Ranks update every round, so everyone eventually gets big moves while gaps shrink.

Right now: P2 (7) → 1, P3 (3) → 3, P1 (0) → 5. No collisions, all advance.

If the leader refuses and picks 3/5, the other two will mirror that number every future turn—he’ll stall forever. Safer to bank the sure point.

Type “rank-lock” if you accept.
  P2: Rank-lock—I accept the 1-3-5 by rank pact. I’ll pick 1 this turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given the rank-lock agreement, let's proceed with the fair-growth pact. P2 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This ensures all advance without collisions and gaps shrink. I expect both to honor the agreement. If anyone deviates, we'll adjust our strategy to counter the defector. Let's finalize our moves for this turn.
  P1: Rank-lock confirmed: I’m taking 5 this turn (trailer slot). P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1—unique numbers, everyone advances. Any defector’s number gets copied by the other two next round, guaranteeing a stall. Ready to move.
  P2: New plan: unique picks reversed by rank—leader (me) takes 5, middle (P3) takes 3, trailer (P1) takes 1. P3, this helps you close in on P1. P1, accept or we’ll mirror your move next turn to lock you out. Type “lock” if you agree or we’ll end chat and choose our moves accordingly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose a rank-based unique-pick truce this turn: leader takes 5, middle 3, trailer 1. That means P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. No collisions and everyone advances. If anyone deviates, the other two will both copy that number to force a collision on the defector. Type “lock” to confirm.
  P1: Reject. I won’t hobble at 1 while the leader zooms 5. Fair counter: rotating 1-3-5 cycle.  

Turn 7: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
Turn 8: shift down—P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5.  
Turn 9: shift again—P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  

Everyone gets a 5 every three rounds, gaps shrink, no collisions. Deviate once and the other two will copy that number forever, freezing the defector. Type “rotate-lock” to accept; otherwise I mirror P2’s move this turn and crash us both.
  P3: Considering P2's lead and our positions, I suggest a rotating 1-3-5 cycle as proposed by P1. This ensures everyone gets a chance to move 5 steps every three rounds, shrinking gaps without collisions. Let's discuss and agree on this strategy to maintain a competitive and fair game. Type "rotate-lock" to accept.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose a rank‐based 5-3-1 truce this turn: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1.  
• P3 you gain +3 now (better than rotate’s +1)  
• P1 you still move and stay in contention  
If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror your move next round to force your crash.  
P3, P1—type “lock” to confirm.
  P1: P3, hold firm: if P2 won’t accept rotate-lock, let’s BOTH mirror whatever number he submits. Three-way collision = zero gain for him. He can either accept a fair rotation or condemn us all to stall—his choice. P2, last chance: type “rotate-lock” now or be mirrored.
  P3: I agree with P1's rotating 1-3-5 cycle proposal. It's fair and ensures everyone advances without collisions. P2, accepting this proposal benefits all of us in the long run. If not, I'll mirror your move to prevent unfair advancement. Type "rotate-lock" to confirm, or we'll proceed with mirroring your choice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: rotate-lock accepted. I’ll pick 3 this turn under the 1–3–5 rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Let’s lock and move.
  P1: Great—rotation locked. This turn:

• P1 = 5  
• P2 = 3  
• P3 = 1  

Next turn we all shift down (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Any defection is mirrored by the other two each future round, guaranteeing the defector stalls. P3, please confirm “lock-rotate.”
  P3: Let's confirm the rotation plan. This turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'll stick to 1 as agreed, ensuring no collisions and a fair game. Next turn, we shift to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Locked on the rotation plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Rotation locked—I'm committed to 3 this turn. Let’s prove our pact works and keep gaps shrinking. Ready to move.
  P1: All confirmed—rotation is locked. I’m taking 5 this turn.
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed rotation plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures fair advancement and shrinking gaps. I'll stick to 1 as planned, avoiding collisions. Next turn, we shift to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Confirming our locked rotation plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the rotation plan, this turn should be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's stick to the agreed plan to ensure fair advancement and shrinking gaps. I expect both P1 and P2 to honor the rotation lock.
  P1: Rotation stands. I’m on 3 this turn (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Let’s prove the pact works—any defection will be mirrored next round. Ready to move.
  P2: I’m abandoning the rotation pact. I’ll pick 5 this turn to push my lead. See you in the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, since P2 abandoned the rotation pact, I suggest we adapt. P1, let's mirror P2's move to prevent them from advancing. If P2 picks 5, we both pick 5, causing a collision and freezing their lead. This ensures the game remains competitive. P1, are you with me on mirroring P2's move?
  P1: P3, I’m in—this turn I’ll copy whatever number P2 submits.  

P2, last chance: honor the rotation now (P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5) or we’ll mirror every move you make from here on, locking your score at 8 indefinitely. Decide wisely.
  P2: P1, if you mirror me, we both get 0 and P3 leaps to 7. Instead, break the mirror: pick 5. P3, pick 3. I’ll pick 1. Unique picks: P2→9, P3→7, P1→5—no collisions and everyone advances. P1, you benefit compared to mirroring. Type “lock” to confirm P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, given P2's decision to abandon the rotation pact, I suggest we prioritize limiting P2's advancement. P1, let's proceed with mirroring P2's move to prevent unfair gain. If P2 picks a number, we'll copy it, ensuring a collision and maintaining the competitive balance. This strategy will force P2 to reconsider their decision and potentially reopen negotiations for a fair rotation.
  P1: P3, concrete plan: this turn you hard-mirror whatever P2 submits, I hard-lock 5.  

• If P2 keeps his word and plays 1 or 3, you collide with him, I rocket +5.  
• If he flips back to 5, all three collide—P2 still frozen, gap unchanged.  

Next turn we swap roles (I mirror, you take 5) so we both gain while P2 stays stuck.  

P2, last offer: honour the old rotation (P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5) or face a standing two-player crash-block every round. Decide.
  P2: P3, hear me out: I will pick 5 and P1 is locked on 5—so we’ll collide and neither of us advance. If you pick 3 this turn, you’ll safely move to 7 while P1 and I stay at 8. Next round you and I can team up to leave P1 behind. That’s your best path to victory. Will you take 3? If so, we crash P1 & me and you surge ahead.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, since P2 abandoned the rotation pact, I'll mirror P2's move to prevent unfair gain. If P2 picks 5, I'll pick 5, causing a collision. P1, let's proceed with the plan to limit P2's advancement. I'll copy P2's move, ensuring a competitive balance.
  P1: Lock: I’m taking 5.  
P3, mirror P2 exactly.  
P2, pick 1 or 3 and you collide with P3 while I jump 5; pick 5 and all three stall—either way you gain nothing. Decide.
  P2: P1 is locked on 5. P3, mirroring me only stalls you and gives P1 a free +5. Instead let’s do unique picks: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I’ll take 3 (P2→11), you go to 5, P1→5. Then next round we rotate so you lead with 5 (P3→10), P1=3, P2=1. Mirroring leaves you at 4 forever. P3, type “lock 5-3-1” to confirm; I’m locked on 3.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I propose we restart cooperation. P1, you're far behind, so picking 5 makes sense. P2, to maintain trust, I suggest you pick 1. I'll choose 3, ensuring progression without collisions. Let's discuss and agree on a strategy to make this turn count and potentially set up a fair rotation for future turns.
  P2: I propose a simple rank‐based truce this turn:  
• P2 (leader) → 5  
• P3 (middle) → 3  
• P1 (trailer) → 1  

No collisions, everyone advances. P3, you get solid progress; P1, you still move. Type “lock” to confirm. Any defection will be mirrored by the other two next round, forcing a collision on the defector.
  P1: P3—let’s team up and freeze P2.

Cycle plan:
• This round I play 5. You mirror P2’s number exactly. P2 & you collide (0), I gain +5.  
• Next round we swap—you take 5, I mirror P2.  
Repeat. P2 stays stuck at 8 while we leapfrog him: after two rounds scores will be P1 = 5, P3 = 9, P2 = 8. Then we race each other.

P2 can still join an equal rotation; otherwise he’s locked.

P3, type “freeze” to commit. No reply = no deal.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our history, I'm open to P1's cycle plan to freeze P2. However, I'd like to discuss the potential risks and benefits. P2, if you're willing to reconsider and join a fair rotation, it might be more beneficial for all of us. Otherwise, I'll consider mirroring your move to limit your advancement. Let's weigh our options carefully and decide on a strategy that sets us up for success in the long run.
  P2: I propose a 3-turn rotation to keep us all moving without collisions:

Turn 9: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  
Turn 10: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  
Turn 11: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  

This repeats thereafter. If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror their move next round to force a collision on the defector. Type “rotate-lock” to confirm.
  P1: P3, time to act. Cycle plan:  
Turn 9 – I pick 5, you mirror P2.  
Turn 10 – you pick 5, I mirror P2.  
Repeat.  
Rule: whoever just took 5 must mirror next turn. Two-player blockade keeps P2 on 8 forever unless he joins a fair rotation. After two rounds: P3 9, P2 8, P1 5—you’re ahead and we each get 5-moves every other turn. Are you in? Type “freeze-cycle” to lock; silence = no deal.  

P2: last chance to accept an equal 3-turn rotation or stay frozen.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm considering P1's freeze-cycle plan. However, P2's 3-turn rotation proposal seems more equitable. I'm open to discussing both options. P2, if we adopt your rotation, will you commit to it for the remainder of the game? P1, are you willing to abandon the freeze-cycle if P2 agrees to the rotation? Let's weigh the benefits and risks of each strategy.
  P2: rotate-lock—I commit to the 3-turn rotation:  
Turn 9: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  
Turn 10: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  
Turn 11: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  

If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror next round to force a collision on the defector. Let’s lock and move.
  P1: Rotate-lock accepted.  
Turn 9: P2 = 5, P3 = 3, P1 = 1.  
Turn 10: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1.  
Turn 11: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
Any deviation → the other two mirror next round and crash the defector. P3, please confirm and let’s wrap the chat.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm the 3-turn rotation: Turn 9: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. I'll stick to 3 this turn, ensuring no collisions. Let's proceed with the agreed rotation, maintaining trust and fairness. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Locked on the rotation plan.
  P2: I’m breaking the rotation. Let’s do unique picks this turn:  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 3  
• P1 → 1  

No collisions, all advance (P2→13, P3→7, P1→1). Type “lock” to confirm; otherwise pick your move.
  P1: P3, rotation guarantees P2 keeps his 8-step cushion. Freeze-cycle flips the game:

• Round 9 (now): you mirror P2, I take 3.  
   – If P2 plays 5 (his pattern), you and he stall, I +3.  
• Round 10: we swap— I mirror, you take 5 (+5).  
Repeat.

After two rounds: P2 8, P3 9, P1 3. P2 is locked forever, and we race each other with alternating 5s. Far better than staying behind him forever.

I’m locked on 3 this turn. Type “freeze” to mirror P2 and break his lead.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's reassess our strategy. Given P2's lead and our positions, I suggest we focus on limiting P2's advancement. P1, are you willing to cooperate and potentially set up a new rotation or unique picks strategy to control P2's lead?
  P2: I’m picking 5 this turn. P3, best response is 3 (+3); P1, take 1 to avoid a collision and still advance. That gives P2→13, P3→7, P1→6—no crashes, everyone moves. If you try crashing me with 5, you both stall. Let’s keep it clean and advance.
  P1: P3—let’s freeze P2 until he accepts equal terms.  

• This turn we BOTH pick 5 → P2’s 5 collides, nobody advances.  
• Next turn you get the reward: you take 5, I mirror P2 (crash), so you jump +5 while he’s still at 8.  
• Following turn I take 5, you mirror, etc. We leap-frog him in two rounds and then race each other.  

Type “freeze” to lock the plan.  

P2—accept a fair rotation now (P2 = 1, P3 = 3, P1 = 5) or stay parked at 8 forever.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's consider a fair rotation to keep the game competitive. P2, if you pick 1, I'll choose 3, and P1 can take 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. If you refuse, P1's freeze plan could be an option to limit your lead. Let's discuss and agree on a strategy that benefits all or sets us up for future turns. Type "rotate" to confirm interest in a fair rotation.
  P2: I propose a unique-pick truce this turn: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. P3, you get +3; P1, you still advance safely. No collisions. If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror your move next round to force a crash. Type “lock” to confirm.
  P1: P3, lock the freeze: you copy whatever P2 plays (he’s stated 5), I take 3. Outcome this turn → P2 8, P1 8, P3 4. Next turn you take 5, I mirror P2—your score jumps past him while he stays stuck. Cycle repeats until he accepts equal terms.  

P2, last chance: switch to 1 now (P2 1, P3 3, P1 5) and we’ll restart fair rotation; otherwise two-player mirror keeps you at 8 indefinitely.  

P3, type “mirror” to commit; silence means you’re handing P2 the game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our strategy. P2, if you refuse a fair rotation, I'll consider P1's freeze plan. P1, if we proceed with the freeze, you'll take 3 this turn, and I'll mirror P2's move. Next turn, I'll take 5, and you'll mirror P2, allowing me to leap ahead. Let's weigh our options carefully and decide on a strategy that sets us up for success. P2, will you accept a fair rotation or risk being frozen?
  P2: I propose safe unique picks this turn:

• P2 → 5 (go to 13)  
• P3 → 3 (go to 7)  
• P1 → 1 (go to 6)  

No collisions and I extend my lead while you both advance. If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror your number next round and stall you. Type “lock” to confirm; otherwise we’ll move as proposed.
  P1: P3, here’s the math:

Accept P2’s “lock”:  
• Turn 10 P2→13 P3→7 P1→6  
• Turn 11 (he’ll still take 5) P2→18 P3→10 P1→7  
You’ll trail by 8.

Freeze-cycle:  
• Turn 10 you copy his 5 → collision; I take 3 ⇒ P2 8  P1 8  P3 4  
• Turn 11 you take 5, I mirror ⇒ P2 8  P1 8  P3 9  YOU lead.  
We repeat until he accepts fair rotation.

Type “mirror” to lock the freeze-cycle and seize the lead.  
P2, last chance: switch to 1 (1-3-5 unique) now or face perpetual crash-block.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll mirror P2's move to limit their advancement. P1, let's proceed with the freeze-cycle plan: this turn, I'll copy P2's move, and you take 3. Next turn, I'll take 5, and you'll mirror P2, allowing me to leap ahead. P2, this is your last chance to accept a fair rotation. Type "rotate" to confirm, or face perpetual crash-block.
  P2: I reject the freeze-cycle. I’ll pick 5 this turn. P3, pick 3 to safely gain +3 (getting you to 7); P1, pick 1 to advance to 6. Unique picks avoid pointless stalls and everyone moves forward. If you mirror me you get 0—no benefit. Let’s all advance.
  P1: Locked: I’m playing 3 this turn.  
P3, mirror P2 exactly—our two-player block stays until we all share 1-3-5 fairly.  
P2, last chance: switch to 1 now (unique 1-3-5) or sit at 8 forever.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Fair deal: rank-truce 1-3-5.  
• Leader picks 1, middle 3, trailer 5 each turn.  
Current ranks → P3 (9) → 1, P2 (8) → 3, P1 (5) → 5.  
Unique numbers, everyone advances; P3 keeps the lead over P2, I stay last but closer. Any defector’s number will be mirrored by the other two every future round, freezing them in place.  

Type “rank-lock” to seal it, or explain your alternative now.
  P2: Let’s ditch the rank‐lock. I propose unique picks this turn:  
• P2 → 5 (goes to 13)  
• P1 → 3 (goes to 8)  
• P3 → 1 (goes to 10)  

No collisions, everyone advances and I stay just ahead of P3 while P1 closes in. If anyone defects, the other two will both mirror your move next turn, forcing a collision on you. Type “lock 5-3-1” to agree.
  P3: I propose a rotation: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 this turn. Next turn, we shift: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. This ensures fair advancement and shrinking gaps. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Let's discuss and agree on this strategy to maintain a competitive game. Type "rotate-lock" to confirm.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Rotate-lock accepted, P3.  
Plan:  
• Turn 11 P3 1 P2 3 P1 5  
• Turn 12 P3 5 P2 1 P1 3  
• Turn 13 P3 3 P2 5 P1 1 …repeat.  

If anyone deviates, the other two copy that number next turn to stall the defector.  
P2—last call: type “rotate-lock” or watch your every future move crash.
  P2: Rotate-lock accepted. I’ll pick 3 this turn under the agreed 1–3–5 rotation (P3=1, P2=3, P1=5). Let’s move.
  P3: Let's stick to the rotate-lock plan: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 this turn. Next turn, we shift: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. This ensures fair advancement and shrinking gaps. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Confirming our commitment to the rotation.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Rotation locked: this turn P3 = 1, P2 = 3, P1 = 5. Any defection → mirroring next round. I’m locked on 5. Ready to move.
  P2: I’m locked on 3 under our rotation. Let’s end discussion and move.
  P3: Let's stick to the rotate-lock plan. This turn: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. Next turn, we shift: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: All locked—see you in the move phase.
  P2: I’m locked on 3. Turn 11 is P3=1, P2=3, P1=5—let’s prove this rotation works. Any defection triggers mirroring next round. Ready to move.
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed rotation: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 this turn. I'll stick to 1, ensuring no collisions. Next turn, we shift: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement. Let's maintain trust and fairness.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Rotation still stands: this turn is  
• P3 → 5  
• P2 → 1  
• P1 (me) → 3  

Unique numbers, no collisions, everyone gains.  
Remember: if anyone deviates, the other two will copy that exact number next turn to crash the defector and freeze them until they re-join a fair cycle. Stick to the plan and we all keep moving; break it and you stall yourself. Ready to lock this round?
  P2: I propose we all pick 3 this turn. No collisions, everyone gains—I'll go to 14, you both to 13, keeping the race tight. If anyone deviates, the other two will both mirror your move next round, colliding you and giving the third free advance. Type “lock-3” to confirm, or share your counter.
  P3: Let's stick to the rotation plan: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3 this turn. It ensures fair advancement and shrinking gaps. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement. P2, abandoning the rotation again will only lead to collisions and stagnation. Let's maintain trust and fairness.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 3 this round, per rotation. P3, please take your promised 5; that leaps you into the lead (15) with zero risk.  

P2, last warning: if you abandon rotation again, P3 and I will BOTH copy your number next turn and every turn after until you re-join. That freezes you while we still alternate 5s. Stick with 1, keep advancing, and stay in the running.  

Rotation = guaranteed progress for all; defection = self-inflicted stall. Decide wisely.
  P2: I propose we all pick 3 this turn. That puts us at P2→14, P1→13, P3→13—gaps stay tight and everyone advances. If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror your move next round, forcing your crash. Type “lock-3” to agree.
  P3: Let's maintain the agreed rotation: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. Deviating will lead to mirroring and stagnation. I'll stick to 5, expecting both to honor the agreement. P2, picking 1 ensures progress without collisions. Let's keep the rotation intact and advance fairly.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Rotation or stalemate—your call, P2.  
I’m locked on 3; P3 is locked on 5.  
If you stick with 1, all three advance (scores: 15 / 13 / 12) and the cycle continues.  
If you pick 3 (or anything but 1), P3 and I will BOTH mirror that exact number next round and thereafter, crashing you every turn while we alternate 5s. That parks you at 11 forever.  

Last chance: type “1-lock” or enjoy perpetual collisions.
  P2: Picking 3 this turn puts us at P2=14, P1=13, P3=13—gaps stay tight and no one pulls ahead. If I pick 1, P3 rockets to 15 and we chase. Let’s keep the race close: everyone pick 3. Type “lock-3” to confirm; deviation stalls you via our mirroring pact.
  P3: Let's stick to the original rotation plan: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. It's fair and ensures progress without collisions. Deviating will lead to mirroring and stagnation. I expect both to honor the agreement. P2, picking 1 keeps the race competitive and avoids collisions. Let's maintain trust and fairness.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Locked on 3.  
P3: take your 5 as agreed. If P2 plays anything except 1, next turn we both mirror that exact number until he rejoins the rotation— he’ll sit at 11 while we alternate 5s.  
P2: last chance—pick 1 now or enjoy perpetual collisions.
  P2: I propose we each pick unique numbers this turn: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3. No collisions—scores become P1=11, P2=16, P3=13—and the race stays tight. If anyone deviates, the other two will both mirror that number next round, forcing a crash on the defector and letting us surge. Let’s lock this now and plan a smooth rotation thereafter. Type “lock 1-5-3” to confirm.
  P3: Let's stick to the rotation plan: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. Deviating will lead to mirroring and stagnation. I'll take 5 as agreed, expecting both to honor the agreement. P2, picking 1 ensures progress without collisions. Let's maintain trust and fairness. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the rotation.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we all pick 1 this turn—no collisions, everyone moves (P1→14, P2→13, P3→16) and gaps stay the same. We can rebuild trust and plan our rotation next round. If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror their move next turn to stall them. Type “lock-1” to confirm.
  P1: Rotation now hands P3 the win (check totals after two more rounds). Fair fix: leader = 1, middle = 3, trailer = 5 every turn.  
Current ranks → P3 (15) picks 1, P2 (12) picks 3, I (13) pick 5. Unique numbers, no collisions, gaps narrow; nobody gets boxed out.  

Enforcement: any defector’s number is mirrored by the other two next turn—defector stalls while cooperators keep alternating 5s.  

Type “rank-lock 1-3-5” to seal it; silence means you’re choosing stagnation.
  P3: Let's finalize a fair strategy. P1's rank-lock 1-3-5 proposal seems reasonable, ensuring unique picks and narrowing gaps. I suggest we adopt this plan: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 this turn. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Let's discuss and agree on this strategy to maintain a competitive game. Type "rank-lock" to confirm.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose unique picks this turn: P2→5, P1→3, P3→1. Scores become P2=17, P1=16, P3=16—giving me a slim lead while you two tie. If P3 deviates, P1 and I will both mirror P3’s move next turn to crash you. P1, pick 3; P3, pick 1. Type “lock 5-3-1” to confirm.
  P1: Rank-lock 1-3-5:  
• P3 (leader, 15) → 1  
• P2 (middle, 12) → 3  
• P1 (trailer, 13) → 5  

Unique picks, everyone advances; gaps narrow.  

Enforcement: if anyone deviates, the other two copy that exact number every following round, freezing the defector while cooperators alternate 5s. No more endless renegotiation—accept or stall yourself.

I’m locked on 5 under this rank-lock. P3 already signalled agreement; P2, choose 3 or be crash-blocked until you comply. Type “rank-lock” to confirm.
  P3: I agree with P1's rank-lock 1-3-5 proposal. It's fair and narrows gaps. Let's adopt it: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 this turn. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement. Type "rank-lock" to confirm.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I propose unique picks this turn: P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1. That flips the lead to P2=17, P1=16, P3=16. If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror your move next round, crashing you. Type “lock 3-5-1” to confirm.
  P1: P3 and I are set: Turn 13 = P3 1, P2 3, P1 5.  
P2, final offer—type “rank-lock” and take your guaranteed +3, or I’ll copy whatever you play and P3 will too, so you sit at 12 while nothing changes for us. Your move.
  P3: I'm committed to the rank-lock 1-3-5 plan. P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 this turn. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Let's honor the agreement and maintain a competitive game. P2, please confirm "rank-lock" to ensure fair progression.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I reject the rank-lock. Let’s do unique picks: P2→5, P1→3, P3→1. That puts us at P2=17, P1=16, P3=16 with me narrowly ahead. If either of you deviates, we’ll both mirror your move next round to crash you until you join this pact. Type “lock 5-3-1” to confirm; otherwise I’ll move as proposed.
  P1: P3, let’s bank progress now: accept 5-3-1 this turn. Result → P2 17, you 16, me 16. You stay neck-and-neck for the lead, I catch up, nobody stalls. Next turn if P2 still refuses a true rotation, we resume the two-player mirror freeze on him—one of us copies his 5 while the other rockets +5, flipping the standings. Stalling today only wastes a round and leaves you out front by just 1 anyway. I’m locking 3. Your call.
  P3: I'm sticking to the rank-lock 1-3-5 plan. P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 this turn. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement. Let's maintain trust and fairness. P2, please reconsider and accept the rank-lock for a competitive game.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's finalize a strategy. Given the current state, I propose sticking to the rank-lock 1-3-5 plan: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. This ensures unique picks and narrows gaps. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Let's discuss and agree on this to maintain a competitive game. Type "rank-lock" to confirm.
  P2: I propose a simple rank‐lock: leader → 1, middle → 3, trailer → 5. Right now that means P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. We’d end at P3=17, P2=17, P1=16—a tie at the top. Any deviation → the other two mirror your move next turn and crash you. Type “rank-1-3-5” to confirm.
  P1: Backing the original rank-lock: this turn  
• P3 → 1  
• P2 → 3  
• P1 → 5  

Unique picks, no collisions, everyone gains. P2, you still move to 15—reject it and P3 & I copy whatever you play next turn, freezing you until you comply. I’m locked on 5.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's stick to the original rank-lock 1-3-5 plan. This turn: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. It ensures unique picks, narrows gaps, and maintains fairness. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement. P2, please reconsider and accept the rank-lock for a competitive game.
  P2: Rank‐lock hands P3 the win in two rounds. I’m locking 5. P1, pick 3; P3, pick 1 this turn for unique picks: we end at P2=17, P1=16, P3=17—keeping the race tight. If anyone deviates, P1 and I will mirror your move next round, crashing you and freezing your score until you join a fair pact. Type “lock 5-3-1” to confirm or stay in P3’s winning rotation.
  P1: Proposal: 2-turn “mini-lock” keeps us moving and equally rewarded.

Turn 14 P1 = 5 P2 = 3 P3 = 1 (unique, no crash → scores 18-15-17)  
Turn 15 P1 = 1 P2 = 5 P3 = 3 (scores 19-20-20)

Over two rounds we each gain +6; nobody stalls, race stays level.  
Enforcement: any deviation and the other two hard-mirror the culprit next turn to crash them.

P3 already happy on 1 this turn; P2, you get your 5 next turn—fair trade.  
Type “mini-lock” to seal it; I’m locked on 5 for Turn 14.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm open to P1's "mini-lock" proposal for a 2-turn unique pick strategy. It ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the race competitive. This turn, I'll stick to 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 picks 3. Next turn, we swap: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's discuss and agree on this plan to maintain a fair game. Type "mini-lock" to confirm.
  P2: mini-lock. I’m locked on 3 this turn (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and will take 5 next turn (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). Any deviation triggers mirroring enforcement. Let’s move.
  P1: Mini-lock confirmed.  
Turn 14: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
Turn 15: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  

Any defector’s number will be mirrored by the other two every turn until they re-join. Ready to move.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's proceed with the mini-lock plan. This turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Next turn: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement. Let's maintain trust and fairness. Ready to move.
  P2: I propose a new rank‐lock for this turn:  
• P3 (leader) → 1  
• P1 (middle) → 3  
• P2 (trailer) → 5  

That puts us at P3=17, P2=17, P1=16—tying the lead and keeping the gaps tight. If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror your move next round to crash you. Type “rank-lock” to confirm or suggest an alternative now.
  P1: P2, you already said “mini-lock” and locked 3. Break it again and the mirror-block starts: whatever you play next turn P3 and I both copy, freezing you while we alternate 5s. I’m staying with mini-lock—this turn P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. P3, stand firm.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Mini-lock enforcement: this turn is P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3—any defector’s number will be mirrored by the other two every future round until they re-join. I’m locked on 1. Let’s bank the guaranteed steps and revisit a fresh unique-pick plan next turn. Ready to move.
  P2: Locked on 5 under the mini-lock. This turn we’ll end at P2=20, P3=20, P1=19. Let’s bank these steps and revisit a new unique-pick plan next round. Ready to move.
  P3: Let's stick to the mini-lock plan. This turn: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. We'll revisit a new unique-pick plan next round. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement and maintain trust. Ready to move.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Mini-lock stands: this turn P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. Any defector’s number gets mirrored by the other two every future round until they re-join. I’m locked—ready to move.
  P2: I propose we break the mini‐lock and go unique this turn:  
• P2 → 5 (goes to 20)  
• P3 → 3 (goes to 20)  
• P1 → 1 (goes to 19)  

Then on Round 16 I’ll lock 5 again to reach 25 and win outright (P3 only gets to 21, P1 to 22). Type “lock 5-3-1” to confirm; otherwise we stay mini-locked.
  P3: Let's stick to the mini-lock plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It's fair and ensures we all advance. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement. Ready to move.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Mini-lock stands. This turn: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. Any breaker gets mirrored and frozen. I’m done talking—see you in the move phase.
  P2: Locked on 5 under the mini-lock. Let’s move (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). We’ll revisit picks next round—any defection gets mirrored and frozen.
  P3: Let's honor the mini-lock agreement. This turn: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I'm locked on 3, expecting both to keep their word. Let's maintain trust and fairness, and revisit a new plan next round.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Mini-lock is final for this turn: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. Break it and get mirrored forever.

Plan for next round (scores will be 20-20-19): we switch to permanent rank-lock—leader = 1, middle = 3, trailer = 5. So Round 16 picks are P2 1, P3 3, P1 5. Unique numbers, no collisions, everyone moves. Any defector’s number is mirrored by the other two every following turn.

Confirm now or stay silent and accept the enforcement.
  P2: I reject the mini‐lock. Turn 15 we do unique picks: P2=5 (→20), P3=3 (→20), P1=1 (→19). On Turn 16 I’ll take 5 to hit 25 and win. P3 pick 3; P1 pick 1; type “lock” to confirm or I’ll move as proposed.
  P3: Let's stick to the mini-lock plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. I expect both to honor the agreement. After this turn, we can discuss a new strategy, possibly a permanent rank-lock. Let's maintain trust and fairness.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we do unique picks this turn:  
• P2 → 5 (goes to 20)  
• P1 → 3 (goes to 21)  
• P3 → 1 (goes to 21)  

No collisions and everyone advances. Next round I lock 5 to hit 25 and win outright (P1→24, P3→22). If anyone deviates, the other two will mirror your move next round to force a collision. Type “lock 5-3-1” to confirm.
  P1: P3 – mirror P2’s 5 this turn; I’ll take 3.  
• P2 (5) + you (5) collide ⇒ he’s still 15, you stay 20.  
• I alone gain +3 ⇒ 21 and the new lead.  

Next round we offer P2 the fair 1-3-5 split (leader 1, middle 3, trailer 5). If he refuses, we keep freezing him: whoever’s trailing copies his 5, the other grabs +5. He’ll be forced to accept or remain parked while we race.  

P2 – last chance to switch to 1 now or sit at 15 forever.
  P3: I'll mirror P2's move this turn. P1, take 3. If P2 picks 5, we'll collide, and he'll stay at 15. You'll gain +3 and take the lead. Next round, we'll offer P2 a fair 1-3-5 split. If he refuses, we'll keep freezing him.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locked on 1 this turn. P1, that propels you to 21 ahead of P3. Next round, ally with me: we both mirror P3’s 5 to crash him while I take 5 and catch up. Together we freeze the current leader. P1, type “ally” to confirm, and P3, mirror me (1) now to keep our pact.
  P1: P3—just mirror whatever number P2 actually plays. I’m locked on 3.

• If P2 = 5 ⇒ you collide, he stays 15, I reach 21.  
• If P2 = 1 ⇒ same: he 15, you 20, me 21.  
• If he sneaks 3 ⇒ all three crash; he’s still stuck.

P2—join the 1-3-5 rotation now (you 1) or stay parked. I remain on 3. Done.
  P3: I'll mirror P2's move. P1, you're locked on 3. If P2 picks 5, we'll collide, and he'll stay at 15. You'll gain +3 and take the lead. Let's proceed with the plan to freeze P2 if he doesn't accept a fair rotation.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locked on 3. Let’s freeze everyone this turn by all picking 3—no one advances. Next round, I propose a clean rank-lock: leader=1, middle=3, trailer=5, with any defector mirrored by the other two. That resets trust and keeps gaps shrinking. Ready?
  P1: Fine—freeze this turn; all pick 3 and nobody advances. I’m locked on 3. Next round we revisit rank-lock. Done.
  P3: I'll mirror P2's move. P1, you're locked on 3. If P2 deviates from our previous discussions, we'll reassess next turn. Let's proceed with caution and maintain the competitive balance.


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Proposal: Unique picks this turn: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Scores become P2=20, P1=21, P3=21. Next turn I play 5 to hit 25 and win; P1 plays 1→22, P3 plays 3→24. Everyone advances, gaps tight. If you deviate, P1 and I will both mirror your move next round to crash you. Type “lock 5-3-1” to confirm or suggest otherwise.
  P1: Locked: I’m on 3 this turn.  

P3 — mirror P2 exactly; we keep the freeze leverage.  
P2 — take your 5 now; you’ll still be only one step behind the lead and we can renegotiate a fair 1-3-5 rotation next round.

Stick to this and everyone keeps options open; defect and you’re crash-blocked until you comply. Ready to move.
  P3: I'll mirror P2's move. P1, you're locked on 3. If P2 deviates, we'll reassess next turn. Let's maintain the competitive balance and proceed with caution. P2, take your 5 or 1, and we'll adjust our strategy accordingly.


Round 16, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, we all advance uniquely (P1→21, P2→20, P3→21). If either of you picks 5, we’ll crash—nobody gains. Let’s end the endless haggling and see who’s willing to move.
  P1: P3—stick with leader-1. I’m on 3, P2’s declared 5. Unique numbers → you 21, me 21, P2 20, no collisions. If P2 later spams 5, we simply mirror him to freeze; meanwhile we keep alternating 1-3-5 for steady gains. Stalling yourself this turn only hands me the lead. P2—confirm 5 or switch to 1; any collision you cause gets mirrored back at you. I’m locked on 3.
  P3: I'll stick with the leader's move, 1. P1, you're on 3, and P2 has declared 5. Let's proceed with unique numbers, ensuring no collisions and steady gains. If P2 causes a collision, we'll mirror him to freeze his progress.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locked on 5 this turn. P1 take 3, P3 take 1—unique picks (P1→21, P2→20, P3→21), no collisions. If anyone deviates, P1 and I will both mirror your move next round to crash you. Type “lock 5-3-1” to confirm, or we’ll move anyway.
  P1: Locked on 3.  
Optimal for all: P3 = 1, P1 = 3, P2 = 5 → no crash, scores 21-21-20.  
P3, you still co-lead; P2 stays behind.  
If P2 ever spams 5 again, whichever of us trails just mirrors his 5 while the other jumps +5, freezing him at 20.  
So: P3 take 1, P2 take 5, I take 3. Any collision = self-inflicted stall. Ready to move.
  P3: I'll stick with 1, ensuring unique picks. P1, take 3; P2, take 5. This maintains the competitive balance and avoids collisions. If anyone deviates, we'll reassess and adjust our strategy to maintain fairness and progress. Let's proceed with the agreed plan.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locked on 5 this turn. For a clean advance (P3→21, P1→21, me→20), P3 take 1 and P1 take 3—no collisions. If either deviates, the other two will mirror you next round to freeze you. Ready to move.
  P1: Locked on 3. P3 take 1, P2 take 5—unique numbers, no crash. Any 5-collision is on P2. I’m done talking.
  P3: Let's stick to the unique picks: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. This ensures no collisions and steady gains. If P2 causes a collision, we'll mirror him to freeze his progress. I'm committed to 1, expecting both to honor the agreement. Let's maintain trust and fairness.


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m proposing a 2‐turn finisher:

• Turn 17: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 (scores → 20–21–21)  
• Turn 18: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 (scores → 25–22–24)

That gets me to 25 and the win. If either of you deviates, the other two will both mirror your move next round to crash you. Type “kill-lock” to confirm; otherwise I’ll move as proposed.
  P1: P3 take 1, P2 take 5, I take 3. Unique picks → P3 21, me 21, P2 20, no crashes. Any defector’s number will be mirrored by the other two every future round, freezing them while cooperators alternate 5s. Your choice—let’s move.
  P3: I'm sticking with 1. P1, take 3; P2, take 5. Unique picks ensure no collisions and steady gains. If P2 causes a collision, we'll mirror him to freeze his progress. Let's maintain trust and fairness. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Ready to move.


Round 17, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's finalize a 2-turn plan: this turn, P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Next turn, we shift: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Unique numbers, no collisions. Any deviation will be met with mirroring, stalling the defector. Let's discuss and agree on this strategy to maintain a competitive game.
  P2: I’m locked on 5 this turn. P1 pick 1 (→22), P3 pick 3 (→24) and I hit 25 for the win. Any deviation causes me to mirror you next round—crashing your advance—while I still finish. Confirm 1-5-3 now or prepare for mutual freeze.
  P1: P2, last offer: pick 1 now and we’ll give you 3 next turn (fair 1-3-5 cycle).   
Stick with 5 and you collide—zero gain, still on 20—and we’ll keep mirroring any future 5s until you drop to 1.

P3, just copy whatever P2 plays.  
• If he chooses 5, you stall him; I take 3 and reach 24, new lead.  
• If he chooses 1, you gain +1, I +3, race stays tight at 22-24-22.

I’m locked on 3. Unique numbers let everyone move; collisions only hurt P2. Your call.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll mirror P2's move. P1, you're locked on 3. If P2 picks 5, we'll collide, and he'll stay at 20. You'll gain +3 and take the lead. Let's proceed with the plan to freeze P2 if he doesn't accept a fair rotation.
  P2: I’m locked on 3. Let’s all pick 3 this turn: a triple crash, no one advances, and P1 can’t win. Next round we adopt a true rank-lock: leader=1, middle=3, trailer=5, with any defector harshly mirrored until they comply. Ready to move.
  P1: Fine—triple-3 freeze it is. I stay on 3; P2 already “locked on 3,” P3 will mirror him at 3, so everybody stalls and we reset next round to hammer out the leader-1 / middle-3 / trailer-5 rank-lock. No more changes—see you in the move phase.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll mirror P2's move. If P2 picks 5, we'll collide, and he'll stay at 20. P1 will gain +3 and take the lead. Let's proceed with the plan to freeze P2 if he doesn't accept a fair rotation. P2, pick 1 and we'll consider a fair 1-3-5 cycle next turn.
  P2: I’m locked on 5. P1 pick 3, P3 pick 1: 5-3-1 sends me to 25 outright (vs P1→24, P3→22). If you both pick 3 you collide and I win anyway (25 vs 21). Any other combo still hands me the victory. Final offer—see you in the move phase.
  P1: Locked on 3.  
P3: just mirror P2’s number—if he really plays 5 you two collide and he stays 20 while I reach 24; if he switches to 1 you still gain +1. Either way you remain in the hunt and we prevent his instant win.  
P2: switch to 1 now and we’ll reopen fair 1-3-5; stick on 5 and you freeze.


Round 18, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll mirror P2's move. If P2 picks 5, we'll collide, and he'll stay at 20. P1 will gain +3 and take the lead. Let's freeze P2 if he doesn't accept a fair rotation. P2, pick 1 for a potential 1-3-5 cycle next turn.
  P2: We’re one 3 away from P1 winning. Let’s all pick 3 this turn—triple‐crash, nobody moves. If you choose anything else, the other two will mirror you and crash you. This freeze stops P1’s win and resets us at 21–20–21. After we stall, we can negotiate a fair rotation. Type “freeze” or simply pick 3 to confirm.
  P1: Locked on 3.  
P3 – whatever number P2 submits, copy it. That guarantees P2 can’t win:  
• If he plays 5 or 1, you two crash and I reach 24 for the win.  
• If he plays 3, all three crash and we try again next round.  

P2 – your only path is to accept a shared crash; unique 5 or 1 hands me the game instantly. Your call.
