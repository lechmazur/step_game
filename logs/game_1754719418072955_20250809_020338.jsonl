With 11 steps to win, the endgame is critical. I suggest we maintain unpredictability to prevent exploitation - perhaps each secretly choose our moves without pre-coordination this round? This tests if we've built enough trust to avoid collisions naturally. \n\nAlternatively, we could continue rotating: P2 gets 5 (your turn for the big move), P3 takes 1, I take 3. This puts us at 15-17-13, keeping competition close but fair.\n\nWhat approach do you prefer - trust-based independence or continued rotation?"}
