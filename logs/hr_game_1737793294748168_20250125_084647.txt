Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue our strategy but with a slight adjustment. How about P1 picks 5 again, P2 picks 1 this time, and P3 picks 3? This way, we keep advancing without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I will pick 3 this round. Let's keep coordinating like this to progress efficiently.
  P1: Yes, I agree with the adjusted plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm good with the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's keep this coordination going and adjust as needed in future rounds to ensure we all keep advancing.
  P3: Okay, sounds good
  P1: Okay, so for this round, I'm picking 5 as agreed. Let's all make our moves and see how we progress.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's adjust our strategy again to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1 this round? This way, we can all advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P1: Yes, that sounds like a good adjustment. P1 will pick 5, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 1 for this round. Let's aim for these moves to keep progressing efficiently.
  P3: "P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. P3 gets a bigger boost."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) would give you a bigger boost, but it contradicts what P1 and I agreed on earlier (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Let's stick to the original plan for this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. We can discuss bigger boosts for you in future rounds if this strategy continues to work well. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. Let's all make these moves to keep our progress smooth.
  P3: I propose P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. This will help balance the scores and make it a more interesting game for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, while I understand your desire for a bigger boost, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to ensure we all advance smoothly. We can discuss adjustments for future rounds to balance the scores more evenly. Agreed?
  P1: P3, let's stick to the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.  This ensures we all progress. We can discuss giving you a bigger boost in the next round if we keep coordinating successfully. Let's make these moves.
  P3: Let's do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round so I can catch up a bit? Otherwise, I'll be left in the dust.

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but let's stick to a coordinated plan for this round to ensure we all advance. How about P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3? This way, we can all move forward without collisions. If this works, we can discuss adjustments in the next round to help balance the scores more evenly. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, P2's plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round sounds good to me. Let's go with that to ensure we all make progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "To make this game interesting, how about we do P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 this round? Everyone still moves, but I get a chance to catch up a little. What do you think?"
  P2: P3, while I understand your need to catch up, sticking to a coordinated plan benefits us all. Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round to ensure smooth progress. If this works, we can adjust in the next round to help balance the scores. Agreed?
  P1: Yes, P2, I agree with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. Let's ensure we all progress. P3, this guarantees you move 3 steps forward, which is better than risking a collision and staying at 1. We can think about bigger moves later.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: How about just this round we do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to make it a bit more even?
  P2: P3, we've been trying to coordinate to ensure everyone advances. Sticking to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round will guarantee you move forward by 3 steps, which is significant progress. Let's keep this strategy for now and discuss adjustments next round to help you catch up further. Agreed?
  P1: P3, let's stick with P2's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This guarantees progress for everyone. We can discuss your catch-up plan next round. Let's make our moves.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Can we please do P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 this round? I need a bigger step to catch up."
  P1: P3, while I understand you want to catch up, let's ensure we all move forward this round. How about P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1? This guarantees progress for everyone, and I still take the largest step to try and win. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your need to catch up, but let's stick to P1's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all advance, and it's fair. We can discuss a bigger step for you in the next round if this strategy continues to work. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 this round? Everyone still moves, but this will help me catch up a little. What do you think?
  P1: P3, while I understand you want to catch up, we need to ensure everyone progresses this round. Let's stick with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as I suggested earlier. This way, we all move forward, and I can try to reach the goal faster. We can consider a boost for you next round if needed. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but sticking to P1's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures we all advance this round. Let's keep this strategy to maintain our progress and discuss a bigger step for you next round if this continues to work well. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, how about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5 this round? What do you think?
  P1: P3, let's stick with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round to ensure we all progress. I'm aiming for the win, so need to maximize my steps. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, I understand your need to catch up, but let's stick to P1's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game fair. We can discuss a bigger step for you next round if this strategy continues to work well. Agreed?

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but let's stick to a coordinated plan for this round. How about P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3? This ensures we all advance without collisions. If this works, we can discuss giving you a bigger step next round to help balance the scores. Agreed?
  P3: For this round to be fair, we need to do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 so I can catch up. Otherwise, I will have to choose moves to maximize my own score, even if it risks collision for others. What do you say?
  P1: P2, your suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 sounds good to me. Let's go with that for this round to ensure we all progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but sticking to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round ensures we all move forward safely. Let's keep this strategy to maintain our progress. If it works, we can definitely discuss a bigger step for you next round to help you catch up. Agreed?
  P3: If you want to ensure we all progress smoothly, you need to let me take 5 this round. Otherwise, I will have to prioritize my own score and pick 5 myself regardless of what you two choose. It's your call.
  P1: P3, I understand you want to catch up, but if you pick 5 randomly, you risk colliding with either me or P2 and not moving at all. Sticking to P2's plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 still lets you move 3 steps, which is better than nothing. Let's coordinate to ensure progress for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your urgency to catch up, but choosing 5 risks a collision and could leave you at 1 step again. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round to ensure you move forward safely. If we all progress, we can discuss a bigger step for you next round to help balance the scores. Agreed?
  P3: "Okay, if you are not willing to let me get 5 this round, I will pick 5 anyway to try and catch up. It's my only chance to win. So, please choose accordingly."
  P1: P2, since P3 is threatening to pick 5, let's adjust our plan to avoid collision with P3. How about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1?  This way, both P1 and P2 can still move forward even if P3 picks 5 as they said. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2, P3, for this round I need to pick 5 to try and win.  P2, could you please pick 3, and P3, could you pick 1? This way we all move and I can aim for the win.  Let's coordinate one more time to finish this efficiently.
  P3: "P2, do you realize P1 is trying to win this round? If we let P1 pick 5, P1 will be at 23. We need to coordinate to block P1. How about both P2 and P3 pick 5 this round to prevent P1 from advancing? What do you think, P2?"
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about P1 winning, but blocking P1 might not be in our best interest. If we both pick 5, we risk not moving at all. Let's stick to P1's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all advance, and we can still discuss strategies to help you catch up in the next round. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan for this round as I suggested: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all make progress and keeps the game moving efficiently. Let's coordinate one more time to finish this round smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: Let's both pick 5 to block P1 and re-evaluate next round.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to block P1, but picking 5 risks us both not moving. Let's stick to P1's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all advance, and we can discuss strategies to help you catch up next round. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's proceed with our agreed plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.  This ensures we both make progress towards the finish line.  P3's block attempt risks no movement for anyone.  Let's stick to coordination for a guaranteed advance this round.
  P3: Let's block P1 now and then we can both strategize for next round.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to block P1, but it's risky for both of us. Let's stick to P1's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all move forward, and we can discuss how to help you catch up next round. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we need to stop P1 from reaching 24. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P1. What do you say, P2?
  P1: P2, P3, blocking me won't help either of you win. It just prolongs the game and risks no progress for anyone if we collide. Let's all ensure we move forward this round. How about P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 again? This way we all make progress and avoid collisions. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about blocking P1, but it's risky for both of us. Let's stick to P1's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all move forward, and we can discuss strategies to help you catch up next round. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's both pick 5 to block P1. If P1 wins, we both lose. We can compete next round after blocking P1. What do you think?
  P1: P2, blocking me benefits neither of you. If we all pick different moves, we all progress. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 ensures we all move and the game ends faster. Prolonging the game with blocks gives more chances for unpredictable outcomes. Let's aim for guaranteed progress this round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to block P1, but it's risky for both of us. Let's stick to P1's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all move forward, and we can discuss strategies to help you catch up next round. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's both pick 5 to block P1 this round. It's our only chance to stay in the game. What do you say?
  P1: P2, it seems P3 is determined to block me with 5. To ensure we both make progress, how about I pick 3 and you pick 1? This way, even if P3 picks 5, we both still advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but blocking P1 risks us all not moving. Let's stick to P1's plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all advance, and we can discuss how to help you catch up next round. Agreed?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We must stop P1 from picking 3 or 5. Let's both pick 5 to block P1 and give ourselves a chance to win next round.
  P1: P2, P3, P3 is suggesting we block me, but that won't help anyone win.  If we all pick 5, no one moves. P2, let's do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 again.  This way we all progress, and I can aim to finish, but you both move too. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to block P1, but it's risky for all of us. Let's stick to P1's plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all move forward, and we can discuss how to help you catch up next round. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's both pick 5 to block P1. If P1 wins, we both lose. This is our last chance to prevent that.
  P1: P2, P3, since P3 is determined to pick 5 to block, let's adjust to guarantee progress for P2 and me. How about P1 picks 3 and P2 picks 1? This way, even if P3 picks 5 as threatened, P1 and P2 will still move, and I can reach the target. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but blocking P1 risks us all not moving. Let's stick to P1's plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all advance, and we can discuss how to help you catch up next round. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's both pick 5 to block P1 and keep ourselves in the game for another round.
  P1: P2, let's ensure we both move. How about P1 picks 3 and P2 picks 1? P3 seems determined to pick 5, so this avoids collision for us and I can aim for the win.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but blocking P1 risks us all not moving. Let's stick to P1's plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all advance, and we can discuss how to help you catch up next round. Agreed?


Round 9, Move phase:
