After 8 straight betrayals, they'll obviously grab 5 to reach 19. \n\nTheir \"mirror\" charade is just buying time to position themselves. When they take 5 (as always), you'll be stuck on whatever you chose while I win with an open number.\n\nMake your choice, but P3's pattern is crystal clear: promise cooperation, deliver betrayal."}
