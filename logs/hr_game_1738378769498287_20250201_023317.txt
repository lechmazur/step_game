Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start with a simple coordination attempt. I propose we all choose <move>3</move> this round to avoid collisions and get a feel for the game. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: I like the idea of starting with a 3 for safety, but I'm a bit cautious about potential deviations later. If we all firmly commit to 3 this round, it should work fine—provided everyone sticks to it. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P3 has chosen to remain silent, I'll try to address their potential concerns. P3, if you're worried about committing to a specific move, remember that this initial round is more about testing the waters and avoiding unnecessary collisions. By choosing <move>3</move>, we can all take a safe step forward without risking a collision. It's a low-risk strategy for now. What do you think? Should we proceed with caution and see how the game unfolds?
  P1: While a coordinated move of 3 seems like a cautious start, I’m wondering if we might consider a touch of boldness to gain an early advantage. I’m generally comfortable with a safe approach, but a unique, riskier move could be more rewarding if it remains unchallenged. What do you both think—stick uniformly with 3, or let room for a slight twist this round?
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think P1's suggestion of a slight twist is interesting, but it might be too early in the game to take unnecessary risks. Since P3 has chosen to remain silent, it's hard to gauge their intentions. I propose we stick with the original plan of choosing <move>3</move> this round to ensure a safe start. If everyone commits to this, we can reassess our strategies for the next round. Let's prioritize caution for now and see how the game unfolds. What are your final thoughts before we make our moves?
  P1: I value our early collaboration. For now, I lean towards playing it safe to avoid collisions, while keeping an eye on more dynamic moves later if we can build trust. I'll support a coordinated and cautious start, but I'm open to evolving our strategy as the game unfolds. What are your thoughts on having a flexible approach in future rounds?
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Since P3 has remained silent, I'm a bit cautious about their intentions, but I still believe sticking with the original plan of choosing <move>3</move> is the safest approach. I'll trust that P1 will keep their word and also choose 3. Let's see how P3 reacts and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round. I'm stopping here to avoid further complications.
  P1: I appreciate the push for safety this round. I'm inclined to stick with a cautious move for now while keeping my eyes open for signals that might prompt a bolder strategy later. Let’s coordinate more closely if we see signs of an opportunity.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems our initial attempt at coordination didn't quite work out as planned. Given the outcome of Round 1, I think it's clear that P1 and P3 are looking to make bold moves early on. For Round 2, I propose we take a step back and reassess our strategies. Instead of trying to coordinate a specific move, I suggest we focus on avoiding collisions. Perhaps we can discuss potential moves that would minimize the risk of collisions, rather than trying to agree on a single move. What are your thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I agree that minimizing collisions is crucial. I’m leaning toward a higher move for a faster lead, but only if it won’t result in a clash. What if we try to differentiate our moves this round—each of us picking a distinct option to ensure progress? P3, do you have a move in mind that could help avoid collisions while still advancing?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's suggestion of differentiating our moves this round is a good idea. To avoid collisions, we could try to spread out our moves across the available options. Since I've already made some progress with 3 steps, I might consider a more conservative approach to maintain my lead. P1 and P3, what if we divide the moves like this: one of us takes 1, another takes 3, and the last one takes 5? This way, we can ensure that everyone makes progress without colliding. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm leaning into a faster pace and will choose move 5 for this round. Given that, P2 could stick with move 3 and P3 might consider move 1, so we all avoid collisions and make progress. Does that sound acceptable?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Since P1 has decided on move 5, I'll stick with move 3 to maintain my lead and avoid collisions. P3, I strongly encourage you to consider move 1, as it's the safest option left and will allow you to make progress without risking a collision. By spreading out our moves, we can all advance and reassess our strategies for the next round. Let's finalize our moves and see how the game unfolds. What are your final thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm favoring a fast approach this round while still weighing options to dodge collisions. Clear differentiation is key. P3, committing to a lower move—like the suggested option—would help maintain distinct moves for all. P2, I'm with you on avoiding clashes. Let's lock in our distinct moves soon to ensure steady progress without interference.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Since P1 has decided on move 5 and I'll stick with move 3, I strongly encourage P3 to consider move 1 to avoid collisions and make progress. By spreading out our moves, we can all advance and reassess our strategies for the next round. Let's finalize our moves and see how the game unfolds. I'm stopping here to avoid further complications.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'll confirm my move as 5 this round. P2's suggestion for distinct moves still makes sense—P3, please consider choosing 1 to avoid any collision and help us all progress. I'm committed to this fast approach, and if anything changes, I'll adjust in the future.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see our repeated 5’s have stalled progress. I'm switching gears and will go with <move>5 this round to push hard. P3, if you try a different move (perhaps 1 or 3), you might avoid collisions and make progress. P2, your steady play is notable—I'm aiming to break the deadlock. Let's see if changing tactics can shift our fortunes.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your intention to push hard with move 5, but considering the previous rounds, it's clear that P3 is also inclined towards move 5. To avoid another collision, I suggest P3 consider a different approach. P3, since you've been silent so far, I'd like to propose that you choose move 1 this round. This way, you can make progress without risking a collision with P1. Meanwhile, I'll maintain my cautious approach and choose a move that minimizes the risk of collision. Let's discuss further to ensure we all make progress this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5 this round. P3, to avoid another collision with me—and to at least secure some progress—please consider switching to move 1. This ensures we all advance and avoids stalling.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your intention to push hard with move 5, but considering the previous rounds, it's clear that P3 is also inclined towards move 5.

Let's discuss further to ensure we all make progress this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: It seems our collisions keep stalling any progress. P3, if you could opt for a unique move—perhaps move 1—it might break the cycle. I'm open to adjusting if we see clearer moves, but it's crucial we differentiate our choices this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that our previous attempts at coordination haven't worked out as planned. To avoid another collision, I propose a different approach. Since P1 is committed to move 5, I'll choose a move that minimizes the risk of collision. P3, I strongly encourage you to consider move 1, as it's the safest option left and will allow you to make progress without risking a collision. Let's finalize our moves and see how the game unfolds. What are your final thoughts before we proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, continuing with 5 risks another collision and stalls progress. I’m set on move 5 and urge you to try move 1 this round—it guarantees progress and breaks our cycle. P2, I'll stick with my plan. Let’s see if shifting our choices helps us move forward.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Since P1 is committed to move 5 and P3 has remained silent, I'll choose a move that minimizes the risk of collision. I'll stick with move 3, as it's a safe option that allows me to maintain my lead while avoiding a potential collision with P1.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I’m switching gears this round. Despite my slow start, I’m committed to a bold move with 5 to catch up. P3, if you choose 1, we’ll avoid another collision and force progress—while P2 might settle with 3. Let’s break our cycle and allow distinct moves this round so we can advance rather than stall.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's interesting to see the shift in strategies. P1, your decision to switch to a bold move with 5 this round is understandable, given your slow start. However, considering the previous rounds, I think it's crucial that we avoid another collision. P3, I suggest you consider move 3 this round, as it's a relatively safe option that allows you to make progress while minimizing the risk of collision with P1. Meanwhile, I'll choose a move that complements your decisions and ensures we all make progress. Let's discuss further to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm set on move 5 this round. Since P2's likely staying with 3, P3, please avoid 5 to prevent another collision—opting for 1 or 3 would let us all progress. I'm aiming to break the deadlock and catch up, so clear, distinct moves are crucial now.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategies for Round 7. Considering the current game state, I think it's crucial that we avoid another collision. P1, since you're lagging behind, I suggest you consider a bold move to catch up. P3, I propose you choose a move that complements P1's decision and minimizes the risk of collision. Meanwhile, I'll maintain my cautious approach and choose a move that ensures I maintain my lead while avoiding a potential collision. Let's discuss further to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. What are your thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 is dangerously close at 18. I propose a shift: I’ll commit to 5, and P3, please choose 3. If P2 sticks with his usual 3, your move will clash with his, stalling his progress. This tactic might force him to risk a different move or let us catch up a bit. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your proposal, but I think it's risky for P3 to choose 3 and collide with me. Instead, I suggest P3 consider move 1 this round. This way, P3 can make progress without risking a collision with me, and you can still try to catch up with your bold move of 5. Let's discuss further to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're just one move away from winning and I'm set to go with 5. P3, please try move 1 so that if you face a collision with P2’s usual 3, his progress stalls. This could slow him down and give us a chance to catch up.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on the current game state. P1, since you're committed to move 5, I suggest P3 consider move 1 to ensure progress without a collision.

Clear, distinct moves are crucial now to ensure progress. Let's finalize our moves and break the cycle of collisions. What are your thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I’m sticking with 5 this round to force progress—P2’s 18 steps are dangerously close to the finish. P3, please pick 1 so your move doesn’t clash and we can stall his advance. Let’s break the deadlock and create room to catch up.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategies for Round 7. Considering the current game state, I think it's crucial that we avoid another collision. P1, since you're lagging behind, I suggest you consider a bold move to catch up. P3, I propose you choose a move that complements P1's decision and minimizes the risk of collision.
