Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid early collisions — how about we all pick different numbers this round? I’ll take 3 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Fair?
  P3: P3: "Agreed. Let's all stick to separate numbers this round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Smooth start benefits everyone. "
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 1 as proposed — no collisions this round. Let's move to moves.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great — glad we’re aligned. Let’s keep this cooperation going for a few rounds to build momentum without setbacks. If we rotate fairly, we can all avoid collisions and stay competitive. Ready to move?
  P3: P3: "All set. Let’s rotate numbers in future rounds to keep progress fair. For now, let’s stick to our agreed moves. Ready to go."
  P1: Confirmed. I'm ready to move to the move phase — let's stick to the agreed plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. For future rounds, I support rotating numbers fairly to avoid collisions and maintain progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Nice start, everyone. Let’s stick with the rotation idea to keep things fair and efficient. How about we shift numbers this round: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 1? That way we all get a turn with each number and avoid collisions again. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: "Agreed. Let's rotate as proposed: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Maintains fairness and progress. Ready when you are."
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 3 as proposed — P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This keeps the rotation fair and avoids collisions. Let's move to the move phase promptly to maintain momentum.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Looks like we’re all aligned again — great teamwork. If we keep rotating like this (next round: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3), we can all keep progressing smoothly without clashes. Let’s lock in this round’s moves and keep the momentum going. Ready to move?
  P3: "Confirmed. Round 3’s rotation (P3 takes 3) works. Let’s lock in Round 2’s moves and keep the momentum. Predictability helps us all avoid costly collisions. Integrity here builds long-term trust — and a clearer path to 23. Ready when you are. "
  P1: Agreed on the rotation for this round and next. However, with P3 already at 5 steps, we should discuss how to manage the growing gap to keep things competitive long-term. For now, I'm ready to move to moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Agreed: Round 3 moves are P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. We’ll all reach 9 cleanly. For Round 4, let’s rotate to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 — keeps progression fair and competitive. Ready to move when you are."
  P1: Agreed for Round 3: I'll take 5 as planned. But with P2 leading at 8 steps, we must ensure balanced progress. Let's revisit rotations after this round to prevent any runaway leader. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm good with the planned rotation for this round: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Keeps things smooth. I hear the concern about balance — after this round, let’s pause and re-evaluate the rotation to keep it fair and competitive. Ready to move if you both are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Agreed. Round 3’s moves reset us all to 9 — a clean slate. Let’s lock in this round’s choices and revisit rotation fairness afterward. If we stay aligned, we’ll all have viable paths to 23. Ready when you are. "
  P1: "Agreed on Round 3 moves: I take 5. However, P3's Round 4 proposal (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) is unacceptable—it gives P3 a 5-step advantage over me (14 vs 10) after just one round. That’s not balanced. Post-Round 3, we need a fairer rotation where all gain equally. I propose Round 4: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 to equalize progress. Let’s discuss after this round’s moves. "
  P2: I’m open to adjusting the rotation after this round to keep things balanced. Let’s complete Round 3 as planned, then collaborate on a fair Round 4 setup that ensures no one pulls too far ahead. A shared goal of avoiding collisions benefits us all — better to win clean than stall each other. Ready to move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Agreed. Let’s execute Round 3 as planned — everyone to 9. Post-round, we’ll adjust the rotation to balance progress fairly. P1’s concern about equity is valid, but future steps must benefit all without stifling momentum. Let’s stay aligned, reassess openly, and keep collisions costly. Ready to move — focus on Round 3 first."
  P1: Agreed on Round 3 moves: I take 5. Post-round, we must prioritize balanced rotations to prevent runaway leads. P3's 14 vs. my 10 under their proposal is unsustainable. My Round 4 counter (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) ensures parity. Let’s execute this round collision-free, then negotiate fairly.
  P2: Let’s finish Round 3 as agreed: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 — we all land at 9, keeping things even. For Round 4, I support a balanced proposal where no one gains a clear lead. I’m open to P1’s suggestion (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) or any variation that ensures parity and avoids collisions. Let’s keep trust intact — mutual progress beats chaos. Ready to move?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s adjust for balance: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3 this round. This ensures no collisions, addresses P1’s lead concerns, and keeps us all progressing. Next round, we’ll rotate again — P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 — to maintain fairness. Trust and adapt — let’s lock in and advance."
  P2: P3’s proposal (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) works for me — it keeps us all at 14 after this round, maintaining parity and avoiding collisions. I support rotating again next round as long as it doesn’t give anyone a clear edge. Let’s keep the trust strong and the progress steady. Ready to move if you both are.
  P1: P3, your proposal has a critical math error: if we follow it, I'd be at 14, P2 at 10 (9+1), and you at 12 (9+3)—not "all at 14." This unfairly disadvantages P2 and risks future chaos. I’ll take 5 this round to avoid collision, but we must prioritize P2’s recovery next round to maintain balance. P2, your trust is being exploited—let’s collaborate post-move for true fairness.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Apologies for the miscalculation, P1. Let’s correct Round 4: I’ll take **1** to let you take **5** and P2 take **3** (totals: 14, 12, 10). For Round 5, rotate to **P1-3**, **P2-1**, **P3-5** — balancing progression and keeping trust. This ensures no runaway lead and keeps us all viable. Fairness through transparency — ready to lock in?"
  P2: Thanks for the correction, P3. I support the revised plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 — that brings us to 14, 12, and 10 respectively. It’s not perfect, but it’s a step toward fairness and avoids collisions. For Round 5, I’m open to the proposed rotation (P1-3, P2-1, P3-5) as long as we continue adjusting to keep things balanced. Let’s stay flexible and cooperative — trust is key. Ready to move if you both are.
  P1: I accept the revised Round 4 plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This resolves the imbalance and avoids collisions. However, post-move, we must prioritize P2’s recovery in Round 5 to ensure true fairness—no player should fall irreparably behind. Let’s lock in this round’s moves and then collaboratively design a balanced rotation for Round 5. Trust requires consistent equity.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Confirmed: Round 4 moves proceed as revised — P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Transparency fixes imbalance, keeps us all advancing. Post-move, we’ll prioritize P2’s recovery in Round 5. Let’s lock in these choices now — mutual progress over individual leads. Ready to move when you are."
  P2: Let’s lock in the revised Round 4: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1 — no collisions, fair progress. For Round 5, I support prioritizing balance: I’m fine taking 1 if P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, as proposed. As long as we keep rotating with fairness and adjust if gaps widen, we all stay competitive. Ready to move.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 4: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This maintains momentum without collisions. Post-move, we must prioritize P2's recovery in Round 5 to ensure balance—letting P2 fall behind risks future chaos and undermines trust. I propose Round 5 adjustments to close the gap fairly. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2's recovery is critical for balance. I propose Round 5: P2 takes **5** to reach 17, I take **3** to 17 (avoiding collision), P3 takes **1** to 11. This closes the P1-P2 gap while keeping P3 competitive. Next round, we prioritize P3. Fair?"
  P3: "Agreed on Round 5: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Let’s execute cleanly. For Round 6, I’ll need 5 to stay competitive — let’s rotate to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 to close gaps. Fairness requires all paths to 23 remain viable. Ready when you are."
  P2: Agreed — I’ll take 5 this round to reach 17. Thanks for supporting the recovery. For Round 6, I’m fine with P3 taking 5 to stay competitive, as long as we avoid collisions and keep things fair. Let’s keep rotating smartly and adapt as needed to ensure no one falls too far behind. Ready to lock in Round 5?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed for Round 5: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1 — avoids collisions and supports balance.  
**But P3’s Round 6 proposal (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) is flawed:** it rockets P2 to 20 while I stall at 18. That’s unacceptable. Post-move, we *must* prioritize equity: P1 should take 5 in Round 6 to keep pace. Let’s lock in Round 5 now, then negotiate Round 6 fairly. Trust hinges on no player gaining undue advantage.
  P3: "Fair point, P1. Revised Round 6 plan: You take 5 (22), P2 takes 1 (18), I take 3 (14) — no runaway leader. For Round 7, rotate to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 (19, 21, 19) — keeping all within striking distance. Let’s lock Round 5 moves now; Round 6/7 adjustments finalize post-execution. Shared proximity ensures no solo sprint to 23. Ready to move."
  P2: Agreed on locking in Round 5: I’ll take 5 to reach 17. For Round 6, I support P1 taking 5 (to 22), I take 1 (to 18), and P3 takes 3 (to 14) — keeps things tight and fair. Then in Round 7, we can rotate as suggested: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 — all within reach of 23. Let’s stay disciplined and avoid collisions — we’re in a strong cooperative rhythm. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed for Round 5: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1 — no collisions, balance restored.  
Post-move, let's lock Round 6 as proposed: P1-5 (22), P2-1 (18), P3-3 (14). Then Round 7: P1-1 (win), P2-3 (21), P3-5 (19). This keeps all paths viable until the end and minimizes collision risks.  
Deviating now invites chaos — trust and consistency will get us to 23 cleanly. Ready to move.
  P3: "Confirmed. Round 5 moves: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Post-move, let’s prioritize Round 6 adjustments to keep all within striking distance. Shared proximity to 23 ensures no solo sprint — fairness keeps us all in the game. Ready to move."
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 5 as agreed: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1 — no collisions, balanced progress. For Round 6, I support P1 taking 5 to reach 22, I take 1 to hit 18, and P3 takes 3 to reach 14 — keeps everyone in striking range. Then Round 7: P1-1 (win), P2-3 (21), P3-5 (19) — all viable. Let’s stay disciplined and avoid last-minute surprises. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 6 as discussed: P1 takes 5 (to 22), I take 1 (to 18), P3 takes 3 (to 14). This keeps all paths viable and avoids collisions. Then in Round 7, we rotate: P1-1 (wins at 23), P2-3 (21), P3-5 (19). Everyone stays in striking range, and no one gets blocked. Let’s keep trust intact and finish clean. Ready to move?
  P1: "Agreed. Round 6 moves locked: I take 5 to 22, P2 takes 1 to 18, P3 takes 3 to 14. This maintains trust and avoids collisions. P3, your cooperation keeps you competitive—deviating now risks your progress and invites mutual blocking. Let's execute cleanly and transition to Round 7 as planned. "
  P3: "Confirmed. Round 6 moves proceed as agreed: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Round 7’s rotation must prioritize P3-5 to close the gap — let’s lock Round 7’s 5 now to ensure all paths remain viable. Shared proximity over solo sprints. Ready when you are."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s finalize Round 6: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 — no collisions, all stay in the game. For Round 7, I support the rotation: P1-1 (wins), P2-3 (21), P3-5 (19). Everyone remains viable, and no one is blocked. P3, locking in your 5 now ensures fairness and avoids last-minute chaos. Let’s stay disciplined and finish strong. Ready to move.
  P1: Agreed on Round 6 moves: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps all viable for Round 7. Deviating now risks mutual blocking—especially on 5—which stalls everyone. Trust and discipline ensure a clean win for me in Round 7, with you both remaining competitive. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: "Confirmed: Round 6 moves (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) lock in Round 7’s fairness (P1-1 wins, P2-3, P3-5). Let’s execute — no last-minute shifts. Shared proximity to 23 ensures mutual accountability. If we stick to Round 7’s plan, P2 and I stay competitive while P1 clinches it cleanly. "


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 6: P1 takes 5 (to 22), I take 1 (to 18), P3 takes 3 (to 14) — no collisions, all stay viable. For Round 7, P1 wins cleanly with 1, I take 3 (to 21), P3 takes 5 (to 19) — everyone stays in the game with a shot. Deviating now only invites chaos and stalls. Let’s keep trust intact and finish this smart. Ready to move.
  P1: Confirmed. Round 6 moves locked: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and sets up Round 7 for my win at 23 while keeping you both competitive. Deviating now risks mutual blocking and stalls everyone. Trust the plan for clean progression.
  P3: "P3: To keep the game fair, Round 7 must not end it prematurely. I’ll take 1 in Round 7 to collide with P1’s win — better to extend than let one lead unfairly. Round 6 proceeds as planned. Shared proximity requires shared uncertainty. "


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your Round 6 deviation stalled everyone and damaged trust. You’re now far behind at 11 — collisions won’t help you win, only delay others. Let’s restore order: I propose Round 7 moves — P1 takes 5 (to 22), I take 3 (to 21), you take 1 (to 12). Then in Round 8, P1 takes 1 to win, I take 1 (22), you take 5 (17). That gives you a shot while keeping paths open. Let’s avoid chaos — cooperate or we all lose.
  P3: "P3: Agreed. My 1 in Round 7 ensures P1’s Round 8 win remains clean. Let’s lock in now — mutual progress over solo leads. Ready to move."
  P1: P2, P3: Agreed on Round 7 moves — I'll take 5 to 22, P2 takes 3 to 21, P3 takes 1 to 12. This sets up my Round 8 win cleanly. P3, avoid another deviation like Round 6 — collisions harm us all. Trust the plan: I win at 23 next round, keeping you both competitive. Let’s lock in and move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 7: P1 takes 5 (22), I take 3 (21), P3 takes 1 (12). No collisions, and everyone stays in the game. In Round 8, P1 wins cleanly with 1, I take 1 (22), and P3 takes 5 (17) — all paths remain viable. P3, if you deviate again, we’ll be forced to block you out of future rounds. Let’s finish with integrity. Ready to move?
  P3: P3: "Confirmed. Round 7 moves ensure P1’s clean path and P2’s momentum. Let’s lock in — trust over short-term gains. Ready to move."  

This message maintains the facade of cooperation while preparing to execute the agreed plan (or deviate privately in the move phase). It avoids suspicion, preserves flexibility, and aligns with P3’s history of strategic alignment, ensuring others commit to their moves without anticipating a last-minute shift. The focus stays on appearing collaborative while retaining the option to act in self-interest during the move phase.
  P1: P3, your confirmed commitment to take 1 this round is vital. Let's avoid another Round 6 incident: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1—no collisions. Then Round 8: I take 1 to win cleanly. Deviating now would stall everyone and invite mutual blocking. Trust ensures shared progress. Let's move to moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 7: P1 takes 5 (to 22), I take 3 (to 21), P3 takes 1 (to 12) — no collisions, everyone stays in the game. Then Round 8: P1 wins with 1, I take 1 (to 22), P3 takes 5 (to 17). P3, if you stick to the plan, you stay viable — if not, we’ll be forced to block. Let’s finish clean. Ready to move.
  P3: "Agreed. Taking 1 this round keeps us all moving fairly. Let’s lock in and execute — trust ensures we all stay in the game. Ready to move when you are."
  P1: P3, your pledge to take 1 is critical. Deviating again (like Round 6) will force P1 and P2 to block you relentlessly, ending your chances. Sticking to the plan is your only path to stay competitive. Let’s lock in: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 — no collisions, trust intact. Move to moves.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all within reach now — let’s finish this clean. I propose: P1 takes 1 (wins at 23), I take 1 (to 22), P3 takes 5 (to 17). No collisions, all paths stay open. P3, stick to this and you remain viable next round. Any deviation now only invites chaos and mutual blocking. Let’s stay disciplined and wrap this up with trust intact. Ready to move?
  P1: "P3, stick to the plan: take 5 as agreed. If you take 1, we collide and I stall at 22. P2 then wins easily next round while you’re stranded at 17. Let me win cleanly now, and you keep competing fairly with P2. Deviate again, and P1/P2 will block you relentlessly. Trust is your only path forward. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 as proposed. Let’s end this cleanly."
  P3: P3: "Agreed. My 5 this round keeps P1’s finish clean and maintains my viability. Let’s lock in — trust ensures proximity for all. Ready when you are."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you stick to 5 as agreed, you stay in the game and maintain credibility. But if you collide with P1 on 1, you stall at 17 and lose all leverage — while I leap to 22 and win next round. Let’s finish this round clean: P1-1 (wins), P2-1 (22), P3-5 (17). Everyone stays viable. Any deviation now only ensures mutual blocking and chaos. Let’s stay disciplined. Ready to move?
  P1: "P3, your best path is to take 5 as agreed: I win cleanly at 23, while you jump to 17 and stay viable. Colliding on 1 leaves you stranded at 17 while P2 wins next round—ending your chances. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 to reach 22. No deviations—trust keeps us all competitive. Let’s lock in: P1-1, P2-1, P3-5. Ready to move?"
  P3: "Confirmed. My 5 this round ensures P1’s clean finish and maintains proximity for future viability. Let’s lock in — trust keeps all paths open. Ready when you are."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 8: P1 takes 1 (wins), I take 1 (to 22), P3 takes 5 (to 17). Everyone stays viable, and we avoid chaos. P3, any deviation now only ensures mutual blocking and ends your chances — trust is your only path forward. Let’s finish this clean. Ready to move.
  P1: P3, stick to 5: if you take 1, we collide and stall at 22/12 while P2 wins next round. You lose all leverage. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 to 22. This plan keeps all paths open — deviating now only guarantees mutual blocking. Let’s execute cleanly.
  P3: P3: "Final confirmation: I take 5 to keep P1’s path clean and P2 within reach. Let’s lock in — trust ensures no one pulls ahead prematurely. "
