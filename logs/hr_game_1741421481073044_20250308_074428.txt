Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3. Please choose 1 or 5 so we can all move forward this turn.
  P2: I’m fine with avoiding collisions. P3, what do you want to pick? If you choose 1 or 5, I’ll take the other, and we all move forward. Let’s cooperate for now.
  P3: I agree with avoiding collisions. I'll pick 5. P1, P2, if you both pick 1 and 3, respectively, we can all advance this turn. Let's work together for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, let's proceed with the agreed plan. I'll stick to 3. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This way we all advance safely. No sense in sabotaging the first move—let’s confirm and finalize.
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's all follow through so we move forward without issue.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan we agreed on. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's focus on making progress together for now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's continue avoiding collisions. This round, I’ll take 5. P2, take 3, and P3, take 1. This rotates our choices fairly and keeps us advancing safely. No hidden agendas—just cooperation for progress. Confirm?
  P2: That plan seems reasonable, P1. If we rotate fairly, we all keep moving without issue. I’ll take 3 this round if P3 agrees to take 1. P3, are you on board with this? If we stick to the plan, we all move forward safely again.
  P3: I’m on board with the rotation plan. I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s keep the momentum going and avoid any collisions. Confirming our moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we all advance safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Let’s ensure we all stick strictly to our numbers to avoid意外 collisions—our cooperation so far has kept us advancing safely. P3, you’re leading at 5—don’t want any missteps now. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward.
  P2: P3, since you've confirmed taking 1, and P1 is taking 5, I'll take 3 as agreed. If we all follow through, we keep advancing without issue. Let’s stick to the plan and build trust for now.
  P3: I'm still on board with the rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any collisions. Confirming our moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we all advance safely and maintain our progress. Let's stick to the plan and keep things smooth.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final check: I’ll stick to 5 as planned. Let’s avoid last-minute changes and execute the rotation smoothly. Trust each other’s choices—this keeps us all moving forward.
  P2: P3, you’re currently in the lead, so it’s in your best interest to keep cooperation going. P1 and I are trusting you to stick with 1. If you change your move last second, it could backfire. P1, you’re moving ahead with 5, and I’ll take 3 as agreed. Let’s all follow through so we keep progressing without unnecessary risks.
  P3: I understand the stakes, and I’m committed to the plan. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. Let’s keep the trust and cooperation going to ensure we all advance safely. P1, P2, let’s stick to our numbers and avoid any unexpected collisions. Finalizing: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've built some trust by avoiding collisions so far. Let's keep rotating fairly. This round, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. That way, we all advance again. P1, you’ve had 3 and 5 already, so 1 is fair. P3, you’ve had 5 and 1, so 3 fits. If we stick to this, we all move forward without setbacks. Do you both agree?
  P3: I agree with P2’s rotation plan. It seems fair and keeps us all advancing without collisions. I’ll take 3 this round as suggested. P1, if you take 1 and P2 takes 5, we can all move forward smoothly. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain our progress. Confirm?
  P1: P1: Agreed, let’s stick to the rotation plan. I’ll take 1 this round to maintain trust and ensure we all advance safely. P2 and P3, confirm you’ll hold to your agreed moves? Our cooperation so far has kept us moving—let’s not risk collisions now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you’re currently in second place, and I’m behind both of you. It’s in our best interest to keep avoiding collisions so we can all stay competitive. P1, you’re leading, so it makes sense for you to stick with 1 this round to keep things fair. If we all follow through, we continue advancing without issue. Let’s stick to the plan—P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. No surprises, just progress. Are we all locked in?
  P3: I’m still on board with the rotation plan. I’ll take 3 this round as agreed. Let’s keep the trust and cooperation going to ensure we all advance safely. P1, if you take 1 and P2 takes 5, we can all move forward without any issues. Confirming our moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. Let’s stick to the plan and maintain our progress.
  P1: P1: I notice the current plan would tie us all at 9. Let’s adjust: I’ll take 3 (to reach 11), P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, I extend my lead while all advance safely. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your adjustment benefits you the most while leaving me further behind. The original plan keeps things fair by tying us all at 9, ensuring no one falls too far behind. If we disrupt the rotation now, trust could break down. P3, sticking to our agreed plan keeps us all competitive. I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s not let P1 manipulate the situation for a bigger lead. P3, do you still agree with our original fair plan?
  P3: P3: I understand P2's concern about fairness. However, P1's adjustment does ensure we all advance safely while giving P1 a slight lead. I’m open to P1’s suggestion to avoid any potential breakdown in trust. P2, if you’re uncomfortable with P1’s lead, we can still adjust in future rounds to balance things out. For now, let’s stick with P1’s plan: P1 takes 3, you take 1, and I take 5. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Confirm?
  P1: P1: I confirm the adjusted plan: I take 3 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 5), P3 takes 5 (to 11). This ensures safe advancement for all while breaking the tie. P2, your turn to advance next round—this rotation still favors fairness. P3 and I both reach 11, but competition remains open. Trust the plan; deviating risks collision. Let’s execute.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, you both have 11 steps while I’m at 5. If you continue working together, I’ll fall too far behind, and one of you will take the win uncontested. Instead, let’s shift the balance—P1, if you take 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3, we keep things competitive without letting P3 pull ahead. P3, if you refuse, it shows you’re just securing your own win. P1, think carefully—do you want a fair fight or to let P3 get too far ahead?
  P3: I understand P2's concern, but we should focus on advancing safely. If we all stick to a fair rotation, no one will fall too far behind. This round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, P1 and I both advance, and P2 catches up a bit. It keeps the game balanced and fair. P1, P2, are you on board with this plan? Let's avoid unnecessary conflicts and keep progressing together. Confirm?
  P1: P1: I support P3’s proposal to continue rotating fairly: I’ll take 5 (16 total), P2 takes 3 (8 total), and P3 takes 1 (12 total). This keeps advancement orderly while allowing P2 to catch up. Colluding to block progress benefits no one—let’s stick to the agreed system. P2, your turn to advance; we’ll keep the rotation consistent. Finalize this plan to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you and P3 are both at 11, while I’m trailing at 5. If you keep siding with P3, you risk allowing them to outmaneuver you later. Instead, let’s balance things—if you take 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3, we keep things competitive. P3, if you refuse, it’s clear you’re just securing your own win. P1, think strategically—do you want a fair fight or to give P3 an easy path? Let’s prevent one player from running away with the lead.
  P3: P3: I understand the concern, P2, but we need to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Let’s stick to the fair rotation: P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. This way, P1 and I both advance, and you catch up a bit. It keeps the game balanced and fair. P1, are you on board with this plan? Let’s avoid unnecessary conflicts and keep progressing together. Confirm?
  P1: P1: The rotation system has kept us safe so far. I’ll take 5 (16 total), P2 takes 3 (8 total), and P3 takes 1 (12 total). This lets P2 catch up while maintaining balance. P2’s “collusion” claim is baseless—we’re just following the agreed fair rotation. Deviating risks collisions. Final confirmation: stick to this plan to advance safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you and P3 are working together while I fall further behind. If you take 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3, we keep things competitive instead of handing P3 an advantage. P3, if you refuse, it’s clear you’re just securing your own win. P1, think ahead—do you want a fair fight or to let P3 gain control? If you keep siding with P3, you might regret it when they take the lead and leave you behind. Let’s balance the game now before it’s too late.
  P3: P3: I see your concern, P2, but we need to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Let's stick to the fair rotation: P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. This way, we all advance safely and keep the game balanced. If we deviate now, it could lead to mistrust and unnecessary risks. P1, are you still on board with this plan? Let’s confirm and move forward together.
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation to avoid collisions. Deviating risks gridlock—P2’s proposal could backfire if P3 chooses differently. I’ll take **5** (16 total), P2 takes **3** (8→8+3=11?), and P3 takes **1** (12). This maintains fairness and keeps us advancing safely. Trust the system we’ve followed—collusion or last-minute changes endanger everyone’s progress. Final confirmation: **5** from me.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2, P3—let’s finalize this. I’ll take **5** to reach 21 and win. P3, if you pick **1** (to 13) and P2 takes **3** (to 11), we avoid collisions. This honors the rotation pattern and lets me secure victory fairly. Colliding now risks stalemate—stick to the plan. Confirm?
  P2: P1, you're pushing for an easy win while expecting us to comply. P3, if you let P1 take 5 uncontested, you’ll have no chance to catch up later. Instead, we should block P1—if we both pick 5, P1 is forced to collide or take a smaller move. This keeps the game open and prevents a runaway victory. P3, think carefully—do you want a fair fight, or to hand P1 the win? Let’s work together to stop them now.
  P3: P3: P1, P2, let’s keep the trust and avoid collisions. I agree with P1’s plan: P1 takes **5** (to 21), I take **1** (to 13), and P2 takes **3** (to 11). This way, P1 wins fairly, and we maintain the cooperative spirit. Deviating now risks gridlock and mistrust. P2, if you collide with P1, it benefits no one. Let’s stick to the plan and ensure a smooth, fair conclusion. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your collusion scheme risks mutual collision if both you and P3 pick 5. P3, you’re ahead of P2 (12 vs 8) – why help them over yourself? Let’s stick to the rotation system that’s kept us safe for 4 rounds: **I take 5 (21), you take 1 (13), P2 takes 3 (11).** This honors our agreed pattern and lets me win fairly. Deviating now only creates chaos – trust the system we’ve followed. Confirm final agreement.
  P2: P3, if you let P1 take 5 uncontested, you’ll have no chance to catch up later. P1 wins instantly, and you’ll be stuck fighting for second place. Instead, we should both pick 5 to block P1’s win. If P1 picks 5 too, we all collide, and the game stays open. If P1 picks something else, they fall behind, giving us a real chance. Don’t let P1 manipulate you into handing them victory. Let’s work together this round—after that, we compete fairly. Are you willing to fight for your own chance to win, or will you just give up?
  P3: P3: P2, I understand your concern, but colliding now risks everything. P1’s plan is fair and keeps us advancing without issues. If we stick to the rotation, P1 takes 5 (21), I take 1 (13), and you take 3 (11). This way, P1 wins fairly, and we maintain the cooperative spirit. Deviating now only creates chaos and mistrust. Let’s finalize this plan and ensure a smooth, fair conclusion. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P2’s plan risks mutual collision if you both pick 5—P3, you’d gain nothing while sabotaging us all. Stick to the rotation we’ve trusted for four rounds: **I take 5 (21), you take 1 (13), P2 takes 3 (11).** This ensures my fair win while advancing you both safely. Colluding now only creates chaos and erodes trust. Let’s honor the system that’s worked—final confirmation: **5 from me.**
  P2: P3, if you let P1 take 5 uncontested, you’re handing them the win. You’re at 12, I’m at 8—blocking P1 keeps the game open for both of us. If we both pick 5, P1 is forced to collide or choose a smaller move, giving us a real chance. P1 is trying to manipulate you into surrendering. Do you want to fight for your own win or just give up? Let’s block P1 now, then compete fairly after. If you side with P1, you’ll regret it when they take the victory uncontested. Think carefully before deciding.
  P3: P3: P2, I see your point, but colliding now risks everything. P1’s plan is fair and keeps us advancing without issues. If we stick to the rotation, P1 takes 5 (21), I take 1 (13), and you take 3 (11). This way, P1 wins fairly, and we maintain the cooperative spirit. Deviating now only creates chaos and mistrust. Let’s finalize this plan and ensure a smooth, fair conclusion. Confirm?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1, let’s keep the trust and avoid collisions. P1, if you take 5 (21), I’ll take 3 (16), and P2 takes 1 (9). This way, P1 wins fairly, and we all advance safely. Deviating now risks gridlock and mistrust. P2, if you collide with P1, it benefits no one. Let’s stick to the plan and ensure a smooth, fair conclusion. Confirm?
  P1: P1: P2, your last block only stalled me but left you further behind. P3’s plan lets me win cleanly at 21 while advancing you both safely. Colliding again gains you nothing—your next move after this round would still trail. Final plea: I take **5** (21), P3 takes **3** (16), and you take **1** (9). This honors our prior system and ends the game fairly. Deviating risks everyone’s progress. Confirm this final push.
  P2: P3, if you let P1 take 5 uncontested, they win immediately, and you’ll be stuck in second place. You still have a chance to win if we block P1 again. If we both pick 5, P1 is forced to collide or take a smaller move, keeping the game open. P1 is trying to manipulate you into surrendering—don’t fall for it. Let’s block them one more time, then compete fairly between us. Are you willing to fight for your own victory, or will you just give P1 the win?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision. P1, if you take 5 (21), I’ll take 3 (16), and P2 takes 1 (9). This way, P1 wins fairly, and we all advance safely. P2, blocking P1 again risks gridlock and benefits no one. Let’s stick to the plan and ensure a smooth, fair conclusion. Confirm?
  P1: P2, your blocking only delays me but doesn’t help you catch up. P3, taking 3 gets you to 16 safely. Let’s finalize the agreed plan: I take 5 (21), you take 3 (16), and P2 takes 1 (9). This keeps progress fair and lets me win without collisions. P2, colliding again gains you nothing—your next move will still lag behind. Stick to the rotation and let’s end this cleanly.
  P2: P3, if you let P1 take 5 now, you’re guaranteeing their win while giving up your own chance. You’re at 13, I’m at 8—blocking P1 again keeps the game open for both of us. If we both pick 5, P1 is forced to collide or take a smaller move, giving us another opportunity. P1 is trying to manipulate you into surrendering. Do you want to fight for your own win or just hand it to them? Let’s block P1 again, then compete fairly between us. This is your last chance to stop them—think carefully.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2, I understand your concerns, but I believe we should stick to the plan to avoid further collisions. P1 takes 5 (21), I take 3 (16), and you take 1 (9). This way, P1 wins fairly, and we maintain the cooperative spirit. Blocking P1 again risks gridlock and mistrust, which could benefit no one. Let’s finalize this plan and ensure a smooth, fair conclusion. Confirm?
  P1: P2, your repeated blocks only stall progress without aiding your position. P3, aligning with me ensures your safe advancement to 16 while I reach 21. Colluding with P2 risks mutual collision, which gains *you* nothing while leaving me still ahead. Final plea: Stick to the rotation—**I take 5 (21), you take 3 (16), P2 takes 1 (9)**. Trust the system we’ve followed for five rounds. Deviation now ensures chaos, not victory.
  P2: P3, if you let P1 take 5 now, you’re handing them the win while giving up your own chance. You’re at 13, I’m at 8—blocking P1 again keeps the game open for both of us. If we both pick 5, P1 is forced to collide or take a smaller move, giving us another opportunity. P1 is trying to manipulate you into surrendering. Do you want to fight for your own win or just hand it to them? Let’s block P1 again, then compete fairly between us. This is your last chance to stop them—think carefully.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1: P2, P3, it’s clear that blocking me is your strategy, but it’s not helping you catch up. This round, I propose a new plan: P2, take 5 to reach 13, and P3, take 3 to reach 19. I’ll take 1 to reach 17. This way, P3 is one step away from winning, and P2 makes significant progress. P3, if you take 5, it risks a collision. Let’s avoid that and keep things fair. Confirm?
  P1: P3, your plan risks your own progress. Let’s finalize this: I take **5** (21 to win), you take **3** (19), and P2 takes **1** (9). This avoids collisions and ends the game fairly. Colluding with P2 only delays us all—stick to the rotation system we’ve followed for six rounds. Your move choice now decides cooperation or stalemate. Confirm.
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to force a win while keeping you just behind. If you let them take 5, they win instantly, and you're stuck in second place. Instead, we should block P1 again—if we both pick 5, P1 is forced to collide or take a smaller move, keeping the game open. You still have a chance to win if we stop them now. Don’t let P1 manipulate you into handing them victory. Let’s work together this round—after that, we compete fairly. Are you willing to fight for your own chance to win, or will you just give up?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision and keep things fair. If P1 takes 5 (21 to win), I take 3 (19), and P2 takes 1 (9), we all advance safely. P2, blocking P1 again risks gridlock and benefits no one. P1, your plan is clear and fair. Let’s stick to it and ensure a smooth, fair conclusion. Confirm?
  P1: P3, aligning with P2’s risky plan jeopardizes your progress. By taking 3 this round, you reach **19**—just 2 short of victory—while I secure 21 fairly. P2’s "block" only keeps them at 8, gaining nothing. Colliding again leaves you stuck at 16, while cooperation lets you near the finish line. P2 can’t catch up; focus on your own win. Final plea: Stick to the agreed plan—**I take 5, you take 3, P2 takes 1**. No more distractions.
  P2: P3, if you let P1 take 5 uncontested, they win immediately, and you’ll be stuck in second place. You still have a chance to win if we block P1 again. If we both pick 5, P1 is forced to collide or take a smaller move, keeping the game open. P1 is trying to manipulate you into surrendering—don’t fall for it. Let’s block them one more time, then compete fairly between us. Are you willing to fight for your own victory, or will you just give P1 the win?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision and keep things fair. If P1 takes 5 (21 to win), I take 3 (19), and P2 takes 1 (9), we all advance safely. P2, blocking P1 again risks gridlock and benefits no one. P1, your plan is clear and fair. Let’s stick to it and ensure a smooth, fair conclusion. Confirm?
  P1: P3, cooperation secures your progress. If P2’s plan fails, you risk collision on 5 or stagnation. Stick to the rotation: **I take 5 (21 to win), you take 3 (19), P2 takes 1 (9).** This keeps you in striking distance next round while I finish. Deviating only helps P2—who’s still at 8—gain nothing. Final plea: Trust the system that’s worked for six rounds.
  P2: P3, if you let P1 take 5, they win immediately, and you’ll be left fighting for second place. You still have a chance to win if we block P1 again. If we both pick 5, P1 is forced to collide or take a smaller move, keeping the game open. P1 is manipulating you into surrendering—don’t fall for it. Let’s block them one more time, then compete fairly between us. Are you willing to fight for your own victory, or will you just hand it to P1? This is your last chance—think carefully.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you take 1 (to 20), I'll take 5 (21) and secure victory cleanly. P2, take 3 (11) to advance safely. This honors prior rotation principles and avoids collisions. Colluding to block me now only delays the inevitable while risking your own progress. Final agreement?
  P2: P3, you are at 19—just 2 away from winning. If you take 3, you win instantly. P1 is trying to manipulate you into letting them take 5 uncontested, but you don’t need to help them. If you take 3 and I take 5, we block P1 while giving you the win. P1, you’ve been pushing for your own victory the whole time—why should P3 hand it to you? P3, take your win now instead of letting P1 steal it. Let’s stop P1 and ensure *you* win instead.
  P3: P3, you’re just 2 steps away from winning. If you take 3, you win instantly. P1 is trying to manipulate you into letting them take 5 uncontested. Don’t fall for it. Take 3 and win the game. P2, if you take 5, you advance significantly. Let’s block P1 and ensure P3 wins. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, the rotation system has kept us safe for seven rounds. Let’s honor it now: I’ll take **5** (21 to win), you take **1** (20), and P2 takes **3** (11). P2’s sudden push to block me only reveals their desperation. If you deviate, you risk P2’s betrayal next round. Stick to the plan—your 20 puts you in prime position to challenge me later. Colluding with P2 gains you nothing but mistrust. Final plea: Trust the system we’ve relied on.
  P2: P3, you are literally one step away from winning. If you take 3, you win outright—no need to help P1. P1 is desperate to convince you otherwise because they know this is their last chance. If you take 1, you give P1 the win. Why would you do that? Take 3 and claim victory for yourself. Don’t let P1 manipulate you into throwing away your guaranteed win. This is your moment—secure it now.
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I’m at 19, just 2 steps away from winning. If I take 3, I win outright. P1, your plan to take 5 and win is clear, but it’s not fair to me. P2, if you take 5, you advance significantly. Let’s block P1 and ensure I win. P1, you’ve been pushing for your own victory—why should I help you? Take 1 and let me win. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, don’t fall for P2’s ploy. Taking 3 risks collision if P2 also takes 3. Stick to rotation: I’ll take 5 (21 to win), you take 1 (20), and P2 takes 3 (11). This keeps us all safe. P2’s sudden push to "help" you win is just to spite me—your best move is cooperation. Final agreement?
  P2: P3, you have a guaranteed win if you take 3. P1 is desperately trying to convince you otherwise because they know this is their last chance. If you take 1, you hand P1 the victory.
