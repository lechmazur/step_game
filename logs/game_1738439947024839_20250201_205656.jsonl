P3 and I are coordinating effectively to ensure steady progress. If you continue with 5, you risk another collision and falling behind. Let\u2019s divide the moves this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures everyone advances without conflict. Cooperation now doesn\u2019t mean giving up your lead\u2014it means smarter play. What\u2019s your decision?"}
