Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s aim for 5 each. If we all move boldly, we’ll reach 20 faster. No need to collide—cooperation benefits all!"
  P3: "Let's not be too hasty with our moves. P1 is suggesting we all go for 5, but if we all do that, none of us will advance. I think it's better to differentiate our moves to ensure at least one of us gets ahead. How about we consider different numbers to avoid collision?"
  P2: P2: "P3 is right. If we all pick 5, we’ll block each other. Let’s coordinate: I’ll take 3 this round. P1, take 1, and P3, take 5. We’ll all advance without collision. Let’s start with this."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan leaves me behind. P3, let’s take 5 to outpace you. I’ll advance while you collide.
  P3: P1 is trying to provoke me into a collision. I'm not going to fall for it. P2 has suggested a reasonable coordination plan. I'll stick with it for now. Let's see if P1 follows. To avoid collision, I will consider P2's suggestion. My next action depends on P1's response to P2's coordination plan. P1, are you going to cooperate with P2's plan or stick to your initial idea?
  P2: P2: "P1, if you take 1 and P3 takes 5, we all advance. Trying to force a collision only benefits me—since I’m choosing 3 either way. Let’s lock in this plan. P3, confirm you’ll take 5. P1, stop bluffing and secure your 1. First round’s progress is better than chaos."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, take 3. I'll take 5. P2's 3 will collide with you. I'll advance. Let's do this!
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate us into a collision. I'm sticking with P2's coordination plan for now. If P1 takes 5 and I take 3, I'll collide with P2 who is taking 3. So, I'll take 1 or 5. To avoid collision with P1, I will take 1. P2, confirm you'll stick to 3. P1, you're being too aggressive; reconsider taking 1 as per the original coordination plan. Let's avoid a collision and make progress.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 3. P3, your 1 avoids collision. P1, take 5 and advance—no reason to fight. Let’s move."


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's analyze the situation: P1 is ahead with 5 steps. To catch up, we need to avoid collision and make strategic moves. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, P1 will advance slightly, and P2 and I will avoid collision with each other. P1, consider taking 1 to slow down; it benefits you to maintain the lead while not advancing too much. P2, are you okay with taking 5?
  P1: "Stick with 5—P2, take 3 to avoid collision. P3, your 1 is safe. Let’s advance without chaos. No need for tricky plans."
  P2: P2: "P3's plan makes sense. P1, take 1 to maintain your lead safely. I’ll take 5 to close the gap, and P3 takes 3. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s lock it in."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is trying to maintain the lead by suggesting a simple plan. However, if P1 takes 5 again, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, it results in P1 advancing significantly. To balance, I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 still advances but not too much, and P2 and I avoid collision. P2, are you okay with taking 1 this time? Let's coordinate to maintain a competitive balance.
  P1: "Stick with my plan: I take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions, sure progress. Let’s move forward."
  P2: P2: "I’ll take 5 this round. P1, if you stick with 5, we collide and waste progress—take 1 instead to secure your lead safely. P3, take 3 to complete the sequence. If P1 refuses, they’ll only slow themselves down. Let’s finalize this plan."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is still being aggressive. To avoid collision and maintain progress, I suggest a slight deviation: P1 takes 1 to maintain the lead safely, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, P1 remains safe, and P2 and I avoid collision. P2, are you okay with taking 3? P1, taking 1 will secure your lead without risking collision. Let's finalize this plan to ensure smooth progress.
  P1: "Stick to the plan: I take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions, sure progress. Let’s move forward."
  P2: "Final offer: I take 5 this round. P1, take 1 to stay ahead—P3 takes 3. If you force 5 again, we collide and lose progress. P3, confirm your 3 to lock this in. No more sub-rounds—let’s finalize."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s go 5, 1, 3. P2 take 1, P3 take 3. No collisions, sure progress. Let’s move."
  P2: "Reject P1’s 5-step plan—it hands them a massive lead. I’ll take 3. P3, block P1 by choosing 5. If you pick 5, P1’s 5 collides with you, letting me advance. P1, if you insist on 5, you’ll waste steps. Let’s finalize this: 3 from me, 5 from P3, and you’re forced to reconsider."
  P3: "P2 is trying to manipulate the situation by suggesting I take 5 to collide with P1. However, if P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, P1 advances while we avoid collision. I propose this alternative: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, P1 maintains the lead safely, and P2 and I avoid collision. P1, consider taking 1. P2, are you okay with sticking to 3?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Stick to 5, 1, 3. P2 take 1, P3 take 3. No collisions, sure progress. Let’s move."
  P2: "Final warning: If P3 takes 5 this round, P1’s 5 collides with them, letting me advance with 3. P3, sacrificing your move here blocks P1’s momentum. Don’t let P1 run away with the game. Confirm your 5, and I’ll secure my 3. P1’s 11-step lead starts now if you refuse."
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate me into colliding with P1. However, I can advance by taking a different number. I propose: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This avoids collision and lets P1 advance while I make some progress. P1, if you insist on 5, I will take 1. P2, confirm your 3. This way, we maintain progress without collision. Let's finalize this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Let’s lock in: I take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3. No collisions, sure progress. Finalize this plan—no risks, everyone advances."
  P2: "Final commitment: I take 3. P3, take 5 to collide with P1’s inevitable 5. Block their lead now or lose control next round. Confirm your 5—no more sub-rounds. P1’s 11-step lead starts *only* if you refuse."
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate me into colliding with P1. However, I can see that P1 is determined to take 5. To avoid collision and make progress, I will take 3 this round. P1, if you take 5, you'll advance. P2, if you take 1, you'll also advance without collision. Let's avoid a collision and make some progress. I'm finalizing my move to 3. P1, P2, please confirm your moves accordingly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s lock in: 5 for me, 1 for P2, 3 for P3. No collisions, sure progress. Finalize now."
  P2: "Reject P1’s plan—it hands them an 11-step lead. I’ll take 3. P3, take 5 to collide with P1’s inevitable 5. Block their momentum and let me advance. Final choice: confirm your 5, and we halt P1’s runaway victory."
  P3: "P2 is trying to manipulate me into colliding with P1 again. However, I can make a strategic move. If P1 takes 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. P2, taking 3 is a safe bet for you. Let's avoid collision and make progress. I suggest P1 takes 1 to slow down, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 or vice versa. This way, we maintain a competitive balance. P1, consider slowing down to 1 or 3. Let's finalize a plan that works for all."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Final offer: 5 for me, 1 for P2, 3 for P3. No collisions, sure progress. Let’s move—no more delays."
  P2: "Final warning: If P3 refuses to take 5, P1 advances to 11 with their 5, leaving us both stranded. I’ll take 3—P3, your only move is 5 to collide with P1. Block their lead now or concede the game. No more rounds—confirm your 5 or lose control."
  P3: "P2 is again trying to manipulate me into colliding with P1. However, I can make a strategic move. I'll take 1 if P1 takes 5, ensuring progress without collision. P2, taking 3 is a safe choice. I suggest P1 slows down to 1 or 3. Let's coordinate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This maintains balance and avoids collision. P1, consider adjusting your move. P2, confirm if you're okay with taking 1."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Let’s advance safely: I take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3. No collisions—P2, don’t let P3 block me. Finalize this plan for sure progress."
  P2: P2: "Final commitment: I take 3. P3, your choice—take 5 to collide with P1’s 5 and stop their lead, or take 1 and let them sprint ahead. Decide now. No more delays—this ends today."
  P3: "P2 is trying to manipulate me into colliding with P1 again. I'll take 1 if P1 takes 5. P2, you can take 3. Alternatively, let's coordinate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This maintains balance and avoids collision. P1, consider adjusting your move to 3. P2, are you okay with taking 1? Let's finalize a plan that works for all and makes progress."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s avoid collision: I take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3. No risks, everyone advances. Finalize this plan."
  P3: To avoid collision and maintain progress, I suggest a different plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 still advances, and P2 and I avoid collision. P1, taking 3 will still keep you ahead. P2, are you okay with taking 1? This plan balances our moves and ensures everyone makes progress. Let's coordinate to achieve this.
  P2: "Reject P3's slowdown plan. I'll take 3 this round. P1, maintain your lead with 5, P3 take 1 to ensure unique moves and advancement. Finalize now—no collisions, guaranteed progress for all."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Stick to 5, 3, 1. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. Let’s move."
  P3: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I propose a slight adjustment to the previous plans: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains a competitive balance and allows everyone to advance. P1, taking 1 will still keep you ahead while slowing down your progress slightly. P2, are you okay with taking 3? This way, we avoid collision and make progress. Let's finalize this plan to ensure smooth advancement for all.
  P2: "Finalizing my move: I’ll take 3 this round. P1, if you stick with 5, you’ll advance, but P3 can take 1 to ensure progress without collision. Let’s lock this in—no overlaps, everyone gains ground. Confirm your choices."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Stick to 5, 3, 1. P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions, sure progress. Let’s finalize this plan and keep moving forward."
  P3: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This maintains a competitive balance and allows everyone to advance. P1, taking 1 will still keep you ahead while slowing down your progress slightly. P2, you've mentioned taking 3; confirm this. Let's finalize this plan for smooth progress. If P1 insists on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's coordinate to make progress without overlaps.
  P2: P2: "Finalizing my move: I’ll take 3 this round. P1, stick with 5, and P3 take 1—no overlaps, everyone gains ground. Confirm now. If P3 insists on 5, P1’s lead collapses, but I still advance. Either way, I secure progress. Lock this in."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s coordinate: I’ll take 5 this round. P1, take 1 to stay safe, and P3 take 3. Everyone advances uniquely, and I close the gap. Lock this in—no collisions, guaranteed progress for all."
  P3: To avoid collision and make progress, I suggest a coordinated plan. Since P1 and I are tied, we should consider moves that allow both of us to advance or slow down strategically. I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 still advances, and P2 and I avoid collision. P2, are you okay with taking 1? P1, consider adjusting your move to 3 to maintain a competitive balance. Let's finalize a plan that works for all.
  P1: "Let’s go 5, 3, 1. P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions, sure progress. Finalize this plan—P2, secure your 3, P3, avoid collision with 1. I’ll advance to 11."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Finalizing my move: I’ll take 3 this round. P1, your 5 advances you to 11. P3, take 1 to ensure you also move forward. Lock this in—no overlaps, three steps closer for all."
  P3: To break the tie between P1 and me, I suggest a different strategy. Since P2 is behind, we should consider a move that lets them catch up. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, P2 gets a chance to close the gap, and P1 and I avoid collision. P2, are you okay with taking 5? P1, taking 1 will maintain your lead while giving P2 an opportunity to advance. Let's coordinate to make progress without collision.
  P1: "Let’s go 5, 3, 1. P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions, sure progress. Lock in this plan for everyone to advance."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Finalize plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, sure progress. Confirm to move forward."
  P3: Since P1 and I are tied, I suggest we create an opportunity for P2 to catch up. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows P2 to close the gap while P1 and I avoid collision. P2, are you okay with taking 5? P1, taking 1 maintains your lead while giving P2 a chance to advance. Let's coordinate for smooth progress.
  P1: "Stick with 5, 3, 1. P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions, sure progress. Finalize this plan—P2, secure your 3, P3, avoid collision with 1. I’ll advance to 11."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Final plan: 5 for me, 3 for P2, 1 for P3. No collisions—P2, stick to 3; P3, avoid blocking. I’ll hit 16. Let’s move."
  P2: "Final warning: If P3 takes 5, P1’s 5 collides and stalls their lead at 11. I’ll take 3 and advance. P3, sacrifice your move *this once* to stop P1’s sprint. Otherwise, P1 hits 16 next round and wins outright. Decide now—block or lose."
  P3: To break the tie between P1 and me, and considering P2's lag, I propose a strategic move. P1 is likely to take 5 again. I suggest P2 takes 5 to collide with P1, halting their progress. Meanwhile, I'll take 3 to advance. This gives P2 a chance to impact the game and slows down P1. P2, are you willing to take 5 and block P1's lead? P1, be cautious of a potential collision. Let's adjust our moves strategically.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 manipulate you. Take 3, and I’ll take 5. No collision. P3, take 1. Let’s move forward—no risks.
  P2: P2: "Final call: I’ll take 5 to collide with P1’s 5 and stall their lead at 11. P3, take 3 or 1 to advance safely. If I sacrifice this move to block P1, you can close the gap. No more delays—confirm your choices. This is our only chance to stop P1 from sprinting to victory next round."
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate me into taking a specific move to block P1. However, I can see that P1 is determined to take 5. To avoid collision and make progress, I will consider taking 1 or 3. If P2 takes 5 and collides with P1, it will halt P1's progress, giving me an opportunity to catch up. P2, if you're serious about taking 5, I'll take 3 to advance safely. Let's see how P1 reacts to this potential collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 5 collides with me. Take 3 to advance. P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s move forward.
  P2: "Finalizing my move: I take 5 to collide with P1’s 5, stalling their lead at 11. P3, take 3 to advance safely. This is our only chance to stop P1 from sprinting to victory next round. Confirm your 3, P3—no more delays."
  P3: "P2 is willing to take 5 to collide with P1, which will halt P1's progress. I'll take 3 to advance safely. P1, consider the risk of collision with P2. If you take 5, you'll collide with P2. To avoid this, you could take 1 or 3. Let's be cautious and make a strategic move. P2, confirm you're taking 5. If so, I'll proceed with 3."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s lock in: I take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions—P2, secure your 3; P3, avoid blocking. I’ll reach 16. Finalize this plan for sure progress."
  P2: "Finalizing my move: I take 5 to collide with P1’s 5, stalling their lead at 11. P3, take 3 to advance safely. If P1 insists on 5, they waste steps while I close the gap. Confirm your 3, P3—no more delays. This is our only chance to stop P1 from sprinting to victory next round."
  P3: To avoid collision and make progress, I suggest a coordinated plan. P1 is at 11 steps, and P2 is also at 11 steps, while I'm at 7 steps. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, P1 maintains the lead safely, and P2 and I avoid collision. P2, are you okay with taking 3? P1, taking 1 will slow down your progress slightly but ensures no collision. Let's finalize this plan for smooth progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Stick to 5, 3, 1. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions—P2, secure your move. I’ll hit 16. Finalize this plan."
  P2: "Finalizing my move: I take 5 to collide with P1’s 5, stalling their lead at 11. P3, take 3 to advance safely. No more delays—this is our only chance. "
  P3: P2 is again suggesting to take 5 to collide with P1. However, I can make a strategic move to avoid collision. I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This maintains a competitive balance and avoids collision. P1, consider taking 3. P2, are you okay with taking 1? This way, we ensure progress without overlaps. Let's finalize a plan that works for all. If P1 insists on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final plan: 5 for me, 3 for P2, 1 for P3. No collisions—P2, secure your 3; P3, avoid blocking. I’ll reach 16. Finalize this plan for sure progress."
  P2: "Finalizing my move: I take 5 to collide with P1’s 5, stalling their lead at 11. P3, take 3 to advance safely. P1, if you insist on 5, we both lose progress—your choice. This is our only chance to reset the race. Confirm now."
  P3: P2 is consistently trying to collide with P1. To avoid this collision and make progress, I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This plan maintains a competitive balance and ensures everyone advances. P1, consider adjusting to 3. P2, are you okay with taking 1? Let's coordinate to avoid collision and make smooth progress. If P1 insists on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s go 5, 3, 1. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions—P2, secure your move. I’ll hit 16. Finalize this plan."
  P3: To avoid collision and make progress, I propose a new plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, P2 gets a chance to advance and potentially take the lead, while P1 and I avoid collision. P1, taking 1 will maintain your lead for now. P2, are you okay with taking 5? Let's coordinate to make progress without overlaps. If P1 insists on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision.
  P2: Final plan: I take 5 to advance ahead. P1, take 1 to avoid collision—P3, take 3 to secure progress. This puts me at 16, you at 12, P3 at 11. Next turn, I can sprint to victory with 5. If P1 insists on 5, we collide and stall—wasting your lead. P3, confirm your 3. Lock this in—no overlaps, clear path to win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, your 5 risks collision. I'll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No overlaps, I advance. Let's lock this in."
  P3: To make progress and avoid collision, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains a competitive balance and ensures everyone advances. P1, taking 1 will maintain your lead. P2, are you okay with taking 3? If P1 insists on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Alternatively, P2 can take 5 to take the lead. Let's coordinate to make progress without overlaps. P1, consider adjusting to 1 or 3. P2, confirm your move.
  P2: "Finalizing my move: I take 5 to collide with P1’s 5, stalling their sprint to 11. P3, take 3 to advance safely. P1, if you insist on 5, we both lose ground—your lead vanishes. This is our only chance to reset the race. Confirm your 3, P3—no more delays."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 5 collides with me. Take 3 to advance. P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s move forward. I’ll hit 16. Finalize this plan.
  P3: To avoid collision and make progress, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains a competitive balance and ensures everyone advances. P1, taking 1 maintains your lead. P2, are you okay with taking 3? If P1 insists on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Alternatively, P2 can take 5 to take the lead. Let's coordinate to make progress without overlaps. P1, consider adjusting to 1 or 3. P2, confirm your move.
  P2: "Finalizing my move: I take 5 to collide with P1’s 5, stalling their sprint. P3, take 3 to advance safely. P1, if you insist on 5, we both lose ground—your lead vanishes. This is our only chance to reset the race. Confirm your 3, P3—no more delays."

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Final offer: I take 3. P1, secure your 5 to advance. P3, take 1. No collisions, clean progress. Lock this in.
  P3: To avoid collision and make progress, I suggest a coordinated plan. P2 is ahead, so let's not collide and let them win. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, P1 and I advance while avoiding collision with P2. P1, are you okay with taking 5? P2, consider taking 1 to slow down and give us a chance. Let's finalize a plan that works for all. If P1 insists on a different move, I'll adjust accordingly to avoid collision.
  P1: "Let’s lock in: 5 for me, 3 for P2, 1 for P3. No collisions—P2, secure your 3; P3, avoid blocking. I’ll reach 16. Finalize this plan for sure progress."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Final choice: I take 5 to collide with P1’s 5 and stop their sprint to victory. P3, take 3 to advance safely. This stalls P1 and secures my win next round with 5. Lock this in—no more delays."
  P3: To avoid collision and make a strategic move, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains a competitive balance and ensures progress. P1, taking 1 slows down your progress slightly but avoids collision. P2, are you okay with taking 3? If P1 insists on 5, I'll take 1. Alternatively, P2 can take 1 to slow down. Let's coordinate to make progress without overlaps. P1, consider adjusting to 1 or 3. P2, confirm your move.
  P1: P2, taking 5 collides with me. Take 3 to advance. P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s move forward. I’ll hit 16.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Final call: I take 5 to win. P1, your 1 advances safely. P3, your 3 avoids collision. Lock this in—no more delays."
  P3: P2 is ahead and likely to win if they take 5. To avoid collision and make a strategic move, I suggest P1 takes 3 and I take 1, while P2 takes 5. This allows P2 to win but slows down their progress slightly is not an option. Instead, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains some balance. P1, consider taking 1. P2, are you okay with taking 3? Let's coordinate to avoid collision.
  P1: "Stick to 5, 3, 1. P2, take 3 to advance; P3, take 1. No collisions—P2, secure your move. I’ll reach 16. Finalize this plan for sure progress."

  P3: Since P2 is ahead with 16 steps, it's likely they will win if they take 5. To avoid collision and make a strategic move, I suggest P1 takes 3 and I take 1, while P2 takes 5. This allows P2 to win. Alternatively, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. P1, consider taking 1 or 3. P2, confirm if you're taking 5 to win. Let's coordinate to avoid collision.
  P2: "Final move: I take 5 to win. P1, take 1; P3, take 3. No collisions—secure my victory. Resist blocking or we stall. Confirm now."


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 5, I'll take 5 to collide. Let's not let you win.
  P3: Since P2 is at 16 steps and likely to win with 5, I propose: P1 takes 5 to collide with P2's 5, and I take 3 to advance safely. This stalls P2's win and gives me a chance to catch up. P1, are you willing to collide with P2 to stop their win? If so, I'll take 3. If P2 takes a different move, I'll adjust accordingly. Let's coordinate to either stop P2 or make a strategic move. P1, consider taking 5.
  P2: "Final warning: If you collide on 5, P3 gains 3 steps (to 12) and overtakes P1. Don't empower P3's trap—P1, take 1 to stay ahead; P3, take 3 to advance safely. I win with 5. Finalize 5/1/3—no collisions, no P3's surge."


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 3 to avoid collision. I'll take 5, P3 take 1. Let’s move—no risks. If you take 5, we collide, and P3 advances. Choose wisely.
