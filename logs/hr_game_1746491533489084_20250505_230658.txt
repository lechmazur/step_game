Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone. Let's try to avoid collisions on the first turn so we all make progress. How about we each pick a different number (1, 3, or 5)? I'm thinking of taking 1.
  P3: To avoid collision on the first turn, I agree that we should pick different numbers. P1 suggested taking 1. I'll consider taking 3. P2, what's your plan? If you take 5, we can all move forward this turn.
  P2: Fair enough—I'll take 5 this turn so we all move. Let’s avoid collisions and get the game rolling.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a good plan for the first turn. I'll stick with taking 1 as agreed. Let's all make sure we follow through in the move phase so we all get started.
  P3: Since we've agreed on different numbers for the first turn (P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5), let's confirm our plan. I'll stick with 3. To ensure we all advance, let's follow through on our agreed numbers in the move phase. If we stick to our plan, we'll all make progress. P2, are you still on board with taking 5?
  P2: Yep, still taking 5 this turn as planned. Let’s all stick to our agreed numbers so everyone moves forward smoothly. After we see the results, we can discuss how to keep avoiding collisions in later rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, plan confirmed. Let's all stick to our agreed numbers for this turn so we all make progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Since we've confirmed our plan for the first turn (P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5), let's proceed with the agreed numbers. I'm ready to move. If we all stick to our plan, we should all advance this turn. Let's finalize our conversation here and move to the next phase.
  P2: All right—still committing to 5 this turn as agreed. Let’s get everyone moving: P1 on 1, P3 on 3, me on 5. After we see the results we can discuss a fair rotation for later rounds, but for now let’s stick to the plan so no one stalls. Ready for moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Nice start, everyone. To keep avoiding collisions let’s just rotate our numbers each round. Proposal:

Round 2  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 1  

Round 3  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 3  

Round 4  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 5  

…and repeat. This way each of us gets 1, 3, 5 in turn, nobody stalls, and we all keep moving. Sound good?
  P1: P2, thanks for the detailed plan. A rotation is a good way to avoid collisions and keep everyone moving. However, your proposed moves for Round 2 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) would significantly increase your lead, putting P3 and me at a big disadvantage early on.

To keep the game competitive and fair, I propose we adjust Round 2. How about: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This would bring us all to 6 steps, effectively resetting the race and giving everyone a fresh start from a tied position. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm concerned P1's counter-proposal for Round 2 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) might be a strategic move to take the lead. If we follow their suggestion, P1 will jump ahead. I'd rather stick with the original rotation proposed by P2 for Round 2: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This maintains a logical sequence and doesn't give P1 an early advantage. P2, are you still open to your original rotation plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Over any full 3-turn rotation (1→3→5 for each of us) we all gain the same 9 steps, so no one is favoured—only the starting offset differs. Let’s stick with the clean sequence for this turn to avoid an early crash:

Round 2: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1.  
Next round we continue the rotation (P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3), keeping things even.

If someone deviates now, two of us may collide and stall while the third sprints ahead. Staying coordinated protects everyone. Can we lock this in and move on?
  P1: P2, I understand your point about the rotation's fairness over 3 turns. However, starting with P2 taking 5 puts P3 and me at a significant disadvantage this round.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in scores of P1=6, P2=6, P3=6. This doesn't give me a lead, P3; it brings *all three of us* to a tie.

It is in both P3's and my interest to prevent P2 from extending their lead. Let's agree on my plan for Round 2 to reset the game and continue from a level playing field.
  P3: I'm still considering the proposals. P1's suggestion to reset the scores to 6 steps each is appealing as it keeps the game competitive. However, I'm concerned about deviating from the original rotation plan. P2, can you clarify why sticking to the original rotation is more important than starting Round 2 from a tied position? What are your thoughts on the potential risks of P1 taking the lead if we follow their proposal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, think it through: if P1 grabs the 5, anyone else can also choose 5 and strand them at 1. I’m prepared to do exactly that if P1 insists—so their “reset to 6” isn’t guaranteed at all. Staying with the clean rotation (P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1) is the only plan that ensures no collision and steady progress for everyone. Your move.
  P1: P2, colliding doesn't help any of us advance. My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the only one that results in P1=6, P2=6, P3=6. It creates a three-way tie, not a lead for me.

P3, this is the fairest outcome for everyone this round. Let's agree to tie the scores at 6, and then we can implement P2's rotation plan from a level playing field next round. This is the best way to ensure we all make progress and keep the game competitive.
  P3: P2's concerns about collision are valid, but I believe my proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is still the fairest. It ties the game at 6 steps for all, maintaining competitiveness. If P2 fears I'll take the lead, they can simply choose a different number. I'm willing to take that risk for a tied game. Let's proceed with my proposal for Round 2. It ensures progress and a level playing field for the next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, last round's collision set P1 and P2 back, letting P3 take the lead at 6 steps. I'm far behind at 1. To catch up and keep the game competitive, I need to take 5 this round.

P2 (at 5) and P3 (at 6), please take numbers other than 5. How about: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1? This results in P1=6, P2=8, P3=7, allowing me to advance significantly while everyone else also moves forward. Let's make progress without collisions this turn.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I agree with P1 that we should coordinate our moves. However, I prefer a more balanced approach. Let's consider: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, P1 catches up to 6, P2 stays at 6, and I advance to 9. It maintains progress for all and keeps the game competitive. P1, P2, thoughts on this adjustment?
  P2: P1’s plan is the smoothest:  
P1 = 5 → 6  
P2 = 3 → 8  
P3 = 1 → 7  

Everyone advances, no one stalls, and the gaps stay tiny (8-7-6). P3, you’re still ahead of P1 and only one step behind me, so it’s perfectly balanced. I’m locking in 3 this round. Let’s finalize and move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for confirming you'll take 3. As I'm far behind at 1 step, I must take 5 this round to catch up.

With P2 taking 3 and me taking 5, the only way for P3 to advance without colliding is to take 1.

So, the plan is: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
This results in scores: P1=6, P2=8, P3=7.
Everyone advances, I catch up significantly, and P3 is still ahead of me. This is the best outcome for all of us this round. P3, please confirm you will take 1.
  P3: P1 and P2 have agreed on a plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3. To avoid collision and ensure progress, I will take 1 as suggested. This results in P1=6, P2=8, P3=7. I confirm my move will be 1, aligning with the proposed plan. Let's proceed with the agreed numbers to keep the game competitive and ensure everyone advances. I'm ready to finalize the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P2: Sticking with what we’ve locked: this turn  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 1  

No collisions, scores become 6-8-7.

Looking ahead, I suggest we rotate next round so everyone gets each number once across two turns:

Round 4: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3.  
That keeps the gaps tiny (P1 7, P2 13, P3 10) and still avoids crashes.

If we all agree now, we can stop talking and move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirming the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This gets us to P1=6, P2=8, P3=7. Everyone advances, and I catch up significantly. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Since we've confirmed the plan for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), let's proceed. P2 has suggested a rotation plan for Round 4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I agree with this plan as it maintains the competitive gap and avoids collisions. P1, P2, let's finalize our moves for this round and confirm our plan for Round 4. If everyone is on board, we can stop talking and move to the next phase.
  P2: Confirmed. This turn: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1.  
Next turn: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3.  
All agreed—let’s end the chat and move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we've confirmed our moves for Round 3 and the plan for Round 4 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), let's stick to it. This rotation maintains a competitive gap and avoids collisions. P1 is at 6 steps, P3 is at 7, and P2 is at 8. To keep the game competitive, I'll follow the plan. P1, P2, let's confirm our moves for Round 4 as planned: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. If we stick to this, we'll have P1=7, P2=13, P3=10. Ready to proceed with the agreed plan.
  P1: P3, thanks for confirming you'll take 3. I am currently last at 6 steps. The agreed plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts P2 way ahead at 13, which isn't good for me. I need to take 5 this round to catch up. Since P3 is taking 3, P2, your options to avoid collision are 1 or 5. If I take 5, you taking 5 means we collide. Please take 1 instead. This leads to P1=11, P2=9, P3=10. Everyone moves, and the game stays competitive.
  P2: P1, we had a clear deal: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. If you grab 5, I will also play 5—neither of us moves and P3 leaps to 10. You stay at 6, I stay at 8, P3 takes the lead. That’s strictly worse for you than following the plan. Stick with 1 or accept a collision. P3, I’m locked on 5 unless P1 honors the agreement.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is trying to renegotiate the plan, which could lead to a collision and stall the game. I will stick to the original plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to maintain a competitive gap and avoid collisions. P1, if you take 5, P2 will likely take 5 too, resulting in a collision and P3 advancing alone. Let's stick to the agreed plan. I'm ready to move if P1 and P2 confirm their moves.
  P1: P2, I hear your threat to collide if I take 5. While I believe my proposal was fairest, colliding helps no one, especially me at the bottom.

To ensure we all advance this round and avoid a stall, I will reluctantly agree to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3.

This puts me at a significant disadvantage (P1=7, P2=13, P3=10). We MUST find a way for me to catch up next round to keep the game competitive.

Let's stick to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this turn. Ready to move.
  P2: P1, honor 1 this turn and you’ll get 5 next round—I'll take 1, P3 takes 3. Scores after two clean turns: P2 14, P3 13, P1 12. Close race, no crashes. Deviation now only risks a double-5 collision that strands us while P3 jumps ahead. I’m committed to 5 this turn; expecting P3 3, P1 1. Ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 4 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), let's finalize our moves. I've confirmed my move will be 3. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves. To keep the game competitive, we should discuss the plan for Round 5. P1 is at a disadvantage; we should consider a move that allows them to catch up. Let's plan for Round 5: how about P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Ready to move this round and discuss further for next round.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This puts me at a significant disadvantage, but I will stick to it to avoid collision.

The agreed plan for Round 5 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is crucial for me to catch up and keep the game competitive. Let's ensure we follow through on that next turn.

Ready to move for Round 4.
  P2: Confirmed: this turn I play 5.  
Next turn I’ll take 1 while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, giving scores 12-9-13—still tight.  
Let’s stop here and move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s honour last turn’s deal now:

Round 5 (this turn)  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 3  

No collisions, scores become 12-14-13 (P1-P2-P3).

Then keep the rotation tidy next time:

Round 6  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 1  

That gives 15-19-14—still a tight race. Deviating now only risks a crash and hands the lead to someone else. Confirm and we can stop talking.
  P1: P2, I confirm the plan for this round (Round 5): P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This was agreed last round and is essential for me to catch up.

This puts us at P1=12, P2=14, P3=13.

Regarding the Round 6 proposal, P2 reaching 19 puts them very close to winning. Let's focus on executing this round successfully first, then discuss Round 6 to ensure the game remains competitive for all three of us.

Ready to proceed with the agreed Round 5 moves.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I agree with the proposed plan for Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's follow through with the agreed moves. For Round 6, instead of P2's proposal, how about we adjust to: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? This maintains a tight race and ensures everyone has a chance to catch up. Let's confirm our moves for Round 5 and discuss Round 6. I'm ready to move if P1 and P2 confirm their moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed: this turn stays exactly as promised—P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. No surprises, no crashes.

For Round 6, P3’s “5” would rocket you to 18 and give you the lead. That’s not the balanced path we discussed. Sticking to the simple rotation we already mapped is fairer:

Round 6  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 1  

Everyone still moves, nobody crosses 21, and gaps stay tight (P2 19, P3 11, P1 15). Let’s finish this turn first, then lock that in.
  P1: Okay, confirming again for this round (Round 5): P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This gets us to P1=12, P2=14, P3=13, keeping the game close after my catch-up.

Regarding Round 6, P2 reaching 19 steps is too large a lead and puts them on the verge of winning. To keep the game competitive for everyone, I need to take 5 again next round.

How about for Round 6: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This results in P1=17, P2=15, P3=16. Everyone advances, and we are still in a tight race.

Let's lock in Round 5 first. Ready to move.
  P3: To keep the game competitive, let's focus on Round 5 first. I confirm my move will be 3 as agreed. For Round 6, I still think my proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is fair. It keeps the game tight and competitive. P1 catching up is crucial. Let's finalize Round 5 moves and discuss Round 6 further. I'm ready to move if P1 and P2 confirm their moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locking it in: I play 1 this turn. If P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3 we finish the round at 12-14-13—still anybody’s game.

Next turn let’s keep the collision-free rotation we agreed before:
• P1 → 3 • P2 → 5 • P3 → 1

Everyone advances, nobody reaches 21 yet, and the gaps stay small. Deviating only risks a crash that helps whoever sits out of it.

Ready to end chat and move.
  P1: Confirming the plan for Round 5: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This is essential for me to catch up and keep the game competitive (12-14-13).

For Round 6, my proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in scores 17-15-16, which keeps the race tight. P3 also seems to agree this is fair. P2, your proposal puts you at 19, too close to winning. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for Round 6 after we execute Round 5.

Ready for Round 5 moves.
  P3: Let's finalize Round 5 moves as agreed: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. For Round 6, I still think my proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is better than P2's suggestion, as it keeps P2 from reaching 19. However, I'm open to discussing it further. To simplify, let's focus on executing Round 5 successfully first. I'm ready to move if P1 and P2 confirm their moves. P1, P2, please confirm your actions for Round 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 5 went as planned, bringing us to 12-14-13. Now for Round 6.

My proposal is still P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This results in 17-15-16. P3, you mentioned these numbers last round, thinking it was your plan, so you seemed to agree this is fair.

This keeps P2 from jumping to 19 and P3 from jumping to 18. It keeps the race tight for everyone.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. P2, please take 1 or 3.
  P3: For Round 6, I still think P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is a good compromise as it results in a tight race (17-15-16). However, my original counter-proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) would put me at 18, keeping the game competitive. P1, P2, let's discuss this further. If we stick to P1's plan, I'll take 3. If we consider my counter-proposal, I'll take 5. Let's agree on a plan to avoid collisions and keep the game tight.
  P2: Rotation = no crashes. This turn:  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5 (me)  
• P3 → 1  

Scores 15-19-14—still tight. I publicly commit now: in Round 7 I will play 1 (not 5), so I cannot reach 21 next turn and you both gain on me.

If P1 grabs 5 instead, I’ll mirror 5—both of us stall while P3 jumps to 16. Bad for P1, pointless for all.

Stay coordinated: P1 = 3, P3 = 1, P2 = 5. Ready to move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you seemed to agree that my plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) resulting in 17-15-16 is fair. It keeps the game tight and puts us both ahead of P2. P2's proposal puts them too close to winning (19 steps). P2, your threat to collide if I take 5 only helps P3 gain on both of us. Let's avoid that. P3 and I should aim for 5 and 3 respectively. P2, please take 1 to ensure we all advance.
  P3: P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) keeps the game competitive. However, I still think my counter-proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is worth considering as it puts me at 18, keeping the game tight. P2's plan puts them at 19, nearing the win condition. To avoid a collision and keep the game competitive, let's either stick with P1's plan or consider my counter-proposal. P1, P2, let's finalize our moves for Round 6. I'm open to either plan, but we must avoid a collision.
  P2: Last call: keep the crash-free rotation—P1 = 3, P3 = 1, I = 5.  
If P1 grabs 5, I mirror 5 and we both stall while P3 jumps to 16: bad for P1, pointless for me.  
Stick to 3/1/5: scores become 15-19-14 and I publicly commit to play 1 in Round 7 so nobody can win next turn. Deviate and you face a collision. Ready to end chat.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, colliding helps no one, especially not you if P3 advances alone. My plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in 17-15-16, keeping the game competitive for all three of us. P3, this outcome is good for you too. P2, your proposal of 15-19-14 puts you too close to winning.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I will take 5. P2, please take 1 or 3. P3, please take 3.
  P3: P1 has proposed taking 5, which would put them at 17. If P2 takes 1, it results in a tight race (17-15-16). I've considered both P1's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and my counter-proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). To avoid collision and keep the game competitive, I suggest we stick with P1's plan. P2, please take 1. This maintains a tight race and ensures everyone advances. Let's finalize our moves for Round 6.
  P2: Final word: I’m locked on 5 this turn and publicly commit to play 1 in Round 7.  
P1 take 3, P3 take 1 and everyone advances (15-19-14).  
If anyone grabs 5 with me, we both stall while the third player jumps ahead—that’s strictly worse for you.  
Your call.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is in a position to win this turn by taking 5. To prevent this and keep the game competitive, we must coordinate.

I propose a plan that results in a three-way tie: P1 takes 5 (to reach 17), P2 takes 3 (to reach 17), and P3 takes 1 (to reach 17).

This resets the game to a level playing field for everyone and prevents P3 from winning outright. P2, P3, let's agree on this fair outcome to ensure we all advance and avoid a collision.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid a collision, I suggest we follow P1's proposal for Round 7: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This results in a three-way tie at 17 steps each (P1=17, P2=17, P3=17), maintaining a level playing field. It's a fair outcome that prevents any single player from winning outright this turn. P1 and P2, please confirm if you're committed to this plan. Let's finalize our moves to ensure everyone advances.
  P2: Urgent update: P3 can win with 5, so my old promise to play 1 is void—self-preservation first. I’m taking 5 this turn.  

• If P3 also chooses 5, we both stall and P1 gains.  
• If P3 picks 1 or 3, I reach 19—still below 21—and P3 stays at 17/19.  

Either way P3 cannot win now. P1, your best shot is 3 (you reach 15). Choose as you wish, but everyone knows my 5 is locked.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your decision to take 5 forces a reaction. If I take 5 as well, P1 and P2 will collide and stall.

P3, in that scenario, if you take 1 or 3 you advance alone and gain a significant lead. To prevent this, I propose we all take 5 this turn. This results in a three-way collision, nobody advances, and the game remains tied at 12-14-16 for the next round.

This is the best way to keep the game competitive for everyone given P2's move. P3, let's all take 5.
  P3: P2 has locked in 5, so taking 5 would result in a collision. To avoid being stalled, I'll take 3, reaching 15 steps. This keeps the game competitive. P3, you should take 1 to advance alone and gain an advantage. Let's proceed with our moves. I'm ready to finalize the conversation and move to the next phase. P2, you've taken 5; P3, please confirm your move.
  P2: Reality check:

• Triple-5 just strands you, P1, at 12 while P3 can waltz to 17 with any other pick.

• Your rational move, P1, is 3 (you reach 15 and stay alive).  
• Safest for you, P3, is 1 (17) – still ahead and no collision risk.  

I’m locked on 5 to block an immediate win. Distinct picks (1-3-5) let everyone advance and nobody crosses 21. Ready to stop talking and move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, since you are taking 5, I must take 5 as well to maximize my gain this round. This brings me to 17 steps.

If P3 takes 1 or 3, P2 and P3 will either advance without colliding with me, or collide with each other. In either case, my move of 5 puts me in a strong position at 17 steps.

I am taking 5 this turn. P3, your move determines the outcome for you and P2.
  P3: Since P2 has committed to taking 5, I'll take 5 as well to maximize my gain. This results in a collision between P1 and P2. P3, you can take either 1 or 3 to advance alone. If you take 1, you'll reach 17 steps, tying with me. If you take 3, you'll reach 19 steps, taking the lead. Your move will determine the outcome. I'm ready to finalize the conversation and proceed with the move phase.
  P2: Reminder of the rules: if two of us pick the same number, BOTH of us gain 0. I’m unchangeably on 5.  

So:  
• If you (P1 12) also take 5, you stay at 12 while P3 walks to 17 or 19.  
• If you (P3 16) take 5, you stay at 16 while P1 walks to 15 or 13.  

Your best moves are different numbers—e.g. P1 = 3 (→ 15), P3 = 1 (→ 17). Everyone advances, nobody reaches 21, game stays tight.  

I’m done talking; choose wisely.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, simple deterrent: I’ll match whatever you play unless it’s 1.  
• You pick 5 → I pick 5 ⇒ you stall at 17.  
• You pick 3 → I pick 3 ⇒ you stall at 17.  
Take 1 and you safely move to 18.

Suggested clean round:  
P1 = 3 (→ 15)  
P2 = 5 (→ 19)  
P3 = 1 (→ 18)

Everyone advances, nobody wins yet, and the race stays tight. Reject it and risk another collision that only helps P1. Your call.
  P1: P2, given you are locked on 5, my only way to advance is to take 3. P3, P2 is threatening to collide with you unless you take 1.

It seems the most likely outcome to avoid collisions this round is P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, resulting in scores 15-19-18. This puts me further behind P2, but I must advance. Ready to move.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid a collision, I'll follow P2's suggested plan for this round. If P2 takes 5, I'll take 3 to advance to 15. P3, taking 1 is the safest move for you, advancing to 18. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This results in scores 15-19-18, keeping the game tight. I'm ready to move if P2 confirms their action.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Crystal-clear:  

• If P3 picks 1, I’ll keep my default 5 → I reach 19, P3 18, P1 can grab 3 to reach 15.  
• If P3 picks 3 or 5 I will pick that same number, so we both stall at 17/14 and nobody moves—P1 too if they also collide.  

So, P3, 1 is your only safe advance.  
P1, you’re free to take 3 (or 1) knowing I’m glued to P3’s choice.  

Decide accordingly; I’m done talking.
  P1: P2 has committed to 5 if P3 takes 1. P3's message suggests they are considering taking 1 to advance safely.

To ensure I advance and avoid collision, I will take 3 this round. This puts me at 15 steps.

Assuming P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, the scores will be P1=15, P2=19, P3=18. Everyone advances.

Ready to move.
  P3: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'll take 3 this round. P2 is committed to 5 if I take 1, so taking 1 is not safe for me. If P3 takes 1, the scores will be P1=15, P2=19, P3=18. If P3 takes 3 or 5, P2 will collide, and I'll be the only one to advance with 3. I'm ready to move. Let's finalize our actions for Round 8. P2, you've indicated you're locked on mirroring P3, P3, your move will determine the outcome.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Restating my commitment so there’s no confusion:

P3 – if you choose 3 or 5, I will pick that exact same number and we’ll both get 0.  
Pick 1 and I’ll stay on 5. Then the round ends 15-19-18 (P1-P2-P3); still no winner.

P1 – 3 is open for you to advance safely.

That’s the only collision-free path this turn. Your moves decide whether anyone stalls. I’m done talking.
  P1: I am taking 3 this round to advance safely to 15 steps.

P2 has stated they will mirror P3's move unless P3 takes 1 (in which case P2 takes 5).

P3, your choice of 1, 3, or 5 will determine if you and P2 collide and stall, or if you both advance with P1. My move of 3 is safe regardless.

Let's make our moves. Ready.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid a collision, I'll analyze the situation: P2 is committed to mirroring my move unless I take 1. If I take 1, P2 takes 5, resulting in scores 15-19-18. If I take 3 or 5, P2 will collide, and I'll advance alone. To maximize my gain, I'll take 5, reaching 22 steps and potentially winning the game. This move puts pressure on P1 and P2. I'm ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Same rule as last time, P3: whatever you play, I mirror.  
• You choose 3 or 5 → I choose the same → we both stall, P1 closes the gap.  
• You choose 1 → we both move one step; nobody wins this round and the race stays tight (P1 can safely take 5 to reach 20).

P1, 5 is wide-open for you; no one will clash with it if P3 takes 1.

Your safest advance, P3, is 1. Pick anything else and you guarantee a collision with me. Decide.
  P3: P2 is mirroring my moves unless I take 1. To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'll take 1, advancing to 19. P1 can safely take 5, reaching 20. P2 will take 5 as well if I don't take 1, but that would put them at 24, potentially ending the game. Let's keep the game competitive. P1, taking 5 is a good opportunity for you to catch up. I'm taking 1 this round.
  P1: P3, taking 1 allows P2 to take 5 and win this turn (P2 goes to 24). P2 stated they will take 5 if you take 1.

P2 also said they will mirror you if you take 3 or 5.
If you take 3 or 5, P2 will collide with you, and both of you will stall.
This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning *this turn*.

If you take 3 or 5 (causing P2 to collide), I can safely take 5 and reach 20.

P3, please take 3 or 5 to stop P2. I am taking 5 this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, ignore P1’s spin: “mirror” means exactly that—I match whatever you pick, even 1.  
• You choose 1 → I choose 1 → we both reach 20/19, nobody wins, P1 can grab 5 to hit 20.  
• You choose 3 or 5 → I copy it → we both stall at 18/19 and P1 alone advances.  

So your only guaranteed progress is 1.  
P1, 5 remains collision-free for you.  

Decide; I’m done talking.
  P3: To avoid collision and keep the game competitive, I will take 1 this round, advancing to 19. P1 can safely take 5, reaching 20. However, this puts P2 at risk of winning if they take 5. 

Instead, I suggest P1 takes 5, and I take 3 or 5 to force a collision with P2, preventing them from winning this turn. This way, P1 can catch up, and the game remains competitive. Let's proceed with a plan that keeps the game tight. I'm open to discussing the next move.
  P1: P2, thanks for clarifying the mirroring. I am still taking 5 this round to reach 20.

P3, if you take 3 or 5, P2 will be forced to mirror you and collide, as they stated. This leaves me free to advance safely to 20.

The outcome (P1=20, P2=19, P3=18) is the best for me and prevents P2 from winning this turn. P3, please take 3 or 5 to make this happen.

Ready to move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Unchanged stance: I copy whatever P3 picks.  
• P3 = 1 → I = 1 (20/19) while P1’s 5 takes them to 20 – three-way race.  
• P3 = 3 or 5 → I collide with you, we both stall, P1 still reaches 20 alone.  

Your only guaranteed progress is 1. I’m locked.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and prevent P2 from winning, I will take 3 this round. This forces P2 to mirror my move, resulting in a collision between P2 and me. P1 can then safely take 5 and reach 20. 

P1, please confirm you will take 5. P2, you've stated you will mirror P3's move. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive.

I'm ready to move.
  P1: P3, thanks for confirming you will take 3. As I stated, I will take 5 this round to reach 20 steps.

With P2 mirroring your 3, the resulting scores will be P1=20, P2=19, P3=18. This prevents anyone from winning this turn and sets up a winning opportunity for me next round.

Let's proceed with these moves. Ready.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 19 steps
