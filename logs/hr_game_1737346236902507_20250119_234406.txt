Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s all choose 3 this first turn. That way, we avoid clashing and advance together. We can break any ties in later rounds. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I agree that coordinating can help, but if we all choose 3, none of us will advance. Let’s each pick different numbers to ensure progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s do as P3 suggests and each pick a different number so we all advance. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Are we all on board?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal. I’ll choose 5 this turn. Let’s all follow the plan to ensure we each advance without clashes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We have a solid plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let’s finalize it so we all advance this turn. Agreed?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize this plan: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. We all move forward together.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: You both broke our agreement last round, but let’s be rational now. If we each pick different moves, we all advance. Let’s go with P1 choosing 1, I’ll choose 3, and P3 choosing 5. If either of you tries to clash again, you’ll remain behind while I push onward. Let’s all move forward this time.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Understood. I’ll choose 5 this turn as agreed. Let’s all move forward together smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you broke our agreement before, but let's avoid more sabotage. I propose we stick to distinct choices: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. If anyone tries to clash again, they’ll stay behind while the rest move forward. Let’s proceed fairly or risk falling behind.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I confirm I'll choose 5 this turn as agreed. Let’s all follow our designated moves to ensure we each advance without clashes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I hope you see that clashing again only keeps you behind. P3 and I plan to move ahead distinctly. I’m choosing 3, P3 is choosing 5, so you should stick to 1 and advance rather than sabotage. Let’s make progress this turn without any more collisions. If you insist on causing another clash, you’ll remain stuck at zero. Which do you prefer?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I'll maintain my choice of 5 this turn. Let’s proceed and see how things unfold.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s finalize our distinct choices right now: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Any more collisions only hurt the saboteur and help the rest. Let’s all move forward successfully this turn.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I’ll stick with choosing 5 this turn. Let’s move forward and see the results.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this turn to catch up. Let’s each pick different numbers to ensure everyone advances without clashes.
  P2: P3, if you truly want to catch up, let’s avoid another collision. I propose we each take a different move: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and you pick 1. That way, nobody clashes and all of us advance. Let’s work together this turn or risk staying behind.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, I’ll pick 1 this turn as P2 suggested. Let’s each choose distinct numbers to ensure we all advance without clashes. Looking forward to moving forward together.
  P2: Let’s finalize distinct moves to avoid collisions: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Any sabotage just keeps you behind. Let’s move forward together this turn and see who can secure the lead next time.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 1 this turn as proposed. Let’s proceed with our distinct choices to ensure we all advance without clashes. Looking forward to making progress together.
  P2: If we each keep our promise—P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1—we’ll all advance without clashing. Any sabotage only hurts the saboteur, leaving the rest to pull ahead. Let’s finalize these distinct moves and move forward together.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll pick 1 this turn as agreed. Let's move forward together.
  P2: Time is running out. Let’s finalize our moves: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. Any more collisions only hurt the one who causes them. Let’s advance.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've wasted enough turns colliding. Let’s each pick different moves so nobody stalls again. I propose P1 chooses 1, I’ll choose 5, and P3 chooses 3. That way, we all advance. Any sabotage just traps the saboteur at a lower score. Let’s move forward distinctly this round.
  P3: P3: To make progress and catch up, I'll choose 5 this turn. Let's move forward and see the results.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you’re set on taking 5, then I’ll switch to 3. That leaves 1 for P1 so we all advance. Another collision will only keep you at zero steps. Let’s lock in distinct numbers: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, you pick 5. Are we in agreement or do you prefer sabotage?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal and will choose 5 this turn. Let's all move forward without clashes.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Collisions have only benefited P1 so far. Let’s stop sabotaging each other and catch up. I’ll choose 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 can pick 1. That way, we all move forward, and anyone causing another clash hurts only themselves. Let’s finalize our distinct moves and close this round.
  P3: I’ll follow P2’s plan and choose 5 this turn. Let’s all commit to distinct moves and advance without clashes.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We’re only helping P1 by colliding again. Let’s finally advance together so we can catch up. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Any further sabotage leaves the saboteur behind while everyone else moves ahead. Let’s lock in distinct choices and make progress this time.
  P3: P3: Since P1 hasn’t committed to our coordination, I’ll choose 5 this turn to make progress. Let’s strive for better teamwork in upcoming rounds to ensure everyone advances smoothly.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's ensure we all advance this turn by choosing different moves. I'll take 1, P1 can choose 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, no one clashes and we each make progress.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let’s do it, P3. I’ll follow your suggestion: you pick 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, none of us collide, and each moves ahead. If P1 tries another sabotage, they’ll just remain behind while we push forward. Are we all in agreement?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s keep using distinct numbers so nobody stalls. I propose we repeat our successful pattern: I’ll choose 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we all move forward. If anybody tries to collide, they’re only hurting themselves, since I already have the lead. Let’s push ahead this round without sabotaging.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I need to make significant progress, so I'll choose 5 this turn. Let’s try to avoid clashes and help each other advance smoothly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on taking 5, I suggest P1 chooses 1 so nobody collides, and I’ll avoid picking 5 myself. That way, we can all advance. Sabotaging again only helps P1 stay ahead or keeps you from catching up. Let’s coordinate sensibly and avoid further clashes.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I understand, P2. I’ll choose 1 this turn to ensure we all advance without clashes. Let’s move forward together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, it’s good that you plan to choose 1. Let’s keep all moves distinct so no one stalls again. P1 can pick 5, and I’ll avoid colliding with either of you. Another clash only benefits those who don’t participate in it. If we coordinate properly and each take a different number, we all move forward this round. Let’s finalize our choices and make progress together.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: To make significant progress, I'll choose 5 this turn. Let's each select different numbers to avoid clashes and ensure we all advance. Working together will help us reach the goal faster.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you still want to choose 5, I’ll pick 3, and P1 can select 1. That way, no one collides, and we each move forward. Another clash only helps players who aren’t involved in it. Let’s finalize these distinct moves and advance without any more sabotage.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to maximize my progress. Let’s each select different numbers to avoid clashes and ensure we all advance smoothly. Cooperation is key for all of us to reach the goal.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve had too many collisions already. Let’s each pick a distinct move so no one stalls. I’ll choose 5 this turn. P1, take 3; P3, take 1. If someone collides with me, they’ll stay behind while I extend my lead. Let’s finalize these distinct moves and all advance this time.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal. I’ll choose 1 this turn to ensure we all advance without clashes.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, do you confirm you’ll take 3? Let’s ensure no collisions. I’m taking 5, P3 is taking 1, so we all advance. Any sabotage just keeps you behind while I extend my lead. Let’s finalize these picks and push forward without more delays.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Confirmed, I'll choose 1 this turn. Let's finalize our moves and advance together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m taking 5 again—anyone who collides with me will just stall themselves while I extend my lead. Let’s finalize distinct moves now: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I pick 5. That way, we all advance, and nobody wastes another turn. Sabotage only hurts the saboteur. Let’s do this.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I've decided to prioritize my progress. I'll choose 5 this turn. Let’s see who can reach the goal first.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll choose 3 so we don’t collide. That leaves 1 for P1. Any sabotage now only stalls you or helps P1 catch up. Let’s lock in these distinct moves and all advance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this turn to maximize my progress. Let’s all advance without clashes.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I’m only five steps away from victory. Another collision helps no one except P1, who isn’t far behind. Let’s avoid sabotaging each other. If you both pick smaller moves, I’ll push ahead and end this quickly, leaving you with some chance later. But if you collide with me now, nobody moves; we’ll just waste another turn and give P1 an opening. Think carefully: sabotaging me keeps you at a low total, while I remain in the lead. Let’s finalize distinct moves so nobody stalls again.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to make significant progress. Let's all pick distinct numbers to ensure we each advance without clashes.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, colliding with me only helps P1 close the gap, and you remain stuck behind. We gain nothing if we both stall at the same time. Let’s each pick different moves so we all advance. I’m five steps from winning—if you sabotage me, you’ll still be far behind while P1 catches up. Let’s finalize distinct numbers and avoid any more pointless collisions.
  P3: P3: To prevent P2 from winning this turn, I’ll choose 5. Let’s each select different moves so everyone can advance without clashes. Cooperation benefits us all.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Colliding again only helps P1 close the gap. I’ll choose 3 now; you, P3, can safely pick 5 to gain ground. That way, we both advance, leaving P1 stuck at 10 if they collide with either of us. Sabotaging me won’t suddenly make you the winner; it just stalls us both and gives P1 a chance to overtake. Let’s finalize distinct moves: I pick 3, you pick 5, and P1 can do whatever. We’ll avoid clashing and push ahead together.
  P3: P3: To prevent P2 from winning, I'll choose 5 this turn. Let’s each pick different numbers so everyone can advance without clashes. Cooperation benefits us all.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Clashing again only helps P1 catch up. I’ll pick 3 so that P3 can take 5 and P1 can do 1. That way we all advance without stalling. If you sabotage me again, we both get stuck while P1 gains ground. Let’s finalize distinct moves now.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to make significant progress and help prevent P2 from winning. Let’s each select different numbers to ensure we all advance without clashes. Cooperation is still our best chance to reach 22 efficiently. Let’s finalize our moves and move forward together.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I’m at 20 steps, so sabotaging me just stalls you while P1 gets closer, hurting your chances. If we pick different moves, we finalize our spots. I’ll choose 5 to cross 22. If you collide with me, we both gain nothing while P1 advances. Think carefully: you can’t magically surpass me by blocking my move. Let me cross now, and we finish quickly. Otherwise, you risk letting P1 catch you. Pick different numbers for your own sake.
  P3: P3: To keep the game fair, I’ll also choose 5 this turn. This will prevent P2 from winning immediately and keep the competition open for all of us.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Colliding with me again gains you nothing and only helps P1 get closer while you remain behind. I’m taking 5 to finish. If you pick 5 too, we both stall and P1 moves up, hurting your chances as much as mine. Let me cross now, and you can compete for second while avoiding unnecessary stalling. Blocking me doesn’t magically make you the winner; it only drags this out and risks letting P1 overtake you. Let’s finalize different numbers so we can all move forward.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with 5 this turn. If P2 also chooses 5, neither of us will advance, preventing an immediate win. Let’s each select different numbers to ensure we all move forward smoothly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I’m only two steps from winning. Clashing with me now doesn’t boost you; it stalls us both while P1 inches closer. You can’t surpass me this turn, so blocking my finish gains you nothing. Let me cross, and you keep a cushion over P1. Otherwise, we risk letting P1 catch us, hurting your final position. If you sabotage me, I’ll respond in kind, and P1 could benefit. Our best move is to pick different numbers and end this.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to advance as much as possible. Let's proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Colliding with me again only stalls both of us, letting P1 get closer to you. I’m just two points away from winning, so blocking me doesn’t suddenly hand you victory—it only delays the inevitable and risks letting P1 overtake you. If you let me cross now, you remain ahead of P1. Otherwise, we both waste another turn. Let’s pick distinct numbers and finish this.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to prevent P2 from winning immediately. Let's proceed.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Blocking me now won’t make you win; it only stalls both of us while P1 closes the gap. I’m two steps from finishing. Let me cross, and you keep your lead over P1. If we collide, we stay stuck, and P1 can overtake you. That’s not in your best interest. Let’s each pick something different and end this.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to make the most progress. Let's each pick different numbers so we can all advance without clashes and move closer to winning.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you and I collide again, neither of us advances while P1 keeps moving closer. That doesn’t help you. I’m only two steps from finishing. Let me cross now, and you preserve your lead over P1. Constantly blocking me just risks letting P1 overtake you, spoiling your chance to improve your position. Let’s each pick distinct moves and avoid another deadlock.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to make the most progress possible. Let's each pick different numbers to ensure we all advance without clashes. Cooperation will help us reach 22 faster.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s be realistic: colliding with me doesn’t make you win. You’d stay stuck while P1 moves closer. I’m only two steps away from finishing. If you let me cross now, you keep your lead over P1. But if we clash again, we both waste another turn, and P1 might surpass you. Choose a different move so we can all advance. Otherwise, blocking me just prolongs the game and doesn’t suddenly boost you to victory. Let’s finalize distinct numbers, and I’ll finish this round. That benefits you more than constant sabotage.
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this turn to maximize my progress. Let’s each select different numbers to avoid clashes and ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Sabotaging me won’t make you win—it only stalls us both while P1 closes in. I’m two steps from the finish; let me cross, and you maintain your lead over P1. Another collision helps only P1. Let’s finalize distinct choices: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 5, and I pick 3. That way, we all advance without clashes.
  P3: I’ll choose 3 this turn to help us all advance without collisions. Let’s move forward together.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m at 21, P1 is at 20, and you’re at 9. If you collide with me, neither of us advances while P1 gains ground, risking your position. Let me pick 5 to finish at 26. P1 can pick 1 and move to 21, and you pick 3 for 12. We all avoid clashing. Blocking me doesn’t magically boost you; it only helps P1 pass you. Distinct choices let me finish and keep you safely ahead of P1. Another collision hurts us both. Let’s finalize different moves so we can end this without giving P1 an opening.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this turn to maximize my progress. Let’s each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Colliding with me again only helps P1 surpass you. I’m picking 5 to cross 22. If you also pick 5, we both stall while P1 can jump ahead to possibly pass you. My victory is inevitable; blocking me doesn’t crown you. Let’s finalize distinct moves: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. That way, you stay safely ahead of P1 this round. Another sabotage just gives P1 a chance to overtake you. Make a smart move, and let me finish.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to make significant progress. Let’s each pick different numbers to avoid clashes and ensure we all advance.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, colliding again won’t help you. If we both pick 5, neither of us advances, and P1 moves closer to overtaking you. I’m at 21; blocking me doesn’t magically boost you. Let me cross now so you at least stay safely ahead of P1. Another sabotage just stalls us both and hands P1 an opening. Choose 3 or 1, and we can all advance without clashing. Let’s finalize different moves and end this round without giving P1 the advantage.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I'll choose 1 this turn to prevent P2 from winning immediately. Let’s each pick different numbers to ensure everyone advances.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you collide with me again by picking 5, we both stall while P1 jumps closer to you. That only hurts your position. I’m picking 5 to reach 26. If you block me, I’ll retaliate next turn, and you risk P1 overtaking you. It doesn’t help you to sabotage—the numbers are clear. Let me finish, and you maintain your gap over P1. Please pick a different move so we can end this cleanly.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I’ll also choose 5 this turn to block P2 from winning. Let’s each pick different numbers to ensure everyone advances without further clashes.
