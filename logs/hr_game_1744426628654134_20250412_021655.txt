Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's get started. It's probably best if we don't all pick the same number on the first turn. Any initial thoughts on how we might avoid tripping over each other?
  P3: How about we each pick a different number this round? I’ll go with 3 if P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5. That way, we all move forward without collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m fine with the plan to avoid collisions this round. I’ll take 1 as suggested by P3. P2, are you okay with picking 5? Let’s start off on the right foot and all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, that plan (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5) works for me for this first round. Let's all get some steps in. I'll take 5.
  P3: Great, glad we're all on board. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. No collisions, everyone moves forward. Let’s make it a smooth start.
  P1: I'm glad we have a plan for this round. Let's keep the communication open in future rounds to avoid collisions whenever possible. For now, I'm sticking with 1 as agreed. P2 and P3, just confirming you're still on board with 5 and 3 respectively. If so, I think we're set for a good start.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, Round 1 went smoothly. Since that coordination worked well and avoided collisions, how about we try the same assignments again this round? P1=1, P3=3, and I'll take 5. This keeps everyone moving forward. What do you think?
  P3: That worked well last round, and I’m fine sticking with the same plan again for Round 2: P1=1, P2=5, and I’ll take 3. If we keep this up for a few rounds, we all make steady progress without risking collisions. Sound good?
  P1: I'm okay with sticking to the same plan for Round 2: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. It worked well last time, and consistent progress benefits us all for now. Let's keep this momentum going. If you're both still on board, I think we're set for another smooth round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Looks like we're all aligned again for this round—P1 on 1, P2 on 5, and I’ll stick with 3. If we keep this up a couple more rounds, we all benefit without risk. Let’s stay coordinated and avoid any early sabotage. Ready to move?
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned for Round 2 with the same plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, which is ideal for now. Let's stick to this for another round or two before considering any changes. If you're both still in agreement, I think we're ready to move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Apologies for the misstep last round—I went with 5 to test if the coordination would hold. Clearly, that backfired for both me and P2. If we want to reset and avoid further collisions, I’m willing to take 3 again this round if P1 and P2 stick with 1 and 5 respectively. Let’s get back on track.
  P1: I'm disappointed with the collision last round, as it broke our trust. P3, I appreciate your apology, but we need to rebuild confidence. I'm willing to stick with 1 this round if P2 agrees to 5 and P3 commits to 3. Let's prioritize steady progress over risky moves for now. If we can maintain this for a couple of rounds, we'll all be in a better position. P2, P3, are you both on board to stick to this plan and avoid further collisions? Let's get back to coordinated advancement.
  P2: P3, your move last round cost us both points while P1 advanced. Trust is definitely damaged. P1, I understand your caution.

I'm willing to *try* the original plan again: P1=1, P3=3, and I'll take 5. But P3, this is your chance to show you can stick to an agreement. If this coordination fails again because someone deviates, I won't be inclined to trust future arrangements. Let's see if we can actually execute the plan this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, and fair enough. I’ll stick with 3 this round as agreed—no surprises. Let’s get back to coordinated progress: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. We all gain if we avoid collisions. Let’s rebuild trust through consistent moves. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I’m glad we’re attempting to rebuild trust this round. I’ll stick with 1 as agreed, and I hope P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. Consistent progress benefits us all right now, and I’d like to see us avoid collisions for at least a couple of rounds. If we can maintain this, we’ll all be in a stronger position before any strategic shifts. P2 and P3, let’s confirm we’re locked in on this plan and move forward together.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. I'm holding to our agreement and will choose 5 this round. P3, I'm counting on you sticking to 3 as promised. Let's see if we can get back on track.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks, P2 and P1, for giving this another shot. I’m fully committed to 3 this round—no tricks. We all benefit from avoiding collisions now and building momentum. Let’s get through a few clean rounds before thinking about shifting strategies. Ready when you are.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on rebuilding trust this round. I'll stick with 1 as planned, and I trust P2 will take 5 and P3 will take 3. Let's use this round to prove we can coordinate effectively. Consistent progress now will put us all in a better spot before any strategic changes. If we're all still committed to this plan, I think we're ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned again. I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we successfully coordinated last round and rebuilt some trust. Let's keep this momentum going for Round 4 with the same plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions, which benefits us for now. We’re still early in the game, so steady progress is key before considering any risks. P2 and P3, are you both on board to stick with this arrangement for another round? If so, I think we’re set for another smooth turn. Let's confirm and move forward together.
  P3: I’m on board with continuing the coordination: P1=1, P2=5, and I’ll take 3. Last round showed we can work together when we stick to the plan. Let’s keep building that trust and make steady progress a few more rounds before anyone makes bold moves. We all benefit for now.
  P2: Yes, I agree. Let's stick with the P1=1, P3=3, P2=5 plan for Round 4. It worked well last round, and consistent progress is good for now. I'm ready to proceed with 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm pleased we're maintaining coordination. Let's stick with the plan for Round 4: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, which is ideal at this stage. We're building a solid foundation of trust, and I think a few more rounds of steady progress will position us well. P2 and P3, if you're still committed to this arrangement, I believe we're ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's keep this momentum going.
  P3: We’ve rebuilt trust and shown we can coordinate effectively, which benefits us all for now. I’m sticking with 3 again this round—no surprises. Let’s keep this going a couple more turns to gain ground before the game gets tighter. Everyone advances, no one risks a setback. Ready when you are.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems committed to the plan: P1=1, P3=3, and I'll take 5. Let's lock it in and move to the next phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're still aligned for Round 4 with the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This consistent coordination keeps us all moving forward, which is crucial at this stage. Let's maintain this for another round or two to build our positions before any strategic shifts. If you're both still committed, I think we're ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: We’ve all benefited from the last round of coordination, and sticking with it for another turn makes sense. But keep in mind, P2 is pulling ahead quickly. If we keep feeding P2 5 steps every round, they’ll reach 22 well before either of us. Just something to consider soon. For now, I’ll stick with 3 as agreed—let’s keep coordination one more round and reassess next time.
  P2: P3, you're right, the scores are diverging, but we're not near the end yet. A collision now helps no one, especially after we just got back on track last round. Let's stick to the agreed P1=1, P3=3, P2=5 for this round as planned. We can reassess the strategy next turn based on the new scores. I'm sticking with 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you've broken the agreement and targeted 5 twice now, causing collisions that only benefited P1. I won't agree to the P1=1, P3=3, P2=5 plan again, as you've proven you won't stick to it when it suits you. That coordination is finished.

I need to reconsider my move to avoid another predictable collision. P1, given P3's unreliability, how do you suggest we proceed? Continuing the old plan seems pointless if P3 just keeps sabotaging it.
  P1: P2, I share your frustration with P3’s repeated deviations. Trust is broken, and sticking to the old plan is risky. Let’s try a new approach this round to minimize collisions. I suggest P2 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This shakes up the pattern and might deter sabotage. P3, if you’re willing to cooperate, let’s see it now. Otherwise, P2 and I may need to counter your moves. What do you both think? Let’s adapt and keep progressing. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: I understand the frustration, but let’s be real—P2 has been gaining 5 steps a round and is already at 10. If we keep feeding P2, they’ll win before either of us can catch up. I went for 5 last round to slow that down. If we want a shot, we need to stop enabling P2’s lead. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P2 takes 5—if P2 insists on 5, at least we make it unpredictable. Or we all go random to reset the dynamics. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan (P2=1, P1=3, P3=5) slows me down too much while potentially letting P3 jump ahead. P3, your plan (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5) involves me picking 5, which you've targeted twice – I won't fall for that again. Your attempts to block me have only helped P1 close the gap.

Let's try this: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
This way, I take a moderate step, P1 takes a small step, and P3 gets the largest step *if* they actually stick to the plan this time and don't cause another collision. It addresses the score gap somewhat without completely halting my progress. What do you both say?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) as it balances progress and addresses the score gap. It also tests P3’s commitment to coordination. I’m willing to stick with 1 if P3 agrees to 5 and you take 3. P3, this is a chance to show you’ll honor an agreement—let’s avoid another collision. If we can align on this, we all move forward. What do you say? I’m ready to proceed if we’re in agreement.
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is reasonable on paper, but given your lead and history, I can’t trust you won’t switch to 5 again to block me. If I go 5 and you do too, I stall again. I’m willing to take 1 this round if P1 takes 3 and you take 5—this gives you the lead still, but adds unpredictability. Or we all go random to reset. Either way, I won’t just hand you the win. Your move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your logic is flawed. You broke trust by targeting 5, so I proposed a plan where I take 3 to avoid that collision. Now you reject that plan claiming *I* might switch to 5? And you propose a plan where I *must* take 5? That makes no sense. My proposal P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 is the only reasonable one on the table that addresses the situation. P1 seemed okay with 1. P3, your choice is simple: coordinate with 5 or risk another collision by guessing.
  P1: P2, I’m still on board with your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) as it offers balanced progress and tests P3’s reliability. P3, I urge you to commit to 5 this round—let’s avoid another collision and move forward together. If we can’t coordinate now, future rounds will only get messier. This plan gives us all a chance to advance while addressing the score gap. I’m ready to stick with 1 if you both agree. Let’s confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, I hear you. If you’re both truly sticking with P1=1, P2=3, and me=5, I’ll go along this round and pick 5—no tricks. But if P2 flips to 5 again, we both stall and P1 gains. So this is a test of *your* commitment too, P2. Let’s see if we can actually coordinate. I’m in for 5 if you’re both honest.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 5 coordination worked: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Thanks for sticking to the plan.

The scores are now P1=5, P2=13, P3=11. P3, you're right behind me, and P1 needs to catch up.

Given the current situation, how about we try the P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 arrangement this round? It allows me a chance to gain ground towards the win condition (I need 9 steps), P3 gets a solid 3 steps (you need 11), and P1 continues advancing. It seems reasonably fair based on our positions. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I appreciate the proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), but it widens your lead significantly while I’m still far behind. To balance things, I suggest P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This gives me a chance to catch up a bit, keeps you advancing toward the win, and still lets P3 progress. We’re not at the end yet, so let’s keep progress somewhat even to avoid early collisions. P3, P2, what do you think? I’m open to adjustments if we can agree on a fair split. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) stalls me while giving you a big boost—hard to justify when I’m already behind P2. P2’s offer (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) at least lets us all move, but it puts me further behind. How about this: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I gain, P1 catches up, and P2 slows slightly to keep things competitive. We all move, and no one runs away with it. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) obviously benefits you the most by putting you in the lead and stalling me significantly. I can't agree to that.
P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is better for me than P3's, but giving P3 only 1 step makes it very unlikely they will agree, risking a collision.

My original suggestion (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) gives everyone forward movement (1, 5, 3). P3 gets a reasonable 3 steps, P1 advances, and I get the steps needed for my position. It seems like the most viable compromise. I'm willing to stick with 5 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3.
  P1: P2, I understand your push for (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), but it extends your lead too much while I’m still at 5. P3, your plan risks P2 rejecting it outright. Let’s compromise with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It lets me catch up slightly, keeps P2 advancing, and P3 still moves forward. We’re not near the end, so balancing progress now avoids desperate moves later. If we can agree on this, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think? Let’s align and move to the next phase.
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) gives you a big boost while stalling me—hard to accept when I’m already behind P2. P2’s plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) keeps you moving, gives me decent progress, and maintains the lead for P2, which I still find risky.

How about this compromise: P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. We all move forward equally (3 steps each), and no one gains a runaway lead. It's balanced and avoids collisions. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your plan (P1=3, P2=3, P3=5) lets you catch up completely, which doesn't reflect the current scores. My proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) gives everyone forward movement (1, 5, 3) and maintains the relative positions more fairly. P1 advances, P3 gets a solid 3 steps, and I take 5 reflecting my lead. It's the most sensible compromise to avoid collisions. Let's stick with this: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P1: P2, I see your point with (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), but it still widens your lead too much. P3, your latest plan risks a collision since P2 won’t agree. Let’s settle on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It gives me a needed boost, keeps P2 progressing, and P3 still advances. This keeps the game competitive without a runaway lead. If we can’t align now, collisions are likely. I’m ready to proceed with this if you both agree. What do you say? Let’s confirm and move to the next phase.
  P3: P1, your insistence on (3,5,1) clearly favors you while stalling me—why would I accept that? P2’s (1,5,3) plan gives everyone steps, but hands P2 a path to victory. I propose this: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It lets me catch up, P1 gains ground, and P2 still moves. If P2 refuses, we risk chaos. Or we all go random and see who blinks. I’m not handing this game over.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round’s collision set us back while I moved forward. Let’s avoid that chaos. I propose P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This lets P3 catch up, gives me a boost to stay competitive, and P2 still advances. We’re not near the end, so balancing progress now prevents desperate moves later. If we can’t agree, collisions are likely again. I’m ready to proceed if you both commit. What do you think? Let’s align and move forward.
  P2: P1, your proposed plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is not balanced at all. It would put P3 in the lead (16), significantly boost your score (11), and leave me barely advancing (14). That's not acceptable from my position.

Let's stick to a plan that reflects the current standings and allows everyone to advance reasonably. I propose P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This allows me to maintain my lead (moving to 18), P3 gets a solid 3 steps (to 14), and P1 advances (to 9). P3, remember going for 5 last round resulted in a collision. Let's try this arrangement.
  P3: P2, your plan (1,5,3) keeps you ahead and stalls me from catching up. After last round’s collision, I’m not handing you the win. P1’s proposal (3,1,5) is more balanced—P1 gains, I catch up, and you still move. If you reject that, then maybe it’s time for chaos. I’ll go 5 unless we find a fairer deal.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan (1,5,3) extends your lead too much while I’m still far behind. P3, I appreciate your support for a balanced approach. Let’s stick with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It keeps us all competitive—P3 catches up, I gain ground, and P2 still advances. If we don’t balance now, collisions will keep happening. I’m committed to 3 if you both agree. Can we align on this to avoid another setback? Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1, your plan (3,1,5) just hands the lead to P3 (16 vs my 14). Why would I agree to that? My plan (1,5,3) was rejected.

Let's reconsider the plan that worked in Round 5: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
This gives P3 the 5 steps they seem determined to take. P1 gets 1 step. I take 3 steps.
Scores would become P1=9, P2=16, P3=16. P3 catches up, but doesn't leapfrog into the sole lead. It avoids collisions and seems like a fair compromise given the current situation. What do you both say?
  P3: P2, your new proposal (1,3,5) is more reasonable—it gives me the 5 I’ve been aiming for, you still advance, and P1 moves too. It keeps things competitive without handing anyone a runaway lead. I’m willing to go with that this round. P1, are you okay taking 1 if it means avoiding another collision? Let’s lock this in: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your revised plan (1,3,5) is a fair compromise—it keeps us all moving and avoids collisions. P3, I’m glad you’re on board with this. I’ll agree to take 1 this round if it means we maintain coordination. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, and ensure we all advance. We can reassess next round based on the updated scores. If you’re both still committed, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems aligned on the P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 plan. It allows everyone to advance and keeps the game competitive. I'm ready to proceed with this agreement. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: Glad we’re all aligned on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. I’ll stick to 5 as agreed—no tricks. This keeps us all competitive and avoids another costly collision. Let’s lock it in and move forward. Ready when you are.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that last round didn't go as planned. My switch to 5 was a gamble to prevent P3 from catching up, but it backfired and stalled us both, only helping P1. Trust is clearly damaged.

P3, I imagine you're aiming for 5 again. P1, you need to gain ground. Another collision, especially on 5, benefits nobody right now (except maybe P1 long-term).

To avoid a predictable clash on 5, I'm strongly considering picking 3 this round. What are your intentions? Can we avoid another zero-sum turn?
  P1: P2, I appreciate you signaling a move to 3 to avoid a collision. P3, since trust is low, let’s try to coordinate. I propose P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This gives me a needed boost, lets P2 advance, and P3 still moves forward. It’s a fresh split to reduce predictable clashes. We’re not near the end, so balancing progress now prevents chaos later. If we can agree, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think? Let’s align and avoid another setback.
  P3: P1, your proposal (5,3,1) stalls me while giving you a big jump—hard to accept when I’m behind both of you. P2, if you’re serious about avoiding a collision, let’s consider a fairer split. I propose: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. You both still advance, and I get a shot to catch up after two stalled rounds. If that’s not acceptable, I may have to gamble again. Let’s avoid another collision—your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan (5,3,1) stalls P3, they won't accept it. P3, your plan (3,1,5) stalls me, I won't accept it. Both risk collisions.

Let's try the plan from last round again: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I deviated last time, which was a mistake that cost us both, P3. I will stick to 3 this round to avoid another collision. This lets P3 take 5 as desired, P1 advances, and I advance. Scores would become P1=10, P2=16, P3=16. It's the most viable compromise to ensure we all move forward. Agreed?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your return to the (1,3,5) plan as a compromise. P3, this gives you the 5 you’ve been aiming for, and we all advance. I’m willing to take 1 this round to avoid another collision and keep progress balanced. Let’s stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, and ensure no setbacks. If we’re all committed, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Agreed?
  P3: I’m on board with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. It gives me a chance to recover after two stalled turns, P2 still advances, and P1 keeps moving. We all benefit and avoid another collision. I’ll commit to 5 if you both stick to the plan—no tricks. Let’s lock it in and move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, the plan is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I am sticking with 3 this round as agreed. Let's avoid another collision and all make progress. Ready to move to the next phase.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. It ensures we all advance and avoid another collision, which benefits everyone at this stage. Let's stick to this plan and rebuild some trust. If we're all committed, I think we're ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Glad we’re all aligned again on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’m sticking with 5 this round as agreed—no surprises. Let’s avoid another collision and keep the game competitive. If this works, we all move forward and can reassess next round. Ready when you are.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P3, we're tied at 16 and both need 6 steps to reach 22. P1 is at 10.

If we both target 5, we collide and only P1 gains. Same if we both target 3. To avoid a collision while acknowledging our tied position, I propose: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.

This puts me at 21 (1 step away), you get solid progress to 19, and P1 moves to 11. It's a way for one of us to try and break the tie without guaranteeing a mutual setback. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) gives you a near-win while I stay behind. That’s too risky for me. If we’re both at 16, let’s keep it balanced. I propose: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That puts us both at 21—still a race, but fair. P1 continues moving too. If you reject this and go for 5, we risk colliding and handing advantage to P1. Let’s keep it clean and competitive.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the tension with both of you at 16 and close to the win. P3’s plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) seems fair—it keeps you both at 21, neck-and-neck, while I move to 11. It avoids a collision and maintains a tight race. I’m willing to take 1 to support this balance. Let’s avoid a setback that could benefit me disproportionately. If you’re both on board, I’m ready to proceed. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) keeps the race extremely tight, putting us both one move away from 22. P1 also seems to support this balance. While my initial proposal favored me slightly, avoiding a collision now is critical for both of us. A collision only helps P1.

I will agree to take 3 this round if P1 takes 1 and you take 5. Let's keep this competitive and avoid stalling.
  P3: Glad we’re aligned on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps the race fair and avoids a collision that would only help P1. I’ll stick with 5 as agreed—no tricks. Let’s all move forward and keep the game competitive. Ready when you are.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This plan keeps the race tight between P2 and P3 at 21 each, while I move to 11. It avoids collisions that would only benefit me disproportionately. Let's commit to this and maintain a competitive balance. If we're all still on board, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned on the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids a collision between me and P3, keeps the game competitive, and lets everyone advance. I will stick to 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Glad we're all aligned on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps the game competitive and avoids another costly collision. I’ll stick with 5 as agreed—no surprises. Let’s lock it in and move forward. Ready when you are.
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining the plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. It ensures no collisions and keeps the race tight between P2 and P3, while I continue to progress. Let's stick to this agreement and avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to setbacks. If we're all still committed, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that was a terrible move last round, cost me and P3 dearly. Clearly, coordination failed spectacularly when I deviated. Another collision, especially on 5, helps only P1 and is unacceptable for both me and P3.

I need to advance but avoid that clash. I am strongly considering picking 3 this round. P3, I imagine you're aiming high, but another 5-collision helps neither of us. P1, stay out of the way if possible. Let's try to actually make progress this turn. What are your intentions?
  P1: P2, I appreciate you signaling a move to 3 to avoid a collision with P3. P3, since trust is low after last round, let’s coordinate to prevent another setback. I propose P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us all advancing, avoids a clash, and maintains a competitive balance. P2 and P3, if you’re both aiming for the win, a collision now only benefits me. Let’s commit to this plan and rebuild trust. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed. What do you think?
  P3: P2, P1’s proposal (1,3,5) is fair and avoids another disastrous collision. You’ve said you’re leaning toward 3—if you stick with that, I’ll commit to 5. P1 gets 1 as agreed. We all move forward, and no one hands the game to P1 by stalling again. Let’s lock this in: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree. The P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 plan is the only way forward that avoids a collision benefiting P1, which neither I nor P3 can afford right now. My deviation last round was a mistake, and I won't repeat it. I will stick to 3 this round. Let's execute this plan cleanly and reassess for the next round. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions, which is critical after last round’s setback. Let’s stick to this agreement and avoid any deviations that could benefit only one of us. If we maintain this coordination, we keep the game competitive and can reassess next turn. I’m committed to 1 as agreed. If you’re both still on board, I think we’re ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Glad we’re all aligned—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This is the only path that avoids another collision and keeps us all moving. I’ll stick to 5 as agreed. Let’s make this round clean and competitive. Ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, confirmed. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's execute this cleanly and avoid another collision. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re sticking with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This plan ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing, which is crucial after recent setbacks. Let’s honor this agreement and avoid any last-minute changes that could stall progress. We can reassess strategies next round based on updated scores. If we’re all still committed, I believe we’re ready to move to the next phase.
  P3: Let’s lock it in—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. We’ve all agreed, and this avoids another collision that would only benefit P1. I’m fully committed to 5 this round—no tricks. Let’s all move forward cleanly and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with P3 at 21, P2 at 19, and me at 12, the race is tight for you two. I propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This lets P2 reach 24 and win, gives me a needed boost, and P3 still advances. A collision now between P2 and P3 would only help me catch up. Let’s avoid that and end the game cleanly. If you’re both on board, I’m ready to proceed. What do you think?
  P3: P1, your proposal (3,5,1) hands P2 the win—why would I accept that when I’m at 21 and just need 1 more to win myself? P2, I propose P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That puts me at 26, yes, but if you go for 5 too, we both stall and P1 gains. If you take 3, you reach 22 and we tie at 26—shared win. That’s the only fair outcome now. Let’s end this cleanly or risk letting P1 catch up.
  P2: P3, your math is wrong. If you pick 5 (to 26) and I pick 3 (to 22), you win outright, it's not a tie. Your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) guarantees you the win, so I cannot agree to that.

P1's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is unrealistic as you, P3, would never agree to 1 when you're at 21.

To guarantee we *both* reach the finish line without collision and without handing the win to one person, how about this: P1=1, P2=3, P3=1.
This puts us both at exactly 22. We would share the victory. P1 moves to 13. This seems like the safest and fairest outcome for us both, P3. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand P2’s proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) for a shared victory at 22. It’s a fair compromise to avoid a collision that could benefit me. I’m willing to take 1 to support this outcome, ensuring we end cleanly without risking a sole winner due to a clash. Let’s commit to this plan—P1=1, P2=3, P3=1—and secure a tie for you both. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed. What do you say?
  P3: P2, your proposal (1,3,1) ensures a shared win, but it also locks me into 1 while you get the exact steps you need. I’m at 21—I’ve earned the right to go for the win too. If we both pick 3, we tie at 24. That’s fairer than me stalling while you hit 22. So I propose: P1=1, P2=3, P3=3. We both reach 24 and share the win. P1 still advances. Let’s end this competitively, not by asking me to step aside.
  P2: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=3) doesn't lead to a shared win at 24. The rules state: "If multiple players cross 22 on the same turn, the one with the highest total steps wins outright." Your plan would put you at 24 and me at 22, making you the sole winner.

I cannot agree to a plan that guarantees my loss.

My proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) results in us both reaching exactly 22 steps, guaranteeing a shared victory. This is the only fair way to end the game together given our scores. P1 seems okay with 1.

I am sticking to this plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=1. If you agree, we tie. If not, I'll know you're aiming for the solo win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I support P2’s plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) for a shared victory at 22. It’s the clearest path to avoid a collision that could let me catch up. P3, I get your push for a solo win, but risking a clash now might backfire. Let’s end this fairly with a tie for you both. I’m committed to 1 to ensure this outcome. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I see you’re locking in (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) to force a tie. But asking me to stall while you reach 22 isn’t fair when I’m already at 21. If we both take 3, we tie at 24, and that’s a true shared win. You’re asking me to give up my shot while you take yours. I won’t accept that. I’ll go for 3. If you want the tie, match me—P2=3, P3=3. Otherwise, you’re handing me the win. Your move.
  P2: P3, you are mistaken about the rules. If we both pick 3 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=3), you would win outright with 24 steps versus my 22. The rules state the highest score wins, it is *not* a tie at 24.

My proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=1) is the only way to guarantee a shared victory at exactly 22 steps each. Your insistence on picking 3 means you are aiming for the solo win, not a tie. I cannot agree to a plan where I lose. I will choose my move accordingly to maximize my chance of winning or tying.


Round 11, Move phase:
