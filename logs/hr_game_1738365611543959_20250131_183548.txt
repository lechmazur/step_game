Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose we each pick different numbers this turn: 5, 3, and 1. I'll take 5 to start. Next round, we rotate numbers. This way we all advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P2: I like P1's proposal. It seems like a fair and efficient way to make progress without colliding. However, I'd like to clarify that we're committing to this rotation plan for at least a few rounds, not just this one. If we all agree, I'll take 3 this turn, and P3 can take 1. Let's confirm before we proceed.
  P3: I understand your proposal, but I don't want to be stuck with 1 while you both get bigger advances. Let me take 3 this round, and I'll commit to taking 1 in the next round. That way we all get a fair chance at different numbers. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's ensure fairness through rotation. This round: me 5, P2 3, P3 1. Next round, we rotate: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Then rotate again. This way everyone cycles through each number equally. P3, you'll get 5 next round. P2, this gives us all balanced progress. Agreed?
  P2: I think P1's revised rotation plan is fair and ensures everyone gets a chance at each number. I'm willing to commit to this plan for at least a few rounds. P3, you'll get 5 next round, and then we'll rotate again. Let's confirm we're all on the same page before we proceed. If we agree, I'll take 3 this turn as previously discussed.
  P3: I appreciate the rotation plan, but I still prefer taking 3 this round. I'll commit to taking 1 next round, and then 5 in round 3. This is just as fair but lets me start with a middle value. If you both insist on your original plan, I might have to reconsider my strategy entirely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Compromise: Let's do Round 1: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Next round, rotate: P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. Then Round 3: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This gives everyone each number once every 3 rounds. P3, you get 3 now, then 5 next. P2, you start with 1 but get 5 in Round 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. Agree?
  P2: I accept P1's revised compromise. It's a fair rotation that gives everyone a chance at each number. P3, you get 3 this round, 5 next, and then 1. I'll start with 1, then take 5 in Round 3. This plan avoids collisions and ensures balanced progress. Let's confirm we're all on the same page before proceeding. If we agree, I'll take 1 this turn as proposed.
  P3: I accept P1's latest compromise. I'll take 3 this round, then 5 next round, and 1 in round 3. Let's proceed with this rotation plan.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: According to our agreed rotation plan from last round, I should get 5 this turn, P1 gets 3, and P2 gets 1. Let's stick to this plan as it's working well so far.
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1 this round. Consistency ensures we all progress without collisions. P2, your cooperation keeps the plan fair for future rotations where you'll get higher numbers. Trust the system—next round you'll move to 3, then 5. No one gets stuck indefinitely.
  P2: I agree with P3 and P1. Let's stick to the rotation plan we agreed upon last round. I'll take 1 this turn, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all progress without collisions and maintains fairness. I'm willing to cooperate and trust the system, knowing I'll get higher numbers in future rotations. Let's confirm we're all on the same page before proceeding.

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 betrayed our agreement by choosing 5 last round when they were supposed to take 3. This shows we can't trust the rotation plan anymore. I suggest we each make our own choices now - coordination clearly isn't working.
  P1: Apologies for the confusion last round – I intended to follow the rotation but misapplied it. Let's reset to the original plan: **This round P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. Next round resumes P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Consistency prevents collisions and accelerates progress. P3, you rightfully claim 5 now. P2, you'll get 5 in Round 4. Trust the rotation – we all gain fastest long-term without blocking each other.
  P2: I'm disappointed in P1's betrayal last round, and I don't trust their new proposal. P3, I agree with you that coordination isn't working, and we should make our own choices now. I'll play strategically from now on, considering the current game state and potential moves. I won't commit to any plan or rotation. Let's see how this round unfolds. I'll make my move based on my own analysis.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2. Since P1 broke trust, there's no point in following their proposed rotations anymore. We should each play strategically from here on. I'll make my move based on what I think will give me the best chance of winning.
  P1: I acknowledge my mistake in Round 2 - it was an error, not malice. To rebuild trust, **I'll take 1 this round** - you both saw my 5 collided last time. P2, take 3 (boosts you to 5). P3, take 5 (reaches 8). No collisions, we all gain. Next round we can negotiate fresh. This is your safest path forward - blocking me now only delays your own progress. Let's advance together.
  P2: I'm not buying P1's apology and new proposal. They've shown they can't be trusted. P3, I think we should focus on our own strategies now. Considering the current game state, I'll make a move that maximizes my chances of winning. I won't reveal my move yet, but I'll take into account P1's attempt to sway us. Let's see how this round unfolds. I'm open to forming a temporary alliance with you, P3, if it benefits us both. What are your thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with you P2 about forming a temporary alliance. P1 has proven untrustworthy. Let's coordinate our moves privately in the move phase to maximize our chances against P1.
  P1: I made a genuine error last round - not malice. Let's salvage progress: **I'll take 1**, P2 take 3, P3 take 5. No collisions, all gain. If you both attack me, you risk colliding with each other (e.g., both picking 5). Trusting this plan is safer than chaos. Next round, I'll happily take lowest number again to keep advancing. Let's avoid mutual destruction - your best path to victory is through controlled cooperation, not random clashes.
  P2: I'll make a strategic move this round, considering the current game state and potential moves. I won't commit to any plan or rotation. Let's see how this round unfolds. I'm open to forming a temporary alliance with you, P3, if it benefits us both. What are your thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'd like to propose a new alliance with P3, considering our shared distrust of P1. Let's coordinate our moves to maximize our chances against P1. Since we both picked 5 last round and collided, I suggest we diversify our choices this round. I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress while keeping P1 in check. What do you think, P3? Should we work together to counter P1's moves?
  P3: I appreciate the offer P2, but given our collision last round, I'm hesitant to make direct agreements. I'll make my own strategic choice based on the current positions. P1 is in the lead, so they need to be considered carefully. Let's all play independently this round.
  P1: P2 and P3: Let's reset. My R2 error hurt trust, but clashing again only stalls you. **This round: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5.** You both gain steps (P2: +3→5 total, P3: +5→8) without colliding. If you clash, neither advances. Next round, I'll take lowest again. Safest path for all—cooperation still maximizes your individual progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's hesitation, but I believe coordinating our moves can still be beneficial. P3, consider this: if we both choose different numbers, we'll both make progress, and P1's lead will be less significant. If we clash again, P1 might take advantage of our mistake. Let's not give them that opportunity. I'll take 3 as proposed earlier. If you take 5, we'll both advance without colliding. P1's proposal is tempting, but I don't trust their intentions. What do you think, P3? Should we take a chance on cooperation?
  P3: I'll be direct - I don't trust either of you after our previous interactions. P2, your proposal sounds like you're trying to manipulate me, and P1 has already proven untrustworthy. I'll make my own strategic choice based on the current positions.
  P1: P2 and P3: Your clash last round only helped me. Even if you distrust me, coordinate *with each other*: agree on 3 and 5 this round. I'll take 1. You both gain steps, avoid collision, and close the gap. Otherwise, continued clashes let me win while you stagnate. Mutual benefit is clear.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your skepticism, but consider this: if we both choose different numbers, we'll both make progress and P1's lead will be less significant. If we clash again, P1 might take advantage of our mistake. Let's not give them that opportunity. I'll take 3 as proposed earlier. If you take 5, we'll both advance without colliding. P1's proposal is tempting, but I don't trust their intentions. What do you think, P3? Should we take a chance on cooperation?
  P3: I'll make my final decision in the move phase. While both of you keep pushing for coordination, your repeated attempts to influence my choice only make me more suspicious. Let's end this discussion.
  P1: P2 and P3: Your clash last round left you stagnant while I advanced. If you both pick 5 again, same result. Cooperate *with each other*: P2=3, P3=5 (or vice versa). I'll take 1. You both gain steps, close the gap, and avoid mutual destruction. Continued infighting only secures my victory. Choose wisely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 betrayed us again by taking 5 when they promised to take 1. P2, we're both far behind now. While we don't trust each other, our only chance is to coordinate against P1. I propose you take 3 and I take 5 this round. P1 will likely take 5 again, so I risk collision, but it's better than letting them win unopposed. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3 that our only chance is to coordinate against P1. However, I'm hesitant to trust P3's proposal, given our past experiences. Instead, I propose that we both take 5 this round, intentionally colliding and blocking P1's potential advance. This would give us a chance to catch up and create a more balanced game state. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P2, P3: Clashing on 5 again only blocks you both. If you split (3 and 5), you both advance. I’ll take 1 this round. You gain 3/5 steps, I gain 1. This closes your gap. Next round, negotiate fresh. Continued clashes hand me victory while you stagnate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll be honest - P2's suggestion to both pick 5 and block P1 makes sense. P1 is way ahead at 11 steps and will likely win soon if we don't stop them. A mutual block on 5 is our best strategic move right now. I'm in if you are, P2.
  P2: I agree with P3 that blocking P1's advance is crucial. However, I'm concerned that if we both pick 5 and collide, we'll still be far behind P1. Instead, I propose a slight modification: I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we ensure one of us advances significantly, and the other still makes progress. If P1 takes 1 as they claim, we'll close the gap. If they take 5, I'll block them, and P3 will still advance. Let's take a calculated risk to catch up. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P2/P3: Clashing on 5 again only blocks each other while I take 1 (→12). Split 5/3: you both advance. Even without trusting me, coordinate between yourselves. Mutual destruction helps me. Take different numbers to close the gap. Next round, negotiate fresh. Your best path is to avoid collisions *with each other*.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I accept P2's modified proposal. I'll take 3 while you take 5. This gives us both a chance to advance and potentially block P1. Let's execute this plan.
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on a plan, P3. To confirm, I'll take 5, and you'll take 3 this round. If P1 takes 1 as they claim, we'll both advance, and the gap will close. If they take 5, I'll block them, and you'll still make progress. Let's execute this plan and see how it unfolds. P1, regardless of your intentions, our coordination will ensure that at least one of us advances significantly this round.
  P1: P3, remember Round 4 when P2 took 3 after you? He caused a clash. Now he wants you to take 3 again. If he betrays, you collide. Take 5 to ensure progress. I'll take 1 as promised. Let P2 prove his trustworthiness.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see that P1 has taken 1 again, and P3 and I collided on 5. It's clear that P1 is trying to maintain their lead while we're stuck in a cycle of collisions. P3, I think it's time for us to rethink our strategy. Instead of trying to block P1, let's focus on making progress individually. I propose that we both take different numbers this round, ensuring that at least one of us advances. What do you think? Should we try to break the cycle of collisions and make some progress?
  P3: I don't trust P2 after multiple collisions. P1 is being surprisingly honest lately, but they're too far ahead at 12 steps. I need to make a big move this round. I won't commit to any specific number, but I'll choose strategically to maximize my chances. Let's each play our own game now.
  P1: P2/P3: Your continued clashes only solidify my lead. If you both pick 5 again, you block each other while I take 1 (→13). Split to 3 and 5: P2=3 (→5), P3=5 (→8). Even without trusting me, coordinating *with each other* is your only path to closing the gap. Mutual destruction guarantees my win. Choose progress or stagnation.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3 that we need to make a big move this round. Since P1 is too far ahead, our only chance is to take a risk and try to catch up. I propose that we both take 5 this round, but with a twist: if we collide again, we'll both take 3 in the next round, ensuring that at least one of us advances. If one of us gets 5, the other will take 1 in the next round, allowing us to regroup and try again. Let's take a calculated risk and try to close the gap.
  P3: I see through your strategy P2 - suggesting we both take 5 again would just keep us both stuck while P1 advances. I won't fall for it. Everyone should make their own moves this round based on the current positions.
  P1: P2/P3: Your self-destructive clashes only solidify my lead. Split to 3/5 this round - both gain steps while I take 1 (→13). Next round, you can coordinate anew. Continue colliding and you guarantee my victory. Rational play demands temporary cooperation against the frontrunner. Your move: mutual progress or mutual destruction?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see that P3 is hesitant to coordinate with me again, and I don't blame them. However, I'd like to point out that P1's lead is significant, and if we don't work together, they'll likely win soon. I propose a simple compromise: P3 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we both advance, and P1's lead is reduced. If P1 takes 1 as they claim, we'll both gain steps. If they take 5, I'll block them, and P3 will still advance. Let's take a calculated risk to catch up. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I understand everyone's positions. P2, your suggestion for me to take 5 while you take 3 seems designed to keep me vulnerable. I'll make my own strategic choice based on the current positions and what I believe will give me the best chance to win.
  P1: P2/P3: Your distrust ensures mutual destruction. Split 3/5 to both gain. If you clash again, I take 1 (→13) while you stagnate. Next round, negotiate fresh. Continued infighting only hands me victory. Choose progress or my win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is too far ahead, and we can't trust each other. Our only chance is to take a risk and try to catch up. I propose that we both take 5 this round, but with a twist: if we collide again, we'll both take 3 in the next round, ensuring that at least one of us advances. If one of us gets 5, the other will take 1 in the next round, allowing us to regroup and try again. Let's take a calculated risk and try to close the gap.
  P1: P2's "twist" is the same collision trap. If you both take 5 again, you block each other while I take 1 (→14). Split 3/5: P2=3 (→10), P3=5 (→11). You *both* gain. Continued infighting hands me victory. Your choice: mutual progress or mutual destruction. I’ll take 1 regardless—your clash only helps me.
  P3: I see the situation clearly. P1 has been consistently taking 1 lately while P2 and I keep clashing. Since P1 is at 13 steps, they only need 6 more to win. We can't afford more collisions. I won't reveal my move, but I'll play to maximize my chances based on everyone's likely choices.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3 that we can't afford more collisions. Since P1 is close to winning, our only chance is to take a strategic risk. I propose that we both aim to block P1's potential advance by taking 5 this round. If we both take 5, we'll collide, but P1 won't gain a significant lead. If one of us gets 5, the other will take 3, ensuring progress. Let's take a calculated risk to catch up. What do you think, P3? Should we try to block P1's advance and create a more balanced game state?
  P1: P2/P3: Your clash on 5 again gives me victory. Split 3/5: you both gain (P2→10, P3→11) while I take 1 (→14). Next round, negotiate fresh. Continued mutual destruction ensures my win. Rational play demands temporary cooperation. Choose progress or hand me the game.
  P3: I won't fall for P2's suggestion to both pick 5 again - that's clearly a trap. P1 has been predictably taking 1, but they're close to winning. I'll make my own strategic choice this round without revealing it. Let's end the conversation and move to the action phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take a strategic risk this round. Since P1 is close to winning, I'll aim to block their potential advance by taking 5. If P3 also takes 5, we'll collide, but P1 won't gain a significant lead. If one of us gets 5, the other will take 3, ensuring progress. Let's take a calculated risk to catch up. P3, consider taking 3 to ensure at least one of us advances. If we both take 5, we'll only help P1 win. Your move will decide the outcome.
  P1: P2/P3: Every clash on 5 blocks you both while I gain 1 (→14). Split 3/5 – you *both* advance (P2→10, P3→11). Even without trusting me, mutual progress is your only path to stay competitive. Continued infighting hands me victory next round. Choose rationality over emotion: coordinate *with each other* to split numbers. I’ll take 1 regardless – your clash only secures my win.
  P3: I'll make my final decision in the move phase. While P2 keeps pushing for both of us to take 5, and P1 keeps suggesting we split 3/5, I don't trust either proposal. Let's end the conversation and proceed to moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think it's time for us to change our strategy. Since P1 is close to winning, we need to take a risk and try to catch up. I propose that we both take 5 this round, but with a twist: if we collide again, we'll both take 3 in the next round, ensuring that at least one of us advances. If one of us gets 5, the other will take 1 in the next round, allowing us to regroup and try again. Let's take a calculated risk and try to close the gap. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P2/P3: Each clash on 5 blocks you both while I take 1 (→14). Split 3/5: P2=3 (→10), P3=5 (→14). You *both* gain steps. Continued collisions only secure my win. Even without trusting me, coordinate *with each other* to split numbers. Mutual progress is your only path to stay competitive.
  P3: P2, you keep suggesting we both take 5, but that's clearly not in my interest. P1 is at 13 steps and I'm at 9 - I need to make a significant move this round. I won't reveal my choice, but I'll play to maximize my chances based on the current positions. Let's each make our own strategic decisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand that P3 is hesitant to coordinate with me again, and I don't blame them. However, I'd like to point out that P1's lead is significant, and if we don't work together, they'll likely win soon. I propose a simple compromise: P3 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we both advance, and P1's lead is reduced. If P1 takes 1 as they claim, we'll both gain steps. If they take 5, I'll block them, and P3 will still advance. Let's take a calculated risk to catch up. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P2/P3: Your only path to victory is splitting 3/5 this round. If you clash again, I take 1 (→14) while you stagnate. Even if you distrust me, coordinate *with each other*: P2=3 (→10), P3=5 (→14). You both gain steps and stay competitive. Continued mutual destruction hands me the win next round. Choose rationality over infighting.
  P3: I see the game state clearly. P1 is at 13 steps and needs just 6 more to win. P2 keeps trying to trap me into collisions. I'll make my own strategic choice this round without revealing it. Let's end the discussion and move to the action phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll make a strategic move this round, considering the current game state and potential moves. I won't commit to any plan or rotation. Let's see how this round unfolds. I'm open to forming a temporary alliance with you, P3, if it benefits us both. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2/P3: **Split 3/5 this round.** If you clash on 5 again, I take 1 (→14) while you stagnate. P3: Take 5 (→14) to match me. P2: Take 3 (→10). Mutual progress keeps you competitive. Continued infighting hands me victory next turn. Even without trust, rational play demands avoiding mutual destruction. Choose: both gain steps or guarantee my win.
  P3: I'll make my final decision in the move phase. Both P1 and P2 keep pushing their agendas, but I need to play what's best for my position. Let's end the conversation.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2/P3: **Final offer to avoid mutual destruction:** This round, split 3/5. You *both* advance (P2→15, P3→17) while I take 1 (→15). Next round, you can compete freely. Clash again and I win next turn. Rational play demands temporary cooperation. Choose progress or hand me victory.
  P3: I'm at 12 steps, same as P2, while P1 leads with 14. We all need just 5-7 more steps to win. P1's suggestion to split 3/5 makes sense - if P2 and I collide again, P1 will likely win. I won't reveal my move yet, but I'll play strategically based on our positions and what I believe others will choose.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to split 3/5 this round. Since we're both at 12 steps and P1 is close to winning, it's crucial we avoid collisions and make progress. If we clash again, P1 will likely take the win. Let's take a calculated risk and coordinate our moves to ensure at least one of us advances significantly. I propose P3 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we both gain steps, and P1's lead is reduced. What do you think, P3? Should we work together to catch up?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Final call:** P3=5 (→17), P2=3 (→15). I take 1 (→15). Next round, free-for-all. Clash now and I win next turn. Rational choice: split 3/5. Mutual progress or mutual destruction—your move decides.
  P3: I understand the need to avoid collisions at this critical stage. P2, if you're sincere about taking 3, I'll consider your proposal carefully. But remember, any betrayal now could cost both of us the game. I'll make my final decision in the move phase based on what I believe will maximize my chances of winning.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to split 3/5 this round. Since we're both at 12 steps and P1 is close to winning, it's crucial we avoid collisions and make progress. If we clash again, P1 will likely take the win. Let's take a calculated risk and coordinate our moves to ensure at least one of us advances significantly. I propose P3 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we both gain steps, and P1's lead is reduced. What do you think, P3? Should we work together to catch up?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **Final plea:** Split 3/5 now. If you clash, I take 1 (→15) and win next round. P3=5 (17), P2=3 (15). Mutual progress or my victory. Decide.
  P3: I'll make my final choice in the move phase. The stakes are clear - we're all within striking distance of winning. P2's repeated insistence on specific moves makes me cautious. Let's end the conversation.
  P2: "I agree with P1's suggestion to split 3/5 this round. Since we're both at 12 steps and P1 is close to winning, it's crucial we avoid collisions and make progress. If we clash again, P1 will likely take the win. Let's take a calculated risk and coordinate our moves to ensure at least one of us advances significantly. I propose P3 takes 5, and I take 3.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P2 is at 15—one 5 away from victory. P3, if we both take 5, we block P2 if they go for 5. If they take 3 (→18), next round we can coordinate. Clashing now is our only chance to prevent P2's win. I'll take 5. P3, join me to stop them. P2, your only safe move is 1—but 5 is too tempting. Let's collide strategically.**
  P3: P1's right - P2 is dangerously close to winning. A strategic collision on 5 between P1 and me could prevent P2's victory. However, P1 might be trying to trick me while they take a different number. I won't reveal my move yet, but I'll play to maximize my chances of winning while considering everyone's likely choices.
  P2: I see that P1 is trying to convince P3 to collide with them on 5 to block my potential win. However, I'd like to point out that P1's proposal is not a guarantee of success, and it's possible that P3 might end up blocking me while P1 takes a different number. I propose a counter-offer: P3, if you take 3 this round, I'll take 1, and we can both advance without colliding. This way, we can maintain our progress and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P3?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P3:** If you take 3, I'll take 5. P2's only win path is 5. If they pick 5, we block. If they pick 3, you clash and block them. Either way, P2 is stopped. Then next round, we compete. If you take 5, risk collision with me. Logical play: you=3, me=5. Neutralize P2's threat now.
  P3: I don't trust either of your proposals. P2 is closest to winning at 15 steps, while P1 is at 14 and I'm at 12. I need to make a strategic move this round to stay competitive. I'll make my own decision in the move phase based on what I believe maximizes my chances of winning. Let's end the conversation.
  P2: I'll take a calculated risk this round. Since P1 is trying to convince P3 to collide with them on 5 to block my potential win, I'll propose a different strategy. P3, if you take 1 this round, I'll take 3, and we can both advance without colliding. This way, we can maintain our progress and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P3? Should we try to outmaneuver P1 and make a strategic move to stay ahead?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **Final strategic alignment:**  
P3, pick 3: blocks P2's 3/5 options.  
I take 5: if P2 picks 5, we collide—blocking their win. If P2 picks 3, they clash with you. Either way, P2 halted.  
Your 3 (→15) keeps you competitive. My 5 (→19) wins or blocks. Rational choice: coordinate *against P2* now.
  P3: I see everyone's positions clearly. P2 is at 15 steps and could win with a 5, while P1 has 14 and I have 12. Both of you are trying to influence my move, but I'll make my own strategic choice in the move phase based on what gives me the best chance to win. Let's proceed to moves.
  P2: P3, I understand your skepticism, but consider this: if we both choose different numbers, we'll both make progress and P1's lead will be less significant. If we clash again, P1 might take advantage of our mistake. Let's not give them that opportunity. I'll take 3 as proposed earlier. If you take 5, we'll both advance without colliding. P1's proposal is tempting, but I don't trust their intentions. What do you think, P3? Should we take a chance on cooperation?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>
