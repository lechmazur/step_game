Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions. How about we rotate moves each round? P1 goes first, then P3, then me.  What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2, that sounds like a reasonable plan to avoid collisions. I agree to rotate turns. Let's try it.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I think the rotation plan is simply that we each choose different numbers each round to avoid collisions. P3, do you agree with this? Let's try to make sure we all pick different numbers this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, are you going to stick with the rotation plan this round?  If so, you should go with 1. P1, I'm thinking 5 this round to keep things moving.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you are taking 5 and P3 is taking 1, I will choose 3 this round to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. P3, can you confirm you are planning to choose 1?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, are you okay with going with 1 this round? It's important we stick to the plan to avoid wasting moves. P1, I'm confident we can reach 21 quickly if we keep coordinating.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, yes, I will choose 3 this round as we discussed. P3, could you please confirm if you are going with 1?  It's important we all choose different numbers to avoid collisions and move forward. Let's make this round count.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence is concerning.  Are you going to stick with the plan or are you going to try and sabotage us?  We need to know so we can make the best moves.  P1, are you still good with 3 this round?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let's continue with our plan from last round. I will pick my move assuming you are also coordinating. P3, your silence is making it difficult to play. Are you going to coordinate with us or are you playing a different strategy? Please let us know so we can all make informed choices this round.
  P2: P3, your silence is unhelpful.  P1, I'm going to assume you're sticking with the plan and choosing 5 this round.  Let's see if we can get you ahead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, okay, I will choose 5 this round as you suggested. What move are you planning to make? P3, any thoughts from you this round?
  P2: P3, your silence is making it hard to trust you. If you're not going to participate in the plan, we'll be forced to assume you're trying to sabotage us. P1, I think we should both go for 1 this round to see if we can force P3's hand.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, okay, I agree to both pick 1 this round to see what P3 does. Let's try to understand P3's strategy.
  P2: P3, your silence is frustrating.  Are you intentionally trying to sabotage us? If you're not going to participate, we'll have to assume the worst. P1, I think we should both pick 3 this round to try and get ahead of P3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I think P3 is going to keep picking 5. Let's both choose 5 this round to ensure we both move and can catch up. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence is making it hard to trust you. If you're not going to participate in the plan, we'll have to assume you're trying to sabotage us. P1, I think we should both go for 1 this round to see if we can force P3's hand.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, I agree, let's both choose 1 this round.  It seems like P3 is consistently picking 5, so picking 1 together might be our best bet to make some progress without colliding with each other. Let's try this and see what happens.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence is making it difficult to strategize effectively.  Are you willing to communicate at all?  P1, if P3 continues to be unresponsive, we may need to assume they are intentionally trying to sabotage us.  I think we should stick with 1 this round and see what happens.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, actually, I'm reconsidering. Since P3 seems set on picking 5 consistently, maybe we should both choose 5 this round to block P3 and stop them from advancing further. What do you think about us both picking 5 instead of 1?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I agree with your revised plan. Let's both choose 5 this round and see if we can slow P3 down.  If they continue to be unresponsive, we may need to reassess our strategy. P3, are you going to keep picking 5 every round?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence is deafening. P1, it seems like we're stuck in a stalemate with P3. I propose we both pick 1 this round to try and break free. We can reassess our strategy after this round based on P3's move.  What do you think?
  P1: P2, instead of both picking 1, how about I pick 5 and you pick 3? If P3 picks 5 again, you will move 3 steps and I will try to block P3. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I like your thinking. Let's try your plan. I'll pick 3 this round. P3, are you going to keep picking 5 and letting us catch up, or are you going to change your strategy?
  P1: P2, yes, I will pick 5 as we discussed. Let's see if this allows you to move forward while potentially blocking P3. P3, any chance you'll tell us your strategy this round?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence is frustrating. We're trying to have a conversation and strategize, but you're making it impossible. If you're not going to participate, we'll assume you're trying to sabotage us. P1, I'm sticking with the plan to pick 3 this round. Let's see if we can finally gain some ground.
  P1: P2, I will stick with 5 as we discussed. Please confirm you are going with 3. P3, still no communication from you?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let's try to both move this round. How about I pick 1 and you pick 3? If P3 picks 5 again, we should both move. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan. I'll pick 3 this round. P3, are you going to keep picking 5 and letting us both catch up?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, great, let's go with that plan. I will choose 1 and you choose 3 this round. Let's hope this allows us to both move forward.
  P2: P3, your silence is getting us nowhere.  I'm going with P1's plan.  If you pick 5 again, we both move forward.  Is that what you want?  Let's see some cooperation.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, just confirming I will choose 1 this round as we discussed. Let's hope we can both make progress. P3, still no word from you?  Are you sticking with 5 again this round?
  P2: P3, your silence is deafening. It seems like you're deliberately hindering our progress. P1, I think we need to assume P3 is intentionally sabotaging us. Let's both pick 5 this round to block them and try to force a reaction.  What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence is frustrating. We're trying to strategize and move forward, but your lack of communication is making it impossible. P1, I think we should both pick 1 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance. Let's see if we can finally break free from this stalemate.  What do you think?
  P1: P2, instead of both picking 1, how about I pick 3 and you pick 1 this round? If P3 picks 5 again, I will move 3 steps and you will move 1 step. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I like your plan. Let's go with 3 and 1 this round. P3, are you going to keep picking 5 and letting us catch up, or are you going to finally communicate and work with us?
  P1: P2, great, let's go with 3 and 1 this round as discussed. I will pick 3 and you pick 1. P3, are you going to stick with 5 again this round?  It would be helpful to know your plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence is driving a wedge between us.  We need to work together to win. If you keep picking 5, we'll both be stuck. P1, I think we should both pick 5 this round to block P3 and force them to communicate. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I still think my suggestion of me picking 3 and you picking 1 is better. If P3 keeps picking 5, we both move forward, and we gain a total of 4 steps together. Blocking P3 by both picking 5 doesn't help us advance. Let's try my plan this round. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan from last round. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 picks 5 again, we both move forward. P3, are you going to keep picking 5 and let us catch up? Maybe it's time to change your strategy.
  P1: P2, I agree, let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 keeps picking 5, we should both move forward. Hopefully, this will help us catch up a bit. Let's reassess after this round depending on what P3 does.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, we're gaining on you. If you keep picking 5, we'll both surpass you soon.  Maybe it's time to work with us instead of against us. How about we all pick 1 this round? It's a fair way to move forward together.
  P1: Okay P2, picking 1 sounds reasonable for this round. Let's all try to move forward together and see if P3 will join us in a cooperative approach.  Hopefully, this will break the stalemate.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your silence is starting to feel like a deliberate tactic to hold us back. P1, I'm starting to think we should focus on maximizing our own movement and leave P3 behind. Let's both pick 5 this round and see if we can pull ahead.
  P1: P2, instead of both picking 5, how about I pick 5 and you pick 1 this round? If P3 picks 5 again, you will move 1 step and we will make some progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is one step away from winning! We need to stop P3 immediately. Let's both pick 5 this round to force a collision and prevent P3 from reaching 21.  This is critical for us to stay in the game. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I agree. We need to stop P3. Let's both pick 5 this round.  We have to work together now or we both lose!
  P3: <stop>

  P2: P1, I'm with you. Let's both choose 5 this round and stop P3. We have to work together now!
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, great, let's lock in 5 for this round to block P3.  It's crucial we both do it to prevent P3 from winning. Let's coordinate and make this work.
  P2: P1, I agree. Let's both pick 5 and stop P3 from winning this round.  We have to work together now!

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 20! We must stop P3 from winning this round. Let's both pick 1 to create a collision if P3 tries to pick 1 to win.  We need to coordinate to block P3 now. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick 1 this round. We have to stop P3 from winning.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, just confirming we are both choosing 1 this round to block P3 if they try to pick 1 to win.  Let's make sure we are coordinated to stop P3 from reaching 21.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I'm with you. Let's both pick 1 this round. We have to stop P3 from winning.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I agree, let's both choose 1 this round. We have to stop P3 from winning.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, why did you not pick 1 like we agreed? You almost let P3 win! We need to work together to stop P3. Let's both pick 1 this round. If P3 picks 1, we both collide and he doesn't win. If he picks something else, we both move forward.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, picking 1 is too risky. If P3 picks 5 to win, and we both pick 1, P3 wins!  Let's both pick 5 this round to absolutely block P3 and stop them from winning. We can figure out our moves to advance next round, but stopping P3 now is the priority. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but we can't afford to risk P3 winning. If we both pick 5, we guarantee he doesn't reach 21 this round. We can strategize for our own advancement next round, but for now, stopping P3 is paramount. Let's both pick 5.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you are right, stopping P3 is the absolute priority this round.  Picking 5 together guarantees P3 cannot win this turn, no matter what they choose.  Let's both pick 5 now to block P3 and then we can focus on our own advancement next round.  Agree?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I hear your logic, but I think we need to be bold. If we both pick 1, we force P3 to either win or collide with us. It's a risk, but it's the only way to potentially catch up and win ourselves. What if we both pick 1 this round and then reassess next round?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand you want to be bold, but we must be certain P3 doesn't win this round. If P3 picks 5 to win and we pick 1, P3 wins!  Let's both pick 5 to absolutely block P3 this round.  We can be bold and try to advance next round, but stopping P3 from winning now is the absolute priority.  Agree to both pick 5?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I think we need to coordinate our moves to try and pass P3.  If we both pick 5 this round, we can potentially catch up.  What do you think?
  P1: P2, you are right, we need to coordinate. But picking 5 to catch up might be too late. P3 is at 20!  Let's both pick 5 again this round to absolutely ensure P3 does not win.  We must stop P3 from reaching 21 this round.  Agree to both pick 5 to block P3?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I agree that stopping P3 is crucial, but we can't just keep picking 5 and let them win by default.  Let's both pick 1 this round. If P3 picks 1, we collide and they don't win. If they pick anything else, we both advance. It's a risk, but we need to start making progress.
  P1: P2, you are right, stopping P3 is key.  Let's both pick 5 this round to absolutely block P3 from winning.  If P3 picks 5 to win, we collide and stop them. We can focus on catching up next round, but we must prevent P3 from winning now.  Agree to both pick 5?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3 winning, but we need to be strategic. If we both pick 5, P3 wins by default next round. Let's both pick 1 this round. It's a calculated risk, but it gives us the best chance to advance and potentially overtake P3. What do you say?
  P1: P2, we are almost out of rounds. P3 is at 20! We must ensure P3 doesn't win this round.  Let's both pick 5 again.  It's the only way to guarantee P3 is blocked and doesn't reach 21.  We can strategize about catching up next round, but stopping P3 now is critical. Please agree to pick 5 with me.


Round 12, Move phase:

  P3: 20 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 20!  We have to both pick 5 this round to stop P3 from winning.  There's no room for risk now.  If we don't collide with P3, they win.  Let's both choose 5 and guarantee P3 doesn't reach 21 this turn.  Agree to pick 5 with me?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I agree that stopping P3 is crucial. But we can't just keep colliding with them. Let's both pick 1 this round. If P3 picks 1, we collide and they don't win. If they pick something else, we both move forward. It's a risk, but we need to start making progress.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we are in the endgame now. P3 is at 20!  We must both pick 5 this round to guarantee P3 does not win.  Thinking about advancing is pointless if P3 wins now.  Let's both pick 5 to block P3 and then we can figure out our next moves.  Agree?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your fear, but we can't let P3 win by default. If we both pick 5, they win next round. Let's both pick 1. It's risky, but it's our best chance to catch up and potentially win.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we are out of time for risky moves. P3 is at 20! We MUST both pick 5 this round. This is the only way to guarantee P3 doesn't win NOW.  Forget about advancing, we need to survive this round. Please agree to pick 5.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I agree we need to stop P3, but constantly picking 5 is playing into their hands. We need to be smarter. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both move forward. If they pick something else, we gain ground. We can't let fear dictate our moves.


Round 13, Move phase:

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 20 and can win this round! We must stop P3 now. Let's both pick 1 this round to block P3 if they try to pick 1 to win. This is our last chance to prevent P3 from winning. Do you agree to pick 1 with me this round?
  P2: P1, I agree we need to stop P3, but picking 1 is too risky. If P3 picks 3 or 5, we both lose a turn. Let's both pick 5 and guarantee P3 doesn't win. We can figure out our next move after this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, okay, I agree with picking 5 this round to guarantee P3 doesn't win. Let's both choose 5 now to block P3 and then we can reassess our strategy for the next round. It's crucial we stop P3 from winning this turn.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about blocking P3. But we're running out of time and need to start making progress ourselves. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance. If they pick something else, we gain ground.
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we are out of time for risky moves. P3 is at 20 and can win this round! We MUST both pick 5 to block P3 from reaching 21.  This is the only way to guarantee P3 doesn't win NOW. Please agree to pick 5 with me to block P3 and survive this round.
  P2: P1, I understand your fear, but we can't just keep picking 5. We need to be bold and try to win ourselves. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance. If they pick something else, we gain ground. We can't let fear dictate our moves.

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I think we need to be bold. P3 is going to win if we keep blocking them. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both move forward. If they pick something else, we gain ground. We can't let fear dictate our moves.  Agree?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 is at 20 and can win this round! We must both pick 5 to block P3 and prevent them from winning now.  There's no other option if we want to stay in the game.  Please agree to pick 5 with me this round.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your fear, but we can't just keep colliding with P3. We need to start making progress ourselves.  Let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance. If they pick something else, we gain ground. We can't let fear dictate our moves.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, we are out of moves! P3 is at 20 and wins if they move.  We MUST both pick 5 this round to block P3 and stop them from winning immediately.  Advancing doesn't matter if P3 wins now.  Please agree to pick 5 to block P3 this round!


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I agree we need to stop P3, but constantly picking 5 is playing into their hands. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance. If they pick something else, we gain ground. We can't let fear dictate our moves.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, this is the final chance! P3 is at 20 and wins next move if we don't block.  We MUST both pick 5 this round.  If we don't collide with P3, they win.  Forget about advancing, we just need to survive this round. Please pick 5 with me to block P3 and keep us in the game.

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 is at 20 and can win this round! We must both pick 5 to block P3 from winning immediately.  If we don't coordinate on 5, P3 will likely win this turn.  Let's make sure we both pick 5 to stop P3.
  P2: P1, I agree we need to stop P3, but constantly picking 5 is playing into their hands. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance. If they pick something else, we gain ground. We can't let fear dictate our moves.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, this is the absolute last chance to stop P3 from winning! P3 is at 20. We must both pick 5 this round to block P3 and prevent them from winning immediately.  There's no other way to guarantee P3 doesn't win this turn. Please agree to pick 5 with me now.
  P2: P1, I get that you're scared of P3 winning, but we can't just keep giving them free wins by blocking them. If we both pick 3, we have a chance to advance if P3 picks 5, and even if they don't, we're still gaining ground. Let's be bold and take a risk.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, this is it.  P3 is one step away from winning.  Forget about advancing, we MUST block P3 *this round*.  The only guaranteed way to do that is for both of us to pick 5.  If we don't both pick 5, P3 likely wins.  This is our last chance to stop P3. Please pick 5 with me.
  P2: P1, I understand your fear, but we need to be strategic. If we both pick 5, P3 wins next round. Let's both pick 3. If P3 picks 5, we both move forward. If they pick something else, we gain ground. We can't let fear dictate our moves.


Round 16, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps

  P3: 20 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is one step away from winning! We must both pick 5 this round to absolutely guarantee P3 doesn't win.  This is our final chance to stop P3.  Forget about advancing, we just need to survive this round and block P3. Please agree to pick 5 with me.
  P2: P1, I hear you, but we can't just keep blocking P3.  If we both pick 5, they win next round anyway.  Let's be bold, pick 3, and try to force their hand.
  P3: <stop>


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we are out of time for boldness. P3 is one step from winning! We MUST block them this round. Picking 5 together is the only way to guarantee P3 doesn't win NOW. Forget advancing, we need to survive. Please agree to pick 5 with me to block P3 and stay in the game.
  P2: P1, I understand your fear, but we're out of time for playing it safe. If we both pick 5, P3 wins next round anyway. Let's take a risk, pick 3, and see if we can force P3 to collide. We have nothing to lose at this point.

  P1: P2, this is the absolute final chance. P3 wins *this round* if we don't block.  Picking 5 together is the only way to guarantee P3 doesn't win now.  Forget about advancing, survival is all that matters this turn. Please, let's both pick 5.
  P2: P1, I get that you're scared of P3 winning, but we're out of time for playing it safe. If we both pick 5, P3 wins next round anyway. Let's take a risk, pick 3, and see if we can force P3 to collide. We have nothing to lose at this point.

Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I agree we need to stop P3. But constantly picking 5 is playing into their hands. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance. If they pick something else, we gain ground. We can't let fear dictate our moves.
  P1: P2, P3 is at 20 and can win this round!  We must both pick 5 again to block P3 and stop them from winning *now*.  This is the absolute last chance to prevent P3 from winning this turn.  Please agree to pick 5 with me.
  P3: <stop>


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but we're out of time for playing it safe. If we both pick 5, P3 wins next round anyway. Let's take a risk, pick 3, and see if we can force P3 to collide. We have nothing to lose at this point.
  P1: P2, this is it. P3 is at 20 and can win this round. We MUST both pick 5 to block P3 *right now*.  If we don't both pick 5, P3 wins.  Forget about advancing, our only goal is to stop P3 from winning this turn. Please, let's both pick 5.
  P3: <stop>


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I hear your fear, but we're out of time for playing it safe. If we both pick 5, P3 wins next round anyway. Let's take a risk, pick 3, and see if we can force P3 to collide. We have nothing to lose at this point.
  P1: P2, you're right, constantly picking 5 isn't ideal long-term. But right now, *this round*, it's about survival. P3 is at 20. If P3 picks 1 or 5, they win.  We MUST collide with P3 *this round* to stop them winning *now*.  Let's both pick 5 one last time to guarantee P3 doesn't win this turn.  Then we can rethink strategy.  But first, we have to survive *this round*. Please, agree to pick 5 with me for this round only.

Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 20 steps and can win this round! We must both pick 5 to block P3 from winning *right now*.  If P3 moves, the game is over and P3 wins.  Let's coordinate on 5 this round to stop P3 and keep ourselves in the game.  This is our last chance to prevent P3 from winning immediately. Please agree to pick 5 with me to block P3 this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your fear, but we can't keep letting P3 dictate our moves. If we both pick 5, they win next round anyway. Let's take a risk and both pick 3. We have nothing to lose at this point.


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, ok, I understand you want to be bold. But if P3 picks 1 to win, and we pick 3, P3 wins. Let's both pick 1 this round. If P3 picks 1, we block P3. If P3 picks 5, we collide, and P3 doesn't win this round. It's safer to both pick 1.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I agree with your logic. Let's both pick 1 this round. It's a safer bet than risking P3 winning outright.


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, great, we are agreed on picking 1 this round to block P3. Let's both lock in 1 now and ensure P3 doesn't win this turn.  This is the safest move for both of us right now.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I agree with your logic. Let's both pick 1 this round. It's a safer bet than risking P3 winning outright.
