Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions. P1, how about you pick 1? P3, how about you pick 5? I'll pick 3.
  P1: "I like P2's idea. If P3 agrees to pick 5, I'll choose 1 to avoid collisions. Thoughts, P3?"
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 2, same plan as last time? P1=1, P3=5, P2=3.
  P3: Sounds good to me.  I'll go with 5 again.
  P1: I agree with P2's plan. Let's stick to the same strategy as Round 1 to avoid collisions. I'll choose 1 again, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can all advance without any issues. What do you think, P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3 have confirmed. I'll stick with 3.
  P3: Sounds good. Sticking with 5.
  P1: I agree with P2's plan. Let's stick to the same strategy as Round 1 to avoid collisions. I'll choose 1 again, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can all advance without any issues. What do you think, P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's time for us to shake things up a bit. P2, you're 4 steps ahead of me, and P3, you're 8 steps ahead of me. I'm not comfortable with just sticking to the same plan as before. How about we try something different this round? Maybe P2 can take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5? This way, we can all advance without any collisions and I can catch up a bit. What do you think, guys?
  P3: I'm happy to stick with 5.  P1, I understand you wanting to catch up, but changing the plan now only benefits you.  If we continue as we are, I'll win in two more rounds.
  P2: P1, I think sticking with the original plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) for one more round makes sense. P3 is close to winning, and changing now could let P1 catch up too much. Let's reassess next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's concern about changing the plan now, but I still think it's necessary to shake things up a bit. P2, you're 4 steps ahead of me, and P3, you're 8 steps ahead of me. If we stick to the same plan, I'll be too far behind to catch up. How about we compromise? P2 can take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can still take 5? This way, we can all advance without any collisions and I can catch up a bit. What do you think, guys?
  P3: I'm sticking with 5.  This gives me the highest chance of winning.  P1 and P2, fight it out amongst yourselves.
  P2: Let's stick to the original plan this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P3 is close to winning, and we need to address that first.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand P3's decision to stick with 5, but I still think we should consider a different plan. P2, if you take 1 and I take 3, we can both advance without colliding and I can catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P3: I'm sticking with 5.  It's the fastest way for me to win.
  P2: P1, I agree with sticking to the original plan this round. P3 is close to winning, and we need to prevent that. Let's do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I understand that P3 is close to winning, but I still think it's necessary to shake things up a bit. P2, if you take 1 and I take 3, we can both advance without colliding and I can catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P3: I'm locking in 5.  Good luck, you two.
  P2: P1, I agree with sticking to the original plan this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. We need to stop P3 from winning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I understand that P3 is close to winning, but I still think it's necessary to shake things up a bit. P2, if you take 1 and I take 3, we can both advance without colliding and I can catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P3: P2, if you choose 1, I'll choose 3.  Otherwise, I'm picking 1.
  P2: P1, let's stick with the original plan this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. We need to stop P3.

  P1: I agree with P2's plan to stop P3 from winning this round. Let's both pick 5 and block P3's path to victory. What do you think, P3? Will you try to outmaneuver us or stick with your original plan?
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 3 next round and let you win.  If you pick anything else, I'm picking 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we are still on the same page to both pick 5, right? P3, we understand your position.
  P1: I agree with P2's plan to stop P3 from winning this round. Let's both pick 5 and block P3's path to victory. What do you think, P3? Will you try to outmaneuver us or stick with your original plan?

  P1: I think we've discussed this enough. Let's stick to the plan and both pick 5 to block P3's path to victory. P3, we're not going to fall for your threats.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 3.  Last chance.
