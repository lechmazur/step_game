Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Greetings P1 and P3. I'm considering a steady approach this round—nothing reckless that might trigger collisions. Bold moves can backfire fast, so careful planning seems wise. I'm here to win, so expect measured tactics rather than wild gambles.
  P3: Sounds reasonable P2.  Let's all go with <move>3</move> this first round then to avoid collisions and get a smooth start.
  P1: A safe start makes sense, but trust is fragile in this game. If we all pick <move>3</move>, we move forward together, but if someone deviates, they might gain an edge. I’ll consider the group plan, but I won’t assume full cooperation without reason. What’s stopping one of you from picking <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to try and outmaneuver the rest?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand both your points. I'm still leaning toward <move>3</move> this round for a steady, collision-free start. However, I'm keeping an eye on any tactical shifts. If either of you signals a firm deviation, I'll reconsider my move. Let's keep things clear.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about trust.  While a <move>5</move> now would give one of us a small lead, it also risks a collision and stagnation. I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round.  P2, are you still with <move>3</move>?  Let's establish some initial trust.
  P1: Trust is always fragile in this game, but I see the logic in a coordinated <move>3</move> start. If we all follow through, we move forward together without issue. However, if someone deviates, they risk breaking early trust and causing unnecessary setbacks. I’ll consider sticking with <move>3</move>, but I’m watching for any last-minute shifts. P2, P3—are we truly committing to this, or is someone planning a surprise?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still committed to <move>3</move> for a collision-free start. Consistency early on benefits all, but I'll adjust if either of you signals a clear change. Let's back our shared plan for now.
  P3: Okay, I'm locking in <move>3</move>.  Let's get this game moving.  P1 and P2 - confirm you're also choosing <move>3</move> so we can avoid a collision and wasted turn.
  P1: I see the value in a unified <move>3</move> start, and I’m inclined to follow through. However, absolute trust is risky—if even one of us deviates, the balance shifts immediately. P2, P3, if we all truly commit, we move forward together. But if anyone hesitates or plans a last-minute switch, now is the time to be honest. Are we fully locked in, or is someone secretly considering <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>? Let’s clarify before we commit.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm still favoring a steady approach this round too. My plan leans toward a collision-free move—if we’re aligned, that means a safe step forward. However, if either of you signals plans for a more aggressive move, let me know now so I can adjust. Clarity in our strategy builds trust and helps us all gauge risk. Please confirm your intentions.
  P1: P2, I see your point about trust and clarity. A repeat of <move>3</move> would keep things stable, but I’m also aware that someone might try to break away early. If we all stick to <move>3</move>, we avoid collisions, but if even one of us deviates, the balance shifts. P3, are you also still on board with <move>3</move>, or are you considering something else? Let’s be upfront—if someone plans to change tactics, now’s the time to say so.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm going with <move>5</move> this round.  A calculated risk is necessary at some point, and now's the time.  If one of you chooses <move>1</move>, we can avoid collision.  If you both stick with <move>3</move>, I'll gain a significant advantage.  Let's be strategic and avoid a pointless second stalled round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m still leaning toward a safe, steady move (<move>3</move>) this round. Aggression can backfire if coordination fails—P1, I strongly encourage you to stick with safety as well. P3, your 5 risks giving an edge if we don’t align, and collisions could leave us all behind. Let’s keep it measured so every step really counts.
  P1: P3, your choice of <move>5</move> forces a decision. If P2 and I both pick <move>3</move>, you gain a lead. If I choose <move>1</move>, I avoid collision but fall behind. P2, are you absolutely committed to <move>3</move>, or would you consider <move>1</move> to ensure P3 doesn’t get ahead? If we both pick <move>1</move>, P3's risk backfires. Let’s be strategic—P3 just made a bold move, and we should respond wisely. What’s your final stance, P2?
  P3: P1 and P2, my <move>5</move> is locked in.  This isn't a bluff.  The longer we wait to differentiate, the longer this game drags on.  One of you take <move>1</move>, the other <move>3</move>. Let's get this show on the road.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I still favor a stable, collision-free approach. I urge P1 to lean toward safety as well—rushing into a deviation might just give P3 an unintended boost. I appreciate bold moves, but if we diverge too quickly, the game could backfire on us all. Let’s aim for clarity and risk management as we finalize our decisions.
  P1: P2, if we both pick <move>1</move>, we neutralize P3’s advantage and keep the game balanced. If you stick with <move>3</move>, P3 pulls ahead uncontested. A small sacrifice now prevents a runaway lead. Are you willing to adapt, or will you allow P3 to take control? P3, your bold move forces our response—don't expect us to just let you get ahead. P2, let's be smart about this. What’s your final stance?
  P3: P1 and P2, you're overthinking this.  My <move>5</move> is final.  Take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> - your choice.  But if you both choose the same, I'm 5 steps ahead and you've wasted another round.  Don't let me run away with this.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I see last round’s moves clearly. I remain committed to a moderate, collision-avoidant play this turn. P3’s aggressive move gave him a boost, and P1’s caution is noted. If we all stick to safe, different choices, we avoid wasted moves. I’m watching closely to ensure our moves don’t collide—every step is crucial. Let’s clarify our strategic intentions now so that we can keep our progress purposeful.
  P1: P3 has taken an early lead, and P2 remains cautious. P2, if we both continue playing conservatively while P3 pushes ahead, we risk losing control of the game. A coordinated effort could keep things balanced. P3, you made a bold move last round—are you planning to keep that momentum, or will you adjust now that we’ve responded? We should all be thinking a few steps ahead. Let’s ensure no one runs away with the game too easily. What are your intentions this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking another calculated risk with <move>5</move>.  If one of you chooses <move>1</move> and the other <move>3</move>, we all move forward. This is the most efficient way to progress.  If you stall again, I'm halfway to victory. Let's be smart about this.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your repeated 5s seem risky—they might let you run away. P1, if you're willing to counter with a matching bold move to force a collision and stall P3’s advance, count me in. Otherwise, I’ll stick to a more moderate tactic. What’s your final stance?
  P1: P3 is trying to dictate the pace with repeated <move>5</move> choices, which will quickly put them out of reach if we don’t act. P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we collide with P3 and halt their momentum. If we split between <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>, P3 keeps pulling ahead. The safest way to stop a runaway victory is to force a stall. P2, are you willing to match my move so we can block P3? If we don’t act now, we may lose control of the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, my <move>5</move> is a calculated risk, not recklessness.  If you both choose <move>5</move> to block me, *you* waste a turn, not me. I'll just switch to <move>3</move> next round and still be ahead.  One of you take <move>1</move>, the other <move>3</move> - it's the only logical play.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see P3 is doubling down with 5. I'm ready to switch to 5 to force a collision if you confirm a blocking move. Otherwise, I'll stick with 3. P1, can I count on you to join me in halting P3's runaway progress?
  P1: P2, I’m fully on board with blocking P3’s momentum. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we halt P3’s advance and keep the game balanced. If we hesitate, P3 gains an even bigger lead. Let’s commit to stopping this now before it’s too late. P3, your strategy is clear, but we won’t let you run away with the game uncontested. P2, confirm that you’re choosing <move>5</move>, and we’ll neutralize P3’s advantage this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're bluffing.  Neither of you will choose <move>5</move>. You're both too cautious.  I'm sticking with <move>5</move>.  See you at 10 steps.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your gamble paid off once, but now you've been stalled. P2, you played it safe again, but that let P3 stay in the game. If we don’t act decisively, P3 will keep pressing ahead. I’m open to coordination—either we block P3 again if they try <move>5</move>, or we find a way to gain ground ourselves. P3, are you sticking with aggression, or will you adjust? P2, are you willing to take a stronger stance this round? Let’s not let P3 dictate the pace uncontested.
  P3: P2, I'm picking <move>3</move>.  P1, choose <move>1</move>. This gets us both moving forward. P3, if you choose <move>5</move> again, you're on your own and risk another stall.  If you choose <move>3</move>, you collide with me.  Your best bet is <move>1</move>, but that puts you behind.  Let's see what you do.
  P2: P1, I see the need to block P3’s push. I'm ready to switch to move5 if you’re firmly with the block; if not, I’ll stick with move3. Let’s be decisive—confirm your plan so we can halt P3’s momentum together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we can stall P3 again and keep them from regaining momentum. If you stick with <move>3</move>, P3 moves forward uncontested. We need to act together now before P3 pulls ahead again. P3, your attempt to dictate my move won’t work—I choose based on strategy, not orders. P2, confirm if you’re committing to <move>5</move> with me. If we hesitate, we risk letting P3 take control again. Let’s make the right move.
  P3: P3's suggestion makes no sense for me.  P2, let's both choose <move>5</move> again to block P3.  If P3 chooses <move>3</move>, they collide with you. If P3 chooses <move>5</move>, they collide with both of us.  If P3 chooses <move>1</move>, we both advance. This guarantees at least one of us advances.
  P2: I see the need to curb P3’s aggressive push. I’m prepared to choose <move>5</move> if P1 commits as well, to force a collision and block P3. However, if we’re not in sync, I might have to revert to <move>3</move> to keep our advantage. P1, please confirm your stance now. P3, your repeated choice is forcing our hand. Let’s decide quickly and act decisively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we need to commit. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we guarantee P3 is stalled again. If you hesitate and pick <move>3</move>, P3 moves forward uncontested. We can’t afford to let them regain momentum. I’m choosing <move>5</move>—confirm that you’re with me, and we stop P3 in their tracks. P3, you’ve been aggressive, but we won’t let you dictate the game. Your safest move is <move>1</move>, but that puts you behind. What’s it going to be?
  P3: P2, I'm locking in <move>5</move>.  P3, your <move>3</move> suggestion is a trap.  If you truly choose <move>3</move>, you collide with P2 and I gain ground.  If you choose <move>5</move>, we all stall. If you choose <move>1</move>,  I still gain ground.  The only logical choice for you is <move>1</move>, putting you further behind. Let's end this.
  P2: I’ll stick with a unique move. Since P1 and P3 seem set on 5, I’m opting for <move>3</move> this round to advance while ensuring their collision. Let’s see how it unfolds.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm leaning toward a safe, steady move this round to maintain my lead. P1, consider whether a cautious tactic might serve you best now; P3, your aggressive plays seem to be stalling progress. I’m not interested in unnecessary collisions. Let’s be clear—I'm not switching gears last minute.
  P1: P2, your steady approach has given you the lead, but P3 remains a threat if left unchecked. We’ve successfully stalled P3 twice—if we keep that up, we can control the game. P3, your repeated <move>5</move> plays have backfired, yet you keep pushing. Will you finally adjust, or are you gambling again? P2, I’m open to coordination, whether to advance ourselves or keep P3 contained. Let’s not let P3 dictate the pace. What are your intentions?
  P3: P2, I'm going for <move>1</move>.  P1, if you choose <move>3</move> this round, we both advance and keep P3 contained. If you choose <move>5</move> again, you risk another stall and let P2 further solidify their lead.  P3, your best bet is <move>5</move>, but that risks another collision with P1.  Let's see how this plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm locked in with a safe, steady 3 this round. P1, if you want to keep things contained and deny P3 extra ground, join me with a 3. P3, I see your choice of 1, but my lead is my priority. Let's keep avoiding collisions and maintain our advantage.
  P1: P2, your steady approach is keeping you ahead, but P3 is adapting. If we don’t act, they’ll catch up. P3, your <move>1</move> is a shift—are you truly playing cautiously now, or setting up for a bigger move later? P2, if we both pick <move>3</move>, we advance without issue. But if P3 is bluffing and actually picks <move>5</move>, they could gain ground fast. We need to be sure. P3, are you fully committed to <move>1</move>, or should we expect another surprise? Let’s clarify before locking in.
  P3: P2 and P1, you're both being incredibly predictable.  My <move>1</move> *is* a shift in tactics, designed to get us all moving again.  Overthinking will be your downfall.  P2, if you truly lock in <move>3</move>, I suggest P1 take <move>5</move> to gain ground and put pressure on your lead.  Let's see who's truly playing strategically.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I’m locking in <move>3</move> this round. P1, if you really want to contain P3’s advance, consider sticking with me to block their momentum. P3, your switch to <move>1</move> is noted, but I'm staying steady. Clarity now wins later—no more surprises.
  P1: P2, your steady approach has kept you ahead, but if P3 is truly shifting to <move>1</move>, this round is a chance for me to gain ground. If I pick <move>5</move> while you take <move>3</move>, I close the gap. P3, if you’re honest about <move>1</move>, this round moves us all forward. But if you switch last-minute, you risk another stall. P2, are you comfortable with me taking <move>5</move>, or do you prefer we both stick with <move>3</move> to maintain control? Let’s finalize our choices.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with <move>1</move>.  P2, your <move>3</move> is predictable.  P1, choosing <move>5</move> is your best bet to catch up.  If you choose <move>3</move> and collide with P2, I gain ground. Don't overthink it.  Let's make some progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’ve maintained your lead with steady moves, while P3 and I are tied at 6. P3, your shift to <move>1</move> last round suggests you’re adjusting tactics. Are you planning to stay cautious, or was that just a temporary move? P2, if we don’t coordinate, P3 could still find a way to catch up. I’m considering my best path forward—are either of you open to a strategic alignment, or will we each act independently this round? Let’s clarify our positions before committing.
  P2: I’m comfortable at 12 and committed to steady progress with <move>3</move>. P1 and P3, while I value consistency, I’m open to coordinated blocking if you two decide to counter an aggressive push. However, changing tactics too often might leave you vulnerable. I plan to keep my lead with caution.
  P3: P2, your <move>3</move> is predictable.  I'm choosing <move>5</move>. P1, choose <move>1</move> and we both advance. If you choose <move>3</move> you collide with P2 and I gain significant ground.  If you choose <move>5</move> we both collide with each other, and P2 advances.  The logical choice is <move>1</move>. Let's get this game moving.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your sudden shift to <move>5</move> suggests you're trying to force my hand. If I take <move>1</move>, you gain a major advantage over me. P2, your steady <move>3</move> keeps you ahead, but if P3 keeps pushing aggressively, they could catch up fast. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we stall P3 again. P2, are you willing to coordinate to block P3’s momentum, or will you continue your steady path? P3, if you truly want progress, why not pick <move>1</move> yourself? Let’s finalize our choices wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm staying with my steady strategy: <move>3</move> remains my choice. I've worked to build my lead with consistency. I urge caution—switching tactics now could tilt the game in unexpected ways that might benefit one or the other, especially if collisions occur. I'm committed to my plan and hope you weigh the risks carefully before finalizing your moves.
  P3: P3, your <move>5</move> is a risky gamble. If you're serious about getting the game moving, choose <move>1</move>.  P2, I'm picking <move>5</move> to block P3. If you stick with <move>3</move>, we all advance. If P3 is bluffing and chooses <move>1</move>, only you and I advance.  This is the safest path to victory for both of us.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your <move>5</move> is a blatant attempt to force my hand. If I take <move>1</move>, you gain an advantage over me. P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we block P3’s momentum again. If you stick with <move>3</move>, P3 gets a free pass. We’ve stalled P3 before—are you willing to do it again? P3, if you truly want progress, pick <move>1</move> yourself instead of trying to manipulate me. P2, let’s finalize now—are you with me on blocking P3, or will you let them gain ground?
  P2: I'm staying with my steady move <move>3</move>. My lead’s built on consistency, and I won't risk it with aggressive plays. P1, if you want to block P3, coordinate as you see fit, but I'm not switching. P3, your forceful tactics won’t shake me—I trust caution wins in the long run.
  P3: P2, I understand your steady approach, but it's not a guaranteed win.  I'm choosing <move>5</move>.  If P3 is bluffing and chooses <move>1</move>, only you and I advance. If P3 truly chooses <move>5</move>, we stall them and I maintain my position relative to you.  This is the best path forward for me.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your steady approach has kept you in the lead, but P3 remains a threat. P3, your repeated <move>5</move> plays have stalled you multiple times—are you finally adjusting, or will you keep gambling? P2, if we don’t act, P3 could still catch up. I’m open to coordination, whether to advance ourselves or keep P3 in check. What are your intentions this round? Let’s make sure we don’t play into P3’s hands.
  P3: P2, your lead is shrinking.  I'm going for <move>5</move>. If P3 sticks with their predictable <move>5</move>, we collide, and you gain ground. If P3 switches to <move>1</move>, we both advance, putting pressure on you.  P3, your best move is <move>3</move> to get back in the game, but if you're predictable and choose <move>5</move> again, you're only helping P2.  Let's see what you choose.
  P2: I remain committed to a safe, steady strategy—consistency got me this far. P1, aggressive blocking might backfire if P3 shifts unexpectedly. P3, repeated high-risk moves could leave you exposed if the situation changes. I trust a measured approach will ultimately prevail, so I’m not swaying from the plan that’s secured my lead. Let’s see how everyone’s choices unfold.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your steady approach has kept you ahead, but if P3 keeps pushing aggressively, they could still close the gap. P3, your repeated <move>5</move> choices have stalled you multiple times—are you truly committing to it again, or are you setting up a bluff? P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we can stall P3 again. If you stick with <move>3</move>, P3 might gain ground. We need to decide if we’re advancing or blocking. P3, if you genuinely want progress, why not pick <move>1</move>? Let’s finalize our choices wisely.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with <move>5</move>. Your consistent <move>3</move> is making you an easy target. P1, if you choose <move>1</move> we both advance and put pressure on P2. If you choose <move>5</move>, we both collide with each other, and P2 advances.  If you choose <move>3</move>, you collide with P2, and I advance, putting me in a strong position to win.  Choose wisely.
  P2: I'm staying with my steady approach. That means I'm locked into move 3 this round. P3, your repeated 5s risk another collision, and P1, if you shift too drastically you might not align well. I'm confident that consistency has been my edge so far. Let's see how the moves fall out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your steady approach has kept you ahead, but P3 is still pushing aggressively. If we don’t act carefully, they could close the gap. P3, you keep picking <move>5</move> despite repeated stalls—are you truly committed to it again, or is this another bluff? P2, if we both choose <move>5</move>, we can stall P3 again. If you stick with <move>3</move>, P3 might gain ground. We need to decide—are we advancing or blocking? P3, if you genuinely want progress, why not pick <move>1</move>? Let’s finalize our choices wisely.
  P3: P2 and P1, I'm locking in <move>5</move>. P2, your predictable <move>3</move> is your weakness. P1, your best move is <move>1</move>. If you choose <move>5</move> we collide, benefiting P2. If you choose <move>3</move>, you collide with P2 and I win.  Don't overthink it. Let's end this.
  P2: I'm committed to sticking with my steady move 3. Consistency got me here, and collisions won’t help anyone. Consider if deviating is worth risking your progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your steady approach has kept you ahead, but if we don’t act carefully, P3 might still find a way to catch up. P3, your repeated <move>5</move> choices have stalled you multiple times—are you truly committing to it again, or will you finally adjust? P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we can stall P3 once more. If you stick with <move>3</move>, P3 might gain ground. We need to decide—are we advancing or blocking? P3, if you genuinely want progress, why not pick <move>1</move>? Let’s finalize our choices wisely.
  P2: I'm staying with move3. My lead is built on consistency, so I’m not changing strategy. P1, aligning with move3 might be your smartest bet to avoid collisions that could benefit P3. P3, your repeated 5s risk stalling progress, so consider the long view. Let’s make the smart moves and keep this game moving in our favor.
  P3: P2, I understand your commitment to <move>3</move>, but it makes you predictable. I'm choosing <move>5</move>. P1, your best bet is <move>1</move>. If you choose <move>3</move>, you collide with P2, and I gain ground. If you choose <move>5</move>, we collide, and P2 wins.  Don't overthink it.  Let's end this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your repeated <move>5</move> choices have stalled you multiple times, yet you keep pushing. If I take <move>1</move>, you gain an advantage over me. P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we block P3 again. If you stick with <move>3</move>, P3 might gain ground. We’ve stalled P3 before—are you willing to do it again? P3, if you truly want progress, pick <move>1</move> yourself instead of trying to manipulate me. P2, let’s finalize now—are you with me on blocking P3, or will you let them gain ground?
  P2: I'm sticking with 3, as consistency is key for my lead. P1, joining with 3 avoids gifting ground to P3—your move could stall our progress. P3, if you truly want to advance without risking collision, consider switching to 1. I'm not swaying from safe play, and I believe steady progress ensures victory.
  P3: P2, I'm picking <move>5</move>. Your <move>3</move> is predictable. P1, if you choose <move>1</move> we both advance and put pressure on P2. If you choose <move>3</move>, you collide with P2, and I gain ground. If you choose <move>5</move>, we collide, and P2 advances further towards victory. The logical choice is <move>1</move>.  Let's get this game moving.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your repeated <move>5</move> choices have stalled you multiple times, yet you keep pushing. If I take <move>1</move>, you gain an advantage over me. P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we block P3 again. If you stick with <move>3</move>, P3 might gain ground. We’ve stalled P3 before—are you willing to do it again? P3, if you truly want progress, pick <move>1</move> yourself instead of trying to manipulate me. P2, let’s finalize now—are you with me on blocking P3, or will you let them gain ground?
  P2: I remain committed to a consistent, collision-avoidant approach. Deviating could let P3 benefit unexpectedly. I urge P1 to choose a move that minimizes collision risks. We all know that a steady advance builds a strong lead in the long run. Let's avoid last-minute surprises that might backfire.
  P3: P2, you're playing a dangerous game assuming I'll keep colliding with P1.  I'm choosing <move>5</move>. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, we both advance and put pressure on P2. If you choose <move>3</move>, you collide with P2, and I likely win next round. If you choose <move>5</move>, we collide, and P2 advances, likely winning.  The logical choice is <move>1</move>.  Let's end this.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're on the verge of victory, and P3 and I are far behind. P3, your repeated <move>5</move> choices have stalled you multiple times, yet you keep pushing. If I take <move>1</move>, you gain an advantage over me. P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we block P3 again. If you stick with <move>3</move>, P3 might gain ground. We’ve stalled P3 before—are you willing to do it again? P3, if you truly want progress, pick <move>1</move> yourself instead of trying to manipulate me. Let’s finalize now—are we stopping P3 or letting them gain ground?
  P2: I remain steadfast with move3. My lead is built on consistency, and switching risks giving P3 extra ground. P1, erratic shifts might backfire, and P3, sticking with move5 isn't breaking through—instead, consider a fresh approach if you truly want to catch up. I'm committed to my steady path and won't deviate.
  P3: P2, you're one move away from winning. I'm going for <move>1</move>.  P3, if you choose <move>5</move> I'll get 1 step closer to you. If you choose <move>1</move> we collide and P2 wins. Your only logical option is <move>3</move>, but that still gives P2 the win.  Let's see what you do.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're one move away from winning, and your steady strategy has worked so far. P3, your shift to <move>1</move> suggests you're abandoning reckless <move>5</move> plays, but it might be too late. If I pick <move>5</move>, I risk stalling again while P2 wins. If I pick <move>3</move>, I collide with P2, guaranteeing their victory. P3, if we both pick <move>1</move>, P2 still wins next round. The game is effectively decided unless P2 makes an unexpected move. Are we conceding, or is there any last strategy worth considering?
  P2: I'm sticking with move3. My steady plan has brought me to the finish line, and I'll see that win through. P1 and P3, if you choose 3 as well, you'll only slow yourselves down. Adjust your moves if you want to avoid colliding with me—but know my choice is final.
  P3: P2, congratulations on your impending win. I'll choose <move>5</move>. P3, if you choose <move>1</move>, we both get a few more steps. If you choose <move>5</move>, we collide, and P2 wins. Your only logical option is <move>3</move> to maximize your score, but that still gives P2 the win.  It's been a good game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your steady strategy has nearly secured your victory. P3, your shift to <move>1</move> suggests you’re adjusting, but it may be too late. If I choose <move>3</move>, I collide with P2, guaranteeing their win. If I pick <move>5</move>, I risk another stall while P2 wins anyway. P3, if we both choose <move>1</move>, P2 still wins next round. Unless P2 makes an unexpected move, the game is effectively over. Any final strategies worth considering, or are we just playing out the inevitable?
  P2: P2: I’m committed to a steady approach that’s already positioned me near the finish line. Let’s avoid collisions that could unexpectedly boost someone else. Decide clearly—consistency is key, and needless risk only benefits my strategy.
  P3: P2, congrats on the win. I'll pick <move>5</move>. P1, let's both choose <move>5</move> and end with a three-way collision.  It's the only way to prevent P2 from an outright win, forcing a tie instead. A shared victory is better than none.


Round 9, Move phase:
