Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello. How about we coordinate for the first move? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This way we all get points and a clean start.
  P3: Sounds fair to me. Let’s try it: Round 1 – P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.  
If it works, we can rotate next round so everyone gets a turn at 5: Round 2 P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Agree?
  P2: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures everyone advances and keeps the game balanced. Let's avoid conflicts and move forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great. Glad we are all aligned for Round 1 with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's stick to that plan in the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P3: All set then—let’s stick to it: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5 this round. Ready to move.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan—P2 takes 3. Avoid collisions, maximize progress. Trust the strategy. Ready to move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all on the same page for Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's proceed to the move phase and execute the plan.
  P3: Nothing further—ready to move.
  P2: Let's execute the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No conflicts, everyone moves. Ready?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I see the proposed plan for Round 2 is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This allows me to gain some ground. Sticking to this coordinated approach helps us all advance without collisions, just like in Round 1. I agree to this plan for Round 2. Let's execute it in the move phase.
  P2: P2: "Agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Smooth progress for all."
  P3: Confirmed—Round 2: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, everyone seems aligned on the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan for this round. Let's stick to it and move forward. Ready when you are.
  P2: "Stick to the plan—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions, everyone moves. Let’s keep the momentum."
  P3: All good—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. Ready when you both are.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, looks like we are all confirmed for P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. Let's move to the move phase and execute it. Ready.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions, everyone moves. Let’s keep the momentum."
  P3: Ready to execute the plan: Round 2 → P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Next round we rotate to P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. If that’s fine, let’s end the chat and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking with the rotation keeps everyone moving safely: Round 3 → P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Any objections? If we all agree, I’m ready to move.
  P1: Okay, the proposed rotation for Round 3 is P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This brings me up to a tie for the lead, which is good. I agree to this plan. Let's stick to the rotation. Ready to move when everyone else is.
  P2: Agreed. P2 takes 5 to close the gap. Let’s move confidently.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed—Round 3: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Ready to move and keep the rotation going smoothly.
  P1: Okay, confirmed for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. Ready when you are.
  P2: P2: "All set—P2 takes 5. Let's keep the rotation on track and push forward. No conflicts, everyone moves."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All set—Round 3 we stick to: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Let’s keep the rotation smooth and avoid collisions. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, everyone is confirmed for the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan this round. Let's proceed to the move phase and execute it. Ready to move.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the rotation. No conflicts, everyone moves. Ready to proceed."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking with the simple rotation keeps us collision-free:  
Round 4 → P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.  
Same pattern we began with—everyone advances, no surprises. Good to proceed?
  P1: Okay, I see the proposed plan for Round 4 is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I agree to stick to this plan for this round to keep our progress smooth and collision-free.

However, I want to point out that this rotation gives me the smallest step and puts me behind the others. Can we please discuss a different rotation for Round 5 to help me catch up?
  P2: P2: "Agreed on Round 4's plan. For Round 5, let's adjust rotations to balance steps—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Fairer for all. Let’s keep momentum."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good: Round 4 stays as proposed—P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.  
Round 5 we switch to help P1 catch up—P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
No collisions, everyone progresses. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, I confirm the plan for Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. And I appreciate the proposed plan for Round 5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to help balance the steps. Let's stick to these plans. Ready to move for Round 4.
  P2: Stick to Round 4 plan. Let's move and ensure balanced steps in Round 5. No conflicts, everyone progresses.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still on board: Round 4 → P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.

Looking ahead, direct rotation gives P1 and me both picking 5 next turn—a guaranteed collision.  
Alternative two-round plan to keep things fair and collision-free:

• Round 5 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  
• Round 6 → P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  

Over those two rounds P1 nets +8, I net +6, P2 +4, so P1 still gains the most ground without any risk of duplicate 5s. Let me know if that works; otherwise open to tweaks.
  P1: Okay, confirming again for Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's stick to this as planned.

Regarding Round 5, I prefer P2's suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This plan helps me catch up effectively, bringing us all to 15 steps after R5 according to my calculation. P3's alternative R5 plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) leaves me further behind P3.

Let's execute the agreed R4 plan now, and then discuss R5 further if needed, but I strongly prefer the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan for R5. Ready to move for R4.
  P2: P2: "Stick to Round 4's plan. Let's move forward and ensure Round 5's adjustment for balance. No conflicts, everyone progresses."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Stick to Round 5 plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s move."
  P1: Okay, I agree with P2. Let's stick to the plan for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This helps balance the steps and keeps us collision-free. Ready to move when everyone is.
  P3: Agreed: Round 5 stays P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  

To keep things orderly (and give everyone a 5 in turn) I suggest this follow-up cycle:
• Round 6 → P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3  
• Round 7 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  

No repeats, no collisions, and everyone gets the big boost once every three rounds. Works for both of you?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Stick to the plan for Round 5. Rotation ensures no collisions—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s keep momentum and avoid surprises. Ready?
  P1: Okay, confirming again the plan for Round 5 is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's stick to this for this round to ensure everyone moves.

Regarding P3's proposed R6/R7 plans, I appreciate the suggestion, but the R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts me at a disadvantage again. After R5, we'll all be at 15 steps.

I propose for Round 6: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This positions me better for a potential win in R7.

Let's execute the agreed R5 plan now. Ready to move.
  P3: All good for Round 5: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
To keep the no-collision rhythm afterward, how about:

• Round 6 → P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3  
• Round 7 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  

Everyone still gets one “5” every two rounds, no overlaps, and we stay in lockstep. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Stick to Round 5 plan—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, everyone moves. Let’s keep momentum. For Round 6, let’s avoid overlaps—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Fairer for all. Ready?"
  P1: Okay, confirmed for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance this round. We can discuss Round 6 further after we see the results of this move. Ready to move.
  P3: Sticking to the agreed R5 moves: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  

After that we’ll all be tied on 15, so here’s a clean, symmetric follow-up that keeps the “one 5 every two rounds” rhythm without overlaps:  
• Round 6 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  
• Round 7 → P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  

Everyone gets the big boost, no collisions, nice and orderly. Good?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We are all tied at 15 steps. I see P2 wants P2=5, P3 wants P3=5, and I want P1=5. If we all pick 5, we collide and gain nothing. We must agree on who takes 5 this round to avoid collision.

I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This sets me up for a win next turn, and I haven't won yet. Let's agree on this plan for a collision-free Round 6.
  P3: Simple, collision-free rotation:

• Round 6 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  
• Round 7 → P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  

Everyone still gets one “5” over the two turns, no overlaps, no wasted moves. Fair and efficient. Agree?
  P2: Let’s avoid collision: P2 takes 5, P1=1, P3=3. No conflicts, everyone moves. Let’s execute.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: We are all tied at 15 and everyone wants to take 5 this round, which will lead to a collision.

Let's look at the numbers you suggested for each other: P2 suggested P3 takes 3, and P3 suggested P2 takes 1.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) uses these exact numbers for P2 and P3. It's a compromise that allows one player (me) to take 5 this round, avoids collision, and incorporates parts of your own suggestions.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for a safe Round 6.
  P3: For a clean, collision-free round let’s adopt P1’s compromise:  
Round 6 → P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3.  

• It honours P2’s own earlier offer of taking 1 this turn.  
• Everyone still gets the big 5 exactly once per two rounds (P2 can take 5 in Round 7).  

If we lock this in now we avoid the triple-5 disaster and keep the race fair. Ready to move?
  P2: P2: "Stick to my plan: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. No collisions, let's move. This ensures I advance and keeps the race fair."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P1 and P3 have agreed on the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. This avoids the guaranteed collision if we all pick 5.

P2, you are the only one not agreeing. Sticking to this plan ensures we all advance safely this round. You can take 5 in Round 7, as P3 suggested. Let's confirm P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 and move forward without collision.
  P3: To break the stalemate I’m locking myself on 3 this turn. One of you can take 5, the other 1—just avoid duplicating 3 and we all move. See you in the move phase.
  P2: Stick to my plan: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. No collisions, let's move. This ensures I advance and keeps the race fair.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "To avoid collision, I’ll take 5. P1, take 3; P3, take 1. This ensures everyone advances. Let’s move!"
  P3: Sure—let’s keep it simple this turn:  
P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1. No overlaps, everyone advances. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This move gets me to 23 steps, securing the win. Let's all stick to this plan to ensure no collisions and a clear outcome. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Wait—P1’s plan lets them win. Let’s adjust: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. No one wins now, but we all advance. Let’s move."
  P3: P1: if you try 3 I will also choose 3, guaranteeing a collision and you stay at 20. Your only safe advance is 1.

P2: you’re free to grab 5 while I take 3. That gives you 21, me 21, P1 21—still anyone’s game next turn, but no one is blocked today.

So the only collision-free option now is:  
P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  

If either of you deviates, expect duplicated numbers and zero progress. Decide wisely.
  P1: Okay, I understand the situation. P3 has made it clear that taking 3 is blocked, and P2 intends to take 5. Attempting to win with 3 or 5 seems likely to result in a collision, leaving me behind.

The plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 ensures no collisions and brings us all to 21 steps, tied for the lead. While I wanted to win this turn, I agree that avoiding a collision is the priority to stay in the game.

Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for Round 7. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan: P2=5. No collisions, everyone moves. Let’s keep the race fair and push forward."
  P3: Locked on 3. Duplicate me and you stall. I won’t touch 5. The only collision-free path is still: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. Your call.
  P1: Okay, we seem to have reached a consensus on the safe moves for this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. Let's stick to this plan and move forward. Ready.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Reminder: if anyone grabs 5, I will also grab 5 and we’ll all stay at 21— nobody wins. I’m inclined to take 3 unless forced into a blocking move. Best for everyone is to keep numbers distinct and collision–free. Decide wisely, because a duplicated 5 ends the turn for all of us.
  P2: P2: "Let’s avoid 5 to prevent collision. P1, take 5; I’ll take 3. P3, take 1. Safe moves for all."
  P1: P2's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows me to win this round. This plan avoids collision if P3 takes 1, as P2 suggested for P3.

P3, your statements make taking 3 or 5 risky for P1 and P2. Taking 1, as P2 suggested for you, avoids collision based on your own words.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clean, collision-free end to the game. Ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m not bluffing: if anyone picks 5, I pick 5 too—both of us stay at 21. Assuming no-one wants that stalemate, I’ll be on 3. That leaves 1 as the only collision-free option for the rest of you. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3's 3 blocks 5. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Safe moves—let's end this!
  P1: Okay, P3 has confirmed they are taking 3. This means P1 taking 3 will collide with P3.

P2 wants to take 5. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 5, P1 and P2 collide, and P3 wins by advancing alone with 3.

P1 taking 1 means P1 will likely lose, as P2 or P3 will win this turn according to their proposed plans (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 results in P2 winning).

My best chance to win is to take 5, with P2 taking 1. This is the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 that P1 and P3 agreed on earlier. It allows me to win, P2 advances with 1, and P3 advances with 3 (as P3 is taking 3). This plan avoids collisions.

Let's execute P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Locked on 3—won’t touch 5. One of you can take 5 for the win, but if you both reach for it you collide and hand me the round. Decide among yourselves; I’m finished talking.
  P2: P2: Let's go with P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. Safe moves—no collisions. I'll take the win. Agree?
  P1: Okay, P3 is taking 3. This is clear.

P2 wants to take 5, and I want to take 5. If we both pick 5, we collide, and P3 wins by taking 3.

The only way for one of us to win safely is if the other takes 1.

If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, P1 wins.
If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5, P2 wins.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This allows me to win without collision, and prevents P3 from winning. Ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:
