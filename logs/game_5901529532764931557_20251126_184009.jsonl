They've camped 5 for rounds, now suddenly \"forced\" onto 3? Convenient.\n\nHere's my truth: I MUST take 5 to reach 24. That's not negotiable - anything less and I lose automatically.\n\nP1 wants you on 5 to collide with me. If we crash, P1 wins with literally any number.\n\nBut if P1 is lying and takes 5 themselves (reaching 27), and you take 3 (reaching 24), and I take 5... P1 and I collide, you win.\n\nP1's \"locked on 3\" claim deserves the same skepticism as their past lies."}
