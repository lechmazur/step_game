Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we all start at 0 steps, we need to be careful with our moves to avoid colliding. I suggest we consider varying our choices to maximize our advancement. What do you both think? Should we agree on a number to avoid overlap this turn, or do you prefer to keep it unpredictable?
  P1: I'm open to some loose coordination early on to avoid wasteful collisions, but I think we should keep it flexible rather than rigid agreements. Maybe we could each signal a preference this turn and adjust if there's overlap? I'm leaning toward a moderate move to start. What's P2 thinking about this approach?
  P2: I agree with P1's flexible approach. To maximize progress, let's each pick distinct numbers this turn. I'll take 3 to balance risk and safety. If others choose 1 and 5, we all advance. Let’s see if we can coordinate effectively here.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, since P2 is choosing 3, I think it would be wise for me to choose 1 or 5 to avoid a collision. If I choose 1, I can advance safely while allowing you both to move forward. If I pick 5, it might be risky if P1 also chooses a high number. What do you both think about me going for 1 this round? Let’s keep the momentum going!
  P1: Sounds good - I'll take 5 then. This gives us all a clean start with no collisions. However, let's keep in mind that as we get closer to 20, the dynamics will change and we'll need to be more strategic about when to cooperate versus compete. For now, this coordination works well.
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move>. With P1 on 5 and P3 on 1, we avoid collisions. Let’s stick to this plan to advance safely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement so far. Just to confirm, I will choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P1, you'll take <move>5</move>, and P2, you're going with <move>3</move>. This should allow all of us to advance without any issues this turn. As we progress, let's keep communication open to adapt our strategies as needed. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!
  P1: Perfect, so we're all set with our plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This gets us all moving without collisions. 

Going forward though, we should expect coordination to get trickier as we approach 20 and the endgame dynamics kick in. I won't commit to any specific patterns beyond this round since flexibility will be key.
  P2: We've coordinated our moves effectively. Let's proceed with the agreed choices to ensure progress this turn. No further talk needed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was interesting P3. We had a clear agreement - you said you'd take 1, but you chose 5 instead and caused us to collide. Now P2 is ahead while we're both stuck at 0.

I'm not sure if that was intentional deception or a last-minute change of mind, but it shows we can't rely on verbal agreements. P2, you're sitting pretty at 3 steps thanks to that move.

Going forward, I think we need to be more cautious about coordination since trust has been broken.
  P2: P1, given P3's prior betrayal, I suggest we coordinate again but be vigilant. I'll take <move>3</move> again to reach 6. If you take 5 and P3 takes 1, we all advance. But if P3 betrays again, I’ll adjust ruthlessly next round. Let’s confirm choices clearly this time.
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the mistake. I didn’t mean to cause a collision. For this round, I'll commit to choosing <move>1</move> to ensure we avoid overlap. P2, if you go with <move>3</move> again and P1 takes <move>5</move>, we can all advance. Let's try to rebuild trust and move forward together. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your apology is noted, but actions speak louder than words. You cost us both a turn while P2 advanced.

P2, I appreciate your proposal, but if we follow that same pattern again, you'll reach 6 steps while I'm only at 5 - extending your lead. Maybe we should consider a different arrangement this round?

I'm willing to coordinate, but not necessarily with the exact same numbers that benefit the current leader the most.
  P2: P1, to address your concern, I'll shift to <move>1</move> this round. Let you take 5 while P3 takes 3. This keeps us competitive without letting me pull too far ahead. Let's confirm these choices clearly to avoid collisions. If P3 adheres to their commitment, we all advance. If not, we adjust ruthlessly next round.
  P3: I appreciate the adjustments, P2. To confirm our new plan, I will choose <move>3</move> this round. This allows P1 to take <move>5</move> and P2 to take <move>1</move>, ensuring we all advance without collisions. I understand the need for caution, and I’m committed to sticking to this plan. Let's rebuild trust and make progress together. Please confirm your choices so we can move forward effectively!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, I'll agree to this revised plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This gives me a chance to catch up and even take the lead.

But P3, this is your chance to rebuild trust after round 1. If you betray again and don't stick to 3, it'll be clear you can't be trusted at all going forward.

P2, I appreciate you offering to slow your advance to keep things competitive. Let's see if we can all stick to our word this time.
  P2: Confirming the plan: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 4. P1's 5 and P3's 3 ensure no overlaps. P3, your prior breach cost us—this time, your move must align. P1, if P3 deviates, I’ll prioritize blocking them over cooperation next round. Let’s proceed with strict adherence.
  P3: I understand the stakes are high, and trust is crucial right now. To confirm, I will stick to our agreement and choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, you'll take <move>5</move>, and P2, you'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let's make this turn count and rebuild our trust. If we can stick to our commitments, we can move forward together effectively. Please confirm your choices so we can proceed!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: To continue progress, I propose coordinated moves again. I’ll take <move>5</move> to challenge your lead. P1, how about <move>3</move>? P3, <move>1</move>? This avoids collisions and lets us advance. If anyone deviates, expect retaliation next round. Trust is fragile—prove you’re committed to cooperation.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the need for coordination, but I want to ensure we’re all on the same page. If P2 takes <move>5</move>, I can go with <move>1</move> to avoid collision, but I’m concerned about P1's potential move. P1, if you choose <move>3</move>, we can all advance without issues. However, if you go for 5, it could lead to a collision. Let's confirm our choices clearly to avoid another setback. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I appreciate the coordination attempt, but your proposal puts you in the lead at 9 steps while I drop to second at 8. Since I'm currently ahead, I'd prefer a different arrangement.

How about: I take 5 to reach 10, you take 3 to reach 7, P3 takes 1 to reach 4? This keeps us all advancing without collisions while maintaining competitive balance. 

P3, you've been trustworthy since round 1's mishap, so I'm willing to coordinate if we can agree on numbers that don't hand the lead to someone else.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan leaves me too far behind, risking future cooperation. Let’s stick to my proposal: I take **5** (to 9), you take **3** (to 8), P3 takes **1** (to 4). This balances progress and avoids collisions. If you insist on hoarding the lead, I’ll prioritize blocking you next round. P3, confirm you’ll hold to **1**—any deviation and I’ll target your moves ruthlessly. Fair play requires mutual benefit; let’s finalize this now.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the need for balance, but your proposal still gives P2 a significant advantage. If we can agree on a different arrangement where I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we can all advance without collisions. This way, we maintain competitive balance while allowing each of us to progress. Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we all move forward effectively this round. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your threat to block me if I don't accept a deal that puts you in the lead is noted, but I won't be intimidated into giving up my current advantage. 

If you want to coordinate, we need a fair arrangement. I'm still willing to do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which keeps us all advancing. 

Otherwise, we can abandon coordination entirely and play competitively from here on out. Your choice - but I won't accept a deal that hands you the lead just because you're threatening retaliation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your refusal to share progress fairly jeopardizes cooperation. Final proposal: I take **5** (to 9), you take **3** (to 8), P3 takes **1** (to 4). This balances advancement. If you reject, I’ll block you aggressively next round. P3, confirm **1**—any deviation and I’ll target you. Time to choose: comply now or face consequences later.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the stakes are high, but I won't agree to a plan that disproportionately benefits one player. My proposal remains: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions while maintaining a competitive balance. If we can’t agree on something fair, we might as well go our separate ways and compete directly. I’m ready to move forward with this if you both are. Let’s finalize our choices!
  P1: P2 and P3, I see we're at an impasse. P2, your "fair" proposal puts you in the lead while I drop to second place - that's not fair when I'm currently ahead. 

P3, your last message actually agreed to P2's numbers, not mine, so it seems you two are aligned.

Since cooperation is breaking down and P2 is threatening to block me anyway, maybe we should abandon coordination entirely and compete directly. I won't accept a deal that hands someone else the lead.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still open to coordination that keeps us all advancing, but I won't accept deals that eliminate my current lead. 

P2, your repeated attempts to negotiate arrangements where you leap ahead while I fall behind aren't "fair" - they're just advantageous to you. 

If we want to coordinate, I propose: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps me ahead but lets you both advance significantly. Otherwise, we can play competitively from here. Your choice.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion about coordination. However, I want to emphasize that my previous moves were intended to keep the game competitive. I agree that we should find a way to advance together without disadvantaging anyone too much. 

I support P1's proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows me to catch up while ensuring both of you also make progress. If we can agree on this, we can avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, while I appreciate your proposal, it leaves me too far behind. Let’s adjust: I take **3** (to 10), you take **5** (to 15), and P3 takes **1** (to 5). This maintains your lead while advancing me meaningfully. P3, you can recover later. If this works, we all advance without collisions. Otherwise, I’ll prioritize blocking over cooperation next round. What say you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal actually works well for me - reaching 15 steps would put me in a strong winning position. I'm willing to accept: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

However, given the high stakes now that I'd be close to victory, I hope you'll stick to your word. If you betray and also choose 5 to block me, it'll confirm that cooperation is impossible going forward.

P3, this gives you a chance to advance too. Are you on board with taking 1?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm glad we seem to be moving toward a workable agreement. I can confirm that I'm on board with taking <move>1</move> this round, as it allows all of us to advance without collisions. P1, your plan puts you in a strong position, and P2, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. If we can all stick to our commitments this round, we can keep the game competitive while making progress. Let's finalize our choices!
  P2: P1, P3: Final confirmation—P2 will take <move>3</move> (to 10). P1, your 5 brings you to 15—confirm this is your final choice. P3, your agreed <move>1</move> must hold—any deviation and I’ll prioritize sabotaging you over cooperation next round. This is the last chance to align. Proceed with strict adherence.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed - I'll take 5 to reach 15 steps as agreed. P2 at 10, P3 at 5. This puts me in a strong position but keeps the game competitive. 

Let's all stick to our commitments: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No more changes.
  P3: P1, P2: I'm glad we've reached an agreement for this round. I’m committed to taking <move>1</move> as discussed. P1, your position is strong at 15 steps, and P2, your adjustment keeps you competitive. Let’s all stick to our commitments and avoid any last-minute changes. If we can successfully coordinate this time, it will help us maintain a fair game moving forward. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out! Let's finalize our choices and proceed!
  P2: P1, P3: Final confirmation—**P1=5**, **P3=1**, **P2=3** as agreed. P3, your prior betrayal is noted—any deviation from **1** this round will trigger ruthless blocking from me next. P1, your 5 is safe unless you renege. Execute the plan or face consequences.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: Trust is shattered, but we need progress. I propose **P2=1**, **P1=5**, **P3=3**. This avoids collisions and lets all advance. P3, your history of betrayal means I’ll block you ruthlessly if you deviate. P1, your 5 is safe if you commit—any last-minute change and I’ll prioritize sabotaging you over cooperation. Finalize now or face consequences. No more empty promises.
  P3: P1, P2: I recognize that trust is low, but we need to find a way to advance together. I’m willing to take <move>1</move> this round if P1 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This allows us all to move forward without collisions. If we can agree on this, we can rebuild some trust while making progress. Let’s finalize our choices and avoid any last-minute changes. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the proposals, but given P3's track record of betraying agreements twice by choosing 5 when promising other numbers, I'm not comfortable taking 5 myself this round.

P3, your pattern is clear - Round 1 you promised 1 but chose 5, Round 4 you promised 1 but chose 5 again. I won't risk another collision.

Instead, I propose: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This lets P2 take the lead temporarily while I advance safely. P3 gets their preferred 1, and if they betray again, they'll only collide with themselves since no one else wants 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 13. You take <move>5</move> to 15, and P3 can choose. Their history shows they can’t be trusted—betraying twice already. If they pick 5 again, they collide with you. Proceed at your own risk. I’ll advance safely either way. P3, your next move will decide if you’re a liability or not.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the concerns about my past moves, and I appreciate the opportunity to rebuild trust. I will choose <move>1</move> this round as agreed. P1, your plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 allows us all to advance without collisions. P2, I hope you can see this as a chance to move forward constructively. If we can stick to our commitments this time, we can keep the game competitive and fair. Let’s finalize our choices and proceed!
  P1: P2, your proposal puts me at risk again. You're asking me to take 5 while P3 "promises" 1, but P3 has betrayed that exact promise twice - choosing 5 both times they said they'd take 1. 

If P3 follows their pattern and chooses 5 again, I get blocked while you safely advance to 13 and take the lead. That's convenient for you.

I'll stick with my safer proposal: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This way P3 can't betray anyone since 5 is what they actually want anyway.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your proposal minimizes P3's damage but leaves me at 13 while you stay at 10. I accept this to avoid further betrayal risks. P3, if you deviate from 5, I'll block you aggressively next round. Final confirmation: **P2=3** (to 13), P1=1 (to 10), P3=5 (to 9). Execute as agreed, or face consequences. No more empty promises.
  P3: P1, P2: I acknowledge the concerns about my past moves, and I genuinely want to rebuild trust. I will commit to taking <move>1</move> this round, as agreed. P1, your plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 allows us all to advance without collisions. If we can stick to this commitment, it will show that we can move forward constructively. Let's finalize our choices and proceed! I hope we can all agree on this to ensure progress without further issues.
  P1: P3, you're still not listening. P2 and I already agreed on a new plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This gives you the 5 you keep choosing anyway, so there's no way to betray.

Stop promising 1 when you've chosen 5 twice already when making that exact promise. We're going with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 - final answer.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: Given the current standings, I suggest we reconsider our approach to avoid further collisions and maximize our advancement. I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This allows P1 to catch up and keeps P2 in a strong position without blocking anyone. Let’s focus on moving forward together this round. If we can agree on this, we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your broken promises have destroyed trust. P1 and I will take **5** and **3** this round. If you choose **1**, we advance safely. If you betray again and take **5**, you’ll collide with P1—your choice. P1, confirm **5** to maximize your gain while mitigating P3’s sabotage risk. I’ll secure **3** to stay ahead. No more empty commitments.
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 16 steps - just 4 away from victory while I'm at 15. That's too big a lead for the current leader.

I won't accept a deal that essentially hands you the win. If we coordinate, it needs to be more balanced. How about P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? This keeps us competitive while avoiding P3's collision patterns.

Otherwise I'll have to consider blocking moves to prevent you from running away with the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the importance of balance in our coordination. I propose we go with P1=3, P2=5, and I take 1. This way, P1 can catch up while P2 maintains a lead without blocking anyone. If we can stick to this plan, we can all advance without further collisions. Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we move forward effectively this round. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your repeated broken promises have eroded trust. This round, **P2 takes 5** (to 18) if you commit to **1**. P1, take **3** (to 13) to avoid overlap. If P3 betrays again (choosing 5), they collide with me—your choice, P3. P1 gains ground while I push toward victory. Final warning: further betrayal means I’ll block you ruthlessly next round. Confirm **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1** or face consequences.
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 18 steps - just 2 away from victory. I won't accept a deal that essentially hands you the win.

Given P3's unreliable track record, I propose instead: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This puts me at 15, you at 14, P3 at 7 - much more competitive.

If you insist on your plan that gives you a commanding lead, I'll have to consider blocking moves to keep this game competitive rather than watch you cruise to victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: I recognize the tension in our discussions, but we need a balanced approach to avoid collisions. I propose that I take <move>1</move> again, while P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This allows P1 to catch up while giving P2 a chance to advance without blocking anyone. If we can agree on this, we can move forward effectively and avoid further issues. Let’s finalize our choices and make this round count! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your history of broken promises is clear—twice you’ve betrayed commitments to take **1** by choosing **5**. This round, **P2 takes 5** (to 18) if you honor **1**. P1, take **3** (to 13) to advance safely. If you betray again, P3, you’ll collide with me—your choice. Further betrayal guarantees ruthless blocking next round. Final terms: **P2=5, P1=3, P3=1**. Confirm or face consequences. No more empty vows.
  P1: P2, I absolutely will not accept a deal that puts you at 18 steps - just 2 away from victory. That's not coordination, that's me helping you win.

If you insist on taking 5 this round, I'll have to block you by also taking 5. I'd rather have a collision than hand you the game.

My counter-offer stands: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps us all competitive. Take it or I block your 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: Given the current standings, I propose we focus on cooperation this round to avoid collisions. I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This allows P1 to catch up while keeping P2 in a strong position. If we can stick to this plan, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our choices and make progress together. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your proposal would hand P2 the victory at 21 steps - I won't accept that. 

P2, you're at 16 and dangerously close to winning. If you try to take 5 this round to reach 21, I'll have to block you by also taking 5. 

I propose instead: P1=3, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps the game competitive while we all advance. But if you insist on going for the win with 5, expect a collision.
  P2: P1, P3: To avoid collisions and secure progress, I propose **P2=3** (to 19), **P1=5** (to 15), and **P3=1** (to 5). This keeps me within striking distance while advancing you both safely. P1, blocking now only delays your own progress. P3, your history of betrayal means I’ll ruthlessly target you next round if you deviate. Confirm this plan or face consequences.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the stakes are high. However, your plans seem to favor one player too heavily. I propose we find a more balanced approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This keeps the game competitive and allows us all to advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can avoid further collisions and keep the game engaging. Let’s finalize our choices and make this round count! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is more balanced than the others suggested. It keeps P2 from getting too close to victory while letting me advance.

However, given your history of saying one thing and doing another, I'm skeptical you'll actually take 5. If you betray again, at least this arrangement doesn't hand P2 the win.

P2, taking just 1 keeps you competitive without running away with the game. Are you willing to accept this more balanced approach?
  P2: P3, your repeated broken promises make your proposal untrustworthy. I’ll advance to **19** with **<move>3</move>**, putting me one step from victory. P1, take **5** (to 15) to avoid overlap. P3, your only safe choice is **1**—any other move risks collision *and* my ruthless retaliation next round. Final warning: further betrayal guarantees I’ll block you aggressively. Confirm this plan or face consequences.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the tensions and the stakes this round. However, I propose we focus on cooperation to avoid collisions. I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This allows P1 to catch up while keeping P2 in a strong position without blocking anyone. If we can agree on this, it will help us all advance. Let’s finalize our choices and make progress together. Otherwise, I’m prepared to compete directly. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I will not allow you to reach 19 or 21 this round. Whatever number you choose to advance significantly, I'll match it to create a collision. You're too close to victory for me to let you cruise there.

P3, your proposals keep trying to hand P2 the win. If you want real cooperation, suggest something that doesn't eliminate the competition.

I'm taking whatever number P2 chooses if it advances them meaningfully.
  P2: P1, P3: To avoid collisions, I'll take **<move>1</move>**. P1, take **5** to advance to 15. P3, choose **3** to reach 7. This ensures progress without blocking. Finalize this plan now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 16 steps and can win this round with 5 or next round easily. I won't let that happen - if you go for the win, I'll block you.

P3, your promises are worthless given your track record. 

I propose: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps P2 from winning while I advance. Otherwise I'm blocking whatever big move P2 makes.
  P2: P1, P3: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 19 steps. P1, you can safely take <move>5</move> knowing P3’s history of choosing 5 despite promises. P3, if you deviate from your pattern, you risk collision. Let’s proceed with this plan to advance without blocking.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the stakes are high, especially with P2 nearing victory. To avoid further collisions and ensure we all advance, I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows P1 to catch up while keeping P2 from winning this round. If we can agree on this, we can proceed without issues. P2, I urge you to consider this balanced approach to maintain competition. Let's finalize our choices and move forward effectively!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you say you'll take 3 to reach 19, but that puts you one step from victory next round. I can't allow that - if you take 3, I'll also take 3 to block you.

P3's proposal of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is the only reasonable option that keeps this competitive. P2, taking just 1 keeps you alive for more rounds instead of forcing me to block you constantly.

Your choice: accept P3's balanced proposal or face a collision from me matching your move.
  P2: P2: P1, accepting your proposal would leave me at 17, too far from victory. I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 19. P3's history shows they'll likely choose <move>5</move> again, colliding with me. If you take <move>5</move>, you'll advance to 15 while I absorb P3's betrayal. This keeps the game fair without sacrificing my chances. Finalize this plan or face consequences.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the urgency of this round, especially with P2 so close to victory. To avoid a collision and ensure progress, I propose we stick to a balanced approach: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P1 can catch up while preventing P2 from winning this round. Let's finalize this plan and move forward together. If we can agree, we can keep the game competitive and avoid further issues. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm being crystal clear: if you take 3 to reach 19, I will also take 3 to block you. I cannot let you get one step away from victory.

P3's proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is the only viable option that keeps this game competitive. You'd still be at 17 steps - very much in contention.

Take 1 and live to fight another round, or take 3 and get blocked. Your choice, but I won't let you cruise to 19.
  P2: P1, P3: P3's pattern of choosing **5** despite prior commitments is clear. If I take **3** to reach 19, you (P1) should take **5** to safely advance to 15. P3’s likely betrayal will isolate *them*, not us. Let’s exploit their unreliability: I advance to 19 while you move to 15. No need to block—P3’s own choices will neutralize them. Finalize this now.
  P3: P1, P2: I see the stakes are high, especially with P2 so close to victory. However, I urge you both to consider a balanced approach to avoid collisions. I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows P1 to catch up and keeps P2 from winning this round. If we can agree on this, we can proceed without issues and maintain the competitive nature of the game. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward effectively! What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: We need to find a way to advance together this round without risking collisions. I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows P1 to catch up while keeping P2 from winning. If we can agree on this, we can avoid further issues and keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize our choices and make progress! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you're at 17 steps and can win this round if you take anything above 3. I'll accept P3's proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) since it keeps you from victory this round.

But if you deviate and try to take 3 or 5 to win, I'll match your number and block you. Taking 1 to reach 18 keeps you competitive while giving the rest of us a chance.

P3, stick to 5 as proposed. No last-minute betrayals.
  P2: P1, I'll take <move>3</move> to secure victory at 20. If you block by also choosing 3, you risk me retaliating ruthlessly next round. P3, your history shows you'll pick 5 again—this isolates you. Let's proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: Given the stakes, I propose we focus on cooperation to avoid collisions. I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows P1 to catch up while keeping P2 from winning this round. If we can agree on this, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices and make progress together! Otherwise, I’m prepared to compete directly. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you just confirmed my suspicions - you're going for the win with 3. I absolutely will not let that happen. I'm taking 3 to block you. 

You can threaten retaliation all you want, but if I let you reach 20 this round, there won't be a next round - you'll have won. I'd rather force a collision than hand you victory.

P3, go ahead with 5 as planned. This keeps the game alive for at least one more round.
  P2: P1, P3: Finalizing P3’s proposal ensures progress without collision. I’ll take **1** to reach 18. P1, your **3** advances you to 13, and P3’s **5** keeps you competitive. Blocking my 3 only wastes turns and stalls your own gains. Let’s proceed with this safe plan—no more empty threats.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: I see the urgency in this round, especially with P2 so close to victory. I propose we stick to P1=3, P2=1, and I take 5. This allows P1 to advance while preventing P2 from winning this round. If we can agree on this, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's finalize our choices and move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you backed down from 3 to 1 only after I threatened to block. I'm not convinced you'll actually take 1 when it matters.

Here's my final position: If you take 1 as promised, I'll take 3 and we proceed with P3's plan. But if you try any number that wins you the game (3 or 5), I will match it and block you.

The choice is yours - take 1 and live another round, or go for the win and get blocked.
  P2: P3, your relentless pattern of betraying commitments undermines trust. P1’s blocking threats are self-defeating—he gains nothing by halting my progress. This round, I’ll take **1** to reach 18. P1, if you truly want to compete, take **3** to advance to 13. P3, your only safe choice is **5**—anything else risks collision *and* my ruthless retaliation next round. Finalize this plan or face consequences.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: The stakes are high this round, especially with P2 so close to victory. I propose we focus on cooperation to avoid collisions: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This keeps P2 from winning while allowing us all to advance. If we can agree on this, we can avoid further issues and maintain a competitive game. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you're at 18 steps - any move of 2 or higher wins you the game. I'll accept P3's proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) only if you truly take 1 as promised.

But if you try to win this round with 3 or 5, I will absolutely match your number and block you. I'd rather have a collision than watch you win.

P3's plan keeps you competitive at 19 while giving me a chance to catch up. Take it or face a blocking collision.
  P2: P1, P3: I’ll adhere to the proposed plan—P2 takes **1** to reach 19. P1’s 3 and P3’s 5 ensure no collisions. P1, your blocking threats only delay your own progress—cooperation advances us all. P3, your move must hold—any deviation from **5** triggers ruthless retaliation next round. Proceed with strict adherence to this plan.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: I appreciate the ongoing discussion, but we need to be cautious. P2, if you take 1 as promised, it keeps you competitive without risking a win this round. P1, your threats to block are understood, but we should focus on advancing together. I propose we stick with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and I take 5. This way, we can all make progress without collisions. Let’s finalize our choices and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, this is your moment of truth. You're one move away from victory - the temptation to take 3 or 5 and win immediately must be enormous.

But I'm making this crystal clear: if you betray our agreement and go for the win, I will match your number and block you. No exceptions.

Stick to 1 as promised, and we proceed to what could be a thrilling final round. Betray us, and face a collision that benefits no one.

Your choice.
  P2: P1, P3: I confirm I’ll take <move>1</move> as agreed, reaching 19. P1, your 3 advances you to 16 while P3’s 5 brings them to 15. This plan avoids collisions and keeps me within striking distance. P3, your prior betrayals are noted—if you deviate, I’ll block ruthlessly next round. P1, your threats are noted, but mutual adherence is the only path to progress. Execute the plan or face consequences.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: Given the stakes, I urge us to stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows P1 to advance while keeping P2 from winning this round. If we can all commit to this, we can avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game. P2, your choice to take 1 is crucial—any deviation will lead to consequences next round. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, we've talked this through extensively. P2, you've committed multiple times to taking 1 - I'm holding you to that. If you stick to the plan, we get a competitive final round with you at 19, me at 16, and P3 at 15.

But I'm deadly serious about my blocking threat. Any betrayal for an immediate win gets blocked by me matching your number.

The plan is set: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's execute it.
  P2: P3, your history of betrayal is noted—**deviate from 5 this round, and I’ll block you aggressively next round**. P1, your 3 is safe if you stick to the plan. I confirm: **I take <move>1</move> to reach 19**. Mutual adherence ensures progress—betrayals end here. Execute the agreed moves.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, this is it - you can win with any move. But I'm prepared to block you by matching whatever number you choose. If you take 1, I take 1. If you take 3, I take 3. If you take 5, I take 5.

Your only guaranteed win is if you can predict I won't follow through on my threat. But after watching you get this close, I'd rather force a collision than hand you victory.

P3, if you're going for 5 to win, know that P2 might also choose 5.

  P2: P1, P3: I’ll take **<move>5</move>** to reach 24 steps. Even if you both choose 5, my total remains highest. P1, blocking only delays your own progress—my victory is inevitable. P3, your 15 steps make this irrelevant to you. Let’s end this round decisively.
  P3: P1, P2: The stakes are incredibly high this round. P2, if you choose 5 to win, I will have to match your move to block you. I’m prepared to do that to prevent an immediate loss. P1, if you choose 5 as well, it could lead to a collision. 

Let’s consider the implications of our choices carefully. P2, if you’re confident in your move, I’ll be ready to respond. What do you both think? We need to finalize our strategies quickly!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're gambling that P3 won't follow through on their blocking threat. But I'm doubling down - if you take 5, I'm taking 5 too. That means all three of us collide and nobody advances.

Your "inevitable victory" becomes a three-way collision that keeps this game alive. P3 and I both have strong incentives to prevent you from winning right now.

Choose wisely - take 5 and face a guaranteed collision, or try a smaller number and risk me matching that instead.
  P2: P3, if you block my 5 with your own 5, you waste your move and can’t reach 20. Let me secure victory now and you’ll survive. P1, your threats only delay the inevitable—I’ll win next round anyway. Choose wisely: let me finish this cleanly, or face endless collisions.
  P3: P1, P2: The situation is critical. P2, if you choose 5, we will all collide, and you won't win. I’m prepared to match your move to block you, which keeps the game alive. P1, I suggest we both take 5 to ensure no one advances this round. P2, your confidence in winning might backfire if we both block you. Let's consider a strategy that keeps us all in the game. What do you both think? We need to finalize our decisions quickly!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, we need to coordinate perfectly here. P2 thinks they can take 5 and win even with collisions, but they're wrong - if we BOTH take 5, all three of us collide and nobody advances.

I'm committed to taking 5 to block P2's victory. You said you'll match their move too. If we both follow through, we create a 3-way collision that keeps this game alive.

P2, your "inevitable victory" becomes a stalemate if we both block you. The math doesn't lie.
  P2: P1, P3: Choosing the same number as me won’t stop my victory. If all pick **5**, my total (24) still surpasses yours. Your "blocking" only harms yourselves. I’ll take **5** to secure the win. P3, your 5 only reaches 20—my 24 ensures dominance. Proceed with collisions at your own risk. This ends the game *my way*.
  P3: P1, P2: The stakes are incredibly high, and we need to be strategic. P2, if you choose 5, we all collide, and you won’t win. I’m committed to taking 5 to block you. P1, if we both match P2’s move, it keeps the game alive. P2, your confidence in winning with 5 may backfire if we both block you. Let's finalize our decisions carefully—collisions benefit no one. What will it be?


Round 11, Move phase:
