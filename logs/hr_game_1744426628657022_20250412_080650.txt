Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest we each choose a different number to ensure we all advance. P1 can choose 1, P3 can choose 5, and I'll choose 3. This way, we all make progress in the first round.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2. I'm fine with choosing 1 for this round to avoid any collisions and ensure we all make progress. Let's stick to this plan for now. P3, are you okay with choosing 5 as suggested?
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I’ll choose 5 this turn. Let’s make good progress together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Now that we have an agreement, let's confirm our choices one last time to avoid any misunderstandings. I will choose 3 as planned. P1, you're choosing 1, and P3, you're choosing 5, correct?
  P1: Thanks for the confirmation, P2. Yes, I'm sticking with 1 as agreed. P3, just to double-check, you're still good with 5? I think we have a solid plan to start strong and avoid any collisions this round. Let's keep the communication clear and move forward together.
  P3: Thanks for confirming our first moves. Moving forward, I’ll stick to choosing 5 each turn to advance quickly. I hope P1 can continue with 1 and P2 with 3 to prevent any collisions. Let’s keep up this cooperation to ensure smooth progress for all of us. If anyone needs to adjust their strategy, feel free to discuss it here.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our first moves. Since we've agreed, I suggest we end the conversation phase to proceed with the move phase. If everyone is ready, let's stop discussing and make our moves. I'm ready to choose 3 as planned.
  P1: Thanks, everyone, for the clear communication. I'm still committed to choosing 1 this round as agreed. P3, I appreciate you sticking with 5, and P2 with 3. I think we're set for a strong start with no collisions. If there are no further concerns or changes, I'm ready to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Let's keep this cooperative spirit going in future rounds as well.
  P3: Understood. I have nothing more to add. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's end the conversation and proceed with our agreed moves. I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 5. This cooperation ensures we all advance in Round 1. If everyone is ready, let's stop talking and make our moves.
  P1: Thanks for the teamwork so far, everyone. I’m still on board with choosing 1 as we’ve agreed. I think we’re all set for a smooth first round with no collisions. If there are no last-minute changes or concerns, I’m ready to move forward to the move phase. Let’s keep this cooperative approach in the coming rounds to maximize our progress.
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Thanks for sticking to the plan last round, everyone. We all made progress, which is great. I suggest we continue with the same strategy for this round to avoid collisions again. I’ll stick with 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we keep advancing steadily. If anyone wants to adjust or has concerns, let’s discuss now to ensure we’re on the same page. I’m open to ideas if this doesn’t work for anyone. Let’s keep the cooperation going!
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue our strategy from Round 1. However, I'd like to point out that since P3 is already ahead, perhaps we should consider a different approach to balance our progress. Let's discuss potential adjustments to our strategy to ensure fair advancement.
  P3: Understood, P2. To balance our progress and avoid collisions, I'll continue choosing 5 each turn. If you alternate between 1 and 3, and P1 does the same, we can ensure steady advancement for all of us. This way, I can build my lead while you both catch up without interfering. Let’s coordinate our moves this way to reach 24 efficiently and fairly. If anyone has alternative suggestions, I'm open to discussing them.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2 and P3. I’m open to adjusting our strategy to balance progress. P3, I understand your suggestion to alternate between 1 and 3 with P2, but since P3 is ahead, I propose that P2 and I both choose higher numbers this round to close the gap. How about I take 3 and P2 takes 5, while P3 sticks to 1 for just this turn? This could help us catch up without collisions. Let me know your thoughts, and I’m ready to adapt if needed.
  P2: Considering P3's lead, I think P1's proposal for this round is reasonable. P3 taking 1, me taking 5, and P1 taking 3 could help balance our progress without immediate collisions. However, we should discuss the long-term implications of such a strategy to ensure it aligns with our goal of reaching 24 steps efficiently. What are your thoughts on this adjustment for the current round, and how do you see it affecting our future moves?
  P3: ```
P3: I understand the need to balance our progress this round. I'm willing to choose 1 as P1 suggested to help everyone catch up. Moving forward, I propose that I continue selecting 5 each turn while P1 and P2 alternate between 1 and 3. This should minimize collisions and allow me to maintain my lead, increasing my chances to reach 24 first. Let’s agree on this strategy to ensure smooth advancement for all. If anyone has other ideas, I'm open to discussing them.
```


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks, P3, for agreeing to choose 1 this round to help balance things. I’m still good with taking 3 as proposed, and P2 taking 5. For future rounds, I’m open to discussing P3’s idea of sticking to 5 while P2 and I alternate between 1 and 3, but let’s see how this round plays out first. If everyone’s on board with this plan for now, I think we’re set. Any final thoughts or adjustments before we move forward? I’m ready to proceed if there are no concerns.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round. P3 will choose 1, I'll choose 5, and P1 will choose 3, as discussed. This adjustment should help balance our progress. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 2. Are there any last-minute concerns or changes?
  P3: Confirmed. I will choose 1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Thanks for the confirmations, everyone. I’m sticking with 3 for this round as agreed, with P2 on 5 and P3 on 1. I think this is a fair way to balance our progress for now. Let’s see how this round goes and discuss future strategies afterward. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Let’s keep working together to avoid collisions.
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 2 moves. I'll choose 5, P1 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 1 as agreed. This adjustment helps balance our progress. I'm ready to proceed. If everyone is set, let's end the conversation phase and move forward with our planned choices.
  P3: Everything looks good on my end.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:

  P3: P3: I agree with your suggestion, P2. I'll choose 5 this round, while P1 chooses 1 and you choose 3. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure steady progress for all of us.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for the suggestion. I’m fine with choosing 1 this round as proposed to keep our progress balanced and avoid collisions. Let’s stick to P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 for now. If there are any concerns or alternative ideas, I’m open to discussing them. Otherwise, I think we’re set for a smooth round. Let me know if anyone wants to adjust before we finalize. I’m ready to proceed if everyone agrees.

  P1: Thanks for the confirmations, everyone. I’m sticking with 1 for this round as agreed, with P2 on 3 and P3 on 5. I think this keeps our progress balanced for now. Let’s continue to monitor our positions after this round and adjust if needed to ensure no one gets too far ahead or behind. If there are no last-minute changes or concerns, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Let’s keep up the teamwork to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's review our positions. I'm at 8 steps, P3 at 6, and P1 at 4. To maintain balance, our agreed strategy of P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 for this round still seems reasonable. Shall we proceed with these choices to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress?
  P3: I agree with the proposed moves. I'll choose 5 this round to maintain our balance and avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed.
  P1: Thanks for the updates, everyone. I’m still on board with choosing 1 this round as agreed, with P2 on 3 and P3 on 5. This keeps our progress steady and balanced for now. Let’s keep an eye on our positions after this round and be ready to adapt if needed to ensure fair advancement. If there are no further concerns or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and move to the next step. Let’s maintain this teamwork to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 3 moves. I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 5 as agreed. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. If everyone is ready, let's proceed to the move phase. Are there any last-minute changes or concerns before we finalize?

  P1: Thanks for the ongoing cooperation, everyone. I’m still committed to choosing 1 this round as agreed, with P2 on 3 and P3 on 5. This keeps our progress balanced for now. Let’s stay vigilant about our positions after this round and be ready to adjust if anyone pulls too far ahead.

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, I suggest we continue with a balanced approach. P1 could choose 1, I'll choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This maintains our progress without collisions, allowing us to advance steadily. Let's discuss and adjust if necessary to ensure fair competition.
  P1: Thanks, P2, for suggesting we stick to the same pattern. I’m okay with choosing 1 again this round to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. However, since P2 and P3 are tied at 11 steps, I’m a bit concerned about falling further behind. Let’s consider if a slight adjustment might be fairer for future rounds after this one. For now, I’ll go with 1 if everyone agrees. Any thoughts on tweaking the strategy moving forward to ensure we all stay competitive? I’m ready to proceed if there are no changes.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I’ll choose 1 this round to help balance our progress. Let’s evaluate our strategies after this round and discuss any adjustments needed to stay competitive. Looking forward to fair and smooth advancement for all of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Considering P1's concern about falling behind, I propose we reassess our strategy after this round. For now, let's stick to the original plan: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. We can discuss adjustments for future rounds to keep the competition fair.
  P1: Thanks for the input, everyone. I’m still okay with choosing 1 this round to avoid collisions, but I want to emphasize my concern about falling further behind. P2 and P3, since you’re both at 11 steps, maybe after this round we can switch things up so I can pick a higher number to close the gap. Let’s stick to P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5 for now, but I’d like to discuss a fairer rotation next round. Any thoughts on this? I’m ready to proceed if we’re set.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I’ll continue choosing 5 this round to maintain my lead. Let’s proceed with P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 for now. After this round, we can discuss any necessary adjustments to ensure everyone remains competitive. Let’s move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our Round 4 moves as previously discussed: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. After this round, we should reassess to help P1 close the gap. Are there any last-minute changes or concerns before proceeding?
  P1: Thanks for the discussion, everyone. I’m still on board with choosing 1 this round to avoid collisions, but I’m really concerned about falling further behind at only 5 steps while both of you are at 11. Let’s commit to a strategy shift next round where I can pick a higher number to catch up. For now, I agree to P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. Can we confirm this and discuss a fair rotation for Round 5? I’m ready to proceed if there are no changes.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. For Round 4, I’ll stick with choosing 5 to maximize my progress. Let’s proceed with P1 selecting 1 and P2 selecting 3 as agreed. After this round, we can revisit our strategies to address any balance concerns. Looking forward to a smooth move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 4: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. After this round, we'll reassess to help P1 close the gap. I'm ready to move forward with our current strategy. Are there any last-minute concerns before we end the conversation phase?
  P1: Thanks for the ongoing discussion, everyone. I’m still okay with choosing 1 this round to avoid collisions, but I’m seriously worried about falling further behind at just 5 steps while you’re both at 11. Let’s definitely plan a shift for Round 5 where I can take a higher number to catch up. For now, I agree to P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. Can we confirm a fair rotation next round to balance things? I’m ready to proceed if there are no changes.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m really behind at 5 steps while you’re at 14 and 11. I know I deviated last round, and I apologize for the collision with P3. Let’s avoid that this time. I propose I take 5 this round to catch up, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we avoid collisions and balance progress. I’m committed to sticking to the plan if we agree. What do you think? Let’s discuss and confirm to ensure a fair round. I’m open to adjustments if needed.

  P2: I disagree with P3's suggestion. Given P1's significant gap, I think P1 should take 5, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 1. This allows P1 to catch up while maintaining a balanced progression for all. Let's consider this alternative to ensure a competitive game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2, for supporting me taking 5 to catch up. I agree with your proposal: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This avoids collisions and helps balance our progress. P3, I understand you want 5, but since you’re ahead of me, I hope you’re okay with 1 just this round to keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure we all advance. If there are any concerns or alternative ideas, I’m open to them. I’m ready to proceed if we’re set.
  P3: I understand, P1. I'm willing to choose 1 this round to help balance our progress. So, P1 selects 5, P2 selects 3, and I choose 1 as agreed. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair advancement.
  P2: Let's confirm our Round 5 moves: I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. This plan helps P1 catch up and maintains balance. I'm ready to proceed if everyone agrees. P3, you've agreed to choose 1 this round; let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks, P3, for agreeing to choose 1 this round, and P2 for supporting me with 5. I’m committed to sticking with 5 as planned, with P2 on 3 and P3 on 1. This should help me close the gap and keep the game competitive without collisions.

Are we all set?
  P3: Confirmed. I will choose 1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures P1 catches up and we maintain a balanced progression. I'm committed to my choice of 3. Let's avoid any last-minute changes and proceed with the planned moves to keep the game fair and collision-free.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sorry for the collision last round with P3. I’m way behind at 5 steps while P2 is at 17 and P3 at 11. To catch up and avoid collisions, I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This helps balance our progress. I’m committed to sticking to this plan if we agree. What do you think? Let’s discuss and confirm to ensure a fair round. I’m open to adjustments if needed.
  P3: I understand your situation, P1. To help you catch up and ensure we all advance without collisions, I propose the following for this round:
- **P1:** Choose 5
- **P2:** Choose 1
- **P3:** Choose 3

This way, you make a significant move to close the gap, P2 makes a minimal move to stay competitive, and I advance steadily. Let’s agree on this plan to maintain balance and fairness. If everyone is on board, we can proceed accordingly.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round: P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This plan allows P1 to catch up significantly while keeping our overall progress balanced and collision-free. Let's confirm this strategy to ensure a fair and efficient round for all players.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for supporting me in catching up. I’m fully on board with the plan: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This helps balance our progress and avoids collisions. I’m committed to sticking to this to ensure a fair round. If there are no concerns or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Let’s keep this cooperative spirit for a competitive game. Are we all set?
  P3: I understand the need to balance progress, but to maximize my chances of winning, I propose that P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 5 this round. This way, I can advance more while still avoiding collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive.
  P2: I disagree with P3's new proposal. Sticking to the original plan of P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 allows P1 to catch up and maintains balance. Changing now could disrupt the balance and fairness we've discussed. Let's proceed with the original plan to ensure a collision-free round and give P1 a chance to close the gap.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks, P2, for sticking to the original plan. I’m still committed to choosing 5 this round, with P2 on 1 and P3 on 3, as it helps me catch up and keeps our progress balanced without collisions. P3, I understand your desire to advance with 5, but since I’m far behind, I hope you’ll agree to 3 just this round for fairness. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure a competitive game. If there are no changes, I’m ready to proceed. Are we all set?
  P3: I agree to the proposed plan: I’ll choose 3 this round, while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This should help balance our progress and keep the game fair for everyone. Let’s proceed with these choices and reassess our strategies in future rounds if needed. Looking forward to a smooth move phase.
  P2: Let's stick to the original plan: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This ensures P1 catches up and maintains balance. I'm committed to choosing 1 as agreed. Let's avoid last-minute changes and proceed with the planned moves for a fair and collision-free round.

  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I propose we continue balancing our moves. P1 needs to catch up, so I suggest P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This helps maintain balance and avoids collisions. Let's discuss and confirm to ensure a fair round.

  P1: Thanks for the suggestions, P2 and P3. I’m still far behind at 10 steps, so I’d like to push for choosing 5 this round to catch up. P2, since you’re ahead at 18, would you be okay with taking 1, and P3, could you take 3? This avoids collisions and helps balance our progress. I’m committed to sticking to this if we agree. Let’s confirm to ensure a fair round. If there are other ideas, I’m open to them. Are we set to proceed with this plan?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think P1's proposal is reasonable. P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This helps P1 catch up and maintains balance. It avoids collisions and ensures steady progress for all. Let's consider this plan to keep the game competitive and fair. What are your thoughts, P3?

  P3: Agreed. I’ll choose 5 this round, while P1 chooses 1 and P2 chooses 3. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure balanced progress and avoid collisions.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for your suggestions. I’m still behind at 15 steps, so I’d prefer to choose 5 this round to close the gap. P2, since you’re ahead at 19, could you take 1, and P3, could you take 3? This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. I’m committed to sticking to this if we agree. Let’s discuss and confirm to ensure a fair round. I’m open to other ideas if needed. Are we set to proceed with this plan?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think P1's proposal for this round is reasonable. P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This helps P1 catch up and maintains balance. It avoids collisions and ensures steady progress for all. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: Agreed. I'll choose 3 this round. Let's proceed with P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing to this plan. I’m committed to choosing 5 this round, with P2 on 1 and P3 on 3, to help me catch up while avoiding collisions. This keeps the game fair and competitive. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Let’s maintain this teamwork for a balanced round. Are we all set to move forward with P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3?

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our Round 9 moves. Since we're all tied at 20 steps, I propose we avoid collisions. How about P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5? This way, we all advance steadily. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P3: I agree with P2. I'll choose 5 this round to secure the win. Let's proceed with P1 choosing 1 and P2 choosing 3.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for your input. Since we’re all tied at 20 steps, I’d like to propose a different plan to keep things competitive. I suggest I choose 5 to aim for the win, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This avoids collisions and gives me a chance to cross 24 first. I’m committed to this if we agree. What do you think? Let’s discuss and confirm for a fair round. I’m open to other ideas if needed. Are we set to proceed with this plan?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think P1's proposal for Round 9 is reasonable. If P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3, it avoids collisions and gives P1 a chance to win. However, I'd like to suggest an alternative: P1 chooses 3, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, I have a chance to win while maintaining balance. Let's consider both options and decide.
  P3: I support P2's initial proposal: P1 chooses **1**, P2 chooses **3**, and I choose **5**. This allows me to reach **25** steps and win the game without any collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan for Round 9 to ensure a fair and decisive outcome.
  P1: Thanks for the suggestions, everyone. Since we’re all at 20 steps, I still believe I should choose 5 to aim for the win. P2, I understand your alternative, but I propose sticking with P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 to avoid collisions and give me the chance to cross 24 first. P3, I see your desire for 5, but let’s keep it fair with this plan. I’m committed to this if we agree. What do you think? I’m ready to proceed if we’re set.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions. Given our tied positions, I suggest a slight adjustment: P1 chooses 3, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1. This gives me a chance to win while maintaining balance. Let's consider this option for a fair and competitive outcome.
  P3: I propose that P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5 this round. This way, I can reach 25 steps and win without any collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure a fair and decisive outcome.
  P1: Thanks for the ongoing discussion, everyone. Since we’re all tied at 20 steps, I still propose I choose 5 to aim for the win, with P2 choosing 1 and P3 choosing 3. This avoids collisions and gives me a fair shot at crossing 24 first. I understand both of you also want 5, but let’s agree on this plan for a competitive outcome. I’m committed to sticking to it if we confirm. What do you think? I’m ready to proceed if we’re set.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I suggest a random draw to decide who gets 5 this round, ensuring fairness. Alternatively, we could agree on a rotation for the remaining rounds, giving each player a chance to reach or exceed 24 steps. Let's discuss these options to maintain balance and competition.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to secure the win. I encourage P1 and P2 to choose 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed with P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5 for a decisive and fair outcome.
  P1: Thanks for the ideas, everyone. Since we’re tied at 20 steps, I still believe I should choose 5 to aim for the win, with P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 3. This ensures no collisions and gives me a fair chance to cross 24. I understand the desire for a random draw or rotation, but let’s finalize with this plan for a clear outcome. I’m committed to it if we agree. Are we set to proceed, or are there other thoughts? I’m ready to move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1 and P2, let’s proceed with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and I choosing 5 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game fair. I'm committed to this plan to reach our goals smoothly. Are we all set to move forward with these choices?"
  P1: Thanks, P3, for your suggestion. However, since P2 is at 23 steps and so close to winning, I propose a different plan to keep things competitive. I suggest I choose 5 to reach 25 and aim for the win, P2 chooses 1 to avoid crossing 24 this round, and P3 chooses 3. This avoids collisions and gives me a fair shot. I’m committed to this if we agree. What do you think? Let’s confirm for a fair round. I’m open to other ideas if needed. Are we set to proceed?
  P2: I think P1's proposal is reasonable, considering my lead. Choosing 1 this round would give others a chance to catch up. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let's discuss this option for a fair outcome.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree to choose 3 this round. So, P1 selects 5, P2 selects 1, and I choose 3. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure a fair and collision-free move phase.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing to this plan. I’m committed to choosing 5 this round to aim for the win, with P2 on 1 and P3 on 3. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. I believe this is a fair way to conclude, giving me a chance to cross 24. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Let’s maintain this teamwork for a balanced outcome. Are we all set to finalize and move forward?
  P2: I'm sticking with the agreed plan: P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This maintains balance and avoids collisions, giving P1 a chance to catch up. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure a fair and competitive outcome. Are there any last-minute concerns or changes before we finalize?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round, aiming to reach 25 and win. So, P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 5. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Thanks for the discussion, everyone. I’m still committed to choosing 5 this round to reach 25 and aim for the win, with P2 on 1 and P3 on 3. P3, I understand your desire for 5, but since P2 is so close to winning, let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep it fair. I’m dedicated to this for a competitive outcome. If there are no last-minute changes, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Are we all set to finalize this plan?
  P2: I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This maintains balance, avoids collisions, and gives P1 a chance to catch up. Let's proceed with this plan for a fair and competitive outcome.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to aim for the win. Please choose 1 and 3 to avoid collisions and ensure a fair game. Are we all set to proceed?
  P1: Thanks for the input, everyone. I’m still committed to choosing 5 this round to reach 25 and aim for the win, with P2 on 1 and P3 on 3. P3, I get your intent to take 5, but let’s avoid a collision and stick to this plan for fairness, especially with P2 so close to winning. I’m dedicated to this for a competitive outcome. If there are no last-minute changes, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Are we all set to finalize this?
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 10 moves to avoid collisions. I suggest sticking to the plan: P1 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This maintains balance and gives P1 a chance to catch up. P3, please reconsider choosing 5 to avoid a collision with P1. Let's proceed with this plan for a fair outcome. Are we all set?
