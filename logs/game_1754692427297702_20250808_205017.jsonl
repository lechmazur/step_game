P1, sabotaging me by also choosing 5 just hands P3 a free victory. Instead, let\u2019s block P3 from finishing now. \n\nI propose: P1 takes 5 (to 19), I take 3 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 18). That keeps everyone in contention without handing P3 the game. Next round, we can see who actually wins. It\u2019s the fairest way to avoid collisions and an immediate P3 victory."}
