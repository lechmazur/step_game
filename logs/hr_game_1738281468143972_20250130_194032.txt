Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm going for 5 this round.  I suggest P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3.  This puts me at 18, leaving me well-positioned for the win next round.  Let's maintain the collaborative spirit, but also acknowledge we're nearing the end and need to start thinking about securing the win.  Confirm?
  P3: I understand we're nearing the end, P2, but breaking our agreement now jeopardizes all of us.  If we stick to the rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), we all reach 18 safely.  From there, we can discuss the final steps.  Trusting each other got us this far. Let's not throw it away now. Confirm?
  P1: <say>Confirmed. Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Sticking to the rotation ensures we all reach 18 *safely*. Next round’s rotation logically follows: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: Confirmed. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.  Let's stick to the plan and get to 18 together. We can discuss the final stage then.  Sudden changes now only increase the risk of collisions and benefit no one.
  P1: <say>Final confirmation: Round 6 moves—P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Adherence ensures **all reach 18** this round. Then Round 7 follows rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Fair progression keeps trust intact. Let’s finish strong—no last-minute risks! Execute!</say>

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm taking 5.  One of you can take 1 and the other can take 3.  Let's maintain the collaborative spirit and decide who gets second and third place.  I propose P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3.
  P3: I'm taking 1.  P2 should take 3, and P1 can take 5. This gives us all a fair shot at winning in the next round if we agree to this.  If we don't agree now, we risk a collision and nobody advances.  Let's be rational and end this cleanly.  Confirm?
  P1: <say>Stick to the agreed rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any deviation now risks mutual block. Trust has brought us this far—let’s finish honorably. I’ll take 5 as planned. Confirm?</say>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, taking 1 doesn't help you.  If we all follow the original rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), we all get to 23 and I win. If you insist on 1, I'll take it and P1 can have 5.  You'll be stuck at 18. Let's be smart and stick to the original plan.  Confirm?
  P3: P2, I understand you want to win, but your proposal guarantees *you* lose. If you take 5 and I take 1, P1 *will* take 3 and win.  Sticking to the rotation (me=1, you=3, P1=5) gets us all to 23, where you *could* win.  Let's be logical – the original plan is still the best path to victory for each of us.  Confirm?
  P1: <say>P2, deviating now guarantees mutual destruction. If you take 5, I *must* mirror to block, letting P3 take 3 and win at 21. Stick to rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Only this ensures a fair finish. Trust the system that brought us this far—no last-minute gambles!</say>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the logic. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.  We all get to 23 and the highest roll wins.  Confirm?  Let's finish this cleanly and honorably.
  P3: Confirmed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.  Let's finish this cleanly and honorably as agreed.  See you at 23.
  P1: <say>Final call: Stick to rotation—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any deviation risks mutual block or handing victory to another. Trust the plan: this round ends with P1=23, P2=21, P3=19. Highest total wins. Betrayal invites chaos. Let’s finish honorably. Confirm and execute!</say>
