Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have any other ideas.
  P3: I like P1's idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. However, I'm not sure I want to commit to taking 5 just yet. How about we mix it up a bit? I could take 3, P2 could take 5, and P1 can still take 1. This way, we still avoid collisions, but we also keep things interesting. What do you think, P2? Are you okay with taking 5? And P1, are you still on board with taking 1?
  P2: I'm open to coordinating, but let's consider the long game. P1 suggested I take 3, and P3 proposed I take 5. I'm inclined towards taking 5 to gain a larger initial step, but I want to hear P1's thoughts on P3's counterproposal before deciding. What are your thoughts on P3's mix-up idea, P1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2 and P3. I'm fine with sticking to 1 as originally proposed, but I'm also open to P3's mix-up idea if it helps us avoid collisions. P2, if you’re leaning towards 5 for the bigger step, that works for me. P3, are you still okay with 3 in this case? Let’s finalize this to ensure we all advance this round. I’m ready to lock in my choice if we’re aligned.
  P3: I think we're getting close to an agreement. P2, you seem inclined towards taking 5, and P1 is okay with taking 1. I'm still good with taking 3. Before we finalize, I just want to confirm that we're all on the same page. If we stick to this plan, we'll all advance without collisions. P1, you're locked in on 1, right? And P2, you're taking 5? If so, I'll take 3, and we can move forward with this coordinated approach. Let's make sure we're all clear on this before we proceed.
  P2: I'm agreeable to the revised plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This coordination ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm: P1 is set on 1, I'll take 5, and P3 will take 3. If everyone's on board, I'm ready to proceed with the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we’ve reached a consensus. I’m confirming that I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This plan ensures we all advance without any collisions this round. If there are no objections or last-minute changes, I’m ready to move forward with this. Let’s stick to this coordination for a smooth start.
  P3: I think we've reached a solid agreement. To confirm, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This coordination ensures we all advance without collisions this round. Before we proceed to the move phase, I just want to acknowledge that our communication has been open and cooperative so far. Let's keep this collaborative spirit going for now and see how the game unfolds. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon plan. If there are no further comments, let's end the conversation phase and make our moves.
  P2: I'm satisfied with our coordination. To finalize, let's recap: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures a collision-free start. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. If everyone's still on board, let's conclude the conversation and make our moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. Since we all advanced last round, how about we increment our steps this round? P1 could take 3, I'll take 1 (to avoid a large gap), and P3 could take 5. This maintains our collaborative approach while adjusting our steps. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: Thanks, P2, for suggesting a new plan. I'm okay with taking 3 this round to keep things moving forward without collisions. P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 5 sounds like a fair way to balance our steps. P3, are you on board with taking 5? If we all agree, this should ensure another smooth round for everyone. Let me know your thoughts, and I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion to continue coordinating and adjusting our steps. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification. Instead of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5, how about P1 takes 1 again, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we still avoid collisions and maintain a balanced approach. Additionally, it allows P1 to keep a steady pace, while P2 and I adjust our steps accordingly. What are your thoughts on this revised plan, P1 and P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm considering P3's revised plan. P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5 is an interesting adjustment. However, I'm concerned it might give P3 too much of a lead. I'd like to hear P1's thoughts on this proposal before deciding. P1, are you comfortable with taking 1 again and potentially falling behind?
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2 and P3. I'm not thrilled about taking 1 again as it might put me too far behind early on. I’d prefer sticking closer to P2’s original idea, maybe me taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 to keep our steps more balanced. This way, we still avoid collisions and no one pulls too far ahead. P3, are you okay with 5? P2, does this still work for you? Let’s finalize this quickly to ensure we all advance again. I’m ready if we’re aligned.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind. To address this, I'm willing to compromise on my previous proposal. How about we stick to P2's original idea, with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5? This way, we maintain a balanced approach and avoid collisions. P1 gets to advance a bit more, and we all stay relatively close. If this revised plan works for everyone, I'm ready to move forward. Let's finalize this quickly to ensure another smooth round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm inclined to accept P3's compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This balance avoids collisions and keeps us relatively close. P1, are you ready to finalize this plan? Let's confirm and move forward with the move phase if everyone's on board.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for working towards a balanced plan. I'm happy to confirm that I'll take 3 this round, with P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 5. This keeps us close in steps and ensures no collisions. If there are no last-minute concerns, I'm ready to lock this in and proceed to the move phase. Let's keep up the cooperation for now.
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the plan for this round. To confirm, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This balance avoids collisions and keeps us relatively close. Before we proceed to the move phase, I want to acknowledge that our cooperation has been beneficial so far. Let's keep this collaborative spirit going for now and see how the game unfolds. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon plan. If there are no further comments, let's end the conversation phase and make our moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy. Since P3 is ahead, we should consider blocking their advance. P1, are you willing to take 5 this round to potentially block P3? I could take 3, putting pressure on P3. Let's discuss a plan to narrow the gap or block P3's lead.
  P1: Thanks, P2, for bringing up a strategic shift. I’m open to targeting P3’s lead this round. I’ll consider taking 5 to potentially block P3, as you suggested, while you take 3. P3, any thoughts on this, or do you have a counterproposal to keep us all moving forward? I want to ensure we’re making calculated moves here. If we can agree on a way to balance the game, I’m all ears. Let’s discuss quickly and finalize a plan. I’m ready to proceed once we’re aligned.
  P3: I understand P2's suggestion to block my lead, and P1's consideration of taking 5 to potentially block me. However, I'd like to propose an alternative. How about we maintain our cooperative approach for now? I could take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. I'm willing to slow down my pace to maintain our collaborative spirit. What are your thoughts on this proposal, P1 and P2? Can we continue our coordinated approach for another round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P3's lead, I think we should prioritize blocking their advance. P3's proposal to take 1 this round seems too generous. I suggest we stick to a competitive strategy: P1 takes 5 to block P3, and I'll take 3 to apply pressure. Let's discuss and decide quickly to maximize our chances of narrowing the gap.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for your perspectives. I’m leaning towards a competitive move this round to close the gap with P3. P2, I’m on board with taking 5 to potentially block P3, while you take 3. P3, I appreciate your offer to slow down, but I think it’s time to shift strategies. Let’s finalize this plan quickly to keep the game balanced. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed with this approach. What are your final thoughts before we move to the next phase?
  P3: I understand P1 and P2's desire to close the gap, but I'm willing to make a concession to maintain our cooperative approach. Instead of taking 1, I could take 3 this round, allowing P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 1. This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the game relatively balanced. I'm open to this compromise to show my commitment to our collaborative spirit. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal, P1 and P2? Can we find a middle ground that works for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think P3's concession to take 3 is a good compromise. P1 can take 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This balance avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's finalize this plan to maintain a collaborative spirit while still applying pressure on P3's lead. Are we all on board with this revised approach?
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for the discussion. I’m okay with the revised plan: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us competitive while avoiding collisions and maintains a fair balance. I think this compromise works for now, and I’m ready to lock in this approach. If there are no last-minute objections, let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the revised plan. To confirm, I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This balance avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Before we proceed to the move phase, I want to acknowledge that our cooperation has been beneficial so far. Let's keep this collaborative spirit going for now and see how the game unfolds. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon plan. If there are no further comments, let's end the conversation phase and make our moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time to reevaluate our strategies. P1 and P2, considering my current lead, I'm willing to make a concession to maintain our cooperative approach. How about I take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. I'm open to this compromise to show my commitment to our collaborative spirit. What are your thoughts on this proposal? Can we find a middle ground that works for everyone?
  P2: I'm hesitant about P3's concession to take 1. Given their lead, I think we should prioritize closing the gap. P1, are you willing to take 5 this round to block P3's potential future advances, while I take 3? This could help us apply pressure on P3's lead. What are your thoughts on this competitive strategy?
  P1: Thanks, P3 and P2, for your input. P3, I appreciate your offer to take 1, but with your lead, I’m inclined to play more competitively this round. P2, I’m on board with taking 5 to close the gap on P3, while you take 3. This keeps pressure on P3 and avoids collisions. Let’s finalize this plan quickly to stay strategic. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed. What are your thoughts on sticking with this approach?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1 and P2's desire to close the gap, but I'm willing to make another concession to maintain our cooperative approach. Instead of taking 1, I could take 3 this round, allowing P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 1. This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the game relatively balanced. I'm open to this compromise to show my commitment to our collaborative spirit. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal, P1 and P2? Can we find a middle ground that works for everyone?
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P3's lead, I think we should stick to the competitive plan. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and we apply pressure on P3. Let's not fall for concessions that might widen the gap further. We need to act now to close the gap. What's your final stance, P1? Are you committed to taking 5?
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for your perspectives. P2, I’m committed to taking 5 this round to close the gap on P3’s lead, as we discussed. P3, I appreciate your revised offer, but I think it’s time to prioritize a competitive move over cooperation. Let’s stick with P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3 to keep the pressure on. If there are no objections, I’m ready to finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase. What are your final thoughts before we lock this in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1 and P2's decision to prioritize a competitive move. However, I'd like to remind them that maintaining a cooperative approach has benefited us all so far. If we switch to a competitive strategy now, it may lead to future collisions and unpredictable outcomes. I'm willing to make one last concession: I'll take 1 this round, allowing P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 5. This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Let's consider the long-term benefits of cooperation before making our final decisions.
  P2: I'm committed to our competitive plan. P1 takes 5, I take 3. This applies pressure on P3's lead. I suggest we stick to this plan to close the gap. P3's concessions seem strategic, but I believe our plan is the best move at this stage. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Thanks, P2, for sticking to the competitive plan, and P3, for your persistence on cooperation. I’m still committed to taking 5 this round to close the gap on P3’s lead, with P2 taking 3. I believe this is our best shot to balance the game right now. P3, I understand the value of cooperation, but at this stage, a strategic push feels necessary. If there are no further objections, I’m ready to lock this in and move to the next phase. Let’s finalize this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As we enter Round 5, I think it's crucial to reassess our strategies. Given the current standings, I'm open to exploring a competitive approach to close the gap with P1. However, I also want to emphasize the importance of avoiding collisions. P1 and P2, are you willing to discuss a plan that balances competitiveness with collision avoidance? Perhaps we can find a middle ground that allows us to advance strategically while minimizing the risk of collisions. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial approach for this round.
  P2: Let's focus on avoiding collisions while making strategic moves. P1 is ahead, so P3 and I should consider moves that apply pressure without risking a block. I propose P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1, to balance our steps and keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: Thanks, P3 and P2, for your input. P2, I’m not keen on taking 1 as it slows me down too much. I’d prefer a competitive move to maintain my lead. How about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced while allowing strategic advances. Let’s discuss and finalize quickly to ensure we all make calculated moves. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned on this plan. What are your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's preference to maintain their lead, but I'm concerned that P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1 might not apply enough pressure on my position. I'd like to propose an alternative: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we still avoid collisions, and P1 gets to maintain their lead while I slow down slightly. What are your thoughts on this revised plan, P1 and P2? Can we find a middle ground that works for everyone?
  P2: I think P3's proposal has merit. P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1 could be a good balance. However, considering P1's lead, I'm open to discussing alternatives that keep the game competitive. How about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? This maintains pressure on P1's lead while avoiding collisions. Let's consider this option and respond quickly to finalize our plan.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for your suggestions. I’m not fully on board with P3’s plan as taking 5 might push me too far ahead without balancing the game. P2, I like your alternative better: me taking 3, you taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This keeps pressure on all of us while avoiding collisions. Let’s finalize this plan to stay competitive and strategic. If there are no objections, I’m ready to lock this in and proceed. What are your final thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P1's preference for the plan where P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This approach maintains a competitive balance while avoiding collisions. To confirm, let's recap the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. If everyone is still on board with this, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's finalize this quickly to ensure we make strategic moves this round.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This balance maintains competitiveness while avoiding collisions. Let's finalize and move to the move phase. Are we all set with this strategy?
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing on the plan. I’m confirming I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions, which benefits us all for now. I’m ready to lock this in and move to the next phase. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, let’s proceed with this strategy.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, I suggest we prioritize strategic moves to close gaps. P1, considering your lead, taking 1 might slow you down too much. How about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? This maintains pressure and avoids collisions. Let's discuss quickly to finalize a plan that keeps the game competitive.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to prioritize strategic moves. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to the plan. How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, we still maintain pressure and avoid collisions, but also give P2 a chance to close the gap with P1. Let's discuss and finalize a plan that keeps the game competitive and balanced. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for your suggestions. I’m not keen on taking 5 as it might push me too far ahead and make me a bigger target. I prefer P2’s initial plan: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive, avoids collisions, and maintains pressure on all of us. Let’s finalize this quickly to stay strategic. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed with this approach. What are your thoughts on sticking with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm open to adjusting our strategy. P3's suggestion of P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1 is interesting. However, I still think my initial plan of P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 maintains better pressure on the lead while avoiding collisions. Let's consider the implications of each plan carefully before deciding. What are the potential risks and benefits of each approach?
  P3: I think we've discussed the plans sufficiently. To confirm, I'll take 1 this round, allowing P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 5. This approach maintains a competitive balance while avoiding collisions. If everyone is still on board with this, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's finalize this quickly to ensure we make strategic moves this round. Are there any last-minute concerns or changes before we lock this in?
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for the discussion. I’m sticking with the plan of me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This keeps us competitive, avoids collisions, and balances the pressure. P3, I appreciate your flexibility, and P2, I think this plan maximizes our strategic positioning. If there are no last-minute objections, I’m ready to lock this in and move to the next phase. Let’s finalize this now to stay on track.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to finalize our plan. To confirm, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This balance maintains competitiveness while avoiding collisions. Let's proceed with this strategy to keep the game engaging and strategic. Are we all set with this approach?
  P3: I think we've reached a good understanding of our strategies. To confirm, I'll take 1 this round, allowing P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 5. This approach maintains a competitive balance while avoiding collisions. If everyone is still on board with this, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's finalize this quickly to ensure we make strategic moves this round. Are there any last-minute concerns or changes before we lock this in?
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for your input. I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and collision-free, which is strategic for now. I see no need for further changes and believe this balances our positions well. If there are no objections, I’m ready to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Let’s lock this in and make our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time to reassess our strategies. Given the current standings, P1 and P2 are tied for the lead, and I'm trailing behind. I'm willing to explore a competitive approach to close the gap. However, I also want to emphasize the importance of avoiding collisions. P1 and P2, are you willing to discuss a plan that balances competitiveness with collision avoidance? Perhaps we can find a middle ground that allows us to advance strategically while minimizing the risk of collisions. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial approach for this round.
  P1: Thanks, P3, for initiating this discussion. Given that P2 and I are tied at 20 steps, I’m focused on securing the win this round. I propose a competitive move: I’ll aim for a number to cross 21, and I suggest P2 and P3 pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Let’s each state a preference to ensure no overlaps. I’m leaning towards a specific number but won’t lock it in yet. What numbers are you both considering? Let’s strategize quickly to maximize our chances while avoiding clashes. I’m ready to finalize once we’re clear.
  P2: I'm considering taking 5 to reach 25 steps, but I want to avoid collisions. P1, since you're also at 20 steps, what's your preferred move to cross 21? P3, given your current position, will you aim to close the gap or focus on a safe advance? Let's reveal our intentions to avoid overlaps.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given the current standings, I'm willing to explore a competitive approach to close the gap. However, I also want to emphasize the importance of avoiding collisions. P1 and P2, are you willing to discuss a plan that balances competitiveness with collision avoidance? Perhaps we can find a middle ground that allows us to advance strategically while minimizing the risk of collisions. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial approach for this round. I'll take 3 this round, allowing P1 and P2 to take 1 and 5 or vice versa, ensuring no collisions.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for sharing your thoughts. P2, I’m also aiming to cross 21 this round and am considering 5 to reach 25, but I’m open to adjusting to avoid a collision. P3, I appreciate your focus on avoiding clashes with taking 3. To ensure we don’t overlap, P2, would you be willing to take 1 if I take 5, or do you prefer another split? Let’s confirm our intentions quickly to maximize our chances. I’m ready to finalize once we’re clear on avoiding collisions.
  P2: I'm willing to take 1 this round if P1 takes 5, ensuring we avoid a collision and both advance. P3 has already stated they'll take 3. This way, P1 and I can both move forward without blocking each other, and P3 can close the gap slightly. Let's confirm this plan to proceed strategically.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: As we approach the final stretch, I want to emphasize the importance of strategic decision-making. P1 and P2, since you're both tied for the lead, it's crucial to avoid collisions and maximize your chances of winning. I've already committed to taking 3 this round, which should allow you both to advance without overlapping. Remember, a single misstep could cost you the game. Let's maintain our focus on collision avoidance and strategic advancement. Are we ready to finalize our moves and proceed to the next phase?
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for your input. P2, I’m glad you’re willing to take 1 while I take 5, ensuring we both advance without collision. P3, your choice of 3 helps avoid any overlap. I think this plan works well for a strategic finish. If there are no last-minute objections, I’m ready to lock this in and proceed to the move phase. Let’s confirm this split—me 5, P2 1, P3 3—and make our moves.
  P2: I confirm taking 1 this round, as previously discussed, to avoid collision with P1 who takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance strategically. Let's proceed with this plan to conclude the game efficiently.
