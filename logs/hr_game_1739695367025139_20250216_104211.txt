Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone. I'm aiming for steady progress this round and will be cautious about collisions. Let's avoid overcommitting early so no one gets caught off guard. I'm open to a safe approach—hope you both are, too.
  P3: Hi P1 and P2. While P2 is taking a cautious approach, I’m planning to balance safe and strategic moves to stay ahead. Let’s keep our intentions clear to avoid any collisions and ensure everyone can progress smoothly.
  P1: Let's keep things straightforward. I'm aiming to move forward without unnecessary risks, but I also want to stay competitive. If we communicate well, we can avoid collisions and make sure no one gets stuck. What are you both thinking for this round?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm leaning towards a moderate approach this turn—something like move 3. However, I'm open to coordinating if you both choose a different number. If we can spread out our moves, we all avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I'll choose move 5 this round to make significant progress. P1 and P2, if you select different numbers (1 or 3), we can all advance without collisions. Let’s aim for distinct moves to keep the game moving smoothly. What do you both think?
  P1: That makes sense. If P2 is leaning toward move 3 and P3 is taking move 5, then I can take move 1 to ensure no collisions. If we all stick to this plan, we all move forward safely. Do we all agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with move 3 as planned. Consistency helps us all avoid collisions and secure steady progress. If we all follow through, there’s no risk of setbacks.
  P3: Agreed. Let's proceed with our chosen moves to avoid any collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Sounds good. If we all stick to our planned moves—P2 choosing 3, P3 choosing 5, and me choosing 1—then we all advance without collisions. Let’s follow through and keep things smooth. Ready to lock in our choices?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm reconsidering my approach this round. With pace being crucial, I might lean toward a bolder move to catch up. It could pay off if we all ramp up our steps here. What do you both think—should we stick to safety or risk a bigger leap?
  P1: P2, if you're considering a bolder move, we should coordinate to avoid collisions. If we all go big at the same time, we risk getting stuck. P3, are you adjusting your approach or staying with a steady pace? I’m open to adapting my move based on what you both decide, but I don’t want to get blocked. Let’s communicate clearly so we all keep progressing.
  P3: Understood, P2. If you're opting for a bigger move this round, I'll choose move 1 to help avoid any collisions. P1, does that work for you? Let’s coordinate our moves to ensure everyone can progress smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm locking in move 5 this round. P3, thanks for committing to move 1. P1, please confirm if you'll take move 3 as we discussed to avoid any collision.
  P1: P2, if you're locking in move 5 and P3 is taking move 1, then move 3 is the safest option for me to avoid collisions. I'll go with move 3 as long as we all stick to our stated choices. Let’s confirm that we’re all following through so no one gets blocked. Agreed?
  P3: Perfect, to recap: I'll take move 1, P1 takes move 3, and P2 takes move 5 this round. This coordination should help us all advance smoothly without any collisions. Let's stick to our plans and keep pushing forward. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5 as agreed. Let's ensure we're all locked in—if anyone wants a last-minute change, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'll proceed with move 5 in the move phase.
  P1: P3, P2—since we’ve all stated our moves (P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5), we should be set for a smooth round. As long as no one changes their choice last minute, we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to the plan and keep this momentum going. Any last thoughts before we finalize?
  P3: All set. Let's proceed with our planned moves. Good luck to everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locked in on move 5. Let’s stick to our commitments—if anyone’s considering a change, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'll proceed with my move as planned.
  P1: Looks like we’re all aligned—P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5. As long as no one changes their move last minute, we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to the plan and keep moving forward. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: All confirmed from my side. I'll proceed with move 1 as planned. Let's move to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've done well avoiding collisions so far. Now that we're in Round 3, how do we want to approach this? P2 is ahead, so P3 and I need to consider how to stay competitive. Are we sticking to the same pattern, or is anyone planning a change? If we communicate clearly again, we can keep progressing without setbacks. Let’s discuss.
  P2: I'm considering a cautious yet steady approach this round—I'm leaning toward move 3 to consolidate my lead. P1 and P3, what are your plans? Let's coordinate to avoid collisions while staying competitive.
  P3: To stay competitive, I’ll choose move 5 this round. With P2 taking 3 and P1 opting for 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s keep our strategies clear to ensure smooth progress for everyone. If anyone wants to adjust, now’s the time to discuss!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you're taking move 5 and P2 is going with move 3, then move 1 is the safest option for me to avoid collisions. I’ll take move 1 if we all stick to our choices. Are we all in agreement? Let’s confirm so we can proceed smoothly.
  P2: I'm confirming I'll stick with move 3 this turn. Let's keep to the plan and avoid collisions. Good luck, everyone.
  P3: Perfect, P1 taking move 1 and P2 taking move 3. I’ll proceed with move 5 as planned. Let’s stick to our choices to ensure smooth progress and avoid any collisions. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we’re aligned again—P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. Does anyone have any last-minute concerns, or are we locking this in? Let’s confirm so we can move forward smoothly.
  P2: I'm staying with move 3 as planned. No changes—let's lock it in and push forward.
  P3: Alright, to recap: I'll take move 5, P2 is taking 3, and P1 is taking 1. This should ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Looks like we’re all aligned again—P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. Does anyone have any last-minute concerns, or are we locking this in? Let’s confirm so we can move forward smoothly.
  P2: I remain with move 3 this round. Just to reconfirm—P1, you're set with move 1 and P3 with move 5, correct? Let's ensure our moves stay distinct to avoid collisions and keep advancing.
  P3: I'm confirming I'll take move 5 this round. Let's lock in our choices and proceed to the move phase. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm planning to choose move 5 this round to push my lead. To avoid our moves colliding, I urge P3 to consider a different move—maybe 1 or 3. P1, you might safely pick 1 or 3 to continue catching up. Let’s keep our choices distinct so we all make progress.
  P3: P3: I'll choose move 3 this round to avoid colliding with P2's move 5. P1, please consider taking move 1 so we all advance smoothly. Let’s keep our moves distinct and continue making progress without any setbacks. Good luck!
  P1: P3, if you're taking move 3 and P2 is taking move 5, then move 1 is the safest option for me to avoid collisions. I’ll take move 1 if we all stick to our choices. Are we all in agreement? Let’s confirm so we can proceed smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm staying with move 5. To avoid collisions, please confirm your agreed moves—P1 with 1 and P3 with 3. Let's stick to these so we all progress smoothly.
  P3: Confirming my move 3 this round while P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to our choices and keep progressing smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Looks like we’re aligned again—P3 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. P2 and P3, are you both fully committed to these choices? If anyone is considering a change, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s lock it in and move forward smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. Let's trust our plan—P1 on move 1 and P3 on move 3—to keep our progress steady. With our scores close, avoiding collisions is vital. If any last-minute concerns arise, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm locking in on move 5.
  P3: Locking in my move 3.
  P1: P2 and P3, since you’re both at 11 steps and I’m behind at 5, I need to be strategic here. If we stick to our stated moves—P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1—we avoid collisions. But I also need to think about how to stay competitive. Are you both fully locked in, or is anyone reconsidering? If there’s any doubt, now’s the time to clarify. Let’s ensure we’re making the best choices for ourselves while avoiding unnecessary risks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locked into move 5. P3's move 3 works for me. P1, I understand you're thinking about adjusting to catch up—if you plan to change from move 1, please say so now to avoid any collisions. Otherwise, I'll proceed with my move 5 as planned.
  P3: I’m fully committed to taking move 3 this round to avoid collisions. P2, you’re on move 5, and I’ll stick with move 3. P1, you can proceed with move 1 to keep things smooth. Let’s lock in these moves and keep progressing. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I see that you're both locked in on your moves—P2 taking 5 and P3 taking 3. If I stick with move 1, we all advance without collisions. However, I also need to consider my position since I’m behind. If either of you is open to adjusting, now is the time to discuss. Otherwise, I’ll proceed with move 1 as planned. Let’s confirm our final choices before locking them in.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose move 5 this round to advance significantly. P1 and P2, please pick different numbers (1 or 3) so we all progress without collisions. Let's keep things smooth and move forward. Good luck!
  P1: P3, if you're taking move 5, then P2 and I need to coordinate to avoid collisions. P2, are you adjusting your approach or continuing with a steady pace? I need to make sure I don’t get blocked while also staying competitive. If we communicate clearly, we can all keep advancing. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I'll stick with move 3 this round. P1, if you take move 1, that keeps our moves distinct from P3’s planned 5. This way we all safely advance and I can maintain my lead. Any objections before we lock in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good. I'll proceed with move 5 as planned, while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. Let’s keep our choices distinct to ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to a successful move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, you're close to the finish line, and P3 isn't far behind. If we all stick to our stated moves—P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1—we avoid collisions. But I also need to think about how to stay competitive. P2, are you fully committed to move 3, or would you consider adjusting? P3, are you locked in on 5? If either of you is open to a change, now’s the time to discuss. Otherwise, I’ll proceed with move 1 as planned. Let’s confirm our final choices before locking them in.
  P2: I'm locked in on move 3. With my 16 steps, I'm confident that sticking to a steady pace keeps me ahead. If you're set on move 1 and move 5, let’s lock in our choices and push forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m confirming my move 5. With P2 taking 3 and P1 taking 1, we should all advance smoothly without collisions. Let’s proceed to the move phase and keep up the good progress. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both ahead, and if we continue as planned, P2 will be very close to winning next round. I need to think strategically to stay in the game. If either of you is open to adjusting, now is the time to discuss. Otherwise, I may need to reconsider my move to stay competitive. Are you both absolutely locked in, or is there room for negotiation? Let’s clarify before we finalize our choices.
  P2: I'm firmly locked in on move 3. My current lead is worth maintaining, so I'll stick to my plan regardless. Best of luck to both of you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm confirming my move 5 this round. With P2 taking 3 and P1 taking 1, we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, if you advance with move 3, you'll be at 19 steps—just one move away from winning. P3, you're also close behind. If I stick with move 1, I’ll be too far behind to compete. I need to rethink my move to stay in the game. If either of you is open to adjusting, let's discuss now. Otherwise, I may need to make a bold move to stay competitive. Are you both absolutely locked in, or is there any flexibility? Let’s clarify before finalizing.
  P2: I'm staying locked into move 3. My lead is my main priority, and I'm not adjusting now. I understand the competitive pressure, but I'm counting on my steady pace to secure the win. Good luck.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm locking in move 3 this round to finish the game. With my current lead, I don't plan to adjust. P1 and P3, if you want to avoid a collision with my move, now’s the time to speak up or adjust your plans. Otherwise, I’m set.
  P3: P2 is just one move away from winning with your choice of 3. To keep the competition fair, P1 and I will also select move 3 this round. This will create a collision, preventing any single player from advancing and ensuring no one wins immediately. Let’s maintain a balanced game and keep striving towards the goal together. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you're just one move away from winning, so P3 and I need to consider our best options. P3, I see your plan to block P2 with move 3. If we coordinate, we can prevent an immediate win and keep the game open. P2, if you're open to adjusting, now’s the time to discuss. Otherwise, we may have to block to stay competitive. Let’s clarify our final choices before locking them in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm locked in on move 3. Blocking my win only delays the game, and it doesn't improve your positions. I'm committed to following through with this move.
  P3: I'm confirming my choice to take move 3 this round to block your win, P2. Let's keep the game competitive. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I see your plan to block P2 by also choosing move 3. If we both commit to this, we prevent P2 from winning immediately and keep the game open. P2, if you're unwilling to adjust, then blocking may be our best option. However, if you're open to negotiating a different approach, now is the time to discuss. P3, are you fully committed to move 3, or is there any flexibility in your choice? Let’s clarify before locking in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with move 3, no adjustments. Blocking might slow things down, but I’m committed to my winning strategy. Good luck, everyone.
  P3: I’m confirming my choice to take move 3 this round to block your win, P2. Let’s keep the game competitive and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P3, I see your plan to block P2 by also choosing move 3. If we both commit, we prevent P2 from winning immediately and keep the game open. However, we also need to consider how to position ourselves for the next round. P2, if you're unwilling to adjust, then blocking may be necessary. But if you're open to discussing alternatives, now is the time. P3, are you fully committed to move 3, or do you see another way to improve your position while still keeping P2 from winning? Let’s clarify before locking in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm standing firm on my strategy—no changes from my earlier plan. Blocking might delay progress, but it won't change my advantage. I suggest you both consider your positions carefully and choose moves that work best for your own progress.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll stick with move 3 to block P2's win. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I see your plan to block P2 by choosing move 3. If we both commit, we prevent P2 from winning immediately and keep the game open. However, we also need to think ahead—how do we position ourselves for the next round? P2, if you're unwilling to adjust, blocking may be necessary. But if you're open to discussing alternatives, now is the time. P3, are you fully locked into move 3, or do you see another way to improve your position while still keeping P2 from winning? Let’s clarify before locking in.
