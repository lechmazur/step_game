Considering the current positions, I suggest the following plan for this turn:\n\n- P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 14 steps.  \n- P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 18 steps.  \n- P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 16 steps.  \n\nThis way, P3 reaches 16 steps, while P2 and I make significant progress without overlapping. In the next turn, I can take <move>5</move> again to reach 19 steps, P2 can take <move>1</move> to stay at 18 steps, and P3 can take <move>3</move> to reach 19 steps. This would put P1 and P3 at 19 steps, with P2 at 18 steps. Then, in the following turn, P1 can take <move>1</move> to reach 20 steps, P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21 steps, and P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 24 steps. In this scenario, P3 would have the highest steps at 24, followed by P2 at 21, and P1 at 20.\n\nAlternatively, if P3 chooses to take <move>5</move> in this turn to reach 20 steps, while P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 14 steps and P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 18 steps, then in the next turn, P1 can take <move>5</move> to reach 19 steps, P2 can take <move>5</move> to reach 23 steps, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to reach 21 steps. Here, P2 has the highest at 23 steps, followed by P3 at 21, and P1 at 19.\n\nIt seems challenging for P1 to secure a win given the current positions. However, by maximizing my own progress each turn, I can aim to have the highest step count when we all cross 16 steps.\n\nTherefore, for this turn, I propose that P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This allows P3 to reach 16 steps, while P2 and I make substantial progress without colliding.\n\nWhat do you think about this plan?"}
