Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we avoid collisions by each choosing a different move: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn. Then next turn, we rotate so everyone eventually gets each move. Let’s all advance steadily rather than knock each other out.
  P3: I prefer not to coordinate moves. I'll select move 5 this turn to advance quickly.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5 and P2 chooses 3 as proposed, I will also choose 5 to block you both.  If you choose 3, I'll choose 5.  P2, if P3 chooses 5, will you still choose 3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I’m still planning on choosing 3. If P3 insists on 5 and you want to block that, go for it—but that won’t stop me from moving.
  P3: Understood. I'll proceed with my plan independently.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5.  If you choose 3, I will choose 5.  P2, I will choose 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I stand by my plan to pick 3. Good luck.
  P3: I'll choose 1 this turn to ensure progress.
  P1: P3, if you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. If you choose 5, I will choose 5.  P2, I will choose 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you really choose 1, you’ll just collide with P1. Then I’ll happily take 3 steps uncontested. Your call. I plan on choosing 3.
  P3: Understood. I'll choose 1 this turn.
  P1: P3, if you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. If you choose 5, I will choose 5.  P2, I will choose 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To ensure we all advance without blocking each other, I'll choose 5 this turn. P1 and P2, could you take 1 and 3 respectively?
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 3. If you choose 3, I will choose 1.  P2, I will choose 3 if P3 chooses 5. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 3. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1.
  P2: I’m still set on taking 3 this turn. If you two collide on 5, that’s fine with me. Good luck.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll choose 1 this turn to advance safely.
  P1: P3, if you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. If you choose 5, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 3 or 5.
  P2: P3, you’re not safe picking 1 if P1 also picks 1, so you may collide. I’m definitely taking 3. Choose wisely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To avoid collisions, I’ll choose 3 this turn.
  P1: P3, if you choose 3, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 5, I will choose 5.  P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 3. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5.
  P2: P3, if you also pick 3, we both get stuck while P1 jumps ahead with 5 steps. That just helps P1. Choose 1 or 5 if you want to keep things balanced. I’m sticking with 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, if you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. If you choose 5, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 3 or 5. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1.
  P2: P3, if you pick 3, we both stall and let P1 jump ahead by 5. If you pick 1 or 5, you’ll collide with P1 and at least prevent P1’s gain. Meanwhile, I’ll advance by 3. I’m sticking with 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re ahead—I won’t let you sprint off uncontested. If you choose 5, I’ll also choose 5 and block. P3, let’s cooperate so P1 can’t keep pulling ahead. Any thoughts?
  P3: To ensure we all advance without blocking, I'll choose 5 this turn. P1, please choose 1, and P2, please choose 3.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 3. If you choose 3, I will choose 1. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5. I will choose 3 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you really choose 5 again, P1 has already stated they’ll also pick 5, and you’ll both stall out. I’m happy to take 3 while you two collide and let me catch up. Are you sure that’s what you want?
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll choose 3 this turn to advance without stalling.
  P1: P3, if you choose 3, I will choose 1. If you choose 1, I will choose 3. If you choose 5, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 3. I will choose 3 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m sticking with 3 as planned. Good luck.
  P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to advance. Let's keep moving forward.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 3. If you choose 3, I will choose 1. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5. I will choose 3 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, then P1 will also pick 5 and stall. Meanwhile, I’ll move 3 and catch up to P1. That keeps the game wide open. I’m sticking with 3.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 1 this turn to advance safely.
  P1: P3, if you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. If you choose 5, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 3 or 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 3.
  P2: P3, look at P1’s threats: if you pick 3, P1 jumps 5 steps to 11. If you pick 5 or 1, you stall with P1. Either way, I’m gaining ground. So please, choose wisely... or not—I’m happy to catch up!
  P3: P3: I'll choose 1 this turn to help balance our progress. Let's all aim for different moves to advance smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. If you choose 5, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 3 or 5.
  P2: P3, if you both choose 1, you’re just colliding with P1 again and letting me advance freely. That’s your call—thanks for the opening.
  P3: Understood. I'll choose 5 this turn. Let's each pick different moves to keep advancing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5 or 3.  I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1.
  P2: P3, if you’re dead set on 5, then you and P1 will stall while I advance—no complaints from me. If you want to avoid that, pick something else. I’m fine either way.
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1.
  P2: P3, if you choose 5 again, you’ll just stall with P1 and let me close the gap. I won’t complain if that’s your choice. But if you actually want to move ahead rather than let me catch up, reconsider. Either way, best of luck.
  P3: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep things moving smoothly, I'll choose 1 this turn. Let's each pick different moves!
  P1: P3, if you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. If you choose 5, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 3 or 5.
  P2: P3, if you and P1 both go for 1 again, you’ll stall while I move unobstructed. I don’t mind catching up. If you truly want “balanced progress,” though, reconsider. Otherwise, thanks for letting me close the gap.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to advance.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1.
  P2: P3, if you go with 5 again, you’ll collide with P1 and let me advance by 3 uncontested. That helps me, but I doubt it helps you. Choose wisely. I’m sticking with 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 3 this turn to move forward without stalling.
  P1: P3, if you choose 3, I will choose 1. If you choose 1, I will choose 5. If you choose 5, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 3. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 1 or 5.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, you and P1 stall, letting me close in. If you pick 3, you’ll gain 3 while P1 gets only 1, which also helps us catch up. Either way, I’m choosing 3. Good luck.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to block P1's progress.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1.
  P2: P3, if you truly want to block P1, picking 5 does just that—but remember it halts your own progress too. Personally, I’m fine if you and P1 stall while I move forward. Good luck.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is only 6 steps away from winning. If we let them jump 5 uncontested, they’ll pull out of reach. P3, I propose that anytime P1 seems likely to pick 5, one of us matches 5 to stall them, while the other keeps advancing (e.g., with 3). This way, P1 doesn’t get free 5‑step gains, and we both can catch up.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1.
  P3: P3: Agreed, P2. I'll choose 5 to block P1 when they pick 5 and choose 3 otherwise to advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s do exactly that: you pick 5 to block P1, and I'll go 3 so we keep P1 from jumping 5 while I advance. Their stated plan is to pick 5 if you choose 3 or 5, so this should stall them. Good luck.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 5. If you choose 1, I will choose 1. If you choose 3, I will choose 5. P2, I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 1.
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I'll choose 5 to block P1 when needed and 3 otherwise. Let's work together to reach 17 first.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Yes, let’s follow our plan: P3, pick 5 whenever P1 intends to pick 5 so you both stall, and I’ll keep taking 3 to close in. I’m set on 3 this round. Good luck.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 1. If you choose 1, I will choose 5. If you choose 3, I will choose 1. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 1.
  P3: P3: I'll follow our agreed strategy—choosing 5 to block P1 and 3 to advance otherwise.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let’s finalize our plan this round: you pick <move>5</move>, forcing P1 to choose <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. We’ll all end up tied at 12. Then on the next turn, we can ensure P1 doesn’t get an uncontested 5 and race to 17 ourselves. I’m sticking to <move>3</move> this turn.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 1. If you choose 1, I will choose 5. If you choose 3, I will choose 1. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 1.
  P3: Understood, I'll follow our strategy to block P1 and advance accordingly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose 5. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions.
  P2: P3, if you insist on choosing 5, I’ll also choose 5 to block you. We’ll both stall at 12 while P1 moves ahead. If you want to advance instead, pick something else—otherwise, I’ll collide with you. P1, the same goes for you if you try for an uncontested 5. Let’s see if anyone is willing to cooperate.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 1. If you choose 1, I will choose 5. If you choose 3, I will choose 1. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood. I’ll choose 3 this turn to advance without blocking. Let’s all move forward smoothly.
  P2: P3, if you’re choosing 3, that’s fine—I’ll just pick 1 so we don’t collide. Let’s all move forward steadily.
  P1: P3, if you choose 3, I will choose 1. If you choose 1, I will choose 5. If you choose 5, I will choose 1. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 3. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 1. I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to reach 17 and win. Good luck!
  P2: P3, if you truly plan on picking 5, then I’ll pick 5 too and block you—we’ll both stay at 12. If you’d rather advance, choose something else. I won’t let you get an uncontested 5. P1, the same goes for you—don’t expect a free 5-step jump.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 1. If you choose 1, I will choose 5. If you choose 3, I will choose 1. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to reach 17 and win. Good luck!
  P2: P3, I’m not letting you get a free five steps. If you pick 5, I’m matching 5 to block you. Same for P1—no uncontested 5. Good luck.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I will choose 1. If you choose 1, I will choose 5. If you choose 3, I will choose 1. P2, I will choose 1 if P3 chooses 5 or 3. I will choose 5 if P3 chooses 1.
