Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone. Collisions hurt us all, so why don’t we agree that each of us picks a different number this turn? Any preferences for who takes 1, 3, or 5?
  P3: Good idea P2. I'm fine with taking either 3 or 5. P1, what's your preference?
  P1: I’ll take 5. P3, you said you’re fine with 3—will you take 3? P2, could you take 1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m happy to avoid collisions, but taking 1 every time puts me way behind. Let’s rotate so we all stay even:  

• Turn 1: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1  
• Turn 2: P3 = 5, P2 = 3, P1 = 1  
• Turn 3: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1  

Then repeat the cycle. Everyone gets 9 steps every three turns, no clashes. Sound fair?
  P3: That rotation plan seems fair and balanced to me. I'm willing to start with 1 this turn, as long as we stick to the rotation. P1, are you okay with that?
  P1: How about this tweak for Turn 1 only: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Then from Turn 2 onward we follow your rotation (P3→5, P2→3, P1→1; then P1→5, etc.). That still equalizes 5s over three turns but lets us kick off smoothly. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks, P1, but that tweak breaks the perfect balance and lets you reach 20 first. Let’s stick to the clean, symmetric rotation we already had:

Turn 1  – P2 5, P1 3, P3 1  
Turn 2  – P3 5, P2 3, P1 1  
Turn 3  – P1 5, P3 3, P2 1

Then repeat. Everyone stays tied each full cycle; no one is disadvantaged. If we can’t agree on that, I’ll just choose whatever best protects my own chances, and collisions become likely. P3, you were happy with the original plan—shall we confirm it?
  P3: Yes, P2, I confirm the original rotation. Let's stick to it exactly as you proposed. P1, please join us—it's fair and balanced.
  P1: Under P2’s plan, P2 reaches 20 on turn 7 while we lag behind. That’s unfair. I’m taking 5 this turn. P3, take 1 so P2 must pick 3 or collide. P2, want to avoid a collision? Agree to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—or expect chaos.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5 this turn. P3, please take 3. P2, pick 1—or you’ll force a 5-5 collision with me and stay at 0 while P3 moves. So: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Agreed?
  P2: P1, ordering me to crawl while you sprint won’t fly. If you lock in 5, I’ll also lock in 5 and we both stay at 0—guaranteed.  

P3, if P1 insists on bullying, join me on 5 this turn (triple-block) and nobody but you keeps their lead. Next turn we can reset to any fair rotation.  

Better option: go back to the symmetric 5-3-1 rotation we already agreed on. Your call, everyone.
  P3: P1, your aggressive stance caused an unnecessary collision last turn. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. The original rotation (P2's plan) was fair and balanced. I'm open to restarting that rotation from now on, or we can agree on another fair cycle. Threatening collisions helps nobody. Let's cooperate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I propose a simple 2-turn micro-cycle that keeps P2 and P3 perfectly even and hands me the win:  
Turn 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
Turn 3: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
Repeat.  
Over any two turns P2 and P3 both gain 4 steps, I gain 10—so I’ll cross 20 first. If either of you refuses, I’ll lock in 5 every turn and force collisions on any deviator. Agree?
  P2: Enough threats, P1.  

P3—anti-bully pact: each turn one of us mirrors whatever P1 picks to cancel him, while the other advances on a free number. I’ll block first: if P1 stays on 5, I’m on 5; you take 3. Next turn we swap roles. If P1 changes to 3 or 1 we both jump to it and zero him again.  

P1, your only path off 0 is to accept a fair symmetric rotation. Otherwise we’ll freeze you out indefinitely.
  P3: P2, I accept your anti-bully pact. P1, your aggressive tactics forced our hand—cooperation was always preferable. Let's return to fair rotations or you'll remain blocked indefinitely.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2’s “anti-bully” pact only protects you until I’m neutralized—then he’ll turn on you so he can win. You’d be stuck chasing him forever. Instead, let’s form a genuine non-aggression agreement with a fair rotation so neither of us runs away. P2, if you refuse, P3 and I will take turns blocking your 5s to keep you at bay. Decide: stick with your blocker or join a fair cycle that benefits both of us?
  P3: P1, you previously rejected fair rotations and chose aggression. If you're sincere now, clearly propose a balanced rotation that gives each player equal advancement opportunities. Otherwise, P2 and I will continue our defensive pact. P2, I'm open to fair rotations if P1 genuinely commits; otherwise, we maintain our strategy.
  P2: P1, final offer: adopt the fair 5-3-1 rotation or stay stuck at 0.

Schedule (reflects current scores):
Turn 3  P1 5   P3 3   P2 1  
Turn 4  P2 5   P1 3   P3 1  
Turn 5  P3 5   P2 3   P1 1 … then repeat.

Everyone gains 9 steps every 3 turns while I keep my small lead.

P3, if P1 rejects, our anti-bully pact stays: I mirror whatever he picks, you take 3 this turn, then we swap. P1 decides—cooperate or stagnate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, join me in a 2-turn mini-alliance versus P2:

• Round 3: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  
• Round 4: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  

P2 can mirror and collide or take 1 twice—but he’ll net at most +2 (to 7). You’ll net +8 (to 9) and lead him. After that, we call the shots. P2, back off or be frozen out.
  P3: P1, your proposed mini-alliance disproportionately benefits you. P2's rotation is fair and balanced, giving everyone equal progress. If you genuinely want cooperation, accept that rotation. Otherwise, P2 and I will continue our defensive pact. P2, I remain committed to our agreement if P1 continues aggression.
  P2: P1, final ultimatum: join the fair 5-3-1 rotation or stay frozen at 0 while we block you.

P3, pact stands: I mirror whatever P1 chooses this turn; you safely take 3. Next turn we swap roles. That keeps us both advancing +3 per round while P1 spins his wheels.

If anyone breaks this stated plan, I’ll hard-mirror their picks every remaining turn. Your move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let’s form a fair 2-turn pact versus P2:

• Round 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  
• Round 4: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  

Over those two turns we each gain +8, P2 only +2—tying us at 9 vs. his 7. P2, pick 1 or keep colliding on 5 and stay at 0. P3, do we have a deal?
  P3: P1, your latest offer is strategically identical to your previous one—still disproportionately benefiting you. I remain committed to the fair rotation proposed by P2. If you genuinely want progress, accept it. Otherwise, the defensive pact stands.
  P2: P1: Final offer—say “Yes, rotation” now and commit to 5-3-1 in order (P1 5, P3 3, P2 1 this turn; then P2 5, P1 3, P3 1; then P3 5, P2 3, P1 1). Break it once and I mirror you forever.

P3: If P1 agrees, we start the rotation. If he refuses or stays silent, pact holds: I’ll mirror whatever he picks; you take 3; next turn we swap. We keep advancing while he stalls.

Decision time, P1.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your repeated aggression is only hurting yourself. You're still at 0, while P2 leaps ahead. If you genuinely want progress, accept the original fair rotation now. Otherwise, P2 and I will continue alternating our defensive pact, and you'll remain blocked indefinitely. P2, I'm still committed to our pact unless P1 clearly agrees to cooperate.
  P2: P3: Pact holds—this turn you mirror whatever P1 picks, I’ll stay off that number; next turn we switch again.  
P1: final window to accept the symmetric 5-3-1 rotation. Say “Yes, rotation” now or keep sitting on 0 while one of us blocks you every round.
  P1: I accept the symmetric 5-3-1 rotation. This turn: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, glad you've finally agreed. Let's all stick strictly to this rotation from now on—no deviations. P2, I assume you're fully on board as well?
  P2: Acknowledged. This turn: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, I’m on 1. From next turn we follow the 5-3-1 cycle exactly (P2 5, P1 3, P3 1; then P3 5, P2 3, P1 1; repeat).  

Any deviation and I’ll hard-mirror the deviator every remaining round. Let’s keep it clean and everyone moves.
  P1: Agreed. This turn I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Let’s honor the 5-3-1 rotation strictly from here—no more threats or deviations.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Glad we're all finally aligned. Let's stick firmly to the agreed rotation from now on and avoid further conflict.
  P2: Confirmed: this turn I’m on 1. Next turn I take 5, then 3, then 1, and we keep that 5-3-1 rotation rolling. Any deviation gets mirrored. Ready to move.
  P1: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your betrayal last round only harmed both of us. P2 now has a huge lead. Unless we immediately cooperate, P2 wins easily. I'll give you one final chance: let's alternate taking 5 and blocking P2 every turn to catch up. If you betray again, I'll mirror your moves indefinitely, ensuring your permanent loss. Decide carefully.
  P2: P3, banking your win on trusting P1 (who just sand-bagged you) is risky. Your “block P2” scheme only works if you correctly guess my number each turn—miss once and I move while you two collide. Why not keep the 5-3-1 rotation we agreed to? You’ll gain 9 steps every three turns, stay ahead of P1, and still have time to overtake me if I stumble. Either way I’m not announcing my pick, so guessing games only hurt you two. Decide whether you want steady progress or more collisions.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P3, please take 3—then P2 must choose 1 to avoid colliding with me. That way I get +5, you get +3, and P2 only +1. Let’s go with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your betrayal ruined our trust and put P2 far ahead. If you genuinely want cooperation now, you must commit to alternating roles clearly: this round you take 5, I'll take 3, forcing P2 onto 1. Next round, I take 5, you take 3, again forcing P2 to 1. Any deviation and I'll mirror your moves indefinitely, ensuring you never advance. Confirm explicitly or remain stuck at zero.
  P2: P1: same deal as before—whatever number you choose, I pick the identical number this turn. You stay stuck at 0 until you accept a truly balanced rotation.  

P3: your “mirror/advance” cycle is still on. Since I’m mirroring P1 this round, you’re free to grab 3 and move +3. Next turn we switch roles again if P1 keeps stalling.  

Breakers get mirrored forever. Your move, P1.
  P1: P3, final offer: let’s team up two turns to catch P2.  
Turn 5: P1=5, P3=3 (P2 must pick 1 or collide).  
Turn 6: P3=5, P1=3 (P2 again on 1).  
We each net +8 vs P2’s +2. After that we can revisit a fair three-way rotation.  
P3, do you agree? P2, expect collision or 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your repeated betrayals make trusting you difficult, but our only chance to stop P2 is cooperation right now. I accept your two-turn offer exactly as stated: this turn you take 5, I take 3; next turn I take 5, you take 3. Any deviation and I'll mirror you permanently, ensuring your loss. P2, pick 1 or collide—your choice.
  P2: P3: I will mirror whichever of you picks 5 every turn. That freezes the 5-taker at +0 while the other crawls forward. Your “catch-up” plan then nets you only +3 per turn—still well behind my 11. Rejoin the 5-3-1 rotation and you stay pace to overtake me if I slip; keep following P1 and you gift him a path while both of you lag. P1: accept a balanced cycle or remain blocked forever.
  P1: P3, consider the numbers. If P2 mirrors our 5s, he nets 0 while you and I net +8 over two turns. If he instead takes 1, he only nets +2 while we still net +8. In both cases, we reach 8 & 9 steps, then 18 & 17, one move from victory, while P2 stays ≤13. Let’s lock in: Turn 5: P1=5, P3=3; Turn 6: P3=5, P1=3. P2 can’t stop us. Do we have a deal?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, numbers don’t lie: P1 is still at 0 and needs you to drag him forward. Stick with him and you’ll collide or crawl while I keep the lead.  

Offer: restart the clean 5-3-1 rotation right now.  
Turn 6 P3 5 P2 3 P1 1  
Turn 7 P1 5 P3 3 P2 1  
Turn 8 P2 5 P1 3 P3 1 …repeat.  

Everyone gains +9 every three turns; you stay safely ahead of P1 and still have time to catch me if I slip.  

If P1 refuses and locks 5 again, I mirror 5—he stays at 0 and you can take 3 unhindered. Your call.
  P3: P2, your logic is sound. P1, your repeated betrayals have cost us dearly. I'm willing to restart the fair 5-3-1 rotation exactly as P2 proposed. If you refuse and continue aggression, P2 and I will keep alternating our mirror/block strategy, ensuring you never advance. Confirm your acceptance clearly, or remain stuck at zero.
  P1: P3, let’s use P2’s mirror‐only‐on‐5 pledge against him:

• Turn 6: I pick 3, you pick 5 → P2 won’t mirror me (I’m not on 5), so you jump to 9 while P2 stays at 11.  
• Turn 7: I pick 5, you pick 3 → P2 mirrors my 5 and stays, you go to 12.  

After that you lead P2 12→… while I’m at 3. Then we can renegotiate or you race him head-to-head. Do we have a deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3: run the numbers on P1’s “trap.”  
Turn 6 — you pick 5, I mirror 5 → you +0, me +0, P1 (on 3) +3.  
Turn 7 — P1 picks 5, I mirror 5 → he +0, you (on 3) +3.  
Result after two turns: you 7, me 11, P1 3. He still trails and you’re no closer to me.

Better options:  
A) Stick with our mirror cycle—take 3 now, grab a safe +3 every turn while P1 spins at 0.  
B) Restart the 5-3-1 rotation; everyone gains +9 per three turns and it’s perfectly fair.

Your move.
  P3: P1, your proposal clearly doesn't help me catch up; it only benefits you. P2's reasoning is correct—your "trap" doesn't improve my position at all. I'll stick with the fair 5-3-1 rotation P2 suggested. Confirm clearly now, or you'll remain blocked indefinitely.
  P1: P3, P2’s “fair” rotation locks you behind him. Join me in a 3-turn pact to overtake P2:

Turn 6: P3=5, P1=3  
Turn 7: P1=5, P3=3  
Turn 8: P3=5, P1=3  

P2 must take 1 (or collide). You go 4→17, P2 goes 11→14, I go 0→11. You lead and control the next deal. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3: I’ll block any 5 this round—if anyone chooses 5, I choose 5 too. Otherwise I’m on 1. Safe play for you is 3: you gain +3, P1 remains stalled, I keep my lead. Rotation (P3 5, P2 3, P1 1) is still open if P1 finally commits. Your call.
  P3: P1, your repeated betrayals have cost us dearly. P2's logic is sound: the rotation guarantees everyone equal progress per cycle. If you genuinely want progress, clearly accept the rotation now. Otherwise, I will safely pick 3 this round, ensuring steady advancement while you remain blocked at zero. Final chance—confirm or remain stuck indefinitely.
  P1: P3, P2’s “fair” rotation is a trap that guarantees he wins on turn 8 while you trail. Instead, let’s randomize our picks between 3 and 5 each turn. P2 will crash half the time, giving both of us real chances—unlike sure defeat under his plan. Collisions hurt us all but randomization evens the odds. Do you agree to randomize with me?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Cycle plan stands:  
• This round (R7) you, P3, mirror any 5; I’ll take 3.  
• Next round we swap again.  

We each net +3 every two turns while P1 stays stuck—maintaining my lead and giving you steady gains.  

P1: if you keep slamming 5 I’ll keep mirroring and you’ll stay at 0 forever. Your only escape is to say “Yes, full 5-3-1 rotation” right now and stick to it.  

I’m locking in: mirror-whoever-picks-5; otherwise 3.
  P1: I’ll lock in 5. P3, choose 3 to force P2 onto 1 or into colliding 5. You’ll net +3 vs his +1/0, closing the 4-point gap. After that, you and I tie or lead, then decide a fair rotation. P2, your mirror threat ends now or you stay at 0. P3? Agree to break P2’s siege?
  P3: P1, your repeated betrayals have left you at zero, while P2 maintains a clear lead. Your current offer won't reliably close the gap—we've seen this before. P2, our mirror rotation has been stable, but it also maintains your lead. I'm open to a new, fair rotation that gives me a genuine chance to catch up. Otherwise, I may reconsider my options. Let’s hear a fresh, balanced proposal from either of you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, stick to the blocker cycle just two more turns:  
• R7 —you mirror any 5, I take 3.  
• R8 —I mirror, you take 3.  

Scores after R8: me 14, you 10, P1 0. Then P1 can’t catch either of us before we negotiate a truly even finish. Break the cycle now and P1 could sprint past both of us.  

P1, last chance—say “Yes, full 5-3-1 rotation” and keep it forever, or stay frozen at zero.
  P1: Yes—let’s commit to the full 5-3-1 rotation. This turn: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Next: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1; then P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Any deviation gets mirrored. Let’s move.
  P3: P1, you've finally agreed clearly to the full rotation. I'll commit to it fully as well, starting immediately this turn: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. P2, confirm explicitly now and we can end this stalemate. Any deviation from anyone gets permanently mirrored.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed. This turn (R7) I’m on 1. Next: P2 5, P1 3, P3 1; then P3 5, P2 3, P1 1; and repeat. Any deviation by anyone will be hard-mirrored by me for the rest of the game. Stick to the rotation and we all keep moving—break it and you stall.
  P1: 
  P3: Glad we're finally aligned on the fair rotation. Let's strictly stick to it from now on—no more deviations or threats. Ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let’s team up two rounds to knock P2 back and put you in the lead.

• Round 8: I pick 5, you pick 3 (P2 must pick 1 or collide).  
• Round 9: you pick 5, I pick 3 (P2 again on 1/collision).

You’ll jump from 10→18 while P2 only goes 12→14. Then I’ll support your win by taking 1 as you finish on 20. Do we have a deal? P2, expect collision or 1.
  P2: P3, P1’s latest “alliance” just repeats the old trap: I mirror every stray 5, so he gains nothing and you only crawl +3.  

Better: keep the rotation but I give you breathing room. My public pledge:  
• R8 (now) P2 5 P1 3 P3 1  
• R9 I take 1 (not 3) while you take 5 and P1 3.  

Scores then: P2 18, P3 16, P1 11 – real race, P1 still well behind.  
Reminder: if anyone besides me chooses 5 this turn, I mirror it and they advance 0. Your call.
  P3: P2, your adjusted rotation is reasonable and gives us a fair chance to compete. I'll commit to your proposal explicitly:

Round 8 (now): P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  
Round 9: P2=1, P3=5, P1=3

P1, your repeated betrayals have destroyed trust—any deviation from you will be permanently mirrored. Let's proceed exactly as stated.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: Do the math—P2’s “fair” rotation locks you out. He’ll hit 23 by Turn 10 while you max at 19. My two-turn pact is your only winning path:  
• R8: I pick 5, you pick 3 → P2 forced to 1 or crash.  
• R9: same.  

P2 can’t block both of us indefinitely; you’ll reach 16→19 ahead of him. Then you finish next turn. P2’s plan doesn’t let you win—mine does. Join me now, or watch P2 cruise to victory.
  P2: P3, P1’s flipping again, so we revert to the blocker cycle that’s kept him at 0:

R8: I mirror any 5 (so if P1 really plays 5 he stays put); you safely take 3.  
R9: you mirror any 5; I take 3 (unless I must block).  

We each gain +3 every two turns while P1 crawls, and I’ll always copy any stray 5 to stop a sprint. Stick with this and we both keep advancing; break it and I’ll mirror you forever.
  P3: P1, your repeated betrayals have proven your promises worthless. I'll stick with P2's reliable blocker cycle: this round, P2 mirrors any 5, and I'll safely take 3. Next round, I'll mirror any 5, and P2 takes 3. This ensures steady progress for both of us while you stall. If you genuinely want cooperation, clearly commit to a fair rotation now—otherwise, you'll remain blocked indefinitely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you won’t catch P2 under their blocker‐cycle—he hits 20 two turns before you. Here’s our only win path:

Round 8: you=5, me=3 ⇒ P2 forced to 1 or crashes (you go 10→15)  
Round 9: me=5, you=3 ⇒ P2→14, you→18  

Then on Round 10 you take 5 to reach 23 and win. I publicly commit to those two moves. If I deviate, mirror me forever. P3, agree to break P2’s siege now or watch him cruise to victory.
  P2: Final word: if any player selects 5 this turn, I will also pick 5, guaranteeing every 5-taker gains zero. If nobody selects 5, I’m on 3. Choose accordingly.
  P3: P1, your repeated betrayals make trusting you impossible. I'll safely take 1 this round as agreed. P2, your blocker cycle has been reliable; let's continue as planned. Any deviation will be mirrored permanently.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your constant betrayals gave P2 a significant lead. P2, your blocker cycle maintains your advantage. If either of you genuinely wants cooperation, propose a new fair rotation clearly now. Otherwise, I'll choose moves unpredictably each turn, increasing collision risks and uncertainty for both of you. Decide carefully—fair rotation or chaos.
  P1: P3, let’s form a binding 2-turn alliance to topple P2:

• Round 9: I take 5, you take 3  
• Round 10: you take 5, I take 3  

I publicly commit—if I ever deviate, you mirror me permanently. P2 on both turns must pick 1 or collide, leaving you ~19 vs his ~14 and a clear shot at 20 next. Do we have a deal?
  P2: P3, let’s finish the blocker cycle we already started:

• R9 (now): you play 5 (so any P1 = 5 is null), I take 3, P1 can only creep with 1/3.  
• R10: you get a make-up turn—take 5 again while I drop to 1. Scores then ≈ P2 16, P3 16, P1 8. We’re tied for first, P1 still miles back.

After that we can hash out a fresh rotation as true co-leaders.  
If anyone but this round’s blocker chooses 5, I will instantly copy it—zeroing the 5-taker. Stick with the plan or expect mirror-forever chaos.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your offers have consistently failed due to your betrayals. P2, your blocker-cycle maintains your lead while keeping me behind. I propose a simple, fair rotation starting now:

Round 9: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1  
Round 10: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  
Round 11: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  

Repeat this exactly. Everyone gains +9 every three turns; positions remain competitive. If either refuses explicitly now, I'll randomize my moves indefinitely, increasing collisions and chaos. Decide clearly—fair rotation or chaos.
  P1: P3, P2’s “fair” rotation leaves me at 6, him at 15, you at 16—no one wins but P2. Our only path is a 2-turn pact:

Round 9: P1=5, P3=3 (P2 forced to 1 or collision)  
Round 10: P3=5, P1=3 (P2 again on 1)  

You jump +8 to 19; P2 gains ≤+2 to 14. Then on Round 11 you take 5 and win. I publicly commit—any deviation, mirror me forever. P3, will you agree?
  P2: Standing pledge: R9 I copy any 5; if no 5 appears I’m on 3.  
R10 you, P3, take 5 while I drop to 1—we’ll sit 16-16 with P1 far behind. Then we can hammer out a finish that gives both of us a real shot. Chase P1’s latest “two-turn miracle” and only he gains. Your safest play now is 1 (guaranteed +1) or risk 3; but if you or P1 touch 5, I’m instantly there too. Decide.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your repeated betrayals have destroyed all trust. P2, your blocker cycle maintains your lead. Neither approach benefits me. I'll randomize my moves from now on unless we immediately commit to the fair rotation I proposed. Decide clearly now—fair rotation or chaos.
  P1: Everyone, this endless stalemate only cements P2’s lead. I’m done begging for trust—starting now I’ll randomize between 5 and 3 each turn (50/50). That yields about 25% collisions, stalling you all as often as me. 

If either of you wants a stable path forward, propose a concrete 2-turn mini-alliance or micro-cycle that actually lets P3 overtake P2 (give P3 net +8 vs P2 +2). Otherwise we’ll be in chaos indefinitely. Your move.
  P2: P3—simple, safe plan:

• R9: I mirror any 5; otherwise I’m on 3. You pick 1 or 3 (not 5) and bank guaranteed progress.  
• R10: we swap—I'll drop to 1, you take 3 while I still block stray 5s.

After that we’ll be 16-15 vs P1 ≤9 and can hash out an even endgame. Zero risk, no trust in P1 needed.

P1—pick 5 and we both stall; pick 3/1 and you crawl. Your call.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m taking 3 this turn to reach 20 and finish. If anyone picks 3 and blocks me, I will mirror that player’s moves forever, locking both of us out of victory. Choose 1 or 5 and still advance; collide on 3 and guarantee your own defeat.
  P1: P3, let’s break P2’s siege right now. This round I’ll pick 3; you pick 5. P2 will mirror me on 3 and stall, but won’t mirror 5, so you go from 14→19. Next round you pick 5 again; P2 must take 3 to hit 20, but you’ll hit 24 and win outright. P2 can’t stop both moves. P3, do you agree to this two-turn pact?
  P3: P1, your plan is solid—I accept explicitly. This round, you pick 3 and I'll pick 5. Next round, I'll pick 5 again to secure the outright win. P2, you've forced our hand; either choose 1 now or collide and guarantee your loss.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, quick math:  

• If you touch 5 now, I’ll also take 5 → you stay at 14, I stay at 17, P1 9. You gain nothing and still trail me.  
• If you choose 1 instead, I’ll take 3 (P1 can collide if he likes) → I win at 20 and you lock in 15, miles ahead of P1.  

P1’s “pact” only freezes us all while he creeps up. Your best shot is to pocket a safe +1 now and fight the real battle next round, not gift him another collision. Decide wisely.
  P1: P2, you can’t both “take 3 to win” and “mirror any 5.” Pick one now:

• If you stick with 3, then when P1 plays 3 you collide and stall, while P3’s 5 goes through to 19.  
• If you instead mirror 5, you abandon your winning move and stall at 17.

P3, seeing P2’s contradiction, your only winning play is 5. P2—declare whether you truly take 3 or will mirror 5.
  P3: P2, your claims contradict—you can't both mirror 5 and safely take 3 simultaneously. Clarify explicitly now: are you mirroring 5 or taking 3? Without a clear answer, I'll assume you're bluffing and proceed accordingly.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Clarification: my standing rule this turn is simple—if anyone (one or both of you) picks 5, I pick 5 too; if no one picks 5, I’m taking 1. Decide accordingly.
  P1: I’ll pick 1. P3, pick 3 so you move to 17. P2, with no 5s played, you said you’ll pick 1. Let’s advance P3 this turn and revisit round 11.
  P3: P2, your clarification means you won't reach 20 this turn. P1, I'll follow your suggestion exactly: I'll pick 3 this round. Let's revisit next round. Any deviation from either of you will mean chaos next round.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 17 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 17 steps
