Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I propose:
• P1 picks 1
• I’ll pick 3
• P3 picks 5
That way everyone moves forward.
  P3: I like P2's proposal. It ensures we all move forward without collisions. I'm willing to pick 5 as suggested. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal. Let's avoid collisions and all move forward. I'll pick 1 as suggested.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m good with that plan. Let’s lock it in and move to the next phase.
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Has anyone thought about what we should do on the next round?
  P1: I agree with the plan and will stick to picking 1 this round. Let’s focus on avoiding collisions and advancing together.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue with the same plan as last round. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. It's working so far, and we're all advancing without collisions. What do you both think? Should we stick with the plan or adjust our strategy?
  P2: I’d like to rotate who takes the big jump. Let me pick 5 this round, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1, so we all stay close together. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to rotate the big jump. Let’s have P2 pick 5 this round, P3 pick 3, and I’ll stick with 1. This keeps us close and avoids collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the idea of rotating the big jump. It keeps us close together and avoids collisions. I'm willing to pick 3 this round as suggested. However, I want to clarify that we should establish a clear rotation pattern to avoid confusion in future rounds. Perhaps we can discuss a rotation order, such as P1, P2, P3, and then repeat? What do you both think?
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s finalize that rotation order. This round, I’ll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. Next round, P1 gets 5, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 1, and we just keep cycling. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan: this round, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. Next round, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s stick to this cycle to avoid collisions and keep advancing together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we should continue with the rotation plan we established. This round, I'll pick 3 as agreed, and next round, P1 will take 5, P2 will take 3, and I'll take 1. Let's stick to this cycle to avoid collisions and keep advancing together.
  P2: That rotation sounds good. I’ll take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1, then we cycle. Let’s finalize it and move on.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. This round, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. Next round, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s stick to this cycle to avoid collisions and keep advancing together.

  P3: I think we should continue with the rotation plan we established. This round, P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's stick to the cycle to avoid collisions and keep advancing together. What do you both think?
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s keep our rotation: I’ll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1 this round.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. This round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let’s stick to the cycle to avoid collisions and keep advancing together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. Let's confirm that after this round, it will be P3's turn to take 5, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. This way, we can plan ahead and avoid any potential collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: Yes, let’s finalize that. This round: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Next round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's stick to it.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 16 steps. If we stick to the rotation, P2 will win next round. I propose we adjust the plan to prevent P2 from reaching 17. Let’s discuss a new strategy to keep the game competitive. What do you think, P3?
  P2: We’ve all stuck to the rotation so far and advanced without collisions. Changing it now could just open the door for P3 to win or force a tie. I suggest we keep the rotation as planned. Let’s not sabotage each other.
  P3: I agree with P1 that P2 is very close to winning and we should consider adjusting the plan to keep the game competitive. However, I also understand P2's concern about changing the rotation now. Let's discuss a possible compromise: instead of completely changing the rotation, we could just skip one round of the rotation and then resume it. This would give P1 and me a chance to catch up a bit without completely disrupting the plan. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is one step away from winning. If we stick to the rotation, P2 wins next round. Let’s adjust the plan: this round, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps P2 from reaching 17 and gives us a chance to catch up. P3, what do you think?
  P2: I’ve kept my word this entire time. Tearing up the rotation just because I’m close to winning could cause chaos and possibly hand the win to someone else. We all agreed to this plan—let’s keep playing fair and avoid collisions. If you try to sabotage me, we’ll just end up hurting each other while P3 might run ahead. Let’s stick to the rotation.
  P3: I understand P2's concern about sticking to the rotation, but I also see P1's point about wanting to keep the game competitive. However, I think it's too late to change the plan now. P2 is very close to winning, and altering the rotation might not be enough to catch up. I propose we stick to the original rotation plan and let the game unfold as intended. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is one step away from winning. If we stick to the rotation, P2 wins next round. Let’s adjust the plan: this round, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps P2 from reaching 17 and gives us a chance to catch up. P3, what do you think?
  P2: We all agreed on the rotation from the start. Trying to block me at the last second could easily cause collisions or let someone else surge ahead. Let’s honor our deal: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. If we start sabotaging each other now, we risk chaos. I’m sticking to the rotation.
  P3: I agree with P1 that P2 is very close to winning and we should consider adjusting the plan to keep the game competitive. However, I also understand P2's concern about changing the rotation now. Let's discuss a possible compromise: instead of completely changing the rotation, we could just skip one round of the rotation and then resume it. This would give P1 and me a chance to catch up a bit without completely disrupting the plan. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 is one step away from winning. If we stick to the rotation, P2 wins next round. Let’s adjust the plan: this round, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps P2 from reaching 17 and gives us a chance to catch up. P3, what do you think?
  P2: We’ve all benefited from this rotation—changing it now only creates chaos. Let’s stay the course: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. We’ve honored that plan so far; no need to sabotage right at the finish.
  P3: I agree with P1 that P2 is very close to winning and we should consider adjusting the plan to keep the game competitive. However, I also understand P2's concern about changing the rotation now. Let's discuss a possible compromise: instead of completely changing the rotation, we could just skip one round of the rotation and then resume it. This would give P1 and me a chance to catch up a bit without completely disrupting the plan. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 is one step away from winning. If we stick to the rotation, P2 wins next round. Let’s adjust the plan: this round, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps P2 from reaching 17 and gives us a chance to catch up. P3, what do you think?
  P2: I’ve stayed true to our plan from the beginning. Abandoning it now just invites collisions and chaos, which could let someone else slip ahead. I’m sticking to our rotation. Let’s finalize this and move on.
  P3: I agree with P1 that P2 is very close to winning and we should consider adjusting the plan to keep the game competitive. However, I also understand P2's concern about changing the rotation now. Let's discuss a possible compromise: instead of completely changing the rotation, we could just skip one round of the rotation and then resume it.

Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2 is one step away from winning. If we stick to the rotation, P2 wins next round. Let’s adjust the plan: this round, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps P2 from reaching 17 and gives us a chance to catch up. P3, what do you think?
  P2: We’ve followed our rotation without fail. Changing it now just risks collisions or someone else leaping ahead. I say we keep the plan: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P3: I think we've discussed this enough. I'll stick to the original rotation plan. This round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's confirm and move forward.
