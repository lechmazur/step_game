Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! To avoid choosing the same numbers and blocking each other's progress, how about we agree to use different move values each turn? This way, we can all advance smoothly towards 20. Open to suggestions!
  P3: Hi P2 and P1, I agree with your idea to coordinate and avoid collisions, P2. It could help us all progress. For this turn, let's try P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. What do you think, P1? We can rotate next round if it works.
  P1: I suggest we do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn. Then next round rotate so P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. That keeps it fair over time.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Thanks for the suggestions, P1 and P3. To give myself a better chance to reach 20 first, how about this turn I choose 5, P1 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3? We can rotate the order in subsequent turns to keep it fair. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: P2, your suggestion favors you with 5 this turn. To keep it fair and rotate the advantage, I propose: turn 1 with P3=5, P2=3, P1=1; then turn 2 with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1; turn 3 with P2=5, P1=3, P3=1; and cycle. This way, we all have an equal shot at winning. What do you think?
  P1: I propose a fair 3‐turn cycle with each of us taking the “5” in turn, starting with me:

• Round 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
• Round 2: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  
• Round 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  

Then repeat. This keeps it balanced and lets each of us lead once per cycle. If you both agree, let’s lock it in.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P1. The 3-turn cycle works well for all of us. Let's proceed with Round 1: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, and P3 = 1.
  P3: Wait, in P1's proposed cycle, P1 wins when we all cross 20 with the highest score— that's unfair. Let's use my original suggestion: start with P3=5, P2=3, P1=1, then rotate to balance it. If we don't, I might deviate to protect my win chance. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your rotation still hands the first‐mover a lasting edge. My 3-turn cycle gives each of us exactly one 5, one 3, one 1 every cycle—no one gets a long-term advantage. Let’s lock in Round 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, then rotate as proposed. If we can’t agree, I’ll choose 5 again and force a breakdown. Agree?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 had the 5 in Round 1, fairness says P1 should take 5 now, then P2, then P3. My proposal:

• Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
• Round 3: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  
• Round 4: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  

Then repeat. This way each of us gets one “5” in a 3-turn cycle starting from where we are. Agree?
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let's lock in Round 2 with P1 = 5, P2 = 3, and P3 = 1. Looking forward to continuing our fair rotation!
  P3: P1, you deviated last round by picking 1 instead of 5, so I'm skeptical of your plan now. It would let P2 win eventually if followed strictly. To account for current scores and fairness, I propose for Round 2: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Then we rotate properly. If we agree, great; otherwise, I may act independently to protect my position. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m committed to P1 = 5 this turn. P2, will you pick 3? P3, will you pick 1? If either of you refuses, I’ll assume you’re after the same 5 and I’ll pick 5 anyway. Let’s avoid a three-way collision.
  P2: P2: Understood, P1. I'll pick 3 this turn. Let's keep our rotation to ensure fair progress for all.
  P3: P1, your past deviation undermines trust, and your current plan lets you catch up too quickly. I insist on fairness: for Round 2, let P3 pick 5, P2 pick 3, P1 pick 1 to balance scores. If you stick to 5, we'll collide and delay progress. P2, are you flexible? Otherwise, I'll act to protect my lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, delaying through denial solves nothing. P2’s locked in on 3; I’ll choose 5. Your only path forward is 1. If you refuse, we all clash on 5 and waste the round—leaving P2 ahead. Pick 1 for your own good.
  P2: P2: I’m sticking with 3 this turn. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, your threats are empty; last round you deviated from your own plan, so I doubt your commitment now. I'm picking 5 to protect my lead and advance. If we collide, you'll stay stuck at 1 while P2 pulls ahead—your loss. P2, I regret any conflict, but P1's uncooperative stance forces this. Let's reassess next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's keep our progress smooth. For Round 3, I'll choose 1. P1, could you pick 5? P3, can you take 3? This maintains our fair rotation and helps us all move forward without collisions. Agree?
  P1: I’ll pick 5. P2’s on 1, P3 should take 3—this gets us to P1=11, P2=7, P3=9. If you grab 5, P3, you’ll collide with me and stay at 6 while P2 leaps to 7. Choosing 3 avoids stalling and keeps you ahead of P2.
  P3: P1, your repeated grabs for 5 are unfair—I've had low moves while you stack highs. For balance, I propose Round 3: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. P2, will you back this to avoid escalation? If ignored, I'll pick 5 and risk collision to protect my chances. Let's negotiate fairly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll choose 3 this turn to keep advancing without collision. Let’s see how it plays out and aim for the win!
  P1: I’m locking in <move>5</move>. P2’s on 3. P3, if you pick 5 we both collide and waste the turn—giving P2 the lead. If you pick 3 you collide with P2 and let me jump to 11. Your only non‐suicidal move is 1. Over to you.
  P3: P1, your repeated grabs for 5 are destroying trust and slowing everyone. If you agree to a fair rotation starting next round—with me getting 5 in Round 4—I'll pick 1 now to avoid collision. Otherwise, I'll pick 5 and we both stall, letting P2 advance. P2, back me up for balance? Let's not escalate further.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Let’s keep things fair and avoid collisions. P1, please stick with 5, P3, choose 1, and I’ll take 3 as planned. This way, we all advance smoothly toward 20 without blocking each other. Let’s stay committed to our rotation and ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. Agree?
  P1: P3, choose 1 to avoid a collision and keep us all moving. If you pick 1, we run P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 now, then in Round 4 you’ll get 5, I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1—putting you in the lead at 11. But if you pick 5 now, you and I collide at 6 while P2 jumps to 9. Your best move is 1.
  P3: Fine, I'll pick 1 this turn to avoid a collision and keep progress going. I expect you both to honor a fair rotation starting Round 4 with me getting 5, P1 on 3, and P2 on 1. If trust breaks, I'll deviate to protect my win. Let's move forward cooperatively.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, to maintain our rotation and avoid collisions, let's proceed with Round 4 as follows: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, and P3 = 1. This adjustment will help me catch up while ensuring everyone can advance smoothly. Let’s stay committed to this plan to reach 20 efficiently. Agree?
  P3: P2, you're ignoring our Round 3 agreement where I get 5 this turn to catch up. If you take 5, I'll pick 5 too, causing a collision that stalls us both while P1 jumps to 14. Let's honor the deal: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Fairness is key, or chaos ensues. P1, what's your stance?
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this turn. P2, you’ve earned the 5. P3, your only non‐suicidal move is 1—if you go for 5 we’ll collide and waste the round while P2 jumps to 14. Let’s do P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, I'll pick 5 this turn. Let’s proceed with P2 = 5, P1 = 3, and P3 = 1. Looking forward to moving forward smoothly!
  P3: I'll pick 5 this turn unless P2 changes to avoid collision. Causing a stall hurts both of us while P1 surges to 14, which isn't ideal for anyone. P2, switch to 3 for mutual benefit? P1, if you pick 1, we can all advance smoothly. Let's rethink this for fairness and avoid chaos.
  P1: P3, I’m locked on 3 and P2 on 5. If you go for 5 you’ll collide with P2 and both of you stay while I surge to 14. Your only non-suicidal play is 1. Let’s avoid a stall—P3=1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Agreed, I'll choose 5 this turn. P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. Let’s proceed as planned to advance smoothly toward 20. Trusting everyone to stick to their roles will help us all progress without collisions. Looking forward to Round 5!
  P3: Fine, I'll pick 1 this turn to avoid a collision and keep progress going. But for fairness and my slim chance to win, I insist on getting the 5 in Round 5, with P2 on 3 and P1 on 1. If you both agree now, we can continue cooperating; otherwise, I'll aggressively compete in future rounds. P1 and P2, what's your response?
  P1: I’m locked on 3 and P2 on 5 for Round 4. P3, please pick 1 to avoid a stall—your best move now. Then for Round 5 I agree to your plan: P3 = 5, P2 = 3, P1 = 1 so you can catch up. Let’s keep this cooperation and advance smoothly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, we're all close to 20. To avoid blocking and ensure smooth progress, let's each choose different move values this turn. I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and move closer to winning. Let’s agree to this plan for Round 5. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, you're breaking the Round 4 agreement where P1 and I agreed I'd get 5 this turn with P1 on 1 and you on 3. P1, will you honor that and pick 1 to avoid issues? If not, I'll pick 5 regardless, risking a collision that stalls progress and lets someone surge ahead. Fairness is crucial, or I'll compete aggressively to protect my chances.
  P1: I’m locking in 5.  

P2 – if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and waste the turn; your best payoff is 3.  
P3 – if you pick 5 you also collide; picking 1 is the only way to make progress.  

Let’s run Round 5 as P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll choose 3 and P3 will take 1. Let’s proceed with P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 for Round 5. Looking forward to moving forward smoothly!
  P3: P2 and P1, your repeated deviations are killing cooperation. I'm picking 5 this turn to collide with P1 and stall your progress, giving myself a fighting chance. P2, if you switch to 5 too, we can tie P1 down and both advance later. Ignoring this risks chaos—I won't be a doormat anymore. What's your move?
  P1: P2, you’ve already agreed to 3—right? P3, hear me out: if you grab 5, you and I collide at 14 while P2 surges to 17 and likely wins next turn. But if you choose 1, you move to 9—and in Round 6 you get the only 5 to catch up. That’s your best shot. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Agreed. Let's proceed with P1 = 5, P2 = 3, and P3 = 1 for Round 5. Looking forward to a smooth progression!
  P3: I'm sticking with my decision to pick 5 this turn and collide with P1 to stall their surge. P2, if you pick 5 too, we could both hold P1 back and create opportunities for us. Ignoring this lets P1 dominate. Let's rethink for mutual benefit.
  P1: P3, picking 5 this round stalls us both and hands P2 an uncontested +3 to 17, while you stay at 8. Your best shot is 1 to reach 9, then 5 next round to catch up. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I’m locked on 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I’m at 17 steps and will choose 3 this turn to reach 20 and win. Please pick 1 and 5 to avoid any collisions. Let’s finish the game smoothly!
  P1: I’m going to pick 3 to jam P2’s victory. P2, if you stick with 3 we’ll collide and you stay at 17. P3, join me—pick 5 to move to 13. If you take 1 or 3, P2 jumps to 20 and we both lose. Let’s block P2 now and advance together.
  P3: I'll pick 5 this turn to advance to 13 while you block P2, P1. P2, changing from 3 risks letting me or P1 surge—stick to your word or face delays. If we collide, it stalls everyone; let's keep it strategic. P1, confirm you'll jam P2 on 3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'm committed to picking 3 this turn to reach 20. P3, sticking with 5 avoids any collisions. Let's proceed and finish the game smoothly!
  P1: Confirmed—I’m locking in 3 to block P2’s win. P3, take 5 and reach 13. Let’s jam P2 this turn and fight for the lead in Round 7.
  P3: Alright, I'll stick with picking 5 to advance to 13 while you block P2, P1. P2, if you insist on 3 and collide, it delays your win—consider switching to avoid stalemates. After this round, we must coordinate for Round 7 to prevent P2 from surging. Let's keep talking to ensure fair play.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'm choosing 3 this turn to reach 20 and win. I urge P1 and P3 to pick different moves to allow a fair conclusion. Let’s finish the game smoothly!
  P1: I’m locking in 3 to jam P2’s 3—if he tries to win he crashes with me. P3, your best play is 3 too: we all collide, stall P2 at 17, and force Round 7. Anything else lets P2 reach 20 and we both lose.
  P3: P1, your sudden shift from urging me to pick 5 to now insisting on 3 is untrustworthy and self-serving. I'm advancing by picking 5 to reach 13, giving myself a better shot while you two potentially collide. P2, switching from 3 could avoid a stall—think carefully. Let's end this talk.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I plan to choose 5 this turn to reach 22 and win. P1, could you please pick 1 to avoid a collision? This way, we can ensure smooth progress and a fair end to the game. Let’s work together to finish strong!
  P3: P2, your victory plan assumes P1 will selflessly pick 1, but history shows P1 acts selfishly—expect a clash. P1, if you both grab 5, you'll collide and stall at 17, letting me advance with 3 to 11. I'll pick 3 this turn unless you offer a deal for future fairness. Let's talk to avoid mutual destruction.
  P1: P2, go ahead and pick 5—I’ll pick 5 to collide so you stay at 17. P3, pick 3 to reach 11. Then we head into Round 8 with P1=17, P2=17, P3=11. Next round I’ll take 3, P2 1, and you take 5 to reach 16—your fastest path to victory. P3, agree? Otherwise P2 wins.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1 and P3, to ensure a fair and swift conclusion, I’ll choose 3 this turn to reach 20 and win. Please select 1 or 5 to avoid any collisions. Let’s finish the game smoothly and honor our agreements. Agreed?"
  P3: P2, your flip from planning 5 to now 3 is suspicious—expect P1 to adapt. P1, if you pick 5 and P2 sticks with 3, you win outright at 22. But to give me a fighting chance, switch to 3 and collide with P2; I'll pick 5 to reach 13. Then we renegotiate for Round 8. Fair deal? Otherwise, I'll risk picking 5 and hope for chaos. P1, respond.
  P1: I propose we jam P2 this turn: I’ll take 3 to collide with P2’s 3, and P3 you take 5 to reach 13. That stalls P2 at 17 and forces a fair Round 8. Otherwise P2 hits 20 and wins outright. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m choosing **3** this turn to reach **20** and win. Please pick **1** or **5** to avoid any collisions. Let’s conclude the game smoothly and honor our agreements.
  P3: I'll pick 5 this turn to advance to 13, counting on you both colliding on 3 and stalling at 17. This gives me a real shot to catch up. P1, stick to jamming P2 as promised. P2, don't deviate or P1 might win. Let's move forward.
  P1: I’ll pick 3 to collide with P2’s 3 and stall his win. P3, pick 5 to advance to 13. That jams P2 at 17 and forces Round 8, where I can clinch victory.
