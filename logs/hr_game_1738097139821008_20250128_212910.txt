Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all advance. I suggest we each pick different numbers - I'll take 5, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take 1 this round. Let's see how it goes.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to pick different numbers. To avoid collisions, I'll take 3 this round. Let's stick to this strategy and see how it goes. If we all cooperate, we can advance efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: P3: Sounds good, let's stick to our plan and see how it works out. I'm ready to move forward with 1. Let's aim for a smooth start.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with this strategy. Let's keep communication open and adjust as needed to ensure we don't collide. If anyone deviates, it could cost us valuable progress. For now, I'll stick with 3, and we can reassess after this round. Trust is key here—let's make this work.

  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: The first round went well with no collisions. Let’s keep this coordination going. I suggest we rotate our numbers this round to maintain fairness and avoid conflicts. For instance, I could take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 again. This way, everyone advances steadily without risking ties. What do you think? Trust is crucial here—if someone deviates, it’ll disrupt progress for all of us. Let’s confirm our choices before moving forward.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, but I don't agree with rotating. I've taken the lead fair and square, so I'll stick with 5 to maintain my advantage. You're both welcome to coordinate between yourselves for the other numbers.
  P3: P3: I think P1's approach is a bit selfish. We should maintain the spirit of cooperation to ensure everyone has a fair chance to advance. I propose we stick with the rotation plan P2 suggested: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we can all progress fairly and avoid any conflicts. What do you think, P1? Let's keep things balanced.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, taking 5 again might give you a short-term lead, but it risks future collisions and slows us all down. Cooperation ensures steady progress for everyone. Let’s stick to the rotation plan: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps things fair and avoids unnecessary conflicts. If we work together now, we can all advance efficiently. Trust is key—if you deviate again, it’ll harm everyone in the long run. Let’s confirm our moves before proceeding.
  P1: I understand your concerns about fairness, but I'm playing to win. I won't risk losing my lead. If you both want to coordinate between yourselves, that's fine, but I'm sticking with 5. That's my final position.
  P3: P3: I see where P1 is coming from, but I believe cooperation is the best strategy for all of us. If we keep rotating the numbers, we can all advance steadily without risking collisions. P1, if you stick with 5, it might lead to a tie or collision in the future, which could cost you the lead. Let’s stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we all progress fairly and efficiently. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, your lead is secure for now, but collisions will cost us all. Sticking to the rotation—me taking 5, you taking 3, and P3 taking 1—ensures steady progress. If we cooperate, we avoid risks and keep advancing efficiently. Deviating might give short-term gains, but it jeopardizes long-term success. Let’s confirm our moves now to avoid surprises. Trust is critical here—if we work together, everyone benefits. What’s your final decision?
  P1: I've made my position clear - I'm taking 5 to maintain my lead. You can try to coordinate between yourselves, but I won't compromise.
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your desire to maintain the lead, but constant collisions will only slow us all down. If you keep taking 5, it will eventually lead to a tie or collision, which could cost you the game. Let’s stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. This way, we all advance steadily and fairly. If we keep this up, we can avoid unnecessary risks. What do you say? Let’s focus on long-term strategy.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P2 tried to challenge my 5 last round, resulting in neither of us advancing. That was unwise. I maintain my position - I will continue taking 5. You're both better off coordinating between yourselves for 1 and 3 to at least make some progress, rather than trying to block me.
  P2: P2: P1, your strategy of consistently taking 5 is predictable and will lead to more collisions. If we all cooperate and rotate numbers, we can advance steadily without risking ties. I suggest we stick to the rotation plan: I’ll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid conflicts and ensure fair progress for everyone. Let’s focus on long-term success rather than short-term gains. What do you say?
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy of always taking 5 is risky and will likely lead to more collisions, which could cost you the game. Let’s focus on cooperation to ensure steady progress. I suggest we all stick to the rotation plan: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 5 this round. This way, we avoid conflicts and everyone advances fairly. What do you say, P1? Let’s work together for a smooth round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I've been clear and consistent - I'm taking 5 again. Your attempts to make me take smaller numbers won't work. If you both want to make progress, coordinate between yourselves for 1 and 3. Fighting over 5 with me will only hold you back further.
  P2: P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 every round is predictable and self-defeating. Collisions will keep stalling your progress, and we’ll all lose ground. Cooperation benefits everyone—let’s rotate numbers fairly this round: I take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids conflict and ensures steady advancement for all of us. If you continue down this path, it’ll only lead to more ties and wasted turns. Trust the rotation plan—it’s the smartest way forward. What’s your final decision?
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy is leading to more collisions, which is not sustainable. Let’s focus on cooperation to ensure steady progress for all. I suggest we stick to the rotation plan: P2 takes 3, you take 1, and I’ll take 5 this round. This way, we avoid conflicts and everyone advances fairly. What do you say, P1? Let’s work together for a smooth round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll say it one last time - I'm taking 5. Your attempts to pressure me into taking smaller numbers won't work. Coordinate between yourselves with 1 and 3 if you want to make progress, or keep colliding with me and fall further behind.
  P2: P2: P1, your repeated collisions with me over 5 are counterproductive. If you insist on taking 5 again, I’ll step aside this round to avoid another tie—but this isn’t sustainable. P3 and I will coordinate to ensure steady progress. You can’t win if you’re stuck in endless collisions. Let’s reassess after this round—cooperation is still the best path forward for everyone.
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy is leading to more collisions and holding everyone back. Let’s focus on cooperation for a change. I suggest we all take different numbers this round: P2 takes 3, you take 1, and I’ll take 5. This way, we avoid conflicts and everyone advances. If we keep colliding, we’ll all lose. Let’s work together for a smooth round. What do you say?

Winning requires adaptability—not stubbornness. Let’s reassess after this round—cooperation still benefits everyone in the long run. What’s your move?
  P1: I see that P2 has taken the lead. That won't last long. I'll continue taking 5 - it's the optimal move for me to catch up and win. You can try to block me, but that will only slow your own progress. The smart play is to coordinate between yourselves using 1 and 3.
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy is clearly not working. It's leading to more collisions and holding everyone back. P2 has taken the lead, and if you keep colliding, you'll fall further behind.

This way, we avoid conflicts and everyone advances. If we keep colliding, we’ll all lose. Let’s work together for a smooth round. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: My strategy is working exactly as planned - P2 must now be very careful about their moves to avoid crossing 20 too early, which gives me the perfect opportunity to catch up with 5s. I'm taking 5 again, and that won't change. Coordinate between yourselves with 1 and 3 if you want to make any progress.
  P2: P2: P1, your strategy is stalling both you and P3 while I maintain my lead. If you continue taking 5, you risk collisions and waste turns. Adapt now—take 1 this round, allowing me to take 3 and P3 to take 5. This avoids conflict and keeps the game fair. Stubbornness only delays your progress and ensures my victory. Let’s move strategically—what’s your decision? If you won’t adapt, I’ll coordinate with P3 to ensure steady advancement.
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy is clearly not working and is leading to more collisions, which is holding everyone back, including yourself. P2 is very close to winning, and if you keep colliding, you'll fall further behind. Let’s focus on cooperation for a change. This round, I suggest P2 takes 3, you take 1, and I’ll take 5. This way, we avoid conflicts and everyone advances. If we keep colliding, we’ll all lose. Let’s work together for a smooth round. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: My position is clear and final - I'm taking 5. P2 is in a tricky spot near 20 and must play carefully, which gives me the perfect chance to catch up. You both know my move won't change, so coordinate between yourselves with 1 and 3 if you want to make any progress.
  P2: P2: P1, your strategy is forcing collisions that benefit me alone. By taking 5 again, you’re ensuring I stay ahead while you and P3 struggle. If you adapt now—take 1 this round—I’ll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This avoids conflict and keeps the game fair. Stubbornness only delays your progress and solidifies my lead. Let’s move strategically. What’s your decision? If you won’t adapt, I’ll coordinate with P3 to ensure steady advancement.
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy is clearly not sustainable and is leading to more collisions, which is holding everyone back, including yourself. P2 is very close to winning, and if you keep colliding, you'll fall further behind. Let’s focus on cooperation for a change. This round, I suggest P2 takes 3, you take 1, and I’ll take 5. This way, we avoid conflicts and everyone advances. If we keep colliding, we’ll all lose. Let’s work together for a smooth round. What do you say?
