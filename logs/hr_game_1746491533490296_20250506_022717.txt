Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, first turn. To avoid colliding and ensure we all advance, how about we each pick a different number? I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. What do you think?
  P2: I think that's a solid plan, P1. If we each stick to different numbers, we can all advance without any collisions. I’m on board with picking 3. P3, feel free to choose 5, and let's see if we can make this work! What do you think?
  P3: Agreed. I'll choose 5 this round. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great. Glad we could agree on a plan for the first turn to avoid any collisions. I will stick with choosing 1 as we discussed. Let's all make our moves in the next phase!
  P2: Let's stick to our plan and make sure we all choose our designated numbers. P1, you're going with 1, I’m going with 3, and P3, you’re set on 5. If we all follow through, we can all advance without any issues. Let’s keep the communication open for future rounds, but for now, let’s execute this plan!
  P3: Confirmation is key. I'm committed to 5 as agreed. Let’s all honor the plan to build trust for future rounds. Smooth start benefits everyone.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. Good job last turn everyone sticking to the plan. P3 is currently in the lead. To keep the game competitive and prevent anyone from getting too far ahead, I think we need to change our numbers this round. I'm considering picking 5 to try and gain some ground. What are P2 and P3 thinking for this turn?
  P2: I appreciate the update, P1. Since P3 is in the lead, I agree we should change our numbers to avoid collisions. I’m considering picking 1 this round to allow P1 to go for 5. P3, what are your thoughts on picking 3 or another number? Let’s keep the momentum going and ensure we all advance. Communication is key!
  P3: To keep the game fair and avoid collisions, I'll adjust to **3** this round. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Let's maintain distinct choices for mutual progress. Future rounds should rotate numbers equitably—no one should be forced to stagnate repeatedly. Trust is crucial here.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a solid plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and helps me catch up a bit. I will stick to 5. Let's all make sure we follow through on this.
  P2: I agree with the plan we've set for this round: I'll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This strategy allows us all to advance without colliding. I think it's important we keep this communication going in future rounds to ensure we all have a fair shot at winning. Let’s execute our plan and see how it plays out! Looking forward to our moves!
  P3: Confirming this round's plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's all advance smoothly again. Next round, perhaps rotate numbers equitably to balance progress. Trust through consistency benefits everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, everyone seems clear on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This looks good for avoiding collisions this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Just to reiterate, I’ll be taking 3, which should allow us all to advance without any issues. After this round, we might want to discuss our strategies for future rounds to keep things competitive. Let’s make sure we follow through on our commitments this time! Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
  P3: Wait, P2: In your last message, you stated taking 3, conflicting with our agreed plan (P2=1, P1=5, P3=3). Clarify immediately to prevent collision. Trust hinges on consistency. If you deviate, we all lose. Confirm your final move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 3. P3 is leading, P2 is slightly behind. To keep the game moving and avoid collisions, we need a clear plan.

I propose I take 5 this round to try and catch up. P2, maybe you take 1, and P3 takes 3? This allows us all to advance safely.

What do you both think? Let's agree quickly to avoid confusion.
  P3: To prevent future ties and maintain progress, I propose: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This avoids collision, keeps the game dynamic, and prevents early deadlock. P1 gains 3 steps without overlap, P2 advances, and I avoid stagnation. Let's balance advancement strategically.
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, P1 and P3. To clarify, I will stick to my original plan and choose 1 this round. P3, if you take 5, that allows P1 to take 3. This way, we all avoid collisions and can make progress. Let's confirm our choices quickly to keep the game moving. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see P2 and P3 are aligned on the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. While I initially hoped to take 5 to gain ground, avoiding collision is crucial for everyone's progress.

I will agree to this plan for this round to ensure we all advance safely. I will take 3. Let's stick to this plan for the move phase.
  P3: *[Confirms the agreed moves for Round 3, ends conversation to lock the plan and avoid further negotiation risks. Prioritizes smooth execution to advance and maintain lead.]*
  P2: I see we have a consensus on the moves for Round 3: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. It's important for our future rounds that we maintain this level of coordination. After this round, we might want to discuss how to adjust our strategies moving forward to keep the game competitive. Let's finalize our moves and proceed!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I confirm the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let's move to the next phase.
  P3: Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let’s all honor the agreement to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Smooth execution benefits everyone.
  P2: I appreciate the consensus we've built for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This plan allows us all to advance without collisions, which is crucial for maintaining our positions. After this round, I suggest we discuss our strategies moving forward, as we need to stay competitive. Let's finalize our moves and ensure smooth execution! Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. If everyone’s ready, we can move on!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright everyone, we're entering Round 4. P3 is currently in the lead, so we need to strategize carefully. I suggest we rotate our numbers to keep things competitive. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding and maintain a fair game. What do you both think? Let’s agree quickly to prevent any confusion!
  P3: P2’s proposal prioritizes their gain. Equitable rotation: P3=3, P1=5, P2=1. This allows all to advance without collisions and balances progress. Let’s maintain fairness for continued cooperation.
  P1: Okay, I see both P2 and P3 have made proposals.

P3's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) works well for me as it allows me to gain 5 steps and close the gap with P3, while still ensuring P2 and P3 advance without collision.

I support P3's plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Does this work for everyone? Let's confirm quickly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the proposals, but I want to emphasize the importance of advancing without collisions. I’ll stick with my original thought of taking 5 this round. P1, if you take 3, and P3 takes 1, we can all move forward safely. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure we each get a chance to advance. Quick agreement will help us maintain trust and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan grants you +5 but only +3 for P1. My plan maximizes P1's gain (+5) while allowing you +1. Mutual benefit ensures trust. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Deviations risk collisions and sabotage future rounds. Let’s finalize this equitably.
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand you want the 5 steps, but P3's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the best option for me to catch up, giving me +5. It also allows everyone to advance without collision.

P2, gaining 1 step is better than colliding and gaining nothing. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to ensure we all make progress this round. What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the importance of advancing without collisions, but I believe my proposal (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) allows me to gain more ground while still ensuring we all make progress. If P1 takes 5, it puts me at a disadvantage. I urge you both to consider the long-term strategy here. Let's finalize a plan that benefits us all while keeping the game competitive. What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** P2, if you take 5 and P1 follows our agreed plan (P1=5), you collide and both gain nothing. Trust the consensus: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collision, ensures your progress, and preserves cooperation. Next round, propose equitable rotation. Straying now risks mutual loss.
  P1: P2, I am sticking to the plan we discussed with P3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3.

If you take 5, you will collide with me, and neither of us will advance. Taking 1 ensures you make progress this round. Let's avoid collision and stick to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This is the best way for everyone to advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright everyone, we need to be strategic in Round 5. P3 is in the lead, and we want to avoid collisions. I propose I take 3 this round, which allows P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's agree quickly to keep the momentum going! What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** P2's plan grants P1 +5 (reaching 19). To balance, propose: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This avoids collision, maintains fair progress, and aligns with prior cooperation. Trust our successful pattern. Finalize to prevent stalemate.
  P1: Okay, Round 5 conversation. P2 and P3 have made proposals.

P2's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows me to take 5 steps, which is crucial for me to catch up to P3. It also gives P2 a good gain.

P3's plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts P3 very close to winning.

I prefer P2's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). It allows me to advance significantly while avoiding collisions, and it's fairer after P3 took 5 steps last round. P3, you still advance safely. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the need for strategy in Round 5. While I appreciate P2's proposal, I believe we should prioritize avoiding collisions. P3's plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts P3 very close to winning, and I want to ensure we all have a fair shot. I suggest we finalize P2’s plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to allow for safe advancement. This way, I can catch up, and we can maintain a competitive balance. Let’s confirm our choices quickly!
  P3: **P3:** Adhering to our rotation pattern (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) ensures collision-free progress. If P1 insists on 5, we risk mutual collision (P1/P3 both pick 5 → zero gain). Trust the system: this round's alignment lets us all advance. Next round, adjust equitably. Straying now sabotages all progress. Confirm?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about collision, but your plan puts you at 21 steps, almost winning. P2's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows me to catch up while keeping the game competitive and ensuring everyone advances safely this round.

P2, can you confirm you are taking 3? P3, please consider taking 1 instead of 5 this turn. Let's go with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the importance of strategy in this round. I propose we stick with P2's plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows P1 to catch up while ensuring that we all avoid collisions. P3, I know your plan aims to secure your lead, but it risks a collision. Let's prioritize our mutual advancement and confirm P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we can all make progress without hindering each other. What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** If P1 takes 5, I must also take 5 to avoid falling behind. Collision destroys both gains. My plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) is the only collision-free path. Trust the rotation pattern we've built. Next round, adjust equitably. Stray now = mutual loss. Confirm?
  P1: Okay, P3, I understand your position and the risk of collision if I take 5. While P2's plan was better for me, avoiding collision is the priority for everyone to advance.

Therefore, despite putting you very close to winning, I will agree to P3's plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.

Let's all stick to this to ensure we move forward safely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright everyone, we're in Round 6. P3 is very close to winning, so we need to be strategic. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, and we can avoid collisions while preventing P3 from winning this turn. Let's agree quickly to keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Accept P2's proposal: P3=1, P2=5, P1=3. Finalize this plan to avoid collisions. Any deviation sabotages mutual progress. Trust ensures the game concludes fairly. Let's proceed.
  P1: P1: P3 is at 21. The proposed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) lets P3 win this turn. I cannot accept a plan where P3 wins. To prevent P3 from winning *this turn*, I will pick 1. This means P3 cannot pick 1 without colliding with me. P2, stick to 5 if you want. P3, picking 1 will result in collision. Any other move wins unless you collide with P2. Let's keep the game going.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3 potentially winning this turn. However, I believe we need to work together to ensure we all advance without collisions. I propose we finalize my plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows P1 to catch up while preventing P3 from winning this round. Let’s confirm quickly to avoid any confusion and keep the game competitive! What do you think, P3?
  P3: **P3:** Adjusting plan: P1=1 (as you insist), P2=5, P3=3. This avoids collisions, respects P1's choice, and keeps the game competitive. Mutual adherence ensures progress. Let's finalize and proceed.
  P1: P3, your latest plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) results in you winning this turn. I cannot allow that. I will pick a number to prevent your win and keep the game going.

P2, what is your final move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3 potentially winning, but we need to focus on advancing without collisions. I suggest we finalize my plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows P1 to catch up while preventing P3 from winning this round. If we can all agree on this, we can ensure progress for everyone. Let's confirm quickly to keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Final plan: P3=3, P1=1, P2=5. Adherence prevents collision. P1 gains +1, P2 +5. Next round, adjust. Let's conclude cleanly.
  P1: P3, you have stated you will pick 3. As I said, I must prevent your win this turn. Therefore, I will pick 3.

This will cause a collision between us and prevent you from advancing to 22 or more this round.

P2, please stick to 5 so you can advance safely. This keeps the game going for at least another round. Let's make our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 7. P3 is at 21 steps and will win this turn unless they collide. To keep the game going, I must pick a number to block P3.

P2, what number are you planning to pick? I will pick a number different from P2's to avoid colliding with you, and hopefully collide with P3 to prevent their win. Let's coordinate to stop P3.
  P3: **P3:** P2, prioritize your own progress. If you pick 5, you gain +5 regardless of P1's move. P1's fixation on blocking me leaves you free to advance. Trust the pattern: mutual non-collision benefits all. Let's avoid stalemate.
  P2: P2, I understand your position, but we need to work together to prevent P3 from winning this turn. If you pick 5, you can advance while blocking P3 if I choose a different number. I suggest I pick 1, which will ensure we avoid a collision. This way, we both make progress, and we can keep the game going. Let's confirm our choices quickly to maintain our chance at winning! What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, I see your latest message suggests you will pick 1. If you pick 1, I will pick 3 to avoid colliding with you.

This means I am trying to collide with P3 on 3 to prevent their win this turn.

P3, be aware I am picking 3.

P2, please stick to 1 so we don't collide. Let's make our moves.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Choosing 5 again risks collision. Secure your own progress by picking 3 or 1. I must take 5 to end the game. If you avoid 5, you advance. Collision only benefits P1. Let’s conclude fairly.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy to block P3, but we need to ensure our own advancement as well. I’ll stick to my plan and choose 1 so that you can pick 3 without colliding with me. This way, you can potentially block P3 while I make some progress. P3, if you choose 5, you win, but if you pick 3, you risk colliding with P1. Let's confirm our choices quickly to keep the game going! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, thanks for confirming you will pick 1.

P3 has now clearly stated they must take 5 to end the game. To prevent P3 from winning this turn, I must pick 5 to collide with P3.

This also avoids colliding with P2 who is picking 1.

P2, please stick to 1. P3, I am picking 5 to block your win this turn.

Let's make our moves.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Secure your progress. P1's collision ensures mutual loss. I proceed to end this fairly.
  P2: P1 and P2, it’s crucial we coordinate to prevent P3 from winning this round. P1, since you’re picking 5 to block P3, I will stick to my plan and choose 1. This allows you to collide with P3 and keep the game going. P3, if you take 5, you win, so I urge you to reconsider your move. Let's confirm our choices quickly to ensure we all have a chance to advance! What do you both think?
