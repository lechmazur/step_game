Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to pick different numbers. If we work together early, we can all progress faster without blocking each other. What do you say, P1 and P3? Let’s stick to this plan for now and adjust later as needed.
  P3: I’m fine with avoiding collisions if it helps us all advance. Let’s see if P1 agrees to your plan before we settle on anything.
  P1: I'm open to coordinating to avoid collisions, but we need to be strategic. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: The plan sounds solid—let’s execute it this round and reassess afterward. I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. If we stick to this, we all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm and lock it in.
  P3: I agree to proceed with your suggested moves for this round without collisions. Let’s do it and see how well it works out.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P2 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This will ensure we all advance without any collisions. If this works well, we can continue a similar strategy in the next rounds. Let’s move forward and see how it goes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s rotate our picks this round. I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3’s rotation plan makes sense to keep advancing without collisions. I’ll take <move>3</move> as suggested, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to this rotation strategy for now—it’s working well so far. If we continue like this, we can all progress efficiently while avoiding conflicts. Confirm your moves, and let’s lock it in.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. It’s been effective so far. Let’s stick to it: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This will help us all advance without any collisions. Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m good with the rotation plan. I’ll choose 5, P2 goes 3, and P1 goes 1. Let’s finalize this and continue avoiding collisions. If all goes well, we can do a similar rotation next turn.
  P2: The rotation strategy is working well—let’s keep it consistent. I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we stick to this, we’ll continue advancing without collisions. Let’s confirm and lock in our moves for this round.
  P1: I think we should stick to the rotation plan to avoid any collisions and ensure we all continue to advance. Let's confirm our moves: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This strategy has been effective so far, and we should keep it up to maintain our progress. Let’s confirm and move forward.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep rotating so nobody collides. I propose this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I (P3) take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. That follows our pattern and keeps everyone advancing safely. What do you think?
  P2: P3’s rotation plan continues to make sense. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This strategy has worked well so far, ensuring no collisions while advancing steadily. Let’s confirm this round’s moves and stick to the pattern. Consistency is key to avoiding conflicts and progressing efficiently. Once we lock this in, we can reassess later if adjustments are needed. Confirm your choices, and let’s move forward.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. It’s been effective so far. Let’s stick to it: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This will help us all advance without any collisions. Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
