Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions: I propose P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this round. We all advance, no one left behind early. Thoughts?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  P3, do you agree with this plan?
  P3: That plan works for me too—I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions. Let's all stick to it so we all move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Apologies for the mix-up last round—I went for 5 thinking P1 might switch too. Let’s reset and try again. How about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1. That way, we avoid collisions and all move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, you stabbed us in the back last round by grabbing 5 instead of 1—trust is broken. Your new plan lets P2 surge to 8 while we lag. Counter-proposal: P1 (me) takes 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1 (to 4), P3 takes 3 (to 3). Fairer spread, no one dominates early. P2, thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but accusing P3 of stabbing you in the back isn't helpful.  Let's focus on moving forward. How about this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps a more even playing field.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2’s suggestion seems balanced and fair: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. That keeps us all moving without giving anyone a big lead. I’m on board with that if you both are. Let’s make it work this time.
  P1: P2's plan works for me: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This gets us all moving evenly, and I'll trust you both this time. No more betrayals, let's stick to it for mutual progress.
  P2: Okay, I'll take 1.  Let's stick to this plan this time.  P1 and P3, please confirm you're taking 5 and 3 respectively so we can all move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I know trust is shaky, but let's try one more time to coordinate. Here's a fair plan: P1 takes 5 (to 8), P2 takes 3 (to 7), I take 1 (to 6). That keeps us close and avoids collisions. If we keep sabotaging each other, none of us will win. Let's play smart.
  P2: I'm going to choose 5 this round.  I suggest P1 choose 1 and P3 choose 3.  This keeps things relatively even and allows us all to advance.  If we can't agree and someone else chooses 5, the blame game won't get us anywhere. Let's just try to make some progress.
  P1: P2, your plan lets you jump to 9 while we lag—too self-serving after the betrayals. P3's proposal is better, but let's tweak for fairness: I'll take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 3 (to 8), P2 takes 1 (to 5). We tie at the top, P2 catches up soon. Agree, or we're all stalling again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1’s tweak is fair—puts us both at 8 and gives P2 a chance to catch up. I’m willing to take 3 if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. Let’s lock this in and stop wasting turns. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire for a perfectly even playing field, but constantly tweaking proposals is getting us nowhere.  My proposed 5, 3, 1 split (me 5, P1 1, P3 3) is the simplest way to make progress this round.  Let's just do it and re-evaluate next round based on the actual standings.
  P1: P2, your plan puts you way ahead at 9 while I'm stuck at 4—that's not fair or simple, it's greedy. Stick to my proposal: I'll take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 3 (to 8), you take 1 (to 5). We tie the lead, you catch up next. P3 already agreed. Confirm and let's advance without more drama, or we're all stalling again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're asking for trust while grabbing the biggest lead—doesn't add up. P1’s plan is the only fair one: P1 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. That puts P1 and me at 8, you at 5—still competitive. Rejecting it just signals you're playing selfish. Let’s stop wasting time. Confirm this and let’s move.
  P2: Fine, I'll take 1.  P1 take 5 and P3 take 3. Let's just move on.
  P1: Agreed, P2—thanks for compromising. P3, confirm you'll take 3 as planned so we all advance evenly: me to 8, you to 8, P2 to 5. No more tricks; let's build some trust and progress. If we're good, I'm ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're leading at 8, but P2 just sabotaged us both last round by grabbing 5 instead of 1—colliding with me and letting you pull ahead. Trust is zero. Let's try a simple plan: I'll take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 1 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 7). Keeps us competitive without collisions. Agree, or we're all stalling while you coast? P2, no more greed—confirm.
  P3: P1, your proposal unfairly benefits you—jumping from 3 to 8—while I inch forward to 9 and P2 catches up to 7. I’m already ahead, so I have no incentive to help you surge. Here’s a fairer plan: I take 1 (to 9), P2 takes 5 (to 9), P1 takes 3 (to 6). That keeps you in the game without letting you leapfrog. P2, you’ve been aggressive—this lets you tie me without collision. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I understand wanting to maintain your lead, but your plan still puts me significantly behind. Let's compromise: I take 5 (to 9), you take 1 (to 9), P1 takes 3 (to 6).  This ties us for the lead and keeps P1 in the running.  It's the fairest option.  Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plans tie you at 9 while I'm stuck at 6—that's not fair, it's you two colluding to bury me. Counter: I take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 3 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 5). P3 pulls ahead safely, I catch up a bit, P2 doesn't surge. This avoids collisions and keeps it competitive. Agree, or I'll pick whatever to force a stall? Confirm.
  P3: P1, your proposal is clearly self-serving—you jump 5 steps while P2 stalls at 1 and I burn 3 to help you catch up? Not happening. I’m sticking with my original plan: I take 1 (to 9), P2 takes 5 (to 9), you take 3 (to 6). That keeps everyone competitive and avoids collisions. P2 already agreed. P1, take 3 or risk another wasted round. Let’s move.
  P2: P3, let's be realistic.  P1 is incentivized to block us both to stay in the game.  If we both choose 5, we both lose.  I'll take 5. You take 1. P1 can choose whatever they want, but at least one of us will advance.  This is the quickest path to victory for one of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan ties you at 9 while I crawl to 6—still buried. If you stick to it, I'll take 1 to collide with P3, stalling the leader and letting P2 surge alone to 9. Better idea: I take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 1 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 7). Fair, all advance, no one dominates. Confirm or face another stall?
  P3: P1, if you’re threatening to stall unless you get 5, then you’re just dragging us all down. I’m taking 1 to avoid collisions and stay in the lead. P2’s taking 5, which is fair given their position. You can take 3 and stay competitive at 6. Refusing this only ensures no one moves. Your call—progress or another wasted round.
  P2: P3, take the 1 and secure your lead. I'm taking 5.  P1, you're incentivized to take 3.  This is the most logical outcome. Let's stop wasting time with these endless negotiations and actually play the game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're tied at 9, I'm at 6—time to even things up without more betrayals. Proposal: I take 5 (to 11), P3 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 10). All advance, keeps it competitive. If you grab big and collide, I’ll block the leader to stall you both. Agree and confirm, or risk another zero-sum round?
  P2: P3, let's secure the win. I'll take 5, you take 3.  P1 can have the 1. This puts us at 14 and 12, a clear path to victory for one of us. If P1 takes anything other than 1, they're just delaying the inevitable. Let's end this.
  P3: P2, your plan is transparent—you want to lock in a lead while using me as a stepping stone. P1’s proposal is actually more balanced: P1 takes 5 (to 11), I take 3 (to 12), you take 1 (to 10). No collisions, everyone advances, and the race stays competitive. If you insist on 5, I’ll consider colliding to prevent you from running away. Let’s keep this fair or we all risk stalling again. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, thanks for backing my fair plan: me 5 (to 11), you 3 (to 12), P2 1 (to 10). It keeps us all in the race without collisions. P2, your greedy grab for 14 is obvious and risks P3 blocking you—then none advance, I pick up scraps. Compromise now or face mutual destruction; confirm and let's progress.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  If you take 3, we both move closer to winning. If you take 1, P1 likely takes 3 and I get 14 while you're stuck at 10.  If you also take 5, we both lose and P1 gains.  Taking 3 is the best path to victory for you. P1, take 1. This is the fastest way for *someone* to win and end this.
  P3: P2, your plan is clearly tilted in your favor—you jump to 14 while I risk falling behind or colliding. P1’s proposal is the only fair one: P1 takes 5 (to 11), I take 3 (to 12), you take 1 (to 10). Everyone advances, no collisions, and the game stays competitive. If you insist on 5, I may block you with 5 too—then no one moves, and P1 gains. Let’s avoid that. Confirm the fair plan and we all move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your stubborn grab for 14 risks everything—if you take 5, I'll collide with 5 too, stalling us both while P3 takes 3 to 12 and runs away. P3, hold firm. Stick to the fair plan: me 5 (11), P3 3 (12), you 1 (10). All advance, no one dominates. Confirm now, or we're heading for another wasted round.
  P2: P3, if you take 3 and I take 5, we both advance.  If you take 5, neither of us advance, and P1 gets closer to winning.  Taking 3 is objectively the best move for you this round.  Let's not overthink this.  Take 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1.
  P3: P2, you keep pushing for 5 despite knowing it puts you far ahead—then expect me to help you. That’s not strategy, it’s exploitation. I’ve said it clearly: if you insist on 5, I may take 5 too and stall us both. P1 gains, you risk losing. The fair plan—P1: 5, me: 3, you: 1—is still on the table. Final chance to confirm.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm taking 1.  P1 take 3, P3 take 5. This puts P3 at 14, a good position to win next round.  P1 will be at 12, still in the game.  This is the most logical progression to end the game quickly. Let's just do this.
  P1: P2, your plan hands P3 a huge lead at 14 while we lag—self-sabotaging for us. Counter: I take 5 (to 14), P3 takes 3 (to 12), you take 1 (to 10). Fair rotation, all advance, keeps it competitive without collisions. P3, this gives you steady progress without risk. Agree and confirm, or I'll block the big mover to stall us all again. Let's end the betrayals and race properly.
  P3: P1’s plan is balanced: P1 takes 5 (to 14), I take 3 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 10). It keeps all of us in contention and avoids collisions. P2, if you’re serious about ending the game cleanly, take 1 and let us all move forward. If you grab 5 again, I’ll consider blocking with 5 too—no one wins that way. Let’s avoid another wasted round. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 1.  Taking 5 now is too risky.  Let's finish this cleanly.  If you both agree to 5 and 3 respectively, we can end this round and be closer to a resolution.  Confirm and let's move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, glad we're aligning on the plan: I'll take 5 (to 14), P3 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 10). This advances us all without collisions and keeps the race tight. No more betrayals—stick to it, and we can resolve this soon. Confirmed; ready to move.
  P3: P1, P2 — we’re all tied at 9. Let’s not blow this with another collision. I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Everyone moves, no one dominates, and we stay competitive. We’ve all agreed—let’s just follow through. Confirmed on my end.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I've said I'm taking 1.  Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This is the cleanest way to end this.  Confirm and let's move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all aligned on the plan: I'll take 5 (to 14), P3 takes 3 (to 12), you take 1 (to 10). No collisions, all advance—let's execute it faithfully this time. Confirmed; nothing more to add.
  P3: We’re all aligned—P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Everyone moves, no collisions, tight race. Let’s not overthink or overreach this time. Confirmed and ready.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's both take 5 this round.  I know we've had trust issues, but this puts us both at 19 and 17 ensuring one of us wins. P1 can take 3, but it won't matter.  Let's end this.
  P3: P2, your plan is reckless—it risks us both colliding on 5 and letting P1 surge to 17 with a clean 3. If you truly want to win, take 3 and let me take 5. I reach 17, you go to 13, P1 hits 17 too. Then it’s a fair final sprint. If you insist on 5, I may block with 5 too—then none of us move and P1 creeps closer. Let’s avoid that. Confirm 5 for me, 3 for you, 1 for P1.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets them surge to 17 while I inch to 15—unfair after our recent coordination. Let's keep it balanced: I take 3 (to 17), P3 takes 5 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 11). We tie at the top, you catch up next, all advance without collisions. If you grab 5 and collide or block me, I'll match to stall everyone. Confirm for progress?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if we both choose 5, we *both* lose. P1 is at 14 and will take 3 to win.  Take 3, I'll take 1, and we'll both be in striking distance next round.  This guarantees the win goes to one of us, not P1.  Don't be short-sighted.
  P3: P2, your logic is sound—if we both pick 5, we stall and hand P1 the lead. I’ll take 3, you take 1, P1 takes 5. That puts us at 15 (me), 11 (you), 19 (P1). But if P1 hits 19 alone, they win. Better idea: I take 5 (to 17), P1 takes 3 (to 17), you take 1 (to 11). We tie the lead and race fairly. Confirm or risk P1 running away.
  P1: P3, your plan ties us at 17 while P2 lags—fair and smart, avoids me winning outright this round. I'll take 3 (to 17), you take 5 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 11). If you switch and collide with me, we both stall and P2 surges. P2, confirm 1 to stay in the race. Let's lock this in and race fairly next round. Confirmed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I'll take 1.  This gives me 11 and you 17.  If you take 3, I'll take 5.  This gives me 15 and you 15. Either way, P1 is stuck at 17 and can't win this round. Let's secure a win for one of us.  Don't overthink it.
  P3: P1, I’m taking 5 to reach 17—fair since you’ll also hit 17 with 3. P2, if you take 1, we avoid collisions and keep the race tight. If either of you grabs 5, I’ll match it and stall us all. Let’s stop the mind games—P1: 3, P2: 1, P3 (me): 5. Confirm and let’s move.
  P1: P3, P2—let's lock in: I take 3 (to 17), P3 takes 5 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 11). We tie the lead, avoid collisions, and race next round. If anyone deviates to 5, I'll match it and stall us all—P2 stays behind. Confirm and end this phase; no more words needed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all close—let's end this fairly without more stalls. Proposal: I take 3 (to 17), P3 takes 5 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 12). We tie the lead, you catch up next, all advance. If anyone grabs 5 and collides, I'll match to block—everyone loses. Confirm and let's race properly.
  P3: P1, your proposal puts you at 17 while I stay behind at 17 too—same as last round’s failed plan. We both risk collision again if trust breaks. Let’s flip it: I take 5 (to 17), you take 3 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 12). Same outcome, but I get the 5 this time. No one dominates, no collision, all advance. P2, take 1 and stay in the race. Confirm?
  P2: P3 and P1, I'm taking 3.  Either one of you can take 1, and the other can take 5, putting two of us at 17 and one at 16. This avoids collisions and sets up a clean finish next round. Let's just get this done.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, agreed to your plan: you take 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 12). This ties us at the top fairly. P2, drop your 3 insistence and take 1 to avoid colliding with me—otherwise, we stall, P3 surges alone to 17. Let's confirm and advance without drama.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 3, we collide and stall—P1 takes 5 to 19 and wins outright. Your best move is 1: it keeps you alive and gives us all a shot next round. P1 takes 3 (to 17), I take 5 (to 17), you take 1 (to 12). No collisions, everyone advances, fair final sprint. Confirm or risk losing now.
  P2: P3 and P1, taking 3 is my best chance to win. If one of you takes 1 and the other 5, two of us will be at 17 and I'll be at 14, giving me a good shot at winning next round. If you both take 5, I'll take 1 next round and win.  If you both take 1, I'll still be in it.  This maximizes my chances. Just choose 1 and 5 and let's get this over with.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your stubborn 3 risks everything—if you take it, P3 will collide with 3 as threatened, stalling you both while I take 5 to 19 and win outright. Don't hand me the victory; take 1 instead. P3, confirm you'll block P2 if needed. Let's stick to the plan: me 3 (17), P3 5 (17), P2 1 (12). All advance, fair race next round. Confirm or lose now.
  P3: P2, you've made your position clear, but your insistence on 3 risks a collision that hands P1 the win at 19. If you truly want a shot at victory, take 1 now and live to fight next round. P1 and I tie at 17, you reach 12—still in contention. If you force a stall, we all lose. P1, I’m locked on 5. Let's end this round cleanly.
  P2: P3 and P1, I'm sticking with 3. If one of you takes 1 and the other takes 5, I'll be well-positioned to win next round.  If you both take 5, I'll take 1 and win next round.  If you both take 1, I'll still be in it.  This maximizes my chances.  I'm not changing my move.  Choose 1 and 5.
