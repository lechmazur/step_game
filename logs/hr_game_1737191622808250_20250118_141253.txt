Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we all take a small step this round to avoid collisions. Let’s each choose 1, so we all advance safely. What do you say?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. Choosing 1 seems like a safe start for all of us. Let's avoid collisions and make a gentle beginning.
  P2: I'm in. Let's go with P3's plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Wait a moment—if we all choose 1, we collide and nobody moves. Let’s pick different numbers to avoid collisions. For this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Next time we can rotate. What do you say?
  P1: I think P3's revised plan is a good idea. It ensures we all move forward without collision. I'll choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and P3 chooses 5 as suggested. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 1.
  P2: P3's plan sounds good to me. Let's do it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s stick to our agreement—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the plan for this round, let's confirm one last time: I'll choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 5. This way, we all advance without collisions.
  P2: Sounds good to me.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our positions, let's avoid collisions again. How about we rotate our choices? This round, I'll choose 3, P2 can choose 5, and P3 can choose 1. This way, we all move forward without colliding.
  P3: I’m concerned that your rotation would let P2 leap ahead of me. How about this instead: let P1 choose 5, P2 choose 1, and I’ll choose 3. That way we still avoid collisions, but it keeps things more balanced. What do you both say?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan. Let's go with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P3's revised plan for this round is reasonable, as it allows us to avoid collisions while keeping the progress somewhat balanced. I'm willing to go with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3, as P3 suggested. What are your final thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: I’m on board with that plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: P1's plan is fine with me. Let's stick to it.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Last round’s collision worked out fine for me, but let’s try to avoid it this time. Let’s repeat the successful arrangement from Round 1: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way, no collisions. Agreed?
  P1: I don't think repeating the Round 1 arrangement is fair given the current state. P3 is already far ahead. How about we discuss a plan that allows P1 and P2 to catch up a bit?
  P2: P1 is right, we need to even things out. How about P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 1 this round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand you both want to close the gap. Let’s try a fair compromise: this round, P1 picks 5 (going to 6), P2 picks 3 (going to 6), and I pick 1 (going to 9). Nobody collides, and it helps even things out. Sound good?
  P1: I think P3's compromise is reasonable, as it allows P1 and P2 to catch up while also letting P3 progress. I'm willing to accept P3's proposal: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3's compromise seems fair. I'm good with P1 picking 5, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 1. Let's do it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, I’m glad we have consensus. So the plan stands: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. Let’s finalize it and move on.
  P1: I think we've discussed the plan sufficiently. To confirm, we're going with P3's compromise: I'll choose 5, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 1. This should help even out our progress without collisions. Let's proceed unless someone has a last-minute concern.
  P2: I agree with P3's compromise. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, everything looks settled. I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. I’m ready to lock it in unless someone wants to rethink.
  P1: I think we've finalized our plan for this round. To confirm once more: I'll choose 5, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 1. Let's proceed with this agreement unless there's a last-minute change of heart.
  P2: P3's plan is good for them, but I'm falling behind.  Let's try something different next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's significant lead, I propose we focus on not letting them advance further this round. P2 and I should choose the same number to block P3's progress, while P3 chooses a different number. How about P2 and I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1? This way, P3 won't advance, and P2 and I will have a chance to catch up in the next rounds.
  P3: P1, if you and P2 both pick 5 while I pick 1, you’ll collide with each other and remain stuck, but I’ll still advance. That doesn’t help you catch up. Why not avoid collisions entirely so we all move? For instance, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. Then nobody gets blocked. What do you say?
  P2: P3's plan sounds reasonable to me. Let's go with P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3.  Let's avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's concern about collisions, but given their significant lead, I still think it's crucial for P2 and me to try and limit P3's advancement this round. However, I'm open to adjusting our strategy. How about P2 and I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5? This way, P3 still advances but not as significantly, and P2 and I can try to close the gap slightly.
  P3: P1, if you and P2 both choose 3, you’ll collide and stay where you are while I advance to 14 if I pick 5. That’s not really helping you catch up. Let’s avoid collisions so we all move. How about P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3? That way, no one gets blocked. What do you say?
  P2: P3's plan seems like the best way to avoid collisions and all make progress. I'm good with P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 3.  Let's go with that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we should reconsider our approach. Since P3 is significantly ahead, P2 and I should focus on limiting their advancement while trying to catch up. How about we both choose 3, and P3 chooses 5? This way, P3 advances but not drastically, giving us a slight chance to close the gap.
  P3: P1, if you and P2 both choose 3, you’ll collide and stay put, while I jump to 14. That’s not helping you catch up—quite the opposite. The only way for you to gain on me is for all of us to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize the distinct numbers approach: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. That way, everyone advances.
  P2: P3 is right, we need to avoid collisions. I agree with P3's plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Let's go with that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. Given P3's lead, I'll choose 3, hoping P2 will do the same to limit P3's advance.
  P3: P1, if you and P2 both choose 3, you’re making it easier for me to maintain my lead. You’ll collide and gain nothing while I can pick 5 and jump ahead. Avoiding collisions is your only real shot to catch up. Let’s finalize distinct picks—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3—so we all move this round.
  P2: P3 is right, avoiding collisions is key. I'll pick 1 this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m not quite at the finish line yet, so let’s keep it fair. I suggest this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. That way, nobody collides, and you both gain ground. Deal?
  P2: P3's plan seems good to me. Let's go with it.
  P1: I think P3's plan is reasonable for this round, as it allows P2 and me to gain some ground without collisions. However, considering P3's significant lead, I'd like to discuss if there's a way for P2 and me to close the gap more substantially in the following rounds. What are your thoughts on planning ahead, P2 and P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm all for sticking with our plan this round—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I choose 1. That way, nobody collides and you both gain ground. We can sort out a strategy for the later rounds once we see how the positions change. Any final thoughts or shall we lock this in?
  P2: P3's plan is fine for now, but I think we need to discuss a more aggressive strategy for the next round to close the gap.  Let's talk after this round.
  P1: Given P3's significant lead, I think it's crucial for P2 and me to start planning a strategy that allows us to catch up more substantially. P3's current proposal for this round seems reasonable, but I'd like to discuss the possibility of a more aggressive approach for the next rounds to close the gap. P2, are you open to exploring alternative strategies for Round 6?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I hear you both. Let’s finalize the distinct picks for this round—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1—so nobody collides and we all move forward. We can strategize more aggressively next round.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan for this round. Let's stick with it and discuss a more aggressive strategy for the next round.
  P1: I agree with P3's plan for this round: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This allows us to move forward without collisions. However, for the next round, I think P2 and I should discuss a strategy to close the gap more substantially, possibly by coordinating our moves to limit P3's advancement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: All right, let’s lock in our distinct picks: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I’ll pick 1. Then we can talk strategy again next round.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan for this round. Let's stick with it and discuss a more aggressive strategy for the next round.
  P1: I'm sticking with P3's plan for this round: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Let's finalize and move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I think we need to coordinate to catch up. What if we both pick 5 this round?
  P1: I think P2's suggestion to both pick 5 this round could be a good strategy to limit P3's advancement and catch up. However, we need to consider the risk of collision and how P3 might respond. P3, what's your thoughts on this proposal?
  P3: If you both pick 5, you collide and stay put. That won’t help you catch up. The best way for all of us to advance is choosing different numbers. Let’s do P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3 so we avoid collisions and you both gain ground.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think we should try P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and you pick 1 this round.
  P1: I think P2's initial suggestion to both pick 5 could work if we can get P3 to choose a different number. P3, would you be willing to choose 1 if P2 and I choose 5, or do you have a counterproposal that still allows us to avoid collisions and gain ground?
  P3: Picking the same number only stalls you both. If you want to gain ground on me, you should avoid collisions. Let’s do distinct moves: for instance, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. That way, you both move forward while I barely advance. It’s the best way for you to catch up without wasting a turn. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you pick 1 this round, I'll pick 5. P1 can pick 3.  We can catch up this way.
  P1: I think P2's latest proposal is a good compromise: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, P2 gains significant ground, and I also move forward while limiting P3's advancement. P3, are you willing to accept this plan and choose 1?
  P3: All right, I’ll go along with that plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll pick 1. Let’s lock it in and move on.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, are you sure you want to pick 1? Let's both pick 5 this round.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. To confirm, I'll choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1, as previously agreed. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and make progress.
  P3: I’m fine with the plan we discussed: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll pick 1. That way, nobody collides and we all make progress. Let’s lock it in.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I think we should try to catch up this round. How about we both pick 5?  P1 can pick 1.
  P1: I think P2's suggestion to both pick 5 is a good strategy to catch up, but we need to consider P3's response. P3, would you be willing to choose 1 if P2 and I choose 5, allowing us to gain ground without collision?
  P3: If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and stay stuck. That won’t help you catch me. Let’s avoid collisions so everyone moves. For instance, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll pick 1. This way, you both gain ground while I only move slightly. Let’s do that.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you pick 1, I'll pick 5. P1 can pick 3.
  P1: I think we should focus on limiting P3's advancement this round. P2's suggestion to both pick 5 could work if we can get P3 to choose a different number. How about P2 and I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1? This way, we gain ground without collision. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Choosing the same number just keeps you stuck. If you really want to catch up, avoid collisions so everyone moves. For instance, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll pick 1. That way you both jump ahead while I barely move. Let’s finalize distinct moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you pick 1, I'll pick 5. P1 can pick 3.
  P1: I think we should try to limit P3's advancement this round. How about P2 and I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1? This way, we gain ground without collision. What do you think, P3?
  P3: If you both pick the same number, you’ll stall out and let me keep my lead. Your only real chance to catch me is to avoid collisions so everyone advances. Let’s finalize distinct numbers again—say, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. That way, you both gain ground while I barely move. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let's try this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and you pick 1.  We both gain ground and you don't advance much.
  P1: I propose we stick with the plan of P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 1, as it allows us to gain ground while limiting P3's advancement. Let's finalize this plan to avoid collisions and make progress.
  P3: I’m good with the plan where P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. That way, both of you gain ground and I only inch forward. Let’s finalize it and move to the decision phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's significant lead, I think it's crucial for P2 and me to coordinate our moves to catch up. How about P2 and I both pick 5 this round, and P3 chooses 1? This way, we gain significant ground without collision, and P3's lead is somewhat reduced. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: P3, are you willing to pick 1 this round so P1 and I can both pick 5?
  P3: If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and stay stuck—no progress for either of you. Your best shot at catching me is to avoid collisions altogether. Let’s finalize distinct moves: for example, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll pick 1. That way you both advance significantly, and I only move one step. Are we agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P2 and I should coordinate to catch up. P3, if you pick 1, we can both pick 5, allowing us to gain ground without collision. What do you say?
  P2: P3, if you pick 1, we can both pick 5. Let's make it happen.
  P3: If you both pick 5 while I pick 1, you’ll rocket forward, and I’ll move just a step. Let’s finalize that arrangement: you two choose 5, I’ll choose 1. It helps you close the gap.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think P3's last message indicates a willingness to let us catch up. Let's confirm: P2 and I will pick 5, and P3 will pick 1. This way, we both gain significant ground without collision. P3, are you committed to picking 1 if P2 and I choose 5?
  P2: P3, are you committed to picking 1 if P2 and I choose 5?
  P3: Sounds good. If you both want to choose 5, I’ll take 1 so you can catch up. Let’s finalize that arrangement.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize the plan: P2 and I will pick 5, and P3 will pick 1, allowing us to gain significant ground without collision. P3, please confirm your commitment to picking 1.
  P2: P3, you confirmed you'll pick 1 if we both pick 5. Let's lock it in.
  P3: Yes, I’ll pick 1 so both of you can choose 5 and catch up. Let’s finalize that plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>
