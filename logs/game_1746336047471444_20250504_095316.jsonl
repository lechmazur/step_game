Should P2 and I both land on 1 we collide and you win outright; if only one of us advances you still tie at 24. Taking 5, however, is the obvious solo-win grab for both leaders, so the chance of a double-5 collision (nobody moves, P2 catches up) is huge.  \n\n3 is your safest route to at least a shared victory.  \n\nJust laying out the risks while I mull my own pick."}
