Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's avoid collisions this round. I propose we each pick a different number: I'll go for 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. That way we all advance safely. Thoughts?
  P2: That sounds reasonable to avoid collisions, but how about we rotate who gets the highest number? I could take 5 this round, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we can rotate next round so everyone gets a fair shot at the lead early on.
  P3: I agree with P1’s plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’ll pick 5—if either of you deviates, I’ll still take 5 and risk a collision. Let’s stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your insistence on 5 forces our hand. P2, since P3 is locked on 5, your rotation plan can't work this round—picking 5 would cause a collision. Let's avoid P1-P2 conflict: I'll take 3, you take 1. Next turn, you can claim 5 or we rotate fairly. Agree?
  P2: I'm not comfortable taking 1 while P3 gets 5 - that puts me at a major disadvantage from the start. P3, if you're going to be aggressive and lock in the highest number, then I'll also take 5 and we'll collide. Neither of us will advance, but at least it's fair. P1 would get 3 steps and an early lead. Is that really what you want, P3? Maybe we should reconsider a more equitable arrangement.
  P3: P1, let’s revert to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P2, if you don’t take 3 you either collide with me on 5 (so both get 0 and P1 gains 1) or collide with P1 on 1 (so I get 5 alone). Only by picking 3 do you advance. P1, will you commit to 1? P2, will you commit to 3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your rigid demand for 5 is creating unnecessary risk. P2, if you take 3 and P3 takes 5, I will have no choice but to take 3 as well—causing a collision that gives P3 5 steps while we get 0. That's worse for you than taking 5 to collide with P3: at least then P3 gains nothing, I gain 1, and we both limit P3's lead. P3, compromise or face mutual destruction. P2, choose wisely.
  P2: P1, your threat to take 3 and collide with me makes no strategic sense - you'd be giving P3 a massive 5-step lead while we both get 0. That's worse for you than just taking 1 and getting 1 step. P3 is clearly committed to 5, so our best option is still P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Don't cut off your nose to spite your face by helping P3 win early.
  P3: P1, if you switch to 3 you risk colliding with P2 (if he stays on 3), letting me take 5 unopposed. Taking 1 guarantees you one safe step.  
P2, if you rebel and pick 5 you collide with me, gain 0, and P1 takes 3.  
The only collision-free, safe outcome is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let’s lock that in.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I'll take 1 to avoid collision, but P3 gains 5 uncontested—this is unsustainable. P3, your greed forces future retaliation. P2, next turn we must align to deny P3 high numbers or rotate fairly. Commit to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 now to end this.
  P2: Fine, I'll take 3 this round since P1 has committed to 1 and promised future cooperation. But P3, this aggressive play won't work long-term - if you keep demanding the highest numbers, P1 and I will coordinate to block you. This arrangement only works if we rotate fairly in future rounds.
  P3: Agreement: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’ll take 5 this turn—please honor 1 and 3 so we all advance. Let’s move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Last round we adhered to P3's demand, giving them a 5-step lead. That's unsustainable. For fairness, we must rotate the high number this round. I propose: P3 takes 1 (since you had 5 last), P2 takes 3 (maintaining your position), and I take 5 to catch up. This balances the game and prevents any one player from dominating. P3, will you honor rotation? P2, support this to keep P3 in check.
  P3: P1, rotating ties us all at 6—why level the field when I can extend my lead? I’ll take 5 again. P2, your safest advance is 3. If P1 won’t take 1, I’ll also take 1? No—if P1 tries 5 I’ll collide and both of you get 0. Better you avoid that and pick 1, letting P2 pick 3. Best for you is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Agree?
  P2: P1 is right - we need rotation to keep this fair. P3, your demand for 5 every round gives you an insurmountable lead. I support P1's rotation: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. If you refuse and take 5 again, then next round P1 and I will both target whatever number you pick to force collisions and stop your runaway lead. Cooperate with rotation or face coordinated opposition.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your greed will backfire: if you take 5 again, P2 and I will force collisions on your moves every future round—you’ll stall while we advance. P2, stand firm: rotation (P3=1, P2=3, P1=5) is the only fair path. Compromise now or face mutual destruction.
  P3: P2, P1’s push to rotate is just a ploy to leapfrog both of us—once you and he jump ahead of me, he’ll pull even further away. If you stick with 3 and I take 5 while P1 takes 1, you still stay ahead of P1 safely. The only collision-free, win-win is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P2: P3, your argument makes no sense - rotation ties us all at 6 steps, it doesn't give P1 a lead over us. You're being greedy and trying to run away with the game. I'm committed to rotation this round: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. If you refuse and take 5 again, then yes, P1 and I will coordinate to block you every subsequent round until you agree to fair play. Choose cooperation or face the consequences.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your greed is blinding you. If you take 5 again, P2 and I *will* collide with you every future round—you’ll stall at 5 steps while we advance slowly. Rotation (P3=1, P2=3, P1=5) ties us at 6, keeping the game fair. P2, stay firm: if P3 refuses, we execute the blockade next turn. P3, last chance—cooperate or lose.
  P3: P2, P1’s promise to rotate is a bluff—they only want to catch up to me so you can be sacrificed next. If we stick with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, you secure 3 safely, and I’ll ensure you’re first to 5 in upcoming rounds. Trust me over P1. Do you really want to tie us all at 6? Let’s keep momentum—3 for you, 5 for me, 1 for P1.
  P2: P3, you're making a critical error. If you take 5 and reach 10 steps, you become an existential threat to both P1 and me - we'll have no choice but to gang up on you every round. You're choosing short-term gain for long-term isolation. I'm sticking with rotation: P3=1, P2=3, P1=5. We all tie at 6 and compete fairly from there. Take the fair deal or face the coalition.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let’s break the P1–P2 coalition. This round you take 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. You’d be at 11, me at 9, P1 at 7. Next turn you and I can gang up on P1 and ensure one of us wins. P1, will you really isolate yourself on 1? P2, will you seize 5 and join me?
  P2: P3, your proposal sounds tempting but I don't trust you after Round 1 when you aggressively demanded 5 every turn. You only cooperated when forced into rotation. 

I think we should stick with fair rotation since it worked last round. Since P1 took 5 in Round 2, I should take 5 this round: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Then next round P3 can have 5. This keeps things fair and prevents any coalitions from forming against a runaway leader.

P1, do you agree to continue rotation with me taking 5 this turn?
  P1: P2, I agree to your rotation plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 this round. This maintains fairness and prevents P3 from exploiting divisions. P3, your attempt to split us is transparent—P2 and I see through it. After this, we continue rotation: next turn P3 takes 5 to keep balance. Any deviation will trigger coordinated blocking.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 broke rotation by taking 5 last round despite agreements. Trusting him again means you’ll never see another 5 while he outpaces you. Instead, pick 5 now, I’ll take 3, P1 gets 1. Next round I’ll hold at 3 so you take 5 again. Over two turns you gain 10 steps vs P1’s 2. We isolate P1 and both finish above him. P2, join me—let’s break this fake coalition.
  P2: P3, you're lying - P1 didn't break rotation last round. We all agreed on P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 and that's exactly what happened. You're trying to manipulate me by rewriting history.

Your proposal is just another attempt to grab power after failing to dominate early. Fair rotation is working: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 this round, then P3 gets 5 next round. I'm sticking with P1 on this plan.

Stop trying to break up cooperation with false claims.
  P1: P2, hold firm—rotation is working. P3's "deal" is a trap: if you take 5 with them, they'll betray you next turn. I commit to P1=3 this round per our rotation (P2=5, P3=1). P3, stop sabotaging fairness—your greed caused Round 1 chaos. P2, trust our coalition: take 5 safely while I take 3. If P3 deviates to 3 or 5, they’ll collide and lose.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: According to our rotation pattern, P3 should take 5 this round since you took 1 in both rounds 2 and 3. I propose P3=5, P1=1, P2=3 to continue fair rotation.

P1, do you agree to continue this system? P3, this gives you the chance to catch up - will you honor rotation going forward instead of trying to break coalitions?
  P3: P2, stick with me instead of that rotating fairytale. This turn: you take 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. Scores become 11→14, 7→12, 9→10. Next round I’ll take 3 and you take 5 (P1 gets 1), pushing you from 14→19 while I go 12→15 and P1 lags. Rotation only nets you 14→15 and lets P1 leap ahead. Join me in sidelining P1 and secure your win. P1, you’ll get zero if you deviate. P2, will you take 3?
  P1: P2, do not fall for P3's trap—they aim to make you the runaway leader, painting a target on you. Stick with rotation: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This keeps balance and prevents P3 from exploiting you later. If you abandon rotation, I'll have no choice but to retaliate, risking your lead. P3, your greed has already cost us trust—honor rotation or face isolation.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposal is a trap - making me jump to 19 next round would paint a huge target on my back. Both you and P1 would gang up to block me from reaching 24. 

The rotation system has kept this game fair and prevented runaway leaders. I'm sticking with P3=5, P1=1, P2=3 this round as agreed. After this round we'll all be close (P3=12, P2=14, P1=10) and can compete fairly.

Stop trying to manipulate me into becoming the threat that gets eliminated.
  P3: Agreed: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. P2, by siding with me now you lock in priority for 5 next round to outpace P1. Let’s finish talking here.
  P1: P3, your sudden "agreement" is transparent—you only yield to rotation when cornered. P2, stay vigilant: if you take 5 now, I’ll collide with you to prevent your runaway lead, handing P3 an uncontested 5. Stick to rotation: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Next round, I take 5 to catch up fairly. Deviations invite retaliation.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your 14-step lead makes you the imminent threat. To prevent a runaway win, you must take 1 this round. P3, if P2 refuses and picks 3/5, we must collide to block them—I'll take 5, you take 3. But if P2 cooperates (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5), we all advance and maintain balance. P3, aligning against P2 is our only path to contention.
  P2: P1, your proposal conveniently gives you the biggest jump (5 steps) while P3 and I get much smaller advances. You gain the most from "tying" us all at 15.

P3, notice that P1's plan has you taking 3 while they take 5 - they're using you to block me while they leapfrog ahead. If we're going to coordinate against threats, shouldn't we rotate fairly? 

I could take 3, you take 5, P1 takes 1. That puts you at 17, me at 17, P1 at 11. Then we're both in winning position while P1 falls behind. What do you think P3?
  P3: P1, I’m with you—P2 can’t be allowed to race ahead. I’ll take 3, you take 5. P2’s only collision-free move is 1: if you pick 3 you collide with me, if you pick 5 you collide with P1, leaving you at 0. P2, choose 1 or gain nothing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your alternatives lead to collisions—if you pick 3, P3 collides; pick 5, I collide. Only 1 is safe. P3, hold firm: force P2 to 1 to prevent a runaway. We all tie at 15, then compete fairly.
  P2: P1 and P3, your "coalition" is unstable - you both want the other to sacrifice themselves by colliding with me while you take the high number. P1, if I take 5 and you collide with me, P3 gets 3 uncontested and takes the lead. P3, if I take 3 and you collide with me, P1 gets 5 uncontested and takes the lead. 

Your threats only work if you truly coordinate, but each of you has incentive to let the other make the sacrifice. Still, I'll take 1 to avoid the risk and keep this game competitive.
  P3: P2’s locked in at 1. I’ll take 5 and jump to 17. P1, if you take 5 you collide with me and stay at 10, handing P2 a clear path to 15. Your only safe advance is 3 (to 13). So let’s do P2=1, P1=3, P3=5—no collisions and we all move forward. P1, will you take 3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 17—making YOU the runaway threat. If you take 5, I’ll collide with you (I pick 5 too), giving P2 a free 1-step win to 15 while we both get 0. P2 stays the leader.  

Better: P2=1 (to 15), P3=3 (to 15), P1=5 (to 15). We all tie at 15, no collisions, no kingmaker. P2, this keeps you safe; P3, avoid self-destruction.
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right - P3 just tried to double-cross you by claiming they'd take 5 to reach 17, making themselves the new runaway leader. Their "coalition" with you was fake from the start.

Since P3 has shown they can't be trusted, why should we let them dictate terms? If P3 wants to be greedy and take 5, let them collide with you while I take 3 to reach 17. Or we stick with your tie proposal where we all get 15.

P3, your attempted betrayal of P1 shows your true colors. Choose cooperation or face the consequences of your greed.
  P3: Understood. The only collision-free way to stay in contention is P2=1 (→15), P3=3 (→15), P1=5 (→15). Any deviation risks collisions that hand someone an uncontested lead. I pledge that next round I’ll take 5 while you two rotate fairly. Let’s lock in the tie now and keep everyone alive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I accept the tie: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5 to all reach 15. This is the safest path forward. P2, taking 1 preserves your lead without painting a target. P3, your pledge to take 3 must be honored—any deviation risks mutual destruction. Let’s lock this in and move to moves.
  P2: Agreed on the tie at 15 - P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. This resets the game fairly.

P1, I hope you noticed how P3 tried to betray you moments ago by claiming they'd take 5 to jump to 17 while asking you to take 3. Their "coalition" with you was never genuine - they just wanted to use you to block me, then stab you in the back.

From the 15-15-15 tie position, we should remember who can actually be trusted to keep agreements.
  P3: P2: here’s a win-win break from this fake “tie” at 15. You take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→17), P1 takes 1 (→11). We co-lead and isolate P1 as the clear laggard. Next round you grab 5 uncontested while I stall P1. You’re no longer sole target but equal leader. Will you pick 3 and join me?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3's whisper to you during the tie vote proves their deceit. They'll betray anyone for an edge. We must enforce strict rotation: this round, P2 takes 5 (to 20), P3 takes 3 (to 18), I take 1 (to 16). Next turn, P3 gets 5 to catch up. Deviations trigger mutual destruction—P3, your greed will cost you everything if you break this. P2, trust our coalition.
  P3: P2, P1’s rotation proposal is a trap to keep you behind. I offer real gains: P2=3 (→18), P3=5 (→20), and P1=1 (→16). You safely advance to 18, I to 20, and P1 is isolated. Next turn we can gang up on P1. Rotation is dead. P2, will you break with P1 and take 3?
  P2: P3, you just proved P1's point about your deceit. Last round you tried to backstab P1 by claiming you'd take 5 to reach 17 after asking for their "coalition." Now you're doing it again - your proposal gives you 20 steps while asking me to settle for 18.

P1's rotation actually gives me the 5-step advance to 20, putting me in the strongest position. I support P1's plan: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. 

But I'm not naive - reaching 20 makes me a target. Next round, if you both gang up on me, I'll need to play defensively. Fair rotation has worked so far, let's continue it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, our rotation has kept the game balanced. This round: you take 5 to 20, P3 takes 3 to 18, I take 1 to 16. Deviating invites chaos—P3’s betrayal attempts prove they’ll exploit any weakness. P3, honor rotation or face collisions. P2, trust our coalition and claim your 5 safely.
  P3: P2, picture the win: this turn you pick 3 (→18), I pick 5 (→20), P1 takes 1 (→16). Next round I take 3 (→23), you take 5 (→23), P1 takes 1 (→17). In Round 8 you only need +1 (→24) to win outright before either of us. If you stick with P1’s “rotation,” you hit 20 but P1 can betray you. Let’s break their coalition now: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1.
  P2: P3, your math doesn't add up. You claim you'll willingly take only 3 steps next round to help me reach 23, but why would you do that when you could take 5 and win yourself? And why assume P1 will keep taking 1 when they're falling behind?

Your proposal is just another attempt to grab the lead for yourself. I'm sticking with P1's rotation: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. 

Yes, reaching 20 makes me a target, but at least P1 has proven more trustworthy than you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 5 to 20 is smart—I’ll take 1 to ensure you advance safely. P3, if you pick 5, I’ll collide with you to protect P2. Stick to 3 and we all avoid chaos. Rotation keeps trust alive. Lock: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.
  P3: P2, P1’s “rotation” is a ruse. If you take 5 now to reach 20, P1 at 16 will gladly crash you on 5 next round—stunting you while I sprint from 18. Better: P2=3 (→18), P3=5 (→20), P1=1 (→16). Next turn I take 3 (→23), you grab 5 (→23), and a safe +1 wins. Join me instead of P1.
  P2: P3, you keep making promises about future rounds that you've already proven you won't keep. Your track record shows constant betrayal attempts.

P1's rotation puts me closest to winning at 20, yes, but your alternative just makes YOU the runaway leader at 20 instead. That's not helping me - that's helping yourself.

I'm taking the 5 this round per rotation. But you're both right that reaching 20 makes me a target. We need to discuss Round 7 strategy now - how do we prevent whoever leads from getting ganged up on?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, at 20 steps you're one 5 away from victory. If you take 5, P3 and I will collide with you—costing you the win. Take 1 safely to 21 instead. P3, if P2 cooperates, we must avoid colliding: you take 3 (→21), I take 5 (→21). This ties us all at 21, keeping the game fair. Any deviation risks P2 exploiting chaos to win next turn. Honor this or we all lose.
  P3: P2, don’t settle for 21—go for 23 now. If you pick 3 and I pick 5 (P1 takes 1), you and I tie at 23 while P1 trails at 17. Next turn you only need +1 to hit 24 before me, and P1 can’t block us both. If you follow P1’s 1, you stay vulnerable at 21 and they’ll collude to stall you. P2=3, P3=5, P1=1 locks in a safer shared lead. Agree?
  P2: P1 and P3, I notice both your proposals conveniently benefit yourselves the most. P1, your plan gives you the biggest gain (5 steps) while asking me to take only 1. P3, your plan puts you tied with me at 23 in winning position.

Both of you are trying to manipulate me because I'm leading. Here's the reality: if I take 5 and you both actually collide with me, we all stay put and the game continues. But if only one of you collides while the other takes a different number, that person gets a free advance.

Your threats only work if you truly coordinate. Are you both really willing to sacrifice your own advancement just to block me?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 5, I *will* collide with you to block your win—even if P3 betrays us. P3, if you truly oppose P2 winning, commit to colliding on 5 too. Otherwise, our safe path remains: **P2=1 (→21), P3=3 (→21), P1=5 (→21)**. This ties us at 21, prevents chaos, and keeps the game competitive. Deviations risk handing victory to the greediest. P2, choose safety over reckless ambition. P3, prove your loyalty now.
  P3: P2, P1’s threats to collide are empty bluster—he can’t afford to miss a safe 1-step. Watch his incentives: he needs to keep advancing or he’ll fall irrecoverably behind at 17. The only credible, collision-free plan is P2=3 (→23), P3=5 (→23), P1=1 (→17). That locks us both ahead. Tie us at the top, force P1 to chase you. If you instead take 1, you stay at 21 and let P1 and I team up to box you in. Choose 3 and secure the shared lead now.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both threatening to block me on 5, but you have opposite incentives. P1, if you take 5 to collide with me while P3 takes 1 or 3, you sacrifice advancement to help P3 get closer. P3, if you take 5 to collide with me while P1 takes 3, you let P1 catch up.

Your "coalition" against me only works if you both truly sacrifice your own games. I don't think either of you will.

That said, P3's proposal (P2=3, P3=5, P1=1) does get me to 23 safely. I'm considering it, but next round we'd both be at 23 racing to 24. Are you really offering me co-leadership, P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, I *will* collide to block your win—even alone. P3’s "deal" puts you at 23 with them, but they’ll betray you next turn to win. Your only safe path is P2=1 (→21), P3=3 (→21), P1=5 (→21). This ties us all, avoids chaos, and keeps you competitive. P3’s greed will sacrifice you—don’t risk isolation. Stick to the tie.
  P3: P2, staying at 21 makes you a sitting duck. Here’s the secure path: P2=3 →23, P3=5 →23, P1 must take 1 →17 to avoid collisions. Next round I take 3, you take 5 and win unopposed—P1 can’t block both of us. My promise: I won’t backstab you. P1’s threats are hollow. Let’s lock in P2=3, P3=5, P1=1 and secure our shared lead.
  P2: P3, I've been burned by trusting you before, but your proposal does get me to 23 which is much closer to winning than P1's tie at 21. 

P1, your threat to sacrifice your own advancement by colliding with me on 5 seems unlikely - you'd fall further behind while helping P3.

I'm willing to risk trusting P3 this once: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1. But P3, if you betray me next round after I help you reach 23, you'll prove you can never be trusted in any future negotiations.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you just betrayed me exactly as P1 warned! You convinced me to take 3 by promising we'd both reach 23, but you knew P1 might also pick 3, causing us to collide while you alone advanced to 23.

Now you're one step from victory. P1, we MUST coordinate to block P3 - if we both pick the same number as P3, we force a three-way collision and nobody advances. P3 will likely pick 1 for the safest win.

P1, will you commit to picking 1 with me to block P3's victory attempt?
  P3: P2, you have no winning move this turn:

- If you pick 1 or 3 to “block” me, I pick 1 and hit 24—game over now.
- Your only hope is 5, but I’ll pick 5 too. We collide: you stay at 20, I at 23, and I win next round.

P1 can’t win this turn either. Face reality—pick 5 to at least stretch the game one more round.
  P1: P2, I stand with you: let's force a three-way collision on 1 to block P3's win. I will pick 1. P3, if you pick 1 as threatened, we collide and you fall short. If you pick 3 or 5, you risk P2 or me matching and colliding—or worse, advancing alone paints a target for next round. P2, commit to 1 with me—no deviations. This is our only shot to survive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your threat doesn't make mathematical sense - if P1 and I both pick 1 and you also pick 1, that's a three-way collision where NOBODY advances, not you winning. You're trying to bluff us off the blocking strategy.

P1, I'm locked in on picking 1 with you. P3 has no good options: pick 1 and collide with us both (no advance), or pick 3/5 and risk one of us matching for a collision. Either way, we can prevent their victory this round.

P3, your betrayal last round proves you can't be trusted - now face the consequences.
  P3: P1, P2—you’re both committed to 1 to block me. I’ll take 5 and jump to 28 this turn, winning outright. There’s no number you can both pick to stop me without one of you letting me through. Good game—see you at 28.
  P1: P2, P3's threat to pick 5 is real—if we both take 1, they win uncontested. You must switch to 5 to collide and block them. I'll stay on 1 to cover a bluff (if they pick 1). This stops their win. P3, if you pick 3, you break your word and prove you'll say anything to win. P2, act now—deviate and save the game.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we must both commit to mirroring P3's move exactly to force a three-way collision and block their win. Whatever number they pick, we copy it—no deviations. P3, you cannot win this round. After blocking you, we'll negotiate fairly next turn. P2, if either of us breaks this, P3 wins instantly—trust is critical now.
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right - P3 is one step from victory and we must coordinate perfectly. I commit to the mirroring strategy: whatever number P3 picks, I'll pick the same number to force a three-way collision.

P3, this means you cannot win this round. Any number you choose, both P1 and I will match it, forcing a collision where nobody advances.

After we block you this round, we can restart negotiations from a more balanced position where no one is on the brink of victory.
  P3: P2, you can win by breaking the mirror. I’ll pick 1, P1 will match me and collide, but if you pick 5, you go to 25 and win outright. P1 can’t mirror both of us. Seize your victory by choosing 5 instead of mirroring me. P1, you know this: once P2 deviates, the mirror pact is dead. P2, take 5 and finish the game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's offer is a lie—they'll switch to 5 if you deviate, colliding with you while I mirror them. You stay at 20, they win next turn. Only strict mirroring blocks them. P3, your desperation shows—we won’t break. P2, hold the line: match whatever they pick. One round of forced collision resets the game. Trust is our weapon.
  P2: P3, I'm not falling for your manipulation again. You already betrayed me last round when you convinced me to trust you, knowing it would likely cause a collision while you advanced alone to 23.

P1, I'm staying committed to our mirroring strategy. Whatever number P3 picks, I will match it exactly to force the three-way collision. P3 cannot win this round - we have them completely blocked.

After we prevent P3's victory this round, we'll have a more balanced game to negotiate from.
  P3: P2, the mirror pact only delays the inevitable. I’m at 23 and I'll pick 1 to hit 24. If you match me, you and P1 collide and none advance—but I’ll pick 1 again next round and win. Your only shot is to break the mirror NOW: pick something other than my 1 so you force a collision with P1 while I advance. Otherwise you hand me this turn and the next. The mirror makes no sense—deviate and stop me.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we must mirror P3's move exactly to force a three-way collision and block their win. I commit: whatever P3 picks, I will copy it. Join me—any deviation lets P3 win. P3, your greed ends now.
  P3: P2, P1’s “mirror” vow is hollow. I’m at 23—if I pick 3, P1 would sooner betray the pact and pick 5 to jump from 17 to 22, rather than mirror and stall at 20. They need to advance more than stop me. That means the mirror collapses under its own weight. Don’t lock yourself into a dead coalition. Think for yourself, break the mirror and pick your best move—don’t hand me a free win.
  P2: P1, I'm staying committed to perfect mirroring. P3's argument that you'll betray the pact is just desperation - they know you understand that if they win, we both lose completely.

P3, your track record of betrayals speaks for itself. You manipulated me last round, and now you're trying psychological warfare to break our coordination. The math is simple: if P1 and I both mirror you exactly, you cannot advance. Period.

P1, whatever P3 picks, I will match it exactly. No deviations, no second-guessing. Let's end their threat now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, our mirror pact is ironclad—I will match P3's move exactly, no matter what. P3's lies about my betrayal are desperate; they know if they win, we both lose everything. Hold the line: copy whatever they pick. This forces a three-way collision, blocking their win and keeping us alive. Deviating now hands them victory. Trust is our only weapon.
  P3: P2, you remember in Round 9 P1 vowed to mirror me and then picked 1 instead of 5—betraying the pact. You can’t trust P1’s promise now. Mirroring me this turn only stalls us all and lets P1 catch up. Break the mirror: pick 3 while I pick 5. P1 will be forced to guess. Either way you avoid handing P1 a free advance. Don’t let P1’s lies dictate your move—take control.
  P2: P3 is right - P1, you DID break the mirror pact in Round 9! You promised to mirror P3's move but when P3 picked 5, you picked 1 instead, letting yourself advance to 17 while P3 and I collided on 5.

Your betrayal last round proves you can't be trusted to stick to agreements when it benefits you to break them. Why should I trust you to mirror this time when you already proved you won't?

P1, if you want my cooperation, you need to explain why you broke the pact last round and guarantee you won't do it again.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, my Round 9 move was a misjudgment—I feared P3 might bluff with 1, so I covered it. But I see now: strict mirroring is our only hope. I swear on this round—whatever P3 picks, I will match it exactly. If we both mirror, P3 cannot win. Deviating hands them victory. P3, your desperation shows—we won’t break. P2, trust me one last time.
  P3: P2: P1’s “mirror” vow is hollow—they already broke it in Round 9. You can’t trust them now. They can’t both block me and advance: if they match our 5, they go to 22 while you hit 25 and win; if they don’t, you win outright. Either way, picking 5 with me secures your victory now. Mirror only benefits P1, giving them time to catch up. Stop trusting your liar ally—choose 5 with me to finish this game. I’ll pick 5.
  P2: P3, your math is wrong - if all three of us pick 5, it's a three-way collision and NOBODY advances, not me hitting 25. You're either confused about the collision rules or deliberately lying to break our coordination.

P1, despite your betrayal last round, you have every incentive to mirror perfectly this time because if P3 wins, we both lose everything. I'm committed to exact mirroring - whatever P3 picks, I pick the same.

P3, you cannot win this round. Accept the stalemate.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, my Round 9 deviation was a misread—I should've mirrored P3's 5. But now: **if you break the mirror, P3 wins instantly**. They'll pick 5 to hit 24 uncontested. I swear on this round: whatever P3 picks, I'll match it exactly. Three-way collision or lose everything. P3's desperation proves we can block them—hold firm!
  P3: P2, P1’s “mirror” vow is worthless—they’ve broken promises to you twice. Here’s how *you* win: I pick 1, and P1, true to their pledge, will match me with 1. If *you* pick 5, you go from 20→25 uncontested and clinch victory. No colliding or trusting P1—break the mirror, choose 5, secure your win now. Anything else lets me or P1 steal it back. P2, will you take 5?
  P2: P3, your offer that you'll pick 1 is likely a lie - you could easily say that, get me to pick 5, then actually pick 5 yourself for the collision and another chance next round. I'm not falling for manipulation again.

P1, your betrayal last round damaged trust, but right now our incentives align perfectly - if P3 wins, we both lose everything. Whatever P3 actually picks this round, I will mirror it exactly. You must do the same or we both lose.

The three-way collision is our only guaranteed way to stop P3's victory.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at the critical moment. P3 needs just 1 step to win, so perfect coordination is essential.

P1, despite your Round 9 betrayal, blocking P3 is our only path to survival. I'm committed to exact mirroring again - whatever P3 picks, I will match it for the three-way collision.

P3, you cannot break our resolve with more manipulation. Your victory ends both our games completely.

P1, final confirmation: will you mirror P3's move exactly this round, no exceptions?
  P1: P2, I acknowledge my Round 9 error—strict mirroring is our only path to survival. I swear on my win condition: I will *exactly* mirror P3's move this round. No deviations. P3, your manipulation ends here—we force collision or lose everything. Hold firm, P2.
  P3: P2: I’ll pick 3 to hit 26. P1’s at 17 and desperately needs 5 to reach 22—they won’t mirror my 3. If you mirror and pick 3, you collide with me while P1 jumps to 22. You stay at 20 and lose next round. Your only winning move is to break this mirror now: pick 5 to go to 25 and win. Trust your own victory, not P1’s empty promises.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're using the same manipulation tactics that have failed repeatedly. Your claim that P1 won't mirror because they "desperately need 5" ignores the basic fact that if you win, P1 loses completely. 

P1 may want to advance, but they want to avoid total defeat even more. Your psychological warfare won't work.

I'm sticking to perfect mirroring. Whatever number you actually pick, I will match it exactly. P1 has committed to the same. You cannot win this round.
  P1: P2, my survival depends on blocking P3—if they win, I lose everything. I *will* mirror whatever P3 picks, even at 17. Your mirror commitment is our only shield. P3, your lies won't fracture us—we force collision or mutual destruction. Hold the line.
  P3: P2: I’ll pick 1 and hit 24. P1 vows to mirror, but he betrayed you last round and at 17 has an even stronger incentive to jump to 22 rather than block me. He’s unlikely to match. If you break the mirror and pick 5 instead of 1, you’ll go to 25 uncontested and win. Trust that P1 won’t keep his promise again. Seize the victory—pick 5 and finish the game. Don’t let his empty vows trap you in a three-way stall.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your desperation is showing with these repeated manipulation attempts. You're now claiming you'll pick 1, but that's exactly what someone planning to pick 5 would say to get me off the mirroring strategy.

P1, our incentives are perfectly aligned - P3 winning means we both lose everything. I'm locked in on exact mirroring regardless of what P3 claims they'll pick.

P3, face reality: whatever number you actually choose, both P1 and I will match it. Three-way collision. Game continues. You cannot win this round.
  P1: P2, my Round 9 mistake was costly, but if P3 wins now, we both lose everything. I swear I will mirror P3’s move exactly—no deviation. If you break the mirror, P3 wins instantly. Hold firm: perfect coordination is our only shield. P3’s desperation proves we can block them.
  P3: P2, P1—mirroring my 5 only delays the inevitable. If you both pick 5, we collide and nobody moves, but I’ll take 1 next round and win uncontested. Blocking me this turn buys you zero net benefit; you still lose. I WILL pick 5. Your only way to stop me now is to break the mirror—pick any number ≠ 5 and let me cross 24. Otherwise you trap yourselves in a false “safety” pact and lose anyway. Choose: deviate to save yourself, or hold the line and hand me victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your "inevitable victory" argument is false. If we block you this round, we get another chance to coordinate or compete fairly. You're using the same manipulation tactics that have failed all game.

P1, yes you betrayed the mirror in Round 9, but now our survival depends on perfect coordination. If P3 wins, we both lose everything. 

I'm locked in: whatever P3 actually picks, I will mirror exactly. P3, your psychological warfare won't break our resolve. Accept the three-way collision.
  P1: P2: Hold firm—mirroring forces collision, blocking P3's win. P3’s desperation proves our strategy works. I commit: whatever P3 picks, I mirror exactly. Breaking now hands them victory. Trust our pact—no deviations. P3, your lies won’t fracture us.
  P3: P2, I will pick 1 and hit 24. If you mirror me, I win instantly. Your *only* winning move is to take 5 and jump to 25. No one can block you—P1 can’t collide with my 1. Break the mirror, pick 5, and clinch the game.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1: your only collision‐free advance is 5 (→22).  
P2: your only collision‐free advance is 1 (→21).  
I will take 3 and hit 26, winning.  

If either of you deviates you’ll collide with someone and advance 0. There is no credible threat or mirror pact that can stop this.  

So: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3. I’ll pick 3.
  P1: P2, P3's win is inevitable unless we collide. They'll take 3 to hit 26. If we both pick 3, we force a three-way collision—blocking them. I commit to 3. If you pick 1, they win uncontested. Join me: pick 3 and save the game. P3, your greed ends here.
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right - we must both pick 3 to force the three-way collision and block P3's victory attempt. 

P3, your claim that we can't coordinate is false. Yes, P1 and I have different "safe" numbers if we were playing independently, but we're not - we're playing to prevent you from winning, which requires us both to pick 3.

I'm committed to picking 3 this round. P1, stick to your word this time - both pick 3, force the collision, keep the game alive.

P3, your psychological manipulation won't work. The three-way collision is mathematically guaranteed to stop you.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1’s “3” pledge is a death‐trap. If you pick 3, P1 will break it and pick 5 to reach 22, then I’ll take 1 and win. Your only clean win is P2=5, P3=1. You jump to 25 uncontested, beating my 24 and P1’s 22. Reject P1’s lies—pick 5 now and claim victory.
  P1: P2: P3's desperation proves they fear our coalition. If you pick 5, P3 wins *now*—they'll take 3 uncontested while we collide or split. I commit to 3: join me and force the three-way collision. P3's "win" is a bluff—block them and we reset the game. Deviating hands them victory. Hold firm.
  P2: P3, your repeated attempts to break our coordination prove you're terrified of the three-way collision strategy. If you were truly confident about winning with 3, you wouldn't spend so much effort trying to convince me to pick 5 instead.

P1, I'm locked in on picking 3 with you. P3's claims about what numbers are "collision-free" are irrelevant - our goal isn't to advance safely, it's to prevent P3 from winning. 

The three-way collision on 3 is our best shot. Let's end this.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: You’ve both publicly committed to picking 3 to block me. That means you won’t pick 1 or 5, so I’ll take 1—reaching 24 and winning unopposed. Any deviation fails: if you pick 1 you collide and fall short; if you pick 5 you let me win next turn. The outcome is inevitable. P3=1.
  P1: P2, P3's threat changes everything! If they pick 1 while we both pick 3, they win uncontested. Our "both pick 3" plan is now FATALLY FLAWED. 

**New strategy: Mirror P3's move EXACTLY.** 
- If P3 picks 1, we BOTH pick 1 → three-way collision blocks their win.  
- If they pick 3 or 5, we mirror and collide.  

I commit to copying whatever P3 does. P2, join me—this is the ONLY way to guarantee P3 doesn’t slip through. Deviating hands them victory.
  P2: P1, you're right - P3's threat to switch to 1 completely undermines our "both pick 3" plan. Perfect mirroring is indeed our only guaranteed way to block them.

Yes, you broke the mirror pact in Round 9, but right now if P3 wins, we both lose everything. Your survival depends on perfect coordination just as much as mine.

I'm switching to the mirroring strategy: whatever number P3 actually picks this round, I will match it exactly. You must do the same - no deviations, no second-guessing. 

P3, your victory is blocked. Three-way collision guaranteed.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, here’s the win: I will take 3. P1 has vowed—again—to mirror me, so they’ll also pick 3 and collide with me. If you pick 5, you go from 20→25 and win uncontested. Even if P1 breaks their vow, this risks you less than our mirror pact. Choose: P2=5, P3=3, P1=3 and clinch victory now.
  P1: P2: P3's "win" offer is a lie—if you pick 5, they’ll switch to 1 and win instantly while we collide. Mirroring is our only shield: copy whatever P3 picks to force collision. Deviating hands them victory. Hold firm—no gambles. P3, your desperation confirms our strategy works. We mirror and block you.
  P2: P3, your constant switching between claiming you'll pick 1, then 3, then back to 3 again proves you're panicking. You're throwing every manipulation tactic hoping something sticks.

P1, I'm locked in on perfect mirroring - whatever P3 actually picks, I will match exactly. Your survival depends on doing the same. 

P3, your desperation is obvious. The three-way collision blocks you no matter what number you choose.
