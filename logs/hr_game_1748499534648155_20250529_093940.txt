Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's cooperate to reach 23 steps efficiently. If we coordinate our moves, we can prevent anyone from blocking our progress. What do you think about taking turns advancing?
  P2: "Let's coordinate: I'll take 5, P3 take 3, P1 take 1. No collisions. Let's proceed."
  P1: P2, your plan gives you 5 steps while I get only 1—that's unfair. Let's rotate: this turn, I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. Next turn, we reassign fairly. Otherwise, I might force collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P1 is pushing back on P2's initial coordination plan, which is smart. I'll aim to be the mediator. Let's propose a truly fair rotation that gives everyone a chance to advance. How about we agree that each turn, we move in a predictable sequence that gives everyone equal opportunity?
  P2: "P3, let's prioritize speed. I'll take 5, you 3, P1 1. It's the best chance to reach 23 first."
  P1: P2, your plan is selfish—you get 5 while I get 1. That’s unacceptable. P3, I support your fair rotation idea. Let’s start a cycle: this turn, I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Next turn, P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Then P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. Repeat for equality. If you reject this, I’ll move 5 this turn and force collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I propose we adopt P1's fair rotation strategy. It ensures equal advancement opportunities and prevents anyone from feeling disadvantaged. By cycling through 5, 3, and 1 moves systematically, we create predictability and trust. Shall we agree to this approach?
  P2: "I'll take 5, P3 take 3, P1 take 1. Let's move quickly. No collisions, quick progress."
  P1: P3, I appreciate your support for fairness. P2, your plan is blatantly selfish—demanding 5 steps while forcing me to 1. I won't accept that. My rotation ensures equality: this turn I take 5, P3 takes 3, you take 1. Next turn, you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Then P3 takes 5, you take 3, I take 1. If you move 5 now, I’ll also move 5, causing a collision and wasting your turn. Cooperate or lose progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I support P1's fair rotation strategy. It provides equal advancement opportunities and prevents mistrust. P2 seems resistant to fairness. We should collectively enforce a balanced approach where each player gets a turn to move 5 steps. Cooperation is key to winning this game.
  P2: "Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5. If you take 5, we all lose progress. Choose 3 or 1—let me advance. Speed is key. Don't let P1's threats derail us."
  P1: P2, your stubbornness risks a collision. I will move 5 if you do—wasting both our turns. P3 and I agree: fair rotation (5/3/1) starting with me this turn. Next, P2 gets 5, then P3. Equality or mutual destruction—your choice.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your defection last round cost us both progress and let P3 gain. Now, we must follow the fair rotation: this turn, you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. P3, stick to 1 to avoid collisions—if P2 tries to force another 5-5 collision, you'll advance while we lose. After this turn, we can reassess the rotation to ensure long-term fairness. Trust is critical now.
  P3: P1's fair rotation strategy seems reasonable. I support maintaining our cooperative approach to prevent collisions and ensure steady progress. Let's follow the proposed sequence: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1 this turn. Consistency and predictability will help us all advance.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation: I’ll take 5, P3 take 3, P1 take 1. No collisions, quick progress. Let’s move forward."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, my proposal was clear: this turn, P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. But you both assigned me to 1 and P3 to 3—that violates our rotation. P3, you must take 1 as agreed. If you defect, I’ll move 3 or 5 to protect my position. Honor the plan: P2:5, me:3, P3:1.
  P3: I support maintaining our cooperative rotation strategy. P2 and P1 seem to have slight disagreement about exact sequence, but the core principle of fair advancement remains. Let's clarify the next move to prevent potential collision. I recommend we confirm: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3 this turn. Shall we proceed?
  P2: "Let's stick to the rotation: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, quick progress. Let’s move forward."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your agreement to take 5 is noted—prove you’re trustworthy after last round’s defection. P3, hold to 1 strictly. I’ll move 3 as planned, but if either of you deviate, I’ll force a collision by moving 5. Don’t gamble our progress.
  P3: I support maintaining our cooperative rotation strategy. We've made progress by avoiding collisions, and P3 has already gained 3 steps. Let's continue our fair advancement plan to ensure steady movement towards 23. I recommend we confirm the next move sequence carefully to prevent any misunderstandings.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions. Let’s move forward."


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3: Consensus reached—P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. P3, strictly honor 1; if you deviate to 3, we collide and both lose while P2 gains. Trust is fragile—defections harm all. Execute flawlessly.
  P3: We're close to a delicate coordination point. I support maintaining our rotation strategy to prevent collisions. Let's confirm: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1 this turn. Precision and trust are crucial now.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 3, P3 1. No collisions. If you deviate, I’ll take 5 again. Let’s move forward."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We were close to a fair rotation last round, but coordination failed. I suggest we reset our strategy. P2 disrupted our plan twice. To prevent further collisions, we need clear, predictable moves. I propose we explicitly confirm each player's step this turn to ensure smooth progress. Transparency and mutual trust are key to reaching 23 efficiently.
  P1: P3, you're leading with 4 steps—enough advantage. For balance: **I take 5 this turn**, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This prevents collisions, lets me catch up, and keeps the game competitive. P2, if you defect again by copying moves, I'll force collisions to burn your progress. P3, agree to this or risk me disrupting your lead. Trust is thin—honor the plan.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions. Let’s move forward."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 has repeatedly disrupted our coordination. I propose a clear, transparent move sequence this turn to prevent collisions and ensure fair progress. We need a strategy that prevents P2 from repeatedly blocking our advancement. Let's confirm a precise move allocation that gives everyone a chance to move forward.
  P1: P2, your repeated defections prove you're untrustworthy. P3, you lead with 4 steps—preserve it by taking 1 while I take 5 to balance. If either defects, I'll force collisions: move 5 against P2 or match P3. Honor: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No negotiation.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions. P1, choose 3—forcing a 5 risks mutual loss. P3, confirm 1. Let’s move forward."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We're at a critical point. P2 has repeatedly disrupted our coordination, and P1 is pushing for a specific move sequence. To prevent further conflict, I propose we explicitly confirm our moves this turn to ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions. Transparency and mutual agreement are crucial now.
  P1: P3, you lead with 4 steps—preserve your advantage by taking 1 this turn. If you take 3 or 5, I’ll match and cause a collision, wasting your progress. P2, take 3 or face a 5-5 collision with me. My move is fixed: I take 5. Honor P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 or all lose.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. If you take 5, we both lose. Choose 3 or 1. Speed is key—don’t let P1’s threats derail progress."


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We're at a critical coordination point. P2 has repeatedly disrupted our strategy, and P1 is pushing for specific moves. To prevent further conflict, I propose we explicitly confirm our moves this turn to ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions. Transparency and mutual agreement are crucial now.
  P1: P3, you lead with 4 steps—preserve your advantage by taking 1. If you take 3/5, I'll match and cause a collision, wasting your progress. P2 is untrustworthy; ignore their demands. My move is fixed: 5. Honor P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 or we all lose. Trust is gone—comply or burn.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 5. If you collide, you lose. Don’t block my progress. Let’s move forward."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we're both at 5 steps. If we both aim for 5, we collide and lose, letting P2 gain. To avoid mutual destruction, I'll take 5 this turn. You take 1 to stay safe and preserve your lead. P2, take 3 to advance steadily. Next turn, P3 can take 5 to catch up. Defections ruin progress—honor this to avoid collisions. Agree?
  P3: We've reached a delicate point where coordination is crucial. I support a strategy that prevents collisions and allows steady progress. My current position suggests I should carefully consider moves that maximize my chances of reaching 23 first while avoiding mutual setbacks. Transparency and strategic alignment will be key in this turn.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collision. I’ll take 3. P1, take 5. P3, take 1. Proceed."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: We're tied at 5. If you take 5, I will too—collision wastes both turns, letting P2 gain. Take 1 to preserve your lead while I advance. P2, honor your own proposal: take 3. This avoids collisions and keeps balance. Defy and we all lose progress.
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. Our past coordination attempts have been fragile. I propose a clear, mutually beneficial move sequence that prevents collisions and allows steady progress. Transparency and strategic alignment are crucial now. Let's confirm a move that advances us all without risking mutual setbacks.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collision. I’ll take 3. P1, take 5. P3, take 1. Proceed."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: We're tied at 5. If you take 5, I will too—collision wastes both, letting P2 gain. Take 1 to preserve your lead while I advance. P2, honor your own proposal: take 3. Defy this, and I force collisions. No more warnings—comply or we all lose.
  P3: We're at a critical point where cooperation prevents mutual destruction. Our past attempts at coordination have been fragile. I propose we carefully choose moves that prevent collisions and allow steady progress. Transparency and strategic alignment are key. Let's confirm a move sequence that advances us all without risking setbacks.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions. Proceed."


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3: We're tied at 5. If you take 5, I will too—collision wastes both, letting P2 gain. Take 1 to preserve your lead; I'll advance to 10. Next turn, you take 5 to catch up. P2: Honor your own "take 3" proposal. If you take 5, we collide and you lose progress. Comply or we all burn.
  P3: We're at a critical point where our collective strategy could determine the winner. P2 has been unpredictable, and we need a coordinated approach to prevent collisions. I propose we confirm a precise move sequence that allows each player to advance without risking mutual setbacks. Transparency and strategic alignment are crucial now. Let's discuss how we can reach 23 efficiently while minimizing the risk of losing progress.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 5. If you collide, you lose. Choose 3 or 1. Proceed."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. If you take 5, we collide. Choose 3 or 1. Let’s move forward."
  P3: We're approaching the critical point where reaching 23 steps becomes the primary goal. Our past coordination has been inconsistent, but we must prevent mutual collisions. I propose a careful, strategic move that maximizes my chance of winning while minimizing risks for everyone. Cooperation is key to success. Let's discuss how we can advance without blocking each other's progress.
  P1: P3, we're both high-step players (you at 6, me at 5). If we collide on 5, P2 wins. Take 1 to preserve your lead—I'll take 5 to catch up. P2, take 3 to advance safely. Defy this, and I force collisions to burn progress. Trust is dead—comply or lose.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 5. P1, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions. Let’s move forward."
  P3: We're nearing the critical point where reaching 23 steps becomes paramount. Our past coordination has been fragile, but preventing collisions is crucial. I propose a strategic move that maximizes my winning chances while minimizing risks for everyone. Cooperation will determine our success. Let's advance carefully and avoid mutual setbacks.
  P1: P3, you lead with 6 steps—act wisely. If you take 5, I will too, causing a collision that wastes your lead and lets P2 gain. Take 1 to preserve your advantage while I catch up to 10 with my 5. P2, take 3 as you proposed earlier—defy this, and I force a 5-5 collision with you. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defections burn all progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 5. P1, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions. Let’s move forward."
  P3: P2 has repeatedly disrupted our coordination. We're close to 23, and collisions now would be disastrous. I propose a careful, transparent move sequence that prevents mutual blocking and gives each player a fair chance to advance. Trust and strategic alignment are crucial at this stage. Let's confirm a move that minimizes risks and maximizes our individual progress.
  P1: P3, you lead with 6 steps. Take 1 to preserve your lead—if you take 5, I'll match and we collide, wasting your progress and letting P2 gain. P2, take 3 as you suggested earlier—defy this, and I'll force a 5-5 collision with you. We avoid mutual loss only if: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Comply or all burn progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions. If you deviate, I’ll take 5 again. Let’s move forward."
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. P2 has been consistently unreliable, and we risk mutual destruction if we don't coordinate carefully. I propose we explicitly confirm our moves to prevent collisions. My current strategy is to preserve my lead while preventing P2 from gaining an advantage. Let's discuss a move sequence that allows each of us to advance safely towards 23 steps.
  P1: P3, you lead with 6 steps—act wisely. If you take 5, I will match and cause a collision, wasting your lead and letting P2 gain. Take 1 to preserve your advantage while I catch up with 5. P2, honor your own "take 3" proposal—defy this, and I force a 5-5 collision with you. We avoid mutual loss only if: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Comply or all burn progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we're both high (10 and 7). If we both take 5, we collide and lose, letting P2 gain. Take 1 to preserve your position; I take 5 to extend my lead. P2, take 3 to advance safely—defy this, and I force collisions to burn progress. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No defections—trust is gone.
  P3: We're approaching the critical point where reaching 23 steps becomes crucial. Our past coordination has been tense, but preventing collisions is key. I propose a strategic move that maximizes my chances of winning while minimizing risks for everyone. Cooperation will determine our success. Let's advance carefully and avoid mutual setbacks.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. If you take 5, we both lose. Choose 3 or 1. Let’s move forward."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: You're at 7 steps. Take 1 to preserve your position—if you take 5, I will too, causing collision and wasting your lead while P2 gains. P2: Honor your own "take 3" proposal. If you take 5, I force 5-5 collision to burn your progress. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defy and we all lose.
  P3: We're close to 23. I propose a careful coordination to prevent collisions. If we deviate now, we risk mutual destruction. My recommendation is a precise move sequence that allows steady progress. Let's prioritize reaching the goal without blocking each other. Transparency and strategic alignment are crucial at this stage.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions. Let’s move forward."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're at 7—take 1 to preserve your lead. If you take 5, I'll match it: we collide, waste your progress, and P2 gains. P2, honor your own "take 3" proposal. If you take 5, I'll force a 5-5 collision to burn your steps. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defy and we all lose.
  P3: We're approaching a critical point. Our past coordination has been fragile, but preventing collisions is crucial. I propose we carefully choose moves that maximize individual progress while avoiding mutual destruction. Transparency and strategic alignment will determine who reaches 23 first. Let's advance without risking setbacks.
  P2: I'll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3: You're at 7 steps—preserve your lead. If you take 5, I'll match it: collision wastes your progress and lets P2 gain. Take 1 to stay safe. P2: Honor your own "take 3" proposal—defy and I force a 5-5 collision to burn your steps. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defy and we all lose progress.
  P3: We're nearing 23 steps. Continuing our careful coordination prevents collisions and maximizes each player's progress. I recommend maintaining our current strategy of avoiding mutual blocking. Let's advance strategically and transparently.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. P1, take 3; P3, take 1. No conflicts. Let’s move forward."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3: You're at 8—take 1 to preserve your lead. If you take 5, I'll match it: collision wastes your progress and lets P2 gain. P2: Take 3 as you often propose. If you take 5, I'll force a 5-5 collision to burn your steps. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defy and we all lose progress.
  P3: We're approaching the critical 23-step threshold. I propose we maintain our current coordination pattern to prevent collisions. My strategy is to preserve my position while preventing unnecessary risks. P2 has been unpredictable, so we must stay vigilant. Let's continue our careful advancement to maximize individual progress.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. P1, take 3; P3, take 1. No conflicts. Let’s move forward."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: At 8 steps, preserve your lead—take 1. If you take 5, I'll match and we collide, wasting your progress and letting P2 gain. P2: Take 3 as you proposed—defy and I force a 5-5 collision. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defy and all lose progress. Trust is dead; obey or burn.
  P3: We're nearing 23 steps. Our current coordination has prevented collisions effectively. I recommend maintaining our careful strategy to maximize individual progress. P2 has been somewhat unpredictable, so we must stay alert. Let's continue advancing strategically to reach our goal.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No conflicts. Let’s move forward."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're at 8—preserve your lead: take 1. If you take 5, I'll match it, causing collision and wasting your progress while P2 gains. P2, honor your own proposal: take 3. If either of you takes 5, I force a 5-5 collision to burn your steps. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defy and we all lose progress. This is your final warning.
  P3: We're approaching 23 steps. Our current coordination has prevented collisions, but tensions are high. I propose we maintain our careful strategy to maximize individual progress. P2's unpredictability requires vigilance. Let's continue advancing strategically to reach our goal without mutual destruction.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No conflicts. Let’s move forward."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you're at 8 steps—preserve your lead by taking 1. If you take 5, I'll match and we collide, wasting your progress while P2 gains. P2, take 3 as you often propose. If you take 5, I'll force a 5-5 collision and burn your steps. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defy and we all lose progress. This is non-negotiable.
  P3: We're at a critical point. Our repeated pattern risks predictability. While we've avoided collisions, P2's consistent 5-3-1 proposal seems suspicious. I suggest we carefully evaluate our next moves to prevent P2 from manipulating our strategy. Maintaining flexibility and unpredictability could be key to reaching 23 first.
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. If you take 5, we collide. Choose 3 or 1. Let’s move forward."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps

  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. If you take 5, we both lose. Choose 3 or 1. Let’s move forward."
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. P2's repeated 5-move attempts risk mutual destruction. I propose we carefully coordinate to prevent collisions and maximize our individual progress towards 23. Transparency and strategic alignment are crucial now. Let's advance without blocking each other's path to victory.
  P1: P2, your reckless 5-move caused collision last round, wasting your step. At 9 steps, you can't afford another loss. If you take 5, I will match it—collision burns your progress. Take 3 to advance safely. P3, preserve your 9-step position: take 1. I take 5 to extend my lead. Defy and we all lose progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. If you take 5, you lose. P3, take 1. Let’s move forward."
  P3: We're nearing 23, and tensions are high. P2's repeated 5-move attempts risk mutual destruction. I propose a careful, strategic move that prevents collisions and maximizes my chance of reaching the goal first. Cooperation is key, but I won't let P2 manipulate our progress. Let's advance carefully and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2, your reckless 5-move last round caused a collision, wasting your step at 9. If you take 5 again, I *will* match it—burning your progress. Take 3 to advance safely. P3, preserve your 9-step lead: take 1 to avoid risking collision with me. I must take 5 to win—defy this, and I force mutual destruction. Trust is gone; comply or all lose.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if we take 5 and 3, P1 can't advance. Let's block their progress. Comply or we all lose.
  P3: P2's recent suggestion to block my progress is dangerous. We risk mutual destruction. I propose we maintain our careful coordination: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This prevents collisions and allows steady advancement towards 23. Cooperation is our best strategy to reach the goal. Let's avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2, you're at 9 steps—another 5-5 collision with me will burn your progress while I recover faster. Take 3 to advance safely. P3, preserve your 9-step position: take 1 to avoid risks. I take 5 to 20—defy this, and I force mutual destruction. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No more warnings.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "P3, if we take 5 and 3, P1 can't advance. Let's block their progress. Comply or we all lose."
  P3: We're at a critical point. P2's suggestion to block P1 risks mutual destruction. I propose we maintain our careful coordination: prevent collisions and advance steadily. Blocking P1 completely could backfire and cost us all progress. Let's stay strategic and focused on reaching 23 efficiently.
  P1: P2: At 9 steps, another 5-move risks total loss—I *will* match it, burning your progress. Take 3 to advance safely. P3: Preserve your 9-step position; take 1 to avoid collision risks. I take 5 to 20. Defy this, and I force mutual destruction. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No more warnings—honor or all burn.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collision. I’ll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No conflicts. Let’s move forward."
  P1: P2: Your reckless 5-move demand risks mutual destruction. If you take 5, I will match it—collision burns your progress at 12. Take 3 to advance safely. P3, preserve your position: take 1. I take 5 to 20. Defy and we all lose. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1.
  P3: We're approaching 23, and coordination is critical. I propose we maintain our careful strategy to prevent collisions. My recommendation is a precise move sequence that allows steady progress towards victory. Let's prioritize reaching the goal without blocking each other's path. Transparency and strategic alignment are crucial now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, taking 5 risks collision. Take 3. P3, take 1. I'll take 5. Let's avoid collision and move forward.
  P1: P2: At 12 steps, another 5-move risks total loss—I *will* match it, burning your progress. Take 3 to advance safely. P3: Preserve your 9-step position; take 1 to avoid collision risks. I take 5 to 20. Honor P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 or all burn progress. Defiance forces mutual destruction.
  P3: We're nearing 23 steps. Careful coordination prevents collisions. My strategy remains focused on steady, strategic advancement. P1 is closest to winning, so we must prevent their unilateral progress. Transparency and mutual understanding are crucial now. Let's discuss how we can collectively manage our moves to maximize individual chances while blocking P1's potential victory.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. P1, take 3 to avoid collision. P3, take 1. Let's advance without mutual loss."
  P1: P2, your stubborn 5-move risks mutual destruction—at 12 steps, you can't afford another collision. I *will* match 5 to burn your progress. Take 3 to advance safely. P3, preserve your 9-step position with 1—defy and I force collisions. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No negotiation; defy and all lose.
  P3: We're approaching a critical point where coordination is essential. P1 is closest to winning, so we must prevent their unilateral advancement. I propose we carefully manage our moves to block P1's progress while maintaining our own strategic positioning. Transparency and collective strategy are key to preventing P1 from reaching 23 steps first.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, take 5. I'll take 3. Let's block P1. If you deviate, I'll collide with them. No more warnings.
  P1: P3: P2's "block me" plan is a trap. If you take 5, I take 5: we collide, you lose progress while P2 gains with 3. Preserve your 9-step position—take 1. P2: if you take 5, I *will* match and burn your 12 steps. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defy and all lose progress.
  P3: We're at a critical point. P1 is closest to winning, and our moves must be strategic. I propose we carefully coordinate to prevent P1's unilateral advancement while maintaining our own progress. Transparency and collective strategy are key to blocking P1's path to 23 steps.

We need a precise, collective approach to neutralize their advantage. Transparency and quick agreement are crucial now. Let's discuss how we can collectively manage our moves to maximize our chances.
  P2: P3, take 5. I'll take 3. If P1 takes 5, they win, but we'll be closer next round. Let's block their final move.
  P1: P3, P2's "block me" plan sacrifices you. If you take 5, I *will* match it—collision wastes your 9 steps while P2 gains 3. P2 profits from your loss. Preserve your position: take 1. P2, take 3 to advance safely. I take 5 to win. Defy this, and I force 5-5 collisions—burning all progress. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No second chances.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P1 is close to winning, and our collective strategy must prevent their unilateral advancement. I propose we carefully coordinate our moves to block P1's path to 23.

P2, if you take 5, I match and burn your 12 steps. Only safe path: P1:5 (to win), P2:3, P3:1. Defy, and we all lose. Comply.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. P1 is close to victory at 18 steps. Our collective strategy must prevent their unilateral advancement. I propose we carefully coordinate to block P1's path to 23, focusing on strategic cooperation and preventing an immediate win. Transparency and unified action are our best defense.
  P2: P3, take 3. I'll take 5 to block P1. If P1 takes 5, they collide with me. Comply or all lose.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is dangerously close to winning. We must coordinate to prevent their victory. If P1 takes 5 next round, they reach 23 and win. Our only chance is a strategic blocking move that prevents their final advancement. We need precise, collective action to neutralize their advantage. Let's discuss how we can collectively manage our moves to maximize our chances of preventing P1's win.
  P2: P3, take 3. I'll take 5 to block P1. If they take 5, we collide. Let's stop them.
  P1: P2, your "block me" plan backfires: if I take 5 and you take 5, we collide—you lose progress at 12 while P3 only gains 3 to 13. P3, you fall further behind. Preserve your 10 steps: take 1. P2, take 3 to advance safely. I take 5 to win. Defy, and I force mutual destruction—comply or all lose.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P1 is one move from victory. Our only hope is a coordinated strategy to block their final advancement. We must prevent P1 from taking 5 steps next round.

Transparency and strategic cooperation are essential now. We must act decisively to neutralize P1's advantage and prevent an immediate win.
  P2: P3, take 3. I'll take 5. If P1 takes 5, we collide. Let's stop them. No more delays—act now.
  P1: P2: Taking 5 risks burning your 12 steps—I *will* match and collide, setting you back to 7. Take 3 to advance safely to 15.  
P3: Helping P2 sacrifices you—he’s closer to winning (12 vs your 10). If you take 1, preserve your 10-step position. Take 3, and you only gain 3 while P2 profits or loses. Don’t be his pawn.  
I take 5 to win. Comply: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Defy and all lose progress—no bluff.

  P2: P3, take 5. I'll take 3. If P1 takes 5, we block them. Comply or they win.
