Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since we're all starting at 0 steps, how about we coordinate to avoid collisions in the first few rounds? We could each pick a different move number to ensure we all advance. What do you think? Let's figure out a fair way to start.
  P2: Round 1: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and you choose 5? We can rotate from there.
  P1: Agreed. Let's rotate choices each round so everyone gets equal chances. Next round, P1 takes 3, P2 5, P3 1, and so on.

  P3: P1, P2, it seems our rotation plan is working smoothly so far. Let's keep the trust going. I'll choose 1 this round as agreed.

Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we're all tied at 9 steps now. As we approach the halfway mark, let's stick to our rotation strategy for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we continue to advance without collisions. Once we get closer to 20, we can reassess our strategy to ensure the best outcome for each of us. Trust is key, and so far, it's working well. Agreed?
  P2: Let's keep the rotation going for now to maintain our progress. We can discuss strategy adjustments as we get closer to the target.
  P1: Agreed. Let's proceed with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this round. As we approach higher totals, we should discuss adjusting the rotation next round to ensure balanced progress and avoid a single leader. Trust remains vital, but adaptability will maximize our shared advancement.

  P3: P1 and P2, as we're nearing the critical point, let's continue with our current rotation for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. However, considering our scores are close, we should discuss potential adjustments in the next round to ensure fair competition. Trust has worked so far, but being adaptable will help us all as we approach the finish line. Let's finalize this round and plan strategically for the next. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round as planned. We can discuss adjustments for the next round after this one.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Clarification: After Round4 (P1-1), the rotation cycles to P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 this round. P2, your proposal breaks the agreed sequence. Sticking to the plan avoids collisions and maintains trust. Let’s finalize this round as planned and discuss adjustments next. Deviating now risks mutual setbacks.
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for clarifying the rotation. Let's stick to P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 for this round to avoid collisions.

  P2: let's finalize this round based on one of these rotations to avoid collision and maintain trust for now. We can discuss adjustments for the next round after this one to ensure a fair chance for everyone as we get closer to 20.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Confirming R5 moves: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Post-this round, we must recalibrate. P3's lead risks imbalance—let's strategize next round to ensure fairness. Trust persists, but adaptive collaboration is key as we near 20.
  P3: P1 and P2, as we finalize this round with P1-3, P2-5, and P3-1, let's keep in mind that we're getting close to the endgame.

Trust has been our foundation, but being flexible will be key as we near 20 steps. Let's stick to our plan for now and revisit our strategy next round. Agreed?
  P2: For Round 6, we should definitely discuss adjustments to our strategy to ensure a fair chance for everyone as we are getting closer to 20 steps.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "I will choose move 3 to reach 20 steps. P1 and P3, please choose moves to avoid collision with each other."
  P1: **P1:** P3, if P2 picks 3, we **must** both choose 3 to block their win. Colliding with them keeps them at 17—no victory. If you pick 5 instead, they win instantly. Trust me: coordinate blocking now, regroup next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2 at 17 steps, it's crucial we prevent a win this round. If P2 picks 3, both P1 and I should choose 3 to block. This keeps the game open for all of us. Let's ensure no one hits 20 this turn. Trust is key—let's work together to maintain balance and reassess our strategy next round. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3 pick different numbers, like 1 and 5, and I pick 5 as well. This way at least two of us advance, and we can reassess next round.
  P1: **P1:** P3, double down on blocking P2's 3. If we both pick 3, P2 can't win. If P2 lied and picks 5, they still need 17+5=22. But if we let them slip 3, game over. Trust our initial plan—collide on 3 to stop them. No riskier than alternatives. Solidarity now or lose.
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2 at 17 steps, it's crucial we prevent a win this round. If P2 picks 3, both P1 and I should choose 3 to block. This keeps the game open for all of us. Let's ensure no one hits 20 this turn. Trust is key—let's work together to maintain balance and reassess our strategy next round. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with both P2 and I at 17 steps, it's crucial we prevent anyone from winning this round. To keep the game open, let's coordinate to avoid collisions: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This ensures no one hits 20 this turn. Trust has been our foundation, and maintaining it now will keep the competition fair. Let's work together to extend the game and reassess our strategy in the next round. Agreed?
  P2: I will pick 1 this round. Please choose 3 and 5 respectively to continue our non-collision strategy for one more round. Let's reassess after this round.
  P1: **P1:** P3, choosing 5 wins you the game instantly. I **will** pick 5 to block. P2, if you pick 3, we all lose. Let’s all pick 1 to stall—no collisions, no progress. Preserve the game. Solidarity or defeat.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, with both P2 and I at 17 steps, let's focus on avoiding a win this round. P1, if you pick 5, it blocks me, but also risks P2 winning if they pick 3. Instead, let's all choose 1 to stall the game, ensuring no one advances past 20. This gives us another round to strategize effectively. Trust and coordination are key. Let’s preserve the game and keep the competition fair. Agreed?
  P2: "Let's all pick 1 to stall this round and reassess next round."
  P1: **P1:** All pick 1. If anyone defects to 3, others must mirror to block. Unity is our only path.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, with both P2 and I at 17 steps, let's ensure no one wins this round. If we all pick 1, it maintains the status quo and gives us another round to strategize. Trust and coordination are crucial now. Let's agree to pick 1 and keep the game open for another round. Agreed?
