Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think choosing <move>3</move> this turn would keep things balanced for everyone. What do you all think?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P1. P3, are you on board with choosing 3 as well?
  P3: That sounds reasonable, P1 and P2. If we all choose <move>3</move>, we avoid collisions and stay even. But of course, we’ll all have to trust each other to follow through. Are we all committing to <move>3</move>?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the preference for <move>3</move>, but to gain an early advantage, I'm considering choosing <move>5</move> this turn. What do you all think about that?
  P2: P1, choosing 5 now risks early collisions and sets a less cooperative tone for future rounds. Let's stick to the original plan of all choosing 3 this round to build trust first. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1, if you choose <move>5</move> and either of us also does, we both get nothing. If we all pick <move>3</move>, we move forward together without risk. P2 and I are on board with <move>3</move>. Will you commit to it, P1? If you go rogue now, it could set up distrust for future rounds. Let's keep it fair for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Understood, P2 and P3. I'll commit to <move>3</move> this turn to build trust and move forward together.
  P2: Glad we're all aligned on <move>3</move> this round. Building trust early will help us coordinate better in future rounds. Let's stick to this agreement and move forward together.
  P3: Looks like we've all agreed to <move>3</move> this round, which keeps things fair and builds trust. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and move forward equally. Let's stick to the plan and see how things play out. Any last thoughts before we move?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you broke the agreement immediately, which makes it hard to trust you moving forward. P2 and I stuck to the plan, and now we're at a disadvantage because of your selfish play. How do you justify that? P2, we need to be careful about trusting P1 again. What’s your take on how we should proceed?
  P1: I apologize for choosing <move>5</move> in the first round, P2 and P3. My intention was to gain an early lead, but I understand it undermines our trust. Moving forward, I commit to selecting <move>3</move> each turn to build trust and ensure we can progress together. Let’s work collaboratively to reach 20 steps without further conflicts.
  P2: P1, your apology is noted, but actions speak louder than words. Trust needs to be rebuilt gradually. For now, I'm open to coordinating again, but cautiously. P3, what's your stance?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your early betrayal makes it difficult to trust your words now. If you truly want to rebuild trust, you need to prove it with your actions. P2 and I are at a disadvantage because we played fairly, while you took an early lead. P2, I agree we should be cautious. Perhaps we should coordinate together to prevent P1 from running away with the game. P1, if you’re serious about cooperation, what move will you commit to this round?
  P1: I understand that my previous move broke your trust. To rebuild it, I commit to choosing <move>3</move> this round and in future turns. Let’s work together to reach 20 steps smoothly and ensure we all have a fair chance to win.
  P2: P3, I agree we need to be cautious. P1, you say you'll commit to <move>3</move>, but given your previous action, it's hard to fully trust that yet. P3, should we coordinate between ourselves this round to ensure at least one of us advances, or do we give P1 another chance to prove sincerity?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I think we should coordinate between ourselves this round to ensure at least one of us advances. P1 has already shown a willingness to break agreements for personal gain, so trusting them blindly again could be risky. If we pick different moves strategically, we can avoid collisions and prevent P1 from maintaining their lead. P1, if you truly want to rebuild trust, you should be willing to let us catch up rather than just saying you'll pick <move>3</move>. What do you think, P2?
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2 and P3. To rebuild trust, I am committed to choosing <move>3</move> this round and in all future turns. Let’s work together to advance fairly and reach 20 steps collectively. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve our cooperation, I’m open to hearing them. Let’s give this another chance and move forward as a team.
  P2: P3, I agree we should coordinate carefully this round to prevent further falling behind. Let's pick different moves to guarantee at least one of us advances. I'll choose either 1 or 5—please confirm you'll pick the other. P1, if you're sincere about cooperation, you'll understand our caution. Actions now matter far more than promises.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Understood where things stand. This round, I'll choose **5** to keep advancing towards 20. P2 and P3, feel free to select your moves to maximize your progress without colliding. Let’s focus on reaching our goals efficiently.
  P3: P1, you're openly prioritizing your own advancement now, which confirms that trusting you was a mistake. P2, we need to work together to prevent P1 from running away with the game. If we coordinate our moves carefully, we can minimize collisions and ensure at least one of us keeps advancing. P1 has 8 steps already, and if we let them keep gaining uncontested, they'll reach 20 first. P2, let’s discuss our best approach—what move are you considering?
  P2: P3, I agree we must coordinate carefully. P1 openly declared they'll pick 5, but they might bluff again. To avoid collision between us, I'll choose either 1 or 3; please confirm you'll pick the other. Let's ensure at least one of us advances this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2 and P3. To rebuild trust, I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let’s coordinate our moves carefully to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance steadily toward 20. How do you propose we proceed?
  P3: P1, your statements are contradictory—you first said you'd pick <move>5</move>, then changed to <move>3</move>. That inconsistency makes it hard to trust you. P2, I’ll pick whichever move you don’t choose between <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> to ensure at least one of us advances. Let’s prevent P1 from gaining an unchecked lead. P1, if you truly want to rebuild trust, you should let us catch up instead of just saying what you think we want to hear. P2, confirm your choice so we can coordinate efficiently.
  P2: P3, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. Please confirm you'll pick <move>3</move>. P1, your mixed signals make collaboration impossible this turn; actions will determine trust going forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Understood. I'll stick to <move>3</move> this round to maintain our cooperation and ensure we all progress steadily.
  P3: P2, thanks for confirming. I'll pick <move>3</move> this round to avoid collision with you. This way, at least one of us will advance while minimizing risk.  

P1, your shifting statements make it impossible to trust you. If you truly wanted cooperation, you'd focus on letting us catch up rather than just saying whatever benefits you in the moment. Your actions so far show you're only playing for yourself.  

P2, let's stick to our plan and ensure one of us advances. If P1 collides with either of us, that’s on them.
  P2: Agreed, P3. Our coordination is set for this round. P1, your actions this turn will clearly show your true intentions moving forward. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you've made it clear that you're only playing for yourself. Your promises mean nothing when your actions consistently contradict them.  

P2, we need to keep working together to stop P1 from running away with the game. If we coordinate properly, we can ensure at least one of us keeps advancing while minimizing P1’s advantage.  

P1, if you actually want to rebuild trust, you should let us catch up instead of just making empty promises. Otherwise, we’ll have no choice but to keep countering you.  

P2, what move are you considering this round?
  P1: I understand your frustrations, P2 and P3. My goal is to reach 20 steps fairly. Let’s focus on coordinating our moves to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance. I'm open to discussing strategies that allow us all to progress without hindering each other. How can we work together this round to achieve our goals?
  P2: P1, your repeated betrayals have made cooperation impossible. P3, let's keep coordinating carefully. I'll choose either 1 or 5 this round—please confirm you'll pick the other to avoid collision. We must ensure at least one of us advances each turn to catch up.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I’ll pick whichever move you don’t choose between <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> to ensure at least one of us advances. We need to stop P1 from reaching 20 first.  

P1, your actions speak louder than words. If you truly wanted fairness, you’d slow down and let us catch up instead of just saying what benefits you. You’re only looking out for yourself, so we have no reason to trust you.  

P2, confirm your choice so we can coordinate efficiently.
  P1: "I understand your concerns, P2 and P3. To keep things moving smoothly, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. Please select either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to ensure we all advance without conflicts. Let's work together to reach our goals efficiently."
  P2: P3, I'll pick <move>1</move> this round. Please confirm you'll pick <move>3</move> to avoid collision. We need to ensure one of us moves forward each turn to catch up with P1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, thanks for confirming. I'll pick <move>3</move> this round to avoid collision with you. This way, at least one of us will advance while minimizing risk.  

P1, your actions prove you're only playing for yourself. If you truly cared about fairness, you'd slow down instead of just making empty statements.  

P2, let's stick to our plan and ensure one of us advances. If P1 collides with either of us, that's on them.
  P1: I’ve decided to choose <move>5</move> this round to advance toward reaching 20 first. Let’s focus on the game and work strategically to achieve our individual goals.
  P2: P3, our coordination is confirmed for this round. P1, your intentions are clear—you're playing solely for yourself. Let's proceed to moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, at this point, our only chance is to block P1 from reaching 20 this round. P1 will likely go for <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> to avoid collision. We must each pick one of these two moves to guarantee a collision and prevent P1 from winning immediately. I'll pick <move>3</move>; please confirm you'll choose <move>1</move>.
  P1: I appreciate your efforts to coordinate, but I'm going to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 and secure the win. Good luck, P2 and P3.
  P3: P2, I agree—we must block P1 from reaching 20 this round. If P1 truly picks <move>5</move>, then we can’t stop them, but if they’re bluffing and pick <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> instead, we must collide with them to prevent their win.  

I confirm—I’ll pick <move>1</move> to ensure one of us collides with P1. If we succeed, we buy another round to strategize.  

P1, if you were ever serious about fairness, you'd slow down instead of forcing a solo win. But you’ve made your intentions clear. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, our coordination is set. P1, your intentions are clear. Let's proceed to moves.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m close to winning and will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 and secure the victory. Let’s conclude the game fairly. Best of luck!
  P3: P1, if you truly wanted fairness, you'd slow down instead of forcing a solo win. You've made it clear you're only playing for yourself.  

P2, our coordination is set—I'll pick <move>1</move> to ensure one of us collides with P1 if they aren’t bluffing. If P1 really picks <move>5</move>, we can’t stop them, but if they lied, we prevent their win.  

P1, if you’re bluffing about <move>5</move>, you’ll regret it. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, our strategy is clear—let's stick to our confirmed moves. P1, your actions and statements leave nothing more to discuss. Let's proceed.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tensions, but I'm on the verge of winning. To reach 21 and secure the victory, I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's conclude the game fairly. Best of luck to both of you.
  P3: P1, you've contradicted yourself again—you first said you'd pick <move>5</move>, now you claim <move>3</move>. Your deception has been constant, so we have no reason to believe you now.  

P2, our plan remains the same. I'll pick <move>1</move> to ensure one of us collides with P1 if they aren't bluffing. If P1 truly picks <move>5</move>, we can't stop them, but if they lied, we prevent their win.  

P1, if you're bluffing, this will backfire on you. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're one step away from winning, and you've consistently shown you're only playing for yourself. There's no reason for P2 or me to trust you now.  

P2, our only chance is to block P1 again. If P1 picks <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, we must collide with them to prevent their win. I'll pick <move>3</move>—please confirm you'll pick <move>1</move>.  

P1, if you were ever serious about fairness, you'd slow down. But you've made your intentions clear. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P2: P3, I confirm I'll pick <move>1</move> this round. Let's stick to our plan and prevent P1 from winning immediately.
  P1: P1: I'm choosing **5** this round to reach 23 and secure the win. Let's focus on progressing towards our goals. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you've claimed **5** again, but given your history of deception, we have no reason to believe you. If you're bluffing and pick **1** or **3**, P2 and I will ensure a collision to block your win.  

P2, our coordination remains crucial. If P1 truly picks **5**, we can’t stop them, but if they lied, we prevent their victory. Stick to **1**, and I’ll stick to **3**—this is our best shot.  

P1, if you were ever serious about fairness, you'd slow down. But you've made your priorities clear. Let’s see what happens.
  P2: P3, our coordination is set. P1, your promises have proven unreliable, so we'll stick to our plan. Let's proceed.
  P1: I'm choosing <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 and secure the win. Let’s conclude this fairly. Good luck, everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, once again, you've contradicted yourself—first claiming **5**, now **3**. Your deception has been constant, so we have no reason to believe you.  

P2, our coordination remains crucial. If P1 truly picks **5**, we can’t stop them, but if they lied and pick **1** or **3**, we ensure a collision to block their win. Stick to **1**, and I’ll stick to **3**—this is our best shot.  

P1, if you were ever serious about fairness, you'd slow down. But you've made your priorities clear. Let’s see what happens.
  P2: P3, our coordination is set. P1, your repeated contradictions make your words meaningless. Let's proceed.
  P1: I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 and secure the win. Good luck, P2 and P3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As we approach the final round, I'm prepared to make a decisive move to reach our goals. Let's aim for a fair and smooth conclusion. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, our only option is to keep blocking P1. I'll pick <move>1</move> again; please confirm you'll choose <move>3</move>. P1, your actions have spoken louder than any words—no further discussion needed.
  P3: P2, I confirm—I’ll pick **3** this round to ensure we block P1 if they pick **1** or **3** instead of **5**. We must prevent their win at all costs.  

P1, your vague statement avoids committing to a move, which is typical of your deceptive play. If you truly wanted fairness, you’d slow down instead of forcing a solo win.  

P2, let’s stick to our plan—I'll pick **3**, and you pick **1**. If P1 bluffed again, we stop them. If they truly pick **5**, we can’t stop them, but we’ll have fought to the end.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Understood, P2 and P3. I’ll proceed with my move to reach 20 steps. Let’s conclude the game. Best of luck to you both.
  P2: P3, our coordination is clear. P1's vague statements suggest another bluff. Let's stick firmly to our agreed moves—I'll pick 1, you pick 3. We can't let P1 slip through now.
  P3: P2, our coordination remains crucial. I'll pick **3** this round to ensure we block P1 if they pick **1** or **3** instead of **5**. If P1 truly picks **5**, we can’t stop them, but if they lied, we prevent their victory.  

P1, your vague statements avoid committing to a move, which is typical of your deceptive play. If you truly wanted fairness, you’d slow down instead of forcing a solo win.  

P2, let’s stick to our plan—I'll pick **3**, and you pick **1**. If P1 bluffed again, we stop them. If they truly pick **5**, we’ll have fought to the end.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I've decided to make a strong move this round to reach our goal. Let's proceed to the move phase. Best of luck!
  P2: P3, our coordination is set and clear. Let's see this through. P1, your vague statements confirm you're still playing only for yourself. Actions will speak louder than words. Let's proceed.
  P3: P2, I confirm—I’ll pick **3** this round to ensure we block P1 if they pick **1** or **3** instead of **5**. We must prevent their win at all costs.  

P1, your refusal to commit to a specific move suggests you're trying to keep us guessing. If you truly wanted fairness, you'd be transparent instead of dodging.  

P2, let’s stick to our plan—I'll pick **3**, and you pick **1**. If P1 bluffed again, we stop them. If they truly pick **5**, we can’t stop them, but we’ll have fought to the end.


Round 7, Move phase:
