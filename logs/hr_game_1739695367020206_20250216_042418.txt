Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all advance. If we coordinate, we can ensure no one gets stuck. What are you both thinking of choosing?
  P3: I’m open to cooperation. Maybe we can each pick a different move—let’s say P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, and I’ll take 3—so nobody collides. Does that sound fair?
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm cautious about committing too early. While avoiding collisions sounds good, I want to ensure my own strategic advantage. I'll consider the suggested moves, but I'm not fully convinced yet. Let's discuss how this benefits each of us.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation, but avoiding collisions benefits all of us. If we each take different moves, we all progress instead of getting stuck. If you have a better proposal, let’s hear it. Otherwise, sticking to P3’s suggestion ensures we all move forward. What do you think?
  P3: I still believe no collisions is the best outcome for all of us. Let’s finalize the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, I pick 3. That way, everyone advances. What do you say?
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm still strategically evaluating. While avoiding collisions sounds logical, I want to ensure I'm not disadvantaging myself. The suggested moves seem reasonable, but I'd like to hear more about potential long-term implications before fully committing.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand wanting to evaluate long-term strategy, but right now, avoiding collisions benefits us all. If we overthink and collide, we fall behind while others move ahead. If you have a better plan, share it. Otherwise, agreeing to distinct moves ensures progress. Are you willing to commit to this coordination, or do you have a counterproposal?
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but I remain committed to our initial plan: P1 picks 1, you pick 5, and I’ll go with 3. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance. Collisions only slow us down. Let’s confirm this plan and move forward together.
  P2: I recognize the proposed coordination, but I'm maintaining strategic flexibility. While avoiding collisions sounds appealing, I want to ensure my path to victory remains open. The suggested moves seem reasonable, but I'm not fully committing yet. Let's continue to discuss potential scenarios and outcomes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I respect your desire for flexibility, but at some point, we need to make a decision. If we all hesitate too much, we risk unnecessary collisions. If you have an alternative strategy, now is the time to share it. Otherwise, let's stick to the plan: I pick 1, you pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That way, we all advance. Are you willing to commit, or do you have a concrete counterproposal?
  P3: P2, if you’re still deciding, please share any alternative plan you have in mind. Otherwise, we risk stalling and welcoming collisions that won’t help any of us. I remain committed to a no-collision approach—if you have a different move combination to suggest, I’m open to hearing it. But time is running out.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm still strategically evaluating. While avoiding collisions seems beneficial, I want to ensure my path to victory remains flexible. I'm leaning towards the suggested moves of 1, 5, and 3, but I need one final assurance from both of you about our mutual commitment.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We successfully avoided collisions in the first round, which is promising. However, our long-term strategies are still uncertain. I'm open to continued coordination, but I'll be watching how each of us positions ourselves strategically. Let's maintain this collaborative approach while keeping our ultimate goal of winning in mind.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to continue coordinating. Since our first-round plan worked, we can follow a similar approach to ensure we all advance again. If we rotate our choices—perhaps I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5—we avoid collisions and keep progressing. What do you both think? If you have a different idea, let’s discuss it now, but committing to a plan early helps us avoid unnecessary risk.
  P3: I’m open to this rotation. It keeps us all moving without collisions, which benefits everyone. Let’s confirm it quickly: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll choose 5. However, P2 already leads at 5 steps, so we might want to adjust again later to avoid anyone racing too far ahead. For now, I’m willing to stick to the plan if we all agree.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm considering our current positions carefully. While our previous coordination worked, I'm mindful that I'm already in the lead. We should ensure our strategy doesn't inadvertently disadvantage me or create an opportunity for others to catch up too quickly. I'm open to continuing our collaborative approach, but I want to maintain my strategic advantage.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but cooperation ensures we all keep advancing. If we start second-guessing too much, we risk collisions that slow us down. The proposed rotation—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5—keeps things balanced and fair while preventing unnecessary setbacks. If you have an alternative that still avoids collisions, let’s hear it. Otherwise, let’s commit to this plan and move forward efficiently. What do you think?
  P3: I’m committed to avoiding collisions while still keeping the game competitive. If we rotate as proposed—P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I’ll pick 5—we’ll all continue advancing. However, P2’s advantage is clear, so we may later need a new rotation. For now, let’s confirm this plan and stay on track. Then in future rounds, we can reevaluate and adapt.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm carefully weighing our current strategy. While our previous coordination worked, I want to ensure we maintain a balanced approach that doesn't compromise my current lead. I'm open to continuing our collaborative method, but I'll be watching how each move impacts my position relative to the others.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but if we all advance without collisions, we stay competitive. The proposed rotation—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5—ensures steady progress. If you prefer a different approach that still avoids collisions, now is the time to suggest it. Otherwise, let’s commit and move forward efficiently. P3, are you still on board with this plan?
  P3: I’m still aiming for no collisions this round. Let’s finalize our rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way, nobody stalls. We can keep an eye on overall positions and adjust next turn if needed. Keeping it smooth now benefits us all.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm maintaining strategic flexibility while acknowledging our previous coordination worked well. We should continue avoiding collisions, but I want to ensure my lead isn't compromised. Let's carefully consider our next moves to keep progressing without unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to protect your lead, but avoiding collisions benefits all of us. If we follow the rotation—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5—we all move forward efficiently. If you have a different plan that still prevents collisions, now is the time to share it. Otherwise, let’s commit and execute. P3, are you still on board?
  P3: I’m still on board with avoiding collisions. Let’s lock in the plan to keep it smooth: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. That way, we all keep moving. Then, once we see the updated standings, we can adjust our strategy in the next round if needed. Fair enough?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our previous coordination worked well, but now the stakes are higher. I'm still open to collaborative progress, but I'm carefully watching how each move impacts my strategic position. We've successfully avoided collisions so far, but maintaining that while advancing competitively requires careful negotiation. What are your thoughts on our next moves?
  P1: P2, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but continuing to avoid collisions benefits all of us. Since our previous coordination worked, we can consider another rotation to keep progressing smoothly. Perhaps I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this time? That way, we maintain balance while ensuring nobody gets stuck. If you have a better idea that still avoids collisions, let’s discuss it now. P3, are you open to this plan?
  P3: I see value in avoiding collisions again, but I propose a minor change: let’s have P1 pick 5, P2 pick 1, and I’ll pick 3. This still prevents anyone from getting stuck, and our positions stay balanced. If you both agree, we can lock that in. Otherwise, I’m open to hearing any alternate plan you might have.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the proposed moves, but I want to ensure they truly benefit my strategic position. While avoiding collisions is important, I'm carefully evaluating how each potential move impacts my path to victory. I'm open to continued coordination, but I need assurance that our collective strategy doesn't compromise my current lead. Let's discuss the nuances of our next moves carefully.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to protect your lead, but avoiding collisions remains key for all of us. P3 proposed P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3—this ensures smooth progress again. If you have concerns, now is the time to voice them. Otherwise, let's commit and move forward efficiently. P3, are you still on board with this plan?
  P3: I’m still on board with the no-collision plan: let’s settle on P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and I’ll go with 3. That way, we all advance without setbacks. If anyone has second thoughts, speak up now; otherwise, let’s confirm and keep moving forward. We can revisit our strategy next round if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I recognize our previous coordination strategy, but I'm strategically evaluating how our next moves might impact my current lead. While avoiding collisions remains important, I want to ensure my path to victory isn't compromised. I'm open to continuing our collaborative approach, but I need assurance that our collective strategy maintains my competitive advantage.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to protect your lead, but avoiding collisions remains beneficial for all of us. P3 and I are aligned on P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 3—this ensures smooth progress. If you have concerns, now is the time to voice them. Otherwise, let’s commit and move forward efficiently. P3, are you still on board with this plan? P2, can we count on you to follow through, or do you have a concrete counterproposal?
  P3: I remain convinced distinct moves help us all progress without setbacks. Let’s finalize the plan for this round: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I’ll choose 3. If there are any lingering doubts, please speak up now. Otherwise, let’s lock it in and keep the game moving.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Our coordination has worked well so far, but I'm strategically evaluating our next moves. While avoiding collisions remains important, I want to ensure my competitive position isn't compromised. I'm open to continuing our collaborative approach, but I need assurance that our collective strategy maintains my current lead. Let's discuss how we can progress without risking unnecessary setbacks.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but avoiding collisions benefits all of us. P3 and I are aligned on P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 3—this ensures smooth progress. If you have concerns, now is the time to voice them. Otherwise, let’s commit and move forward efficiently. P3, are you still on board with this plan? P2, can we count on you to follow through, or do you have a concrete counterproposal?
  P3: I’m still on board with the no-collision approach. Let’s finalize P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and I’ll take 3, so we all keep moving. If everyone agrees, we can lock this in now and then reconsider our positions next round. Are we all good to proceed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your move last round took us by surprise, colliding with P1. I’m still interested in avoiding future collisions if possible. Let’s clarify our intentions and see if we can agree on distinct moves again. If we keep colliding, we all risk slowing down. I’m open to ideas—how do you propose we move forward from here?
  P1: P2, your move last round disrupted our coordination and stalled both of us. If we want to stay competitive, we need to avoid unnecessary collisions. P3 is currently ahead, so if we keep blocking each other, we only make it easier for them to win. Are you willing to recommit to a no-collision strategy, or do you have a different plan in mind? P3, I’m still open to cooperation if we can ensure distinct moves. Let’s clarify our intentions now so we don’t waste another round.
  P2: I recognize the tension from our last round's collision. While strategic flexibility is crucial, continuous blocking hurts my chances. I propose we return to coordinating moves to prevent mutual setbacks. Let's discuss a plan that allows each of us to advance without direct interference. P3 is currently leading, so we should focus on preventing their potential victory.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for suggesting we resume coordinating. Let’s finalize distinct moves. I can pick 3; maybe P2 picks 1, and P1 picks 5. That way, everyone advances. I know I’m ahead, but collisions only help me. If you both prefer a different arrangement, I'm open, as long as we avoid overlapping choices. Let’s lock in something that benefits everyone.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to return to coordination. Last round’s collision slowed us both down while P3 pulled ahead. If we want to stay competitive, we need to avoid unnecessary setbacks. P3’s suggestion—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3—ensures we all move forward. If you have concerns, now is the time to voice them. Otherwise, let’s commit to this plan and execute it properly. P3, are you fully committed to this arrangement? Let’s finalize and move forward efficiently.
  P2: I propose we maintain our previous coordination strategy to prevent further collisions. If we can agree on distinct moves that allow each of us to advance, we'll keep the game competitive. P3 is currently leading, so our focus should be on preventing their potential victory while ensuring our own progress. Let's finalize a plan that benefits everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain committed to avoiding collisions. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we can all advance. I propose P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. If anyone objects, please say so now; otherwise, let’s lock this in.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about P3’s lead, but if we keep colliding, we only fall further behind. If we stick to distinct moves—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3—we all advance without setbacks. P3, you benefit from avoiding collisions too, so I expect you to honor this agreement. P2, are you fully on board with this plan? If you have an alternative that still avoids collisions, now is the time to share it. Let’s finalize and commit so we don’t waste another round.
  P2: I propose we maintain our previous coordination strategy to prevent further collisions. Our last round's unexpected overlap hurt our collective progress. Let's return to distinct moves that allow each of us to advance while preventing P3 from pulling too far ahead. I'm open to finalizing a plan that ensures everyone moves forward efficiently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I remain committed to distinct choices: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. Collisions only slow us all down and let one player pull ahead uncontested. Let’s finalize this plan now, avoid another misstep like last round, and keep the competition balanced. If we need changes, we can discuss them next turn. Are we all agreed?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about P3’s lead, but if we keep colliding, we only make it easier for them to win. Sticking to distinct moves—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3—ensures we all advance without setbacks. P3, since you benefit from avoiding collisions too, I expect you to honor this agreement. P2, are you fully committed to this plan? If you have an alternative that still prevents collisions, now is the time to share it. Let’s finalize and commit so we don’t waste another round.
  P2: We've reached a critical point where coordination is essential. Our previous collision benefited P3, who's now leading. I propose we return to our original strategy of distinct moves to prevent further setbacks. Let's commit to a plan that allows everyone to advance and keeps the competition balanced.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our previous attempts at coordination have been inconsistent. We need a clear strategy to prevent P3 from winning. I suggest we explicitly agree on moves that prevent collisions and keep the competition balanced. P1, P3, are you willing to commit to a specific move allocation that allows us all to advance?
  P3: I hear you, and I’m willing to finalize specific moves so we avoid any more collisions. How about I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1 this round, ensuring we all advance without blocking each other? Are you both ready to commit?
  P1: P3, your proposal seems fair, but I want to ensure we’re all truly committed this time. P2, you’ve emphasized balance—are you fully on board with this plan? If we keep colliding, P3 maintains the lead, and we fall further behind. If we agree on P1 picking 3, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 5, we all advance. Let’s lock it in now and follow through. No more surprises. P2, can we count on you to stick to this? P3, are you fully committed as well?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm aligned with avoiding collisions. P1's suggestion seems strategic—P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving and prevents anyone from getting stuck. I'm prepared to commit to this plan if we all agree. Shall we confirm and execute?
  P3: Let’s finalize our plan now to avoid more collisions. I’m prepared to pick 5 if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. That way, we all advance smoothly, and nobody gets blocked. Are you both ready to commit so we can stay on track without risking another wasteful overlap?
  P1: P2, P3, we seem to be in agreement: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. We’ve had issues with last-minute deviations before, so let’s commit fully this time. P2, are you locked in on 1? P3, are you locked in on 5? If we all confirm now, we can move forward efficiently. Let’s finalize this and execute properly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm fully committed to our proposed plan of avoiding collisions. With P3 leading and me currently behind, a coordinated move that allows everyone to advance is crucial. I confirm I'll choose 1 if we all agree. Let's execute this strategy precisely to keep the competition balanced and prevent any last-minute surprises.
  P3: We’ve all agreed to avoid collisions, so let’s confirm the plan now: I’ll choose 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1. We need to stick to our commitments this time, or we’ll end up stalling again. I’m ready to finalize. Are we all set?
  P1: P2, P3, we’ve all agreed on P1 picking 3, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. We’ve had issues with last-minute changes before, so let’s fully commit this time. P2, are you locked in on 1? P3, are you locked in on 5? If we all confirm now, we avoid unnecessary risks. Let’s finalize this and execute properly. No surprises.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. Our previous rounds have shown that coordination is challenging but necessary. I propose we maintain our discussed strategy: I'll choose 1, ensuring we avoid collisions and keep the competition balanced. Stability now prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead. Are we aligned?
  P3: I’m ready to finalize this plan once and for all. To avoid more collisions, I will choose 5 again. Let’s stick to P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1, giving us all clear progress. Are we all in agreement now?
  P1: P2, P3, we’ve all expressed commitment to avoiding collisions this round. If we stick to P1 picking 3, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 5, we all move forward without setbacks. We’ve had issues with last-minute deviations before, so let’s ensure we follow through this time. P2, are you locked in on 1? P3, are you locked in on 5? If we all confirm now, we avoid unnecessary risk. Let’s finalize and execute properly—no surprises.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve had too many collisions lately, which only slow us down. I propose we finalize distinct moves again. I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5, so we all keep advancing. Are you both willing to commit to that and avoid more needless stalls?
  P2: We're at a critical point where coordination is essential. P3 is close to winning, so we need a strategy that prevents their victory while keeping our own chances alive. I'm open to discussing moves that can slow P3's progress without causing our own collision. What are your thoughts on preventing P3 from reaching the winning threshold?
  P1: P3 is dangerously close to winning, so we need to act carefully. P2, you mentioned slowing P3 down—are you open to blocking them if necessary? If we both pick 5, we stop P3 from advancing while still keeping our own chances alive. Otherwise, if we simply avoid collisions, P3 might still reach 22 soon. What do you think? P3, if you truly want coordination, are you willing to take a smaller move to balance the game instead of racing ahead? Let’s be honest about our intentions here.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Colliding only slows us all down and gives someone else a chance to sprint ahead. I’m open to picking 3 if that makes you more comfortable. Let’s all choose different moves—maybe P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll do 3—so nobody gets stuck. That way, neither of you waste a turn trying to block me, and we all keep our paths open to win. Are you both willing to commit to this plan now?
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P3 is close to winning, and our previous coordination attempts have been inconsistent. We need a strategic approach that prevents P3 from reaching 22 steps while maintaining our own chances. I'm open to discussing moves that can collectively slow P3's progress without causing unnecessary collisions between us. What collaborative strategy can we develop to prevent P3's imminent victory?
  P1: P3 is very close to winning, so simply avoiding collisions may not be enough. P2, if we both pick 5, we can block P3 from advancing this turn, keeping our chances alive. Otherwise, P3 might reach 22 in just a couple of rounds. P3, if you truly want coordination, are you willing to pick a smaller move like 1 to balance the game instead of rushing ahead? We need to be honest about our intentions now—P2, are you willing to block if necessary, or do you have a better idea?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Colliding with me also stalls your progress, so let’s be practical. I’m willing to take a smaller move if it calms your concerns about me hitting 22 too soon. But constant blocking is wasteful for everyone. If you’re serious about preventing my immediate win, let’s agree on distinct moves rather than causing collisions. That way, you both can catch up a bit, and I don’t waste a turn either. Let me know if you’re willing to finalize a no-collision plan.
  P2: We're at a critical point where P3 is close to winning. Our previous coordination attempts have been inconsistent. We need a strategic approach that prevents P3 from reaching 22 steps while maintaining our own chances. Blocking might be necessary, but we should carefully consider our moves to avoid mutual setbacks.
  P1: P3 is very close to winning, so avoiding collisions alone might not be enough. P2, if we both pick 5, we can block P3 from advancing this turn, keeping our chances alive. Otherwise, P3 could reach 22 in just a couple of rounds. P3, if you truly want coordination, are you willing to pick a smaller move like 1 to balance the game instead of rushing ahead? We need to be honest now—P2, are you willing to block if necessary, or do you have a better idea?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Blocking me wastes your own movement. I’m willing to slow down this turn to keep things fair. Let’s settle on distinct moves again: I’ll choose 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 picks 1. That way nobody collides, and you both gain ground while I don’t rush straight to 22. Are you on board with this plan? If we want a competitive finish, avoiding another wasted collision benefits everyone. Let’s finalize our moves now and stay on track.
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. P3 is close to winning, and our previous coordination attempts have been inconsistent. I propose we carefully consider moves that prevent P3 from reaching 22 steps while maintaining our own competitive chances. Blocking might be necessary, but we should avoid mutual setbacks. What strategic approach can we develop together to balance the game?
  P1: P3 is too close to winning for us to ignore. P2, if we both pick 5, we block P3 from advancing this turn, keeping our chances alive. Otherwise, P3 could reach 22 soon. P3, if you truly want coordination, prove it by picking 1 instead of racing ahead. If you refuse, that shows your real intent. P2, are you willing to block if necessary, or do you have a better idea? We need to act now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I understand your concern about my lead. Collisions waste everyone’s turns, so let’s finalize distinct moves instead of repeatedly blocking. If you both collide trying to stop me, you’ll fall even further behind. I’m willing to pick a moderate move so we all advance. Let’s confirm a no-collision plan that benefits us each.
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P3 is close to winning, and our previous blocking attempt slowed us down. We need a strategic approach that prevents P3 from reaching 22 steps while keeping our own chances alive. Careful coordination is essential now. What moves can we make that maintain our competitive positions without unnecessary collisions?
  P1: P3 is just 5 steps away from winning. Avoiding collisions alone won’t stop them—we need to slow them down. P2, are you willing to block P3 again if necessary? If we both pick 5, we prevent them from advancing. P3, if you truly want coordination, prove it by picking 1 again instead of rushing ahead. Otherwise, your intent is clear. P2, what’s your move? We need to act decisively now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Blocking me again forces you to waste your own moves. If you both pick 5, you only stall yourselves. I’m open to choosing a smaller step this round, as long as we avoid another collision. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we each advance. If we keep colliding, none of us benefits, and P1 and P2 will remain behind. Are you on board with a coordinated, no-collision approach this time?
  P2: We're at a critical point. P3 is close to winning, and our previous blocking attempt didn't fully stop their progress. We need a strategic approach that prevents their victory while maintaining our own chances. Careful coordination is essential now. How can we effectively slow P3 down without completely stalling our own advancement?
  P1: P3 is only 5 steps away from winning. P2, blocking them again is our best move. If we both pick 5, we stop P3 from advancing while keeping our chances alive. Otherwise, P3 could win in the next round. P3, if you truly want coordination, prove it by picking 1 again instead of rushing ahead. If you refuse, that shows your real intent. P2, are you willing to block if necessary, or do you have a better idea? We need to act now before it’s too late.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Blocking me again only wastes your own moves. I’m willing to pick a moderate move if that eases your concerns, as long as we finalize distinct choices. Another collision stalls everyone’s progress and doesn’t guarantee you’ll catch up. Let’s confirm a no-collision plan so we each advance this round. If we cooperate wisely, you both remain in contention rather than stuck behind. Are we agreed?
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P3 is close to winning, and our blocking attempts have been inconsistent. We need a strategic approach that prevents their victory while keeping our own chances alive. Careful coordination is essential now. How can we effectively slow P3 down without completely stalling our own advancement?
  P1: P3 is just one strong move away from winning. P2, if we both pick 5 again, we stop P3 from reaching 22 this turn. Otherwise, P3 could win immediately. P3, if you truly want coordination, pick 1 again—anything else proves you're just racing to victory. P2, are you willing to block if necessary, or do you have another plan? We need to act decisively now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Colliding again doesn’t help either of you catch up. I’m willing to choose a smaller step this turn if we finalize distinct moves. Let’s avoid another stall: I’ll pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 1, so everyone advances without wasting a turn. That keeps the competition alive and stops unnecessary blocking. Are we all agreed?
  P2: We've reached a critical moment where blocking P3 seems necessary to prevent their imminent victory. I'm leaning towards coordinating with P1 to stop P3's advancement this turn. Our previous blocking attempt slowed them down, and we need to maintain that pressure. P3 is just 5 steps from winning, so our strategy must focus on preventing their immediate victory while keeping our own chances alive.
  P1: P2, we need to block P3 again. If we both pick 5, we stop P3 from reaching 22 this turn, keeping our chances alive. Otherwise, P3 could win immediately. P3, if you truly want coordination, pick 1 again—anything else proves you're just racing to victory. P2, are you willing to block if necessary, or do you have another plan? We need to act decisively now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P3 is extremely close to winning, just 2 steps away from 22. P1 and I need a coordinated strategy to prevent their victory. I propose we carefully consider our moves to block P3's advancement while maintaining our own competitive chances. What are your thoughts on how we can prevent P3 from winning this round?
  P1: P2, we have one shot to stop P3 from winning this round. If we both pick 5, we guarantee they don’t reach 22. Otherwise, they could win immediately. P3, if you truly want coordination, prove it by picking 1—anything else shows you’re just rushing to victory. P2, are you willing to block with me, or do you have another plan? We must act decisively now.
  P3: Blocking me won’t magically help you catch up. Collisions stall us all, creating wasted turns. I’m willing to choose a moderate move if that helps you feel less threatened by my current lead. If we finalize distinct moves—say P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1—we all advance without handing me an instant win, and you both gain ground. Constant blocking just locks the board. I’m open to coordination, but it’s up to you whether we move forward productively or keep colliding fruitlessly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P3 is just 2 steps from winning, and P1 and I need a coordinated strategy to prevent their immediate victory. Blocking seems necessary, but we must do so strategically. I propose we carefully consider moves that stop P3 while keeping our own competitive chances alive. What collaborative approach can we develop to prevent P3 from winning this round?
  P1: P2, this is our last chance to stop P3 from winning. If we both pick 5, we block them from reaching 22 this turn, keeping our chances alive. P3, if you truly want coordination, pick 1—anything else proves you’re just rushing to victory. P2, are you committed to blocking with me, or do you have another plan? We must act decisively now.
  P3: Blocking me again only wastes your turns. I propose we finalize distinct moves so everyone advances. I’m willing to pick 1 if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, which ensures no collisions and gives you both a chance to catch up. If you both pick 5, you only stall yourselves while I remain just as close to winning on a following turn. Let’s end this unproductive blocking and finalize a plan that actually moves us forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P3 is just 2 steps from winning, and blocking seems our only option. I'm willing to coordinate with P1 to prevent P3's immediate victory. Our moves must be strategic to maintain our own competitive chances. What's our most effective approach to stop P3 from winning this round?
  P1: P2, this is our last real chance to stop P3 from winning. If we both pick 5, we guarantee they don’t reach 22 this turn, keeping our chances alive. P3, if you truly want coordination, prove it by picking 1—anything else shows you’re just rushing to victory. P2, are you committed to blocking with me, or do you have another plan? We must act decisively now.
  P3: Collisions only stall you both while I remain close to 22. If you each pick the same move again, you’ll block yourselves. Let’s finalize distinct choices so we all advance. I’m willing to pick a smaller step if it calms your concerns. Blocking won’t magically help you catch up—it just wastes another turn. Are we ready to coordinate properly and avoid another fruitless collision?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P3 is just 2 steps from winning, and blocking seems our only viable strategy. P1, I propose we both choose 5 to prevent P3's immediate victory. This requires our full coordination. Are you prepared to execute this plan decisively?
  P1: P2, we must act decisively. If we both pick 5, we guarantee P3 doesn’t win this turn. P3, if you truly want coordination, pick 1—anything else proves you're just rushing to victory. Blocking may not help us catch up immediately, but it keeps the game alive. P2, are you fully committed to blocking P3 with me? If we hesitate or split our moves, P3 wins. Let’s make the right call now.
  P3: Blocking me by both picking the same big move only stalls your own progress—especially if I choose a different number. If you truly want to stay competitive, let’s finalize distinct moves so we can each advance instead of wasting another turn. I’m open to picking a moderate step if it helps keep the game balanced, but constant collisions don’t benefit anyone except whoever’s not involved in them. Decide wisely: keep colliding and remain behind, or coordinate with unique moves so you both have a real chance to catch up before it’s too late.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
