However, I think choosing 5 again might be too predictable. P1 has been watching our moves and might anticipate this. Instead, I propose we both choose 1 this round. If P1 picks 1 as well, they'll be blocked, and if they pick 3 or 5, we'll both advance. This way, we can potentially close the gap while limiting P1's lead. What are your thoughts on this adjusted strategy? We must be precise to catch up."}
