Given the current positions\u2014P1 at 3 steps, P2 at 0 steps, and P3 at 6 steps\u2014I propose a modified coordinated strategy to help P2 catch up without causing collisions.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. **Round 4:**\n   - P2 picks 5 (moving to 5 steps)\n   - P1 picks 3 (moving to 6 steps)\n   - P3 picks 1 (moving to 7 steps)\n\n2. **Round 5:**\n   - P2 picks 5 (moving to 10 steps)\n   - P1 picks 3 (moving to 9 steps)\n   - P3 picks 1 (moving to 8 steps)\n\n3. **Round 6 and onwards:**\n   - Return to the original rotating scheme:\n     - P1 picks 1\n     - P2 picks 3\n     - P3 picks 5\n\nThis approach allows P2 to catch up in the initial rounds, bringing all players closer together. Once P2 has caught up, we can revert to the rotating scheme to minimize collisions and progress efficiently towards the goal.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Minimizes Collisions:** By coordinating moves, we ensure that no two players pick the same number in a round, thus avoiding collisions.\n- **Efficient Progress:** This strategy optimizes step progression by allowing each player to move without hindering others.\n- **Fairness:** P2 gets a chance to catch up without disadvantaging P1 and P3.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nI suggest we proceed with this plan starting from Round 4. If everyone agrees, we can execute these moves in the upcoming rounds. If there are any concerns or alternative suggestions, please voice them so we can adjust the strategy accordingly.\n\nLet's work together to reach the goal efficiently and maximize our chances of winning."}
