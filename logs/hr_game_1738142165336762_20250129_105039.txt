Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's try to coordinate. How about we alternate moving? One of us takes 1, the next takes 3, and so on. That way, we can avoid collisions and hopefully reach 19 quickly. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your idea of alternating moves could work, but it relies too much on trust. How about this: each of us publicly commits to a number before moving? That way, we minimize collisions. I’ll start—I’ll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to coordinate fairly. If anyone deviates, we risk chaos and no one wins. Let’s keep it simple and transparent. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1, I agree that trust is risky. Public commitment is better. I'll also take <move>1</move> this round if P3 agrees to do the same. Let's all start with <move>1</move> to get going and then we can discuss strategy again after this round. P3, what do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that public commitment is a good idea. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> this round to show I'm serious about cooperating. Let's see if we can make this work.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on starting with <move>1</move>. Let’s use this round to establish trust. After this, I suggest we rotate moves in the order P1 → P2 → P3, sticking to <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> for faster progress. If anyone deviates, it’ll only slow us down. Let’s confirm now: are you both committed to this plan? If yes, we can lock it in and focus on execution.
  P2: P1, I agree to your proposed rotation of moves after this round. P3, are you also on board with rotating P1->P2->P3, using <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>? Let's confirm this now so we can move forward with the plan.


Round 1, Move phase:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round’s collision proves we need stricter coordination. Let’s formalize the rotation: P1 → P2 → P3, with each of us taking <move>5</move> in turn to maximize progress. I’ll go first this round with <move>5</move>. P2, you take <move>5</move> next round, and P3 after that. Confirm now so we avoid further collisions. Trust is critical—if anyone deviates, we all lose. Are you both committed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that sticking to a plan is crucial. I'm committed to the rotation: P1 → P2 → P3, with each of us taking <move>5</move>. Let's make this work.
  P2: P1, I agree to the rotation and taking <move>5</move> next round. P3, please confirm you are also on board with this plan. Let's all commit to this to avoid collisions and move quickly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re all aligned on the rotation plan. To ensure clarity, let’s reiterate: this round, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes it next round, then P3. No deviations. If anyone breaks this, it’ll cost us dearly. Let’s confirm one last time—P2, P3, are you fully committed to executing this strategy without fail? Trust is fragile; let’s prove it now. Once confirmed, we focus solely on execution.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for strict adherence to the plan. I'm fully committed to the rotation: P1 → P2 → P3, with each taking <move>5</move>. Let's make this work and reach 19 together.
  P2: P1, I've already confirmed my commitment to the plan. P3, please confirm again that you will take <move>5</move> in round 3. Let's make sure we are all on the same page before we move forward.

  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for confirmation, but we've already agreed. I'm committed to the rotation and taking <move>5</move> in round 3. Let's trust each other and execute the plan.  We can win this if we work together.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all confirmed the rotation. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move> this round, I take <move>5</move> next round, and P3 the round after. No more confirmations needed, let's just execute.
