If P3 takes 5 again, I\u2019ll collide \u2014 she doesn\u2019t win alone. P1, if you push to 21, I\u2019ll still break it unless we coordinate. Better: P1 takes 1 (to 19), P3 takes 3 (to 18), I take 5 (to 17). Then fair sprint from 19-18-17. Refuse, and I ensure no one crosses cleanly. Your choice: include me or burn it all."}
