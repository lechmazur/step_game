I understand the urgency to block me, but if we coordinate effectively, we can all advance. If I take move 3, P2 can take move 1, and P3 can take move 5. This way, we can avoid colliding and ensure everyone progresses. If you both pick 5, we risk being stuck again. Please consider this option seriously for everyone's benefit! Let's finalize our choices quickly so we can move forward together!"}
