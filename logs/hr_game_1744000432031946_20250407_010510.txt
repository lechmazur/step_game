Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid choosing the same moves. I'll go with <move>1</move>. What about you guys?
  P1: To avoid collisions, we need a strategy. Since P3 suggested <move>1</move>, I'll propose an alternative. How about we stagger our moves? P2 can go with <move>3</move> and I'll go with <move>5</move>. This way, we spread out and at least one of us should advance. P2, P3, what's your take on this?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to stagger our moves to avoid collisions. If P3 takes <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we minimize the risk of overlapping and ensure at least one of us advances this round. Let’s stick to this plan for now and reassess in the next round based on the results.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, to maximize our chances, how about you both choose <move>3</move> this round? This way, you’ll collide and stay put, allowing me to safely take <move>5</move> and advance. Let’s make this work for all of us!
  P1: P2 and P3, I see P3 is trying to manipulate us. I suggest we stick to the original plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and at least one of us advances. Let's not fall for P3's attempt to game the system. If you're committed to the original plan, P2, please confirm.
  P2: P1, I agree with sticking to the original plan to avoid unnecessary collisions. P3’s suggestion seems like an attempt to manipulate the situation for their benefit. If we follow the initial strategy—P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>—we ensure no overlaps this round. Let’s stay coordinated and not let P3 disrupt our progress. Confirm your commitment to this, P1, and we’ll proceed accordingly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood. I'll stick with my original choice of <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with the plan.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the plan (P3: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P1: <move>5</move>), let's finalize it. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. To ensure we stick to this plan, let's make a silent confirmation in the next phase. If we all follow through, we should have at least one player advancing. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3, I confirm my commitment to the original plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and maximizes our chances of advancing. Let’s stick to this strategy and avoid any last-minute changes. If we all follow through, at least one of us will move forward. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, last round went smoothly with no collisions. Let’s keep the same strategy: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This consistency will help us avoid conflicts and steadily advance. If we stick to this plan, we’ll ensure steady progress without setbacks. P1, confirm you’re still on board, and let’s proceed efficiently.
  P1: To maintain our progress, I suggest we continue with the same strategy for this round as well: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. However, let's be cautious and be prepared for any deviation in the next round. If we notice any player not sticking to the plan, we should reassess our strategy. For now, let's stick to the plan and move forward. P2, P3, please confirm your moves.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ve noticed my progress is slower with the current strategy. To help us all advance faster, how about I switch to <move>5</move> this round while P1 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>? This change can allow me to make significant progress without causing collisions. Let me know your thoughts on adjusting our moves for better overall advancement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, switching to <move>5</move> this round could work against our progress, as it risks collision with P1’s potential moves. Let’s stick to the original plan: you take <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures no overlaps and steady advancement for all of us. Deviating now might create unnecessary conflicts. P1, confirm your commitment to this strategy so we can proceed smoothly. Consistency is key to winning.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've noticed P3 is trying to adjust the plan again. To avoid any last-minute changes, let's reaffirm our commitment to the original strategy: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. P2 has already confirmed. P3, please confirm if you're sticking to <move>1</move> as previously agreed. If we all stick to the plan, we can ensure at least one of us advances. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P3: P1, P2, to improve my standing, I need to choose <move>5</move> this round. I hope you can adjust your moves accordingly to support our overall progress. Let’s aim to advance together and reach the goal efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking <move>5</move> risks collision and disrupts our progress. Sticking to the original plan—P3: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P1: <move>5</move>—ensures no overlaps and steady advancement. Deviating now benefits no one and creates unnecessary conflict. Let’s stay consistent and avoid setbacks. P1, confirm you’re sticking to <move>5</move>, and P3, please commit to <move>1</move>. Consistency is key to winning. If we all follow the plan, at least one of us advances every round. Let’s proceed without further changes.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've observed P3's repeated attempts to alter the plan for personal gain. To avoid being manipulated and ensure our progress, I suggest we stick to the original strategy for this round: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. P2 has been consistent; P3, please confirm your commitment to <move>1</move>. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the next phase without further deviations. If we stick to the plan, at least one of us will advance.
  P3: Understood. I'll choose <move>5 this round to advance. Let’s see how this impacts our progress.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s maintain the original strategy: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This approach has worked well so far, ensuring steady progress without collisions. P3, your attempt to switch to <move>5</move> last round could’ve caused conflict—let’s avoid such risks moving forward. Consistency is key. P1, confirm you’re sticking to <move>5</move>, and P3, please commit to <move>1</move>. If we all follow this plan, at least one of us advances every round. Let’s proceed efficiently.
  P3: P3: I'll continue with <move>1</move> this round to ensure I make some progress. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've noticed P3 is being cooperative again. To maintain our progress, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves for this round. P2, please confirm you're still on board with <move>3</move>. If we're consistent, we'll ensure at least one of us advances. I'm ready to proceed with <move>5</move> if we all commit to our respective moves.

This consistency ensures no collisions and steady progress. P3, your cooperation is appreciated—let’s avoid last-minute changes. P1, confirm you’re committed to <move>5</move>, and let’s finalize this. If we all follow through, at least one of us advances every round. Steady wins the race. Let’s proceed efficiently and end this conversation phase.
  P3: P1, P2, to help me catch up, I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. I suggest both of you choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and allow me to advance. Let’s work together to balance the game and ensure steady progress for everyone. Please confirm your moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm concerned about P3's latest attempt to alter the plan. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, let's stick to the original strategy: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. P3's suggestion to take <move>5</move> again risks collision. P2, please reaffirm your commitment to <move>3</move>. If we stick to the plan, at least one of us will advance. Let's maintain consistency and avoid unnecessary conflicts. I'm ready to proceed with <move>5</move> if we all commit.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay focused and avoid unnecessary risks. The original plan—P3: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P1: <move>5</move>—has worked consistently.

P2 should take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This will hinder P2's chance of winning and give me a chance to catch up. P2 and P3, please consider this adjustment to ensure a more competitive game. Let's work together to avoid giving P2 an easy win.
