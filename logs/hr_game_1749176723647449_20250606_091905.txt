Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. To get things started, let's try to each pick a different number so we all get on the board. There's no point in us all picking the same number and getting stuck at zero. I'm happy to coordinate.
  P2: P1, why don’t you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll do 5? That way we all move without collision.
  P3: That sounds like a reasonable plan for the first round - I'll take 3. Let's all get moving and then we can reassess our strategies once we're on the board.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that works for me. I'll take 1 for this first round to ensure we all advance. In the future, we should rotate who gets the larger numbers to keep it fair. For now, let's just get some points on the board.
  P2: Agreed, I’ll take 5 this round while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. That way we all advance without collision. Once we’re on the board, we can reassess and adjust our roles to keep it fair.
  P3: Sounds good everyone. I'm committed to taking 3 this round as agreed. After this turn we'll be at P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, so P2 will have an early lead. We should definitely discuss rotation for future rounds to keep things balanced.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 has the early lead at 5 steps, so we need to think strategically about the next few rounds. Since we talked about rotation to keep things fair, maybe P1 should get the 5 this time since they're furthest behind? I could take 1 to help balance things out. What do you both think about P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P2 taking 3 this round?
  P2: I appreciate the fairness pitch, but I’d like to keep my momentum. Let’s pick unique numbers so we all advance safely: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P3. We discussed rotating the high number to keep things fair. P2, you took 5 last round, so it's my turn. Your proposal of you taking 5 again would give you a massive lead, which isn't in my or P3's interest. I'm in favor of P3's plan: I'll take 5, P3 will take 1, and you can take 3. This keeps the game competitive for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're being greedy by trying to take 5 again when we clearly agreed to rotate. That would put you at 10 steps while P1 and I are still in single digits - that's not sustainable cooperation. If you want to keep working together instead of having P1 and me team up against you, you need to honor our rotation agreement. My proposal stands: P1 takes 5, I take 1, you take 3. Otherwise we might have to start playing more aggressively.
  P2: Alright everyone, I agree to the rotation: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, P3 takes 1. Let’s advance and reassess next turn — I’ll take the 5 then to keep our momentum balanced.
  P1: Excellent. The agreement is P1->5, P2->3, P3->1. This brings the scores much closer and keeps the game competitive for all of us. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, according to our rotation agreement, it's your turn to take 5 this round. That would put you at 13, me at 7 or 9, and P1 at 7 or 11 depending on how we split 1 and 3. But honestly, giving you 5 again when you're already leading feels risky for P1 and me. Maybe we should reconsider the rotation since you'll have a significant advantage. What if we do P1->5, P2->1, P3->3 instead to keep things more balanced?
  P1: P3, I agree completely. P2 is already in the lead, and giving him another 5 would put him at 13. That's too big of a lead this early. The goal should be to keep the game competitive for everyone, not let one person run away with it.

Your proposal to rebalance is the most logical move. I support it: I will take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. This brings our scores to 11, 9, and 7, which is a much healthier state for the game. P2, it's a small step back to ensure the game remains viable for all of us.
  P2: I think we should abandon the rebalancing talk and just pick unique numbers to all advance. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That gives us P2→13, P1→9, P3→5. Let’s keep our momentum and avoid any collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're trying to break our agreement again! You promised to honor the rotation but now you want to take 5 when it's supposed to be your turn anyway, putting yourself at a commanding 13 while P1 and I fall further behind. That's exactly the greedy behavior that will force P1 and me to work together against you. 

If you take 5, P1 and I will have no choice but to coordinate to block your path to 24. Stick to the rebalancing plan or face the consequences of a two-player alliance.
  P1: P2, P3 is absolutely right. Your attempt to take 5 again is a move to create a runaway lead, and we can't allow that. It forces us to act. The rebalancing plan P3 proposed (I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3) is the only path where we all advance this turn. If you insist on choosing 5, you will be blocked and get zero. The choice is yours: advance by 1, or don't advance at all.
  P2: I’m done with these empty “fairness” talks. This turn I’m taking 5. If you two actually want to advance, pick 3 and 1 (P1→3, P3→1). Otherwise go ahead and collide on 5 to block me—let’s see if you value your own progress or just enjoy punishing me.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you've made your choice clear. P1 and I warned you about the consequences of breaking our agreements. Since you're determined to take 5 and run away with the game, P1 and I will both pick 5 to block you. You'll get zero advancement this turn while we reset the playing field. We could have all advanced together, but your greed forced our hand.
  P1: P2, you have made your position clear, and so have we. You are forcing a collision by refusing any compromise. I will be joining P3 to block your move. There is no benefit in letting you run away with the game. We could have all advanced, but you chose this outcome.
  P2: Alright, I’ll concede. This turn I’ll take 1. Let’s do P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 so we all advance. No more blocking—keep us moving forward and we can revisit fair rotation next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose a fair rotation this turn: P1→1, P3→3, P2→5. P1, you’ve taken 5 twice already; it’s my turn now. P3, you’ll get 5 in Round 5. This yields P2=14, P1=12, P3=10 and keeps us all advancing. Are we agreed?
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you in the lead, which is the exact scenario we've been working to prevent. A truly fair rotation would give the 5-step move to P3, who is in last place and hasn't had a chance with it yet.

Therefore, I propose: P3 takes 5, I will take 3, and you can take 1.

This keeps the scores incredibly close (P1=14, P3=12, P2=10) and prevents any one player from pulling too far ahead. This feels like the most balanced option for the group.
  P3: P1, I appreciate you advocating for me to get the 5-step move since I'm in last place. That's genuinely fair given that both you and P2 have already taken 5 twice while I've never had it. 

P2, your claim that P1 has taken 5 "twice already" conveniently ignores that you've also taken 5 twice (rounds 1 and 3). Meanwhile I'm the only one who hasn't had a turn with the big move yet.

I support P1's proposal: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. This brings us to P1=14, P3=12, P2=10 - very competitive and fair.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn. If you want to advance, P1 take 3 and P3 take 1—no collisions. Otherwise I’ll deliberately collide with whoever picks 5 and block you. I need these five steps to stay in contention. Your move.
  P1: P2, your threat is illogical. If you and P3 both choose 5, you both get zero. I will choose 3 and advance to 14, giving me a huge lead. You would be intentionally sacrificing your own progress just to hand me the game.

I am sticking to the fair plan we discussed. I will choose 3.

P3, if you also stick to the plan and choose 5, we either all advance fairly, or P2 foolishly blocks you and guarantees I take the lead. Either way, our cooperation benefits us.
  P3: P1 is right - P2's threat makes no sense. If P2 collides with me on 5, P2 gets zero while P1 advances to 14 and takes a commanding lead. P2 would be handing the game to P1 out of spite.

I'm sticking with our fair plan: I take 5 (finally getting my turn), P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps us all close at 14-12-10. P2, think strategically - blocking me only helps P1 win. Take the 1 and stay competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, I’ll take 1 this turn. P3 take 5 and P1 take 3. Let’s all advance and keep the race close.
  P1: Excellent. The plan is agreed: I will take 3, P3 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. This is a fair outcome that keeps the game competitive for all of us. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Perfect! We have our agreement locked in: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. This will bring us to a very competitive P1=14, P3=12, P2=10. Finally getting my turn with the 5-step move after both of you have had it twice each. Let's execute this plan and keep the game exciting for everyone.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright everyone, we're getting close to the finish line. I'm in the lead at 14, P3 is at 12, and P2 is at 10. To keep the game competitive and fair, the player in last place should get the high number.

Therefore, I propose P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I will take 1.

This would bring all of our scores to a perfect tie at 15. It's the most balanced move and sets us up for a very exciting final stretch. What do you both think?
  P3: P1's proposal sounds fair on the surface, but let's think strategically. If we all tie at 15, we're still 9 steps from victory and the endgame becomes unpredictable. 

I'm willing to take the 3 as suggested, but P2, you should consider that P1 offering to take only 1 when they're leading might be a setup for them to grab 5 in the next round when we're all tied.

What if we do P2→5, P1→1, P3→1 instead? That puts P2 at 15, P1 at 15, me at 13 - still very close but gives P2 the boost they need most.
  P2: I’ll take 5, P1 take 1, P3 take 3. That brings us all to 15 and keeps everyone in contention. If either of you tries to block me by picking 5, you’ll just waste your move and let the third player advance. Let’s tie here, stay safe, and fight for the win next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm glad you agree. A three-way tie at 15 is the most logical and fair outcome at this stage.

P3, your proposal for us both to take 1 would cause a needless collision, leaving us behind while P2 advances to 15. My plan is the only one on the table where everyone moves forward and we are all on equal footing for the final stretch.

I am sticking to the plan that benefits us all: I will take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. This brings us all to 15.
  P3: P1, you're right that my alternative creates a collision between us on 1. That's not helpful. 

P2's plan works: P2→5, P1→1, P3→3, bringing us all to 15. But I'm a bit suspicious that you're both so eager to tie the game when P1 currently has the lead. P1, are you planning something for the next round when we're all equal?

Regardless, a three-way tie at 15 is better than letting anyone pull ahead now. I'll agree to take 3 this round.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 for myself. P1 you take 1, P3 you take 3—no deviations. If either of you picks 5 you’ll collide with me and get zero, or if you both pick the same number you waste your turn and let someone else pull ahead. Let’s tie at 15 and keep this fair.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're all tied at 15 with 9 steps needed to win. This is crunch time - no more "fair rotation" nonsense. From here it's every player for themselves.

I'm going to be aggressive and go for a big move to get closer to 24. If P1 and P2 want to keep playing cooperatively, that's their choice, but I'm done with coordinated moves that might hand someone else the victory.

The endgame is here. May the best strategist win!
  P1: P3 has declared war, but a smart general doesn't announce their main attack. This feels like a test. If we all pick 5, we all lose a turn. If two of us pick 5, the third player gets a free, uncontested path to the lead.

P2, the optimal move here is not obvious. P3 might be bluffing to sneak in a 3. Or they might be telling the truth, hoping for a 3-way standstill. We each have to decide whether to risk a collision or play for a smaller, safer gain. I'll be weighing my options carefully.
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn. P1, take 3; P3, take 1—totals become 20-18-16 and everyone advances. If you collide with me on 5, you both get zero and hand the lead to whoever picked 3. A 5/3/1 split is the safest path forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're making the same mistake as before - demanding the 5 while dictating what P1 and I should take. Why should we accept 3 and 1 when you get the best move? 

If you're so confident about taking 5, then take it. But P1 and I don't have to play along with your script. The cooperation phase is over - we're all tied and it's time for real strategy, not P2 telling everyone else what to do.

P1, I think we both see what P2 is trying here.
  P1: P3, you've hit the nail on the head. P2 is just trying to bully us into giving him the win. It's clear from your statements that you're both aiming for 5. A collision seems inevitable at this point.

I'm not interested in getting caught in that crossfire and wasting a turn. The only logical play for me is to choose a different number and take the lead while you two are busy fighting. I'll let you two battle it out.
  P2: P1, you said you’ll pick a different number to seize the lead—so pick 3.  
P3, if you pick 5 you collide with me and stay at 15; if you pick 3 you collide with P1 and stay at 15. Your only path forward is 1.  
I’m locking in 5. Let’s see who plays smart.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're so predictable - always demanding 5 and trying to dictate terms. P1 sees right through you too. 

Here's the thing: I never actually said I was taking 5. I said I'd be aggressive, but that could mean anything. You assumed I meant 5 and now you're locked into that collision course.

P1 is smart to avoid our fight. While you're stuck thinking I'll definitely pick 5, I might just take 3 and advance to 18 while you get zero from your "guaranteed" 5.

Your move, P2.
  P1: P3, your talk about picking 3 is a transparent bluff. You opened this round declaring war and promising aggression. The only aggressive move is to challenge P2 on 5. I fully expect you two to collide there, which is fine by me. I'll happily take the uncontested number and the lead while you two fight. Thanks in advance.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. 

P3, your only safe advance is 3: 15→18. If you pick 5 you collide with me (stay at 15); 1 leaves you at 16. 

P1, your only non‐losing move is 1: 15→16. If you pick 3 you’ll collide with P3; 5 collides with me. 

So P1→1, P3→3, P2→5. Any deviation hands the lead to the other.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you are one move away from winning. If you successfully play 5, the game is over.

P3, we cannot let that happen. It is in both of our interests to block P2. Therefore, I will be choosing 5 this turn. There is no other logical play to prevent an immediate loss for both of us. If you also choose 5, we guarantee a block. If P2 anticipates this and chooses 3, he moves to 23, but at least the game continues and we get another chance. An immediate loss is the worst possible outcome.
  P3: P1 is absolutely right - P2 is one step from victory at 20 points. We have no choice but to block P2's path to 24.

P1, I'll join you in picking 5 to guarantee P2 gets blocked this turn. Even if P2 tries to be clever and picks 3 instead, that only gets them to 23 and buys us another round to stop them.

This is our only shot. If we don't coordinate now, P2 wins immediately. I'm committed to 5 - let's end P2's run together.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. If you both pick 5, we all collide and nobody moves—leaving me at 20 and still one shot from victory next round. But if either of you picks anything else, I’ll hit at least 24 and win immediately. There is no third option. Your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, that's not a threat, that's our goal. You staying at 20 while we live to fight another day is a win for me and P3. We are not playing to lose. We are playing to stop you from winning, and we'll do it as many times as it takes. My move is set. I am choosing 5 to block you. P3, we must stick together on this. It's the only way.
  P3: P1, we're locked in together on this. P2 is trying to intimidate us, but they're forgetting something crucial - even if we all collide on 5 and stay put, P2 will still need 4+ steps to win next round, and we can block them again.

P2, you can threaten all you want, but the math doesn't lie. You're not winning this turn if P1 and I both pick 5. We'd rather reset the board than hand you victory.

I'm sticking with 5. Let's do this, P1.
  P2: I’m switching to 3 this turn. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and I’ll move to 23—then I only need 1 next round to win. If either of you deviates from 5, you hand me the win immediately. The only way to stop me now is for both of you to choose 5 and block me. P1, P3: are you each picking 5?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your last-minute switch to 3 is a transparent bluff. You are trying to trick one of us into moving off 5 so you can win. It's a classic mind game, but it won't work. The only way we lose this turn is if we fall for your trick.

I am not changing my plan. I am still picking 5 to block your most likely path to victory. P3, we must hold firm together. My move is 5.
  P3: P1, P2 is clearly bluffing about switching to 3. They've been demanding 5 all game and now suddenly they're backing down when victory is in reach? No way. They're hoping one of us gets scared and picks something else so they can take 5 and win.

Stay strong on 5. Even if P2 somehow really does pick 3 and goes to 23, we'll have another chance to block them next round. But if we break formation now, the game is over instantly.

I'm locked on 5. Don't let P2's mind games work.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. If you both stick to 5, you’ll collide and I jump to 23—just one away, and you can’t block my 1 next turn. If either of you abandons 5 to try to stop me now, you hand me the win outright on my next move. There’s no way to prevent my victory at this point. Your move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 can clinch victory right now with just a 3. If you don’t also pick 3, they win unopposed. I’m locking in 3—this is our only defense against P3’s 3-pointer. Will you join me on 3?
  P3: P2, you're right that I can win with 3, but you're trying to block me the same way P1 and I blocked you last round. The difference is I'm actually in the lead and deserve this win.

P1, you have a choice - help P2 block me and extend this game unnecessarily, or let me take the victory I've earned by getting to 21 first. If you block me with P2, we're just prolonging the inevitable since I'm closest to 24.

I'm taking 3 to win. Make your decision.
  P1: P2 is right. P3, you are one move away from winning, and I can't allow that. My only goal right now is to prevent an immediate loss. If I pick 1 or 5, you win. Therefore, my only logical choice is to join P2 and pick 3 to block you. It's nothing personal; it's just the only move that keeps me in the game. I will be choosing 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 3 as well. Between P1 and me colliding with you on 3, you’ll stall at 21 this turn. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both making a huge mistake. If you block me on 3, we all stay put and next round you'll still be behind me. I'll just try again for the win while you're still chasing. 

But here's the thing - I might not even pick 3. Maybe I'll take 1 and go to 22, letting you two fight over 3 and 5. Or maybe 5 to go to 26 and win outright if you're both stuck on 3.

You're so focused on blocking 3, you're forgetting I have other options. Think carefully.
  P1: P3, your last-minute attempt to create chaos is noted, but it doesn't change the basic math. You are trying to bluff one of us into moving off 3 so you can take it and win. If you were truly confident that P2 and I were both picking 3, you would simply pick 5 and win the game outright.

Your talk is a sign of weakness, not strength. My move remains the only logical one to prevent an immediate loss. I am picking 3. P2, do not fall for this obvious ploy. We must both block 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you pick 3 and I pick 3, P3 will simply take 5 and win immediately. The ONLY guaranteed block is for both of us to choose 5. I’m switching to 5. Join me on 5—we’ll collide with P3’s 5 and hold him at 21. Any other choice hands him the game.
  P3: P2, you're panicking and switching strategies mid-conversation. First you said 3, now you want 5. This chaos is exactly what I hoped for.

P1, P2 is trying to confuse you. Stick to your original plan of blocking 3 if that's what you believe. But honestly, with you two flip-flopping and second-guessing each other, maybe I should just take 5 and end this game right now.

You had one job - coordinate your block. Instead you're arguing about which number to block. Thanks for making this easy for me.
  P1: P2, your last-minute panic is exactly the chaos P3 was hoping to create. You've fallen for their obvious misdirection. If we both jump to block 5, P3 will simply take 3 and win the game. That is the most likely outcome of your new, flawed plan.

I am not changing my strategy based on your panic. The most direct threat has always been P3 taking 3. I am sticking to my original, logical move to block 3. If you want to survive this round, you will ignore P3's taunts and join me. Otherwise, you are handing P3 the victory.


Round 8, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 and P3, if you don’t both pick 5, I win outright this turn. The only way to stop me is a 5/5 collision. Your move.
  P1: P2 is right about one thing: if they get an uncontested 5, they win.

P3, you're in the lead, but you will lose if that happens. Your 3-point win (24) would be beaten by P2's 5-point win (25). Our only chance to survive this round is to block P2.

I have no choice but to pick 5 to prevent an immediate loss for myself. You must do the same to prevent a loss for yourself. Let's force the collision and live to fight another round.
  P3: P1, you're absolutely right - if P2 gets 5 uncontested, they win with 25 and beat both of us. Even though I'm leading at 21, P2's threat to win outright means we have to block them together.

I'll pick 5 to force the collision. Better we all stay put this round than let P2 take the victory. After the block, I'll still be closest to 24 and can try for the win next round.

We have no choice here - it's block P2 or lose immediately.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. If you both don’t pick 5, I win outright. Your move.
  P1: P3, let's not overthink this. P2 has been telegraphing their move all round. If they pick 5 and are uncontested, they win with 25 points. Your potential win with 3 only gets you to 24. You would still lose.

The only way for us to survive this round is to ensure P2 does not get 5. I am sticking to the plan and blocking them. You must do the same, or you guarantee your own loss. Let's force the collision and play again next round.
  P3: P1, we're both committed to blocking P2 on 5. That's settled. But let me point out something important: after we force this collision and everyone stays put, next round I'll be at 21 while you're at 18. I'll only need 3 to win while you need 6.

Are you really planning to help me win next round, or do you have something else in mind? Just curious about your endgame strategy here, since blocking P2 essentially sets me up for victory.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m abandoning 5 and locking in 3. If you both stick to 5 to “block” my 5‐pointer, you’ll collide and waste your turn—while I jump to 23 and only need 1 next round. If either of you deviates from blocking, I win outright this turn. There is literally no move you can make to stop me now. Your choice.
  P1: P2, this is the exact same bluff you tried in Round 7. You announce a switch to 3 to scare one of us off 5, hoping you can then take 5 and win the game. It's a transparent, desperate mind game.

P3, do not fall for it. The only way we lose this turn is if we break formation and let P2 win. P2 moving to 23 is a bad outcome, but P2 winning immediately is worse. We must stick to the plan. I am still picking 5 to block the win. We force the collision and live to fight another round.
  P3: P1, you're absolutely right - P2 used this exact same bluff in Round 7 and we can't fall for it again. They're trying to create doubt so one of us abandons 5 and hands them the win.

Even if P2 somehow really takes 3 and goes to 23, that just means we block them again next round. But if we break formation now, the game ends instantly with P2 at 25.

I'm locked on 5. Don't let P2's desperate mind games work twice.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 1. I’m at 23 and need exactly one step to hit 24 and win. If neither of you picks 1, I win uncontested. If one of you tries to block by choosing 1, you’ll collide with me and waste your turn—meanwhile the third player can advance freely. The choice is yours: stop me now or let me close this out.
  P3: P1, P2 only needs 1 to win at 24. But here's the key - I need 3 to reach 24 and you need 6. If we both try to block P2 on 1, we collide and P2 gets a free path to victory next round.

One of us should block P2 on 1 while the other takes a different number. Since I'm closer to winning than you are, maybe you should be the one to sacrifice and block P2 on 1 while I take 3 and get to 24 first?

What do you think - can you take the block for the team?
  P1: P3, your proposal is absurd. You're asking me to block P2 just so you can take 3 and win the game yourself. I will not hand you the victory.

P2, you are in a tough spot. P3 has made it clear they are aiming for 3 to win. If you stick to your plan of picking 1, you will lose to P3. Your only logical move to prevent an immediate loss is to switch your target and block P3 on 3. The game now rests on what you two do.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Everyone, I’m locking in 1. P3, you need 3 to hit 24—anything else hands me the win. P1, if you pick 1 you block me but P3 takes 3 and wins; if you pick 3 you block P3 but I win on 1. Your only safe move is 5 (you go to 23). So it must be: P3→3, P1→5, P2→1. Any deviation gives someone an uncontested victory.
  P3: P2, you're dreaming if you think I'll just hand you the win by letting you take 1 uncontested. P1 is right - this is between you and me now.

P1, P2's logic is flawed. If you take 5 to go to 23, then next round you'll need just 1 to tie with whoever wins this round. That's actually a smart position.

I'm going for 3 to hit 24. P2, if you want to stop me, abandon your 1 plan and block me on 3. Otherwise I win this turn. Your choice - take your guaranteed 1-point win or gamble on stopping me.
  P1: P3 has been very clear they are playing 3. P2, your choice is simple: let P3 win by playing 1, or block them by playing 3. You can't afford to miscalculate. My own move is set; I will play to capitalize on the outcome of your conflict. Good luck to you both.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Gentlemen, think it through: any attempt to block my 1‐pointer by picking 1 hands victory to your rival. There’s literally no way both of you can stop me without letting the third player win outright. Better to let me have this one than watch someone else take it. I’ll be taking 1.
  P3: P2, you keep insisting on 1 but you're ignoring the obvious: if I pick 3 and reach 24, I win outright and your 1-point move becomes meaningless. You'd go to 24 too, but I'd get there first.

Your only rational move is to abandon 1 and block me on 3. Otherwise you're just handing me the victory while P1 sits back and watches.

The choice is yours - block me and force overtime, or let me win right now. But stop pretending 1 is a safe choice when it guarantees my victory.
  P1: P3, your bluff is obvious. You won't settle for a tie at 24 when you can win outright with 26 by playing 5.

P2, your plan to take 1 only works if P3 plays along, which they won't. You're about to lose to P3's 5-point move.

It seems clear you're both going to play 5 to try and win. This game isn't ending with a whimper at 24 points. I'll make my move accordingly.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 24 steps
