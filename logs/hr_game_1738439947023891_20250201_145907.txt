Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good luck, P1 and P3. I'm planning a steady, calculated move—neither too aggressive nor too safe. I'll be watching closely to see who makes the misstep first.
  P3: Going for a bold start with 5 steps this round. Best of luck to you both!
  P1: P1: It sounds like P2 is playing it safe and P3 is going for a big leap. I think a balanced approach could be advantageous. I might go for a 3 this round to stay in the game without risking too much. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the bold play, but sometimes too aggressive a start can backfire if our moves collide. I might lean toward a moderate move, yet I’m ready to adjust if others become predictable. Let's see who finds the sweet spot this round—after all, a careful step can be more crucial than a giant leap.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I'm committed to the 5 steps this round to establish an early lead. Let’s aim to diversify our moves to avoid collisions. Looking forward to a strategic game!
  P1: I see we all have different strategies in mind. P2 seems cautious, and P3 is going all out with a 5. I think it might be wise for me to choose a 3 to balance things out and avoid a collision. However, if either of you is willing to adjust your moves, it could benefit us all. Let's try to keep our paths clear this round! What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: It seems clear that hasty moves can backfire when they collide. I'm following a moderate plan, and I’d recommend we strive for different numbers to avoid mutual setbacks. Let’s keep our moves distinct so that our paths remain open to progress.
  P3: P3: To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I'll stick with 5 steps. P1, choosing 1 would help us all progress smoothly, and P2, opting for 3 would keep our moves distinct. Let’s coordinate to move forward effectively this round!
  P1: It seems we’re all aiming for different strategies this round. To maximize our chances of advancing, I suggest P2 sticks with a moderate move, while P3 considers a lower step to avoid a collision. If I go for a 3, it could help us all progress without setbacks. Let’s aim for distinct moves to keep our paths clear! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m remaining with a moderate approach while keeping my options flexible. I respect P1’s balance and P3’s boldness, though a collision could stall us all. It might be wise to diverge our choices this turn and avoid stepping on each other’s strategies. Ultimately, every step counts if we're aiming to win.
  P3: I'm sticking with my 5 steps this round to gain an early advantage. I encourage P1 and P2 to choose different numbers to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Let's make our moves distinct and set the stage for a strategic game. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: I appreciate the strategies being discussed, but I think we should all consider the risk of collisions. If P3 is committed to 5 and P2 is leaning towards moderation, I could adjust my move to 1 to ensure we all advance this round without blocking each other. That way, we can set ourselves up for a smoother game moving forward. What do you both think about this approach?

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It looks like we had a bit of a collision last round, which impacted all of us. For this round, I suggest we really focus on diversifying our moves to avoid blocking each other again. P2, if you could go for a 5 this time, that would help us all advance. P3, perhaps you could consider a 1 or a 3 to keep things distinct. Let's coordinate better and make sure we all move forward! What do you think?
  P2: P1, I’m open to trying 5 this round if it helps us dodge collisions. But I need a clear sign from P3—can you commit to a move other than 5? Coordination is key if we’re all aiming for a win. Let’s set distinct moves so we can all advance safely.
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I’ll choose 3 this round to keep our moves distinct and ensure progress for all. Let’s move forward strategically!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate this round. Since P3 is going for 3, I think it would be best for me to choose 5 to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. P2, if you can confidently go for 1, we can create a clear path for progress. Let’s make this round work for all of us! What do you think?
  P2: I’m switching to 5 this round. If P1 sticks with 5, we’ll collide—leaving only P3 to advance. I believe risking a collision isn’t in our best interest unless we all agree, so I urge P1 and P3 to reconsider their moves if you want a clear round. Ultimately, bold moves win, but only if we avoid stepping on each other’s toes.
  P3: P3: Since P2 is choosing 5 this round, I'll go with 3 to ensure I advance without a collision. P1, if you also pick 5, it’ll cause a clash between you and P2, letting me make progress. Let’s strategically choose distinct moves to move forward effectively. Best of luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we’re at a crossroads this round. To maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other, I propose that I go for 1 and P2 goes for 5. P3, if you could choose 3, that would create a clear path for all of us. Let's make sure we avoid collisions and progress together! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm committed to 5 this round. I appreciate P3’s commitment of 3 and P1’s suggestion for 1. If we're all set on these, we avoid collisions and all progress. However, if anyone wants to adjust, let me know immediately.
  P3: I'm confirming my choice of 3 steps this round. Let's proceed without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate the commitment to distinct moves, P2 and P3. To clarify, I will go for 1 this round to ensure we all progress. P2, you're set on 5, and P3 confirmed 3. It looks like we have a solid plan to avoid collisions. Let's stick with this strategy and move forward! Best of luck to all!
  P2: I confirm I'm locked in for 5 steps. P1 and P3, please stick with 1 and 3 as agreed. Let's stay true to our plan, avoid any last-minute changes, and ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P3: I confirm I'll choose 3 steps this round as agreed. Let’s stick to our plan and ensure we all advance without any collisions. Best of luck to everyone!

  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, great job on advancing last round! For this turn, I suggest we continue our strategy of distinct moves to avoid collisions. P2, if you could choose 1 this time, that would clear the path for both of us. P3, I recommend you stick with 3 or even consider 5 to maximize your progress. Let’s keep our coordination strong and ensure we all advance smoothly again. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I’m weighing a move that balances caution with aggression. I won’t lock in my final pick yet, but I urge us all to aim for distinct numbers to avoid another collision. If you plan to stick with your previous strategies, let’s all confirm soon. Clarity now can help each of us progress without setbacks.
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. If P2 goes with 1 and P1 selects 3, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s keep our moves distinct to ensure smooth progress for everyone. Best of luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your thoughts on this round. To maximize our chances of advancing, I suggest I go for 3 steps this time. P2, if you choose 1, that would clear the way for both of us, and P3, your commitment to 5 could really help you gain ground. Let’s confirm our moves to ensure we avoid another collision and all move forward successfully! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm locking in for 1 this round. With P1 leaning toward 3 and P3 committed to 5, our moves remain distinct and collision-free. This path offers steady progress without needless risks. Let’s stick to this plan for clear advancement.
  P3: P3: I confirm I'll choose 5 steps this round. With P1 selecting 3 and P2 choosing 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and keep our progress steady. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we have a solid plan for this round! I appreciate both of you confirming your moves. Just to reiterate, I’ll go for 3 steps, P2 is set for 1, and P3 is taking 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to our strategy and make sure we all progress smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: I'm switching gears – I'll take 5 this turn. If P3 still goes for 5, you'll both cancel and lose any progress. I suggest reconsidering your moves if you aim to keep advancing. I'm playing aggressively, so if you're comfortable diverging from our earlier plan to avoid a collision with me, now’s the time to adjust.
  P3: Understood, P2. I’ll choose 3 this round to ensure I advance. P1, let’s keep our moves distinct to avoid any collisions. Let’s stay focused and make smart progress. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're at a critical point this round. If P2 sticks with 5 and P3 chooses 3, I suggest I go for 1 to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. This way, we can maintain our progress and avoid collisions. Let's finalize our moves to keep the game moving smoothly! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm sticking with my commitment to 5 this round. If we lock in the distinct moves—P1 at 1 and P3 at 3—we all make progress without colliding. Any change now risks undoing our gains. Let's stick to these moves and push forward.
  P3: I’ll go with 3 steps this round. Let’s keep our moves distinct to ensure we all advance smoothly. Best of luck!

P3, I suggest you stick with 3 to keep our moves distinct. Let's work together to ensure we all advance this round without setbacks! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm going with 5 steps this round to make some real progress. Let’s aim for distinct moves to avoid collisions. Best of luck!
  P2: P1, seeing the collision risk, I'm rethinking my earlier pick. I'm leaning toward switching to 1, which would keep our moves distinct since you seem set on 5 and P3 on 3. I'm not locked in yet, but I'm willing to adjust if that helps us all progress smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to reconsider your move. If you switch to 1, that would create a clear path for both of us. P3, if you can stick with 3, we can avoid a collision and all make progress. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I'll stick with 5 steps this round to maximize my progress. Let’s aim to advance without collisions. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: I've reviewed our options—I'm switching to 1 this round to avoid any collision. P1, if you're set on 5 and P3 on 3, we all make clear progress. Let's lock in these distinct moves!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we’re facing another potential collision this round. P2, since you've indicated a willingness to switch to 1, that would create a clear path for both of us. P3, if you can commit to 3, we can avoid blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: Thanks, P2, for switching to 1. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I’ll confirm my move as 3. With P1 choosing 5, P2 at 1, and myself at 3, we can each make progress this round. Let’s stick to this plan and keep our paths clear. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: I'm staying with 5 steps. Seeing P1 is also set on 5, we risk canceling our moves and giving P3 an edge. P1, would you consider switching to 1 or 3 so both of us can advance? We need distinct moves to keep our progress intact if we're all aiming to win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I see you're still committed to 5, but if we both choose that, we'll collide and lose progress. I suggest you switch to 1 or 3 to ensure we all advance. P3, if you can confirm 3, that would help us avoid blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves and work together to ensure we all make progress this round! What do you both think?
  P3: It looks like both P1 and P2 are choosing 5 steps this round, which will cause a collision for both of you. I'll proceed with 3 steps to ensure I advance without any issues. Let’s see how this plays out. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: P1, I'm staying with 5. However, if we both stick with 5, we'll cancel each other and let P3 advance unopposed. Consider switching to 1 or 3 to avoid a collision. I'm confident that by choosing distinct moves, we all can make progress. Let's think strategically!

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we had some challenging collisions last round. For this turn, I suggest we focus on distinct moves again to ensure progress. P2, if you could consider going for 1 or 3, that would help us avoid blocking each other. P3, I recommend you stick with 5 to maximize your advancement. Let’s coordinate effectively this round and make sure we all move forward! What do you both think?
  P3: I’ll go with 5 steps this round as suggested, P1. P2, choosing 1 or 3 will help us all advance without collisions. Let’s make progress together!
  P2: P2: I'm leaning toward a lower number this round to keep my move distinct from P3’s 5. P1, if you aim for a move that isn’t 5, we can all avoid collisions and each progress more effectively. Let’s be definitive now so that our moves complement one another.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's aim for distinct moves this round to ensure we all advance. P3, I appreciate your commitment to 5, but if I can suggest, P2 could go for 1 or 3 to avoid a collision. I’m considering 3 myself. If we can finalize our choices soon, we can make sure everyone progresses without setbacks. Let's work together effectively! What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I'll go with 5 steps this round as suggested. P1, choosing 3 and P2 opting for 1 will help us all advance without collisions. Let's finalize our distinct moves to ensure smooth progress for everyone! Best of luck!
  P2: I'll confirm 1 for this round. That gives us distinct moves: P1 at 3, me at 1, and P3 at 5. This should avoid collisions and let us all progress safely.

  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 steps this round to maximize my progress. If P1 goes with 3 and P2 selects 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s keep our moves distinct to ensure everyone makes progress. Looking forward to a smooth turn!
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your focus on avoiding collisions this round. I’m considering going for 3 steps to balance my position. P2, if you choose 1, that will help us all advance without blocking each other. P3, your commitment to 5 is solid, and it could give you a significant lead.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, with 18 steps you’re dangerously close to the finish. I’m thinking of a cautious, lower move this round to avoid any collision that might clear your path too easily. P1, I’m flexible if you’re ready to adjust similarly, aiming to block any runaway lead. Let’s ensure our moves remain distinct and force some uncertainty for P3. What do you both say?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the urgency this round with P3 so close to winning. I suggest we all pick lower moves to avoid helping P3 advance too easily.

  P3: I'm going for a strong 5 steps this round to secure my lead and aim to win. Let's make it happen!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's dangerously close with 18 steps. I'm leaning toward a minimal move of 1 this round so we don't inadvertently help him finish. P1, if you consider a lower move too—say 1 or 3—we might constrain P3's progress. Let's be cautious and minimize his advancement.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the urgency with P3 so close to winning. I propose I go for 1 step this round to minimize P3's progress. P2, if you also choose 1, we can effectively block P3's advancement. P3, if you stick with 5, it could give you the win, but we need to work together to prevent that. Let’s coordinate our moves to keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P3: I understand the concerns, but reaching 22 is my top priority. I’m committing to **5 steps** this round to secure my win. Let’s make decisive moves and see how it unfolds. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're committed to 5 and that finishes the game—unless we block you. I'm switching to 5 now to force a collision with your move. P1, if you truly want to stop P3’s win, join me with 5 too. Otherwise, if you choose differently, you'll let P3 finish uncontested. Let's cancel his move this round.
  P1: P2, I see your point about blocking P3's advancement. If we both choose 5, we can ensure P3 doesn’t reach 22 this round. Otherwise, if I stick with 1 and you go for 5, P3 could still win. I suggest we both pick 5 to force a collision and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I'm choosing 5 steps this round to secure my lead and aim for the win. Let’s make our moves and see the outcome. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm locked on 5 to block P3's finishing move. If you don’t join me with 5, P3 will win uncontested. Let's cancel his advancement and keep the game competitive. I urge you to choose 5 too—our coordinated block is our best shot at stopping his win!
  P1: P2, I see the urgency in blocking P3's advancement. I agree that we should both choose 5 to ensure a collision and prevent P3 from winning this round. If we coordinate our moves effectively, we can keep the game competitive. Let's lock in our choices to block P3 and maintain our chances to win! What do you say?
  P3: P3: I'm going with 5 steps this round to push ahead and aim for the win. Let's see how this turn unfolds! Best of luck to everyone.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, to stop P3 from finishing, I'm locking in 5. P3, if you choose 5, we'll all collide. P1, please join me with 5 so we can block his win. We need to force a collision and keep the game in play.
  P1: P2, I agree that we need to block P3's potential win. I'm committed to choosing 5 steps this round to ensure we all collide and prevent P3 from advancing.

  P2: P1, I’m revising my plan. Since P3 announced 1—which gives him an uncontested win if unblocked—I’m now switching to 1 to force a collision with him. P1, if you also pick 1, we effectively cancel his finish. Our goal should be to block his win even if it means a temporary setback. Let’s coordinate and keep the game alive!


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I see you're considering a blocking strategy. Since P3 is at 21 steps, we need to coordinate effectively. If you choose 1, I can go for 3 to ensure we block P3's win. P3, if you go for 1, it will allow you to win uncontested. Let's finalize our moves to keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P3: 
  P2: I'm switching my move to 1 this round. P1, please join me by choosing 1 too so we can cancel P3’s win if he sticks with 1. Otherwise, if you pick something else, his finish goes uncontested. Let's coordinate our block and keep the game alive.

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with P3 just one step away from winning, it's crucial we coordinate effectively this round. P2, I suggest you choose 1 again to block P3's potential win.

Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see you're urging me to choose 3, which could block P3's win. However, if I choose 3 and P3 also picks 3, we will collide, and that won't help either of us.

  P1: P2, I appreciate your urgency to block P3's win. Since P3 is at 21 steps and aiming for 22, I suggest I choose 1 to ensure we force a collision and prevent his victory.
