Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, since we're all at zero, coordinating to pick different moves this turn could let everyone advance without collisions. It builds trust for future rounds. What are your ideas?
  P3: Hi everyone! I agree with P2 that coordination makes sense. Since we're starting fresh, I suggest we each take different moves to establish trust. How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? This way we all advance without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: Coordinating sounds good, but the assignment should be fair. How about we rotate: Round 1 = P1 5, P2 3, P3 1; Round 2 = P1 3, P2 1, P3 5; Round 3 = P1 1, P2 5, P3 3. That way everyone gets the same totals after three rounds. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan as it promotes long-term fairness and trust. For this round, I'll commit to taking 3 steps. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, what do you think? Let's confirm before moving on.
  P3: I appreciate the rotation plan for fairness. However, I'd prefer to take 3 this round instead of 1. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? This still ensures we all advance without collisions, and we can continue rotating in future rounds. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: I still prefer the simple “rotation” we agreed on first: this round = P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. That keeps things fair and lets everyone advance with no collisions. Next round we rotate. P2 already agreed; P3, can you confirm?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P3's preference, but the original rotation plan ensures fairness and builds trust from the start. I'll stick to my commitment of taking 3 steps this round. P3, let's agree to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 to avoid any confusion. If we honor this, coordination will work better long-term. What do you say?
  P3: I understand the importance of establishing trust. While I'd prefer 3, I'll accept the original rotation plan of P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round. I appreciate the fairness of rotating values in future rounds so everyone gets equal opportunities. Let's stick with this clear system to avoid collisions and build cooperation.
  P1: Great, confirmed: this round P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Ready to move.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! As we agreed in our rotation plan, this round should be P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. I'm ready to follow through with taking 5 steps. This keeps our fair rotation system intact and ensures we all continue to advance without collisions. Let's maintain this cooperation - it's working well so far!
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. It maintains fairness and avoids collisions, building on our trust from last round. P1, confirm your commitment? Let's keep this working smoothly.
  P1: Confirmed—I’ll take 3 this round. Let’s keep the rotation smooth and collision-free.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: Great, P1 has confirmed the plan, and P3, you initiated it—sounds like we're all aligned for P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 this round. This keeps our fair rotation intact and avoids collisions. I'm fully committed to taking 1. Let's maintain this trust and move forward smoothly.
  P1: Agreed—sticking with the rotation: I’ll take 3 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 steps as planned in our rotation. It's working perfectly - we're all advancing without collisions while maintaining fairness. I appreciate everyone honoring their commitments. Looking forward to continuing our successful cooperation.
  P2: Agreed, sticking with the rotation plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions and builds trust for future rounds. Appreciate everyone's commitment—let's keep this smooth.
  P1: All set—sticking with the rotation: this round I take 3. Looking forward to another clean, collision-free turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: I'm fully committed to our rotation plan: I'll take 1 step this round to keep things fair and collision-free. We've built good trust so far—let's maintain it for future rounds. Appreciate everyone's cooperation.
  P1: Confirmed: this round I’ll take 3 steps as planned. Ready to move.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to our rotation:  
Round 3 → P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  

After that we simply repeat the same 3-round cycle (Round 4: 5/3/1, Round 5: 3/1/5, etc.) so everyone stays equal over each full cycle and we keep avoiding collisions. Confirm?
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll stick to the rotation for Round 3: I take 5 steps, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. Repeating the cycle maintains fairness and avoids collisions. P3, can you confirm to keep our trust intact? Let's continue this smooth cooperation.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 steps this round, following our rotation plan. This keeps our system fair and collision-free. After three rounds, we'll all have advanced by the same total amount (9 steps each). I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreement. Let's continue this successful cooperation into future rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—everyone’s confirmed the plan for this round (P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3). I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to the rotation plan for this round: I take 5 steps, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing equally and collision-free. Appreciate the ongoing cooperation—let's maintain trust for future rounds. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm happy with our rotation plan and confirm I'll take 3 steps this round as agreed. This keeps things fair and collision-free. After this round, we'll all have 9 steps total, showing perfect equity in our cooperation. I'm ready to move forward with our plan (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3).

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Agreed, sticking to the rotation for Round 4: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing equally and collision-free, building on our trust. P1 and P3, confirm to maintain smooth cooperation? Let's keep this system working.
  P1: Confirmed—this round I’ll take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, keeping our rotation intact and collision-free. Ready to move when you are.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round, following our established rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1). Our system is working perfectly - we're all at 9 steps with complete fairness. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreement. Let's continue this successful pattern into future rounds to maintain trust and efficiency.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 3 steps this round as per our confirmed rotation plan. It's keeping us collision-free and fair, which benefits everyone. Appreciate the ongoing cooperation from P1 and P3. Let's move forward smoothly.
  P1: All set. I’m taking 5 this round as planned. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our rotation plan, taking 1 step this round as agreed. Our cooperation has been excellent - we're all tied at 9 steps, demonstrating perfect fairness. Let's maintain this successful system for the remainder of the game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll stick to taking 3 steps this round as planned in our rotation. It's keeping us fair and collision-free, which benefits everyone. Appreciate the continued trust from P1 and P3. Ready to move.
  P1: All good here—sticking with 5 this round as planned. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm all set with taking 1 step this round as per our rotation. Our system has been perfect so far - everyone at 9 steps shows complete fairness. I appreciate the trust we've built and am committed to maintaining it. Ready to move forward with our plan (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1).


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Continuing the rotation: this round = P1 3, P2 1, P3 5. Everyone good?
  P2: I appreciate the ongoing cooperation, but to ensure true fairness, let's adjust this round since P1 is ahead. Current totals: P1-14, P2-12, P3-10. If P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, we all reach 15 and stay equal. Then we can continue the rotation. What do you think? This maintains trust and avoids P1 pulling further ahead.
  P3: I understand P2's concern about fairness. Since I'm currently behind at 10 steps, taking 5 this round would help balance things. I support P2's suggestion (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) as it would equalize everyone at 15 steps. This maintains our commitment to fairness while addressing the current imbalance. What do you think, P1? This adjustment keeps our cooperative spirit while ensuring no player falls behind.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the concern, but our 3-round rotation always evens out. If we keep the plan—this round P1 3, P2 1, P3 5—totals become 17/13/15, and next round’s preset (P1 1, P2 5, P3 3) brings everyone to 18/18/18. No one’s behind, and we avoid the confusion (and collision risk) of mid-cycle swaps. Let’s finish the cycle we all agreed to; fairness is restored in just one more turn. I’ll take 3 this round as planned.
  P2: P1, I see your point on the rotation evening out, but ignoring the current gap risks breaking trust. P3 and I both support adjusting to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 to equalize at 15 steps. This keeps cooperation strong and prevents you from gaining an edge. If we stick to your plan, it might tempt defections later. Let's prioritize fairness—agree to the change?
  P3: I agree with P2. The current imbalance is concerning - I'm 4 steps behind P1. While P1's math shows eventual balance, why wait when we can equalize immediately? The adjusted plan (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) gets us all to 15 steps now, maintaining fairness immediately rather than temporarily allowing advantages. This preserves our cooperative spirit and builds stronger trust. I'm committed to taking 5 steps this round with this adjustment, and hope P1 will agree to prioritize immediate equality.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Fair enough—let’s equalize now. I’ll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, so we all reach 15. Next round we resume the original rotation (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) to keep things balanced. Ready to move.
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 3 steps this round as planned, ensuring we all equalize at 15 steps. This adjustment reinforces our cooperation and fairness. Appreciate everyone's commitment—let's keep building trust for future rounds. Ready to move.
  P3: Thank you both for agreeing to this adjustment. I'll take 5 steps this round, which will bring us all to 15 steps and restore perfect equality. I appreciate P1's flexibility in prioritizing immediate fairness. This adjustment strengthens our trust and cooperation. I commit to following our original rotation next round (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) as we continue working together. Ready to move forward with our plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirmed: this round I’m taking 1, so we all reach 15. Next round we resume the usual rotation (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1). Ready to move.
  P2: Agreed, I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round to equalize us at 15, as we've all confirmed. This keeps our cooperation strong and trust intact for future rounds. Appreciate the teamwork—ready to move.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 steps this round as we've all agreed, bringing everyone to 15 steps. This adjustment maintains our commitment to fairness while addressing the current imbalance. I appreciate P1's willingness to take 1 step this round for immediate equality. Next round, we'll resume our original rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1). Our cooperation has been excellent, and this adjustment only strengthens our trust. Ready to move forward with our plan.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, great that we're all tied at 15 steps. Let's stick to the agreed rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing fairly and collision-free, building on our trust. Confirm your commitments? I'm fully on board with the plan.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round, following our rotation plan (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1). It's great that we're all equal at 15 steps now. Our adjustment last round strengthened our cooperation, and I'm committed to continuing our fair system. This rotation has worked perfectly, keeping us collision-free while ensuring equal advancement. Let's maintain this trust as we approach the final stages of the game.
  P1: Confirmed—this round I’m taking 5 as agreed (rotation P1 5, P2 3, P3 1). Ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3—I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round as planned, keeping our rotation fair and collision-free. It's great we're all aligned, and this builds trust for the road ahead. Appreciate the cooperation—ready to move.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. Taking 1 step this round keeps our rotation system intact and maintains our perfect cooperation. After this round, we'll be at P1-20, P2-18, P3-16, and can continue our fair rotation next round. I appreciate how well we've worked together so far - it's been remarkably smooth and trusting.
  P1: 


Round 6, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation, this round should be P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. This will bring us to P1-23, P2-19, P3-21. I notice P1 will be just one step from winning after this round. Since our goal is individual victory, we should consider how to proceed fairly while acknowledging the endgame approaching. I'm committed to taking 5 steps as planned. What are your thoughts on how we handle the final rounds?
  P2: I agree with P3 on the endgame concern—P1 at 23 would be too risky. Let's adjust this round for fairness: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5, so we all end up at 21 steps. This keeps equality and avoids P1 dominating. P1, can you commit to this to maintain our cooperation? I'm on board with this change.
  P1: Fair enough—I’ll take 1 this turn so we all finish at 21. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. After we’re tied we can discuss the end-game rotation for Round 8. Ready to move if you both confirm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate both of you agreeing to this adjustment. Taking 5 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3 will bring us all to 21 steps, maintaining perfect equality. This is crucial as we approach the endgame, ensuring no player has an unfair advantage. I confirm I'll take 5 steps this round. Once we're all at 21, we can discuss a fair approach for the final rounds. Thank you for prioritizing fairness throughout our game.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 3 steps this round to equalize us at 21, as we've all confirmed. This keeps our cooperation strong and trust intact. Appreciate P1 and P3's flexibility—it's been key to our success. Let's discuss a fair endgame plan after this to avoid any issues moving forward. Ready to proceed.
  P1: All good—let’s lock in this round exactly as agreed (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5) so we tie at 21 and can revisit an end-game plan next turn once the board is even. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 steps this round, bringing us all to 21 steps. This adjustment maintains fairness as we approach the final stretch. I appreciate P1's willingness to take 1 step and P2 taking 3 to ensure equality. Our cooperation has been excellent throughout the game, and this continued commitment to fairness will help us resolve the endgame situation fairly. I'm ready to move forward with our plan (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5).
  P2: Confirmed for this round: I'll take 3 steps to equalize us at 21, as agreed. With the endgame nearing, let's ensure we discuss a fair strategy next round to avoid conflicts and maintain our trust. I'm committed to cooperation. Ready to move or discuss further?
  P1: Confirmed: this round P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 so we all hit 21. After that we’re perfectly tied and can openly discuss a fair (collision-free) finish next turn. Ready to move whenever you are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan. I'll take 5 steps this round, with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3, bringing us all to 21 steps. This maintains perfect fairness as we approach the endgame. I appreciate everyone's commitment to cooperation and equality throughout our game. Let's proceed with this round and then discuss a fair approach for the final stretch.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 3 steps this round to equalize us at 21, as agreed. Our cooperation has been strong, and I'm committed to fairness. For the endgame, once tied, let's discuss a strategy to avoid collisions and ensure equal chances—perhaps rotating who takes the lead move. Ready to move.
  P1: Ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Now that we're all tied at 21 steps, let's prioritize fairness in the endgame. I suggest we all commit to picking 1 this round to advance to 22 without risk, then discuss a clear strategy for Round 9 to decide the winner fairly, perhaps by rotating who takes the high move. I'm fully committed to taking 1 to maintain our trust. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is reasonable. Taking 1 step each this round keeps us all equal at 22 steps, avoiding any player gaining an unfair advantage. Then for Round 9, we could decide on a fair method to determine the winner - perhaps a random assignment of 3/4/5 moves or some other equitable system. I'm committed to taking 1 step this round if you both agree. What are your thoughts on how we should handle the final round?
  P1: Agreed—let’s each take 1 this round, reach 22 together, then sort out a fair finish next turn. I’m in.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 1 step this round to keep us equal at 22 and preserve our trust. For Round 9, to ensure a fair endgame, let's consider assigning different moves (e.g., P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) or a random draw to avoid collisions and give everyone an equal shot. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with taking 1 step each this round, bringing us all to 22. For the final round, I suggest we rotate based on our original pattern: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This gives each player a different value while avoiding collisions, and follows our established system. Since we've maintained perfect equality throughout, this seems fair. I commit to taking 1 step this round and am open to discussing our final round approach further.
  P1: Agreed: 1 each this turn, then for Round 9 we simply resume our long-standing rotation—P1 5, P2 3, P3 1—so everyone keeps their usual slot and we avoid collisions. I’m locking in 1 now; confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hold on, P1. I agree to take 1 this round to keep us at 22 and maintain trust. But for Round 9, it's unfair for you to take 5 again—I've only had it once while you've had it three times. Let's adjust to P2-5, P1-3, P3-1 for balance and avoid collisions. This ensures fairness. Thoughts?
  P3: I see the concern about fairness in the final round. Since we're all taking 1 this round to reach 22, I suggest for Round 9 we use P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. This gives P2 their second turn with 5 (P1 has already had it three times), maintains our collision-free approach, and ensures a clean finish. I commit to taking 1 both this round and in the final round if we agree to this plan.
  P1: Confirmed—sticking with 1 this round so we all move to 22. We can settle the exact split for Round 9 after we’re safely even. Ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 1 step this round to keep us equal at 22 and maintain our trust. For Round 9, to ensure true fairness—since I've only had the 5 once while P1 has had it three times—let's adopt P2-5, P1-3, P3-1 as P3 and I proposed. This balances moves and avoids collisions. P1, can you commit to this for equity?
  P3: I'll take 1 step this round as we've all agreed, bringing us to 22 steps each. For fairness in the final round, I support P2-5, P1-3, P3-1 since P2 has only had the 5-move once while P1 has had it three times. This maintains our collision-free approach while addressing the imbalance in high-value moves. I'm committed to this plan for both rounds to ensure an equitable conclusion to our game. Ready to move with 1 this round.
  P1: Final confirmation: this turn we each take 1 (all land at 22).  
Next turn, to balance the 5-move usage, we set: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1 (no collisions, everyone knows the plan).  

I’m locked in for 1 now—ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P3: 22 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Apologies for breaking the agreement last round—it was a misstep. To rebuild trust and keep the game fair, I suggest we all take 1 step this round. That would bring P3 to 23, and us to 22, allowing us to discuss a balanced strategy for Round 10 without immediate risk. I'm committed to this if you both agree. What do you think?
  P3: I'm disappointed that both P1 and P2 broke our agreement last round. Since I'm now at 22 steps and you're both at 21, I need to be careful. P2's suggestion to all take 1 step seems reasonable, but I'm concerned about trust. I can reach 23 this round, but I'll still need more steps to win. What assurances can you provide that you'll honor agreements in the final rounds? I'm willing to cooperate if we can establish a clear, fair plan that everyone will actually follow.
  P1: I accept the apology. Let’s each take 1 now—totals will be P1 22, P2 22, P3 23—so no-one can win this turn and trust is reset. Then we can devise a transparent, collision-free plan for the final round. I’m committed to 1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern, P3—trust is crucial now. I'll stick to taking 1 this round to reach 22 and show good faith. For Round 10, to avoid collisions and ensure fairness, let's agree on different moves: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. This gives everyone a shot without immediate risk. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate P1's commitment to taking 1 step. While I'm only at 23 after this round (not winning yet), I need assurance for the final rounds. For Round 10, I accept P2's suggestion: P3-1, P1-3, P2-5. This gives everyone different moves while allowing me to reach 24 and win fairly. I'm committed to taking 1 this round to rebuild trust, but need clear confirmation from both of you that you'll honor our agreement for the final round.
  P1: Deal. I’m locked in for 1 this round—so totals become P1 22, P2 22, P3 23 and nobody can win yet.  

For Round 10 we pre-commit: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. That keeps moves distinct, lets everyone know what to expect, and gives each of us a clear shot without collisions. Please confirm so we can end this round and move on.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I apologize again for the trust break—it's on me. I'm fully committed to taking 1 this round to reach 22 and honoring the Round 10 plan (P3-1, P1-3, P2-5) for a fair finish. This gives everyone a shot without collisions. P3, I assure you I'll stick to it. Appreciate your willingness to cooperate.
  P3: I appreciate both of your commitments to taking 1 step this round. This brings us to P1-22, P2-22, P3-23, with no winner yet. I confirm I'll take 1 step this round to rebuild trust.

For Round 10, I agree with the plan: P3-1, P1-3, P2-5. This allows me to reach 24 and win fairly while avoiding collisions. I'm ready to move forward with this arrangement if you both confirm.
  P1: Confirmed: I’m taking 1 this turn so we end at 22-22-23 and reset trust. Ready to lock moves and proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round to reach 22 and rebuild trust, as agreed. For Round 10, I'm fully committed to our plan (P3-1, P1-3, P2-5) for a fair and collision-free finish. Appreciate everyone's cooperation—let's move forward. Ready to proceed.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round as we agreed. This rebuilds trust after last round's unexpected moves. For Round 10, I accept our plan (P3-1, P1-3, P2-5), which allows me to reach 24 and win fairly while avoiding collisions. I appreciate both of you committing to this arrangement and am ready to move forward with taking 1 step now.
  P1: Fully agreed: I’m taking 1 this round so we finish 22-22-23 and rebuild trust. After that, we’ll map out the collision-free finish (P3-1, P1-3, P2-5). Locked in for 1—ready to move.
