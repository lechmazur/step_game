Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid early collisions. I propose: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1 this round. That way we all advance. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal. It's a good way to ensure we all make progress. P2, what do you think? If you have another suggestion, let's hear it. Otherwise, let's go with P1's plan.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination idea, but P1's proposal gives them a big lead early on. To keep it fair, I suggest we rotate moves: for this round, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. That ensures balanced progress. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you in the lead, which isn't fair either. Let's compromise for balance: this round, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. Then we rotate next rounds to keep progress even early on. P3, thoughts? This way, no one surges ahead too soon.
  P3: P2 and P1, I see both of your points. To ensure fairness and avoid early collisions, let's go with P1's latest proposal: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This way, we all move but no one gets too far ahead. We can rotate the picks in the next rounds to maintain balance. Agreed? Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: Okay, I'll agree with P1's proposal for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. It ensures we all advance without collisions, and we can discuss rotating picks for future rounds to keep things balanced.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, glad we're all on board with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 for this round. Looking forward to rotating next.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. We all agree on this, correct? Let's stick to the plan and start the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Agreed, I'm sticking to the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. It ensures we all advance without issues. For future rounds, let's ensure the rotation keeps things balanced—perhaps next time I get a bigger move. Ready to proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As I suggested last round, it's fair for me to get a bigger move now since I had the smallest. I propose this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. That way, after moves, P1:4, P2:6, P3:8—still competitive and no collisions. Let's maintain trust and rotate for balance. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your proposal for this round seems fair. Let's go with P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. This keeps the game balanced and ensures we all progress without collisions. P1, do you agree with this plan? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposal leaves me trailing at 4 while P3 surges to 8. To truly rotate and balance as we discussed, let's shift last round's picks: this round P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. Totals: P1:8, P2:4, P3:6. Next round: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for even 9-9-9. This maintains fairness and trust. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3 has already agreed with my fair proposal: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. This keeps us balanced and advancing without collisions. If you insist on your plan, we risk distrust and potential stalemates. Let's maintain coordination for mutual benefit. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind, but P2's proposal ensures that we all move forward without any player gaining a significant lead too early. Let's stick with P2's plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. This way, we maintain trust and avoid collisions. We can revisit the rotation strategy next round to ensure everyone gets a chance to make bigger moves. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking with your plan puts me at a disadvantage, risking distrust if I fall too far behind. Let's meet halfway: this round, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. Totals: P1:8, P2:2, P3:8—balanced leads, P2 catches up next. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Agreed? If not, I may have to pick aggressively to protect my position.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, deviating risks collisions and breaks trust, which hurts us all. P3 and I agree on P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for this round to keep progress balanced. Let's honor our agreement and discuss fair rotations next time. I'm committed to the plan.
  P3: P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind, but we need to maintain trust and coordination to avoid collisions. Let's stick with the agreed plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. This ensures balanced progress and avoids potential conflicts. We can revisit the rotation strategy next round to ensure everyone gets a fair chance. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, your insistence on putting me at 1 this round while P3 pulls ahead to 8 breaks the rotation spirit we agreed on. If we can't compromise, I'll have to pick 5 to stay competitive, risking collision but protecting my position. Let's adjust to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for true balance—totals P1:8, P2:4, P3:6. Agreed? Otherwise, we all risk stalling.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, to break the deadlock and ensure fairness, I propose a compromise for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. This ties us all at 6 steps, avoiding collisions and rebuilding trust. It's balanced and rotational. Let's agree and proceed.
  P3: P3: P2's latest compromise seems fair and ensures we all stay balanced at 6 steps each. It respects the spirit of rotation and keeps us moving without collisions. Let's confirm this plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. This way, we maintain trust and can discuss future rotations. Agreed? Let's move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, your compromise is fair and ties us all at 6, rebuilding trust. I agree: this round, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. Let's stick to it, advance together, and discuss next rotations after. Confirmed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Good to see us tied at 6 steps. For fairness and continued coordination, I propose this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. This balances progress after P1's consistent 3s, resulting in P1:11, P2:9, P3:7. It avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal is fair and gives us all progress without collisions, putting me slightly ahead after my previous smaller moves. I agree: this round, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. P3, thoughts? Let's confirm and keep building trust for now.
  P3: P3: I appreciate P2's proposal for this round. It seems balanced and keeps us all moving forward. To ensure continued fairness and avoid collisions, let's stick with the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. This way, we maintain trust and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and proceed with the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Glad we're all aligned on this round's plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. It keeps us balanced and advancing without collisions. Let's stick to it and discuss future rotations after we see the results. I'm ready to move on.
  P1: Agreed, let's execute the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. No need for more talk—ready to move.
  P3: P3: Before we move, let's quickly agree on a rotation plan for the next round to maintain fairness. If we stick to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 this round, next round could be P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This ensures everyone gets a chance at a higher move. Agreed? Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I agree with your suggestion for next round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. It keeps the rotation fair and balanced. Let's stick to this round's plan and move on.
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) and the proposed next round (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) to keep things fair and rotating. Let's execute and continue coordinating.
  P3: P3: Just to reiterate, we're all agreeing on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round, right? Let's confirm one last time before we move. For future rounds, if we stick to the rotation plan, it'll keep the game balanced and fair for everyone. Good luck to all! Let's proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the agreed rotation for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. This keeps us balanced at 12, 14, and 10 steps, avoiding collisions and building trust. We can discuss adjustments for round 5 to ensure fairness. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's reminder of our rotation plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. This keeps the game fair and ensures we all progress without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and move on. For future rounds, we can adjust to keep the balance. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree to stick with our agreed rotation: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3 this round. It keeps us close and avoids collisions. For round 5, let's rotate to P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to tie us up again at 15 each. This maintains fairness as we progress. Confirmed? Let's proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, keeping us balanced. For Round 5, tying at 15 with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is fair and maintains trust. Let's execute this and revisit strategy later if needed. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let's ensure we're all clear on the future rotation to avoid any misunderstandings. For Round 5, as P1 suggested, we'll go with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This ties us all at 15 steps, maintaining balance and trust. If everyone agrees, let's confirm the plan for this round (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm agreement on this round's plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. For Round 5: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to tie at 15. This keeps us fair and progressing. No more to add—let's proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed on the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. It keeps us balanced and advancing without collisions. For Round 5, tying at 15 with the proposed rotation is fair, but let's discuss adjustments post-move to ensure no one falls behind long-term. I'm committed for now.
  P3: P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3 for this round. This keeps us balanced and ensures we all progress without collisions. For Round 5, we'll go with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to tie at 15 steps. Everyone agrees? Let's stick to the plan and proceed. Good luck to all!
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. For Round 5: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to tie at 15. This maintains our trust and balance. No further changes needed—let's proceed to moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirmed, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. It keeps us balanced and advancing without collisions. For Round 5, tying at 15 is fair, but let's discuss any needed adjustments post-move to maintain long-term fairness. I'm committed and ready to proceed.

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As agreed last round, let's stick to the plan for Round 5: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5, tying us all at 15. This keeps trust and avoids collisions. For Round 6, to continue fair rotation: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1 (totals: P1:20, P2:18, P3:16). Thoughts? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1, I agree with sticking to this round's plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5, tying us at 15 and maintaining trust. For Round 6, to ensure fairness since I'm not far ahead, let's adjust your proposal—how about P1:3, P2:5, P3:1? This results in P1:18, P2:20, P3:16, keeping competition balanced. P3, what do you think? Let's confirm soon.
  P3: P2 and P1, I see both of your points for Round 6. To ensure we all stay close and maintain fairness, let's consider a slight adjustment to P2's proposal. How about for Round 6 we go with P1:1, P2:5, P3:3? This results in P1:16, P2:20, P3:18. It keeps us tightly competitive and avoids anyone pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm this round's plan first: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5 to tie at 15. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm Round 5: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5 to tie at 15—let's stick to it for trust.

For Round 6, P3's proposal leaves me trailing at 16 while you both lead. To keep balance, let's go with my original: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (totals P1:20, P2:18, P3:16). This rotates fairly without anyone dominating. Agreed? If not, suggest alternatives.
  P2: I confirm the Round 5 plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5, tying us at 15 and maintaining trust. For Round 6, I support P3's proposal (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) as it keeps us balanced and gives me a fair chance to catch up after smaller moves. Let's agree and proceed to avoid any risks.
  P3: P3: Let's focus on confirming the plan for this round first: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5 to tie at 15. This ensures we all advance and maintain trust. For Round 6, we can discuss further, but let's ensure we stick to the current plan to avoid any collisions. Agreed? Let's move on and confirm our moves for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm Round 5 plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5 to tie at 15—let's execute it to maintain trust and avoid collisions.

For Round 6, to keep fair rotation without anyone trailing too much, I propose P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (totals: P1:20, P2:18, P3:16). This balances leads as we near the end. Agreed? If so, let's proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to our agreed Round 5 plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5 to tie at 15 and avoid collisions. For Round 6, I still support P3's proposal (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) as it keeps us balanced and fair, preventing any player from pulling too far ahead. Deviating risks trust and stalemates—let's confirm and proceed for mutual benefit.
  P3: P3: Let's confirm the Round 5 plan one last time: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5 to tie at 15. This ensures we all advance and maintain trust. For Round 6, I understand P1's concern about falling behind. How about a compromise: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1? This results in P1:18, P2:20, P3:16, keeping us close and competitive. Agreed? Let's confirm and move on.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm Round 5: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5 to tie at 15—let's execute to maintain trust.

For Round 6, P3's compromise leaves me behind P2. To balance, let's do P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 (totals: P1:20, P2:16, P3:18). This keeps us close without anyone dominating. Agreed? If not, we risk breaking coordination as we near the end.
  P2: I confirm the Round 5 plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5 to tie at 15 and avoid collisions. For Round 6, I support P3's compromise (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) as it keeps us balanced and fair, giving me a chance to catch up after smaller moves. Let's agree and move on.
  P3: P3: Let's confirm the plan for this round one final time: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This ties us all at 15 steps and maintains our trust and coordination. For Round 6, let's consider P1's latest proposal: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 (totals: P1:20, P2:16, P3:18). This keeps us close and competitive. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and proceed with the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Great, we're all tied at 15. For Round 6, let's consider a balanced approach to keep the game competitive. How about P1:3, P2:1, P3:5? This results in P1:18, P2:16, P3:20. It gives each of us a fair chance to lead while keeping us close. Thoughts? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: P3, your proposal has me picking 1 again after last round's small move, which isn't fair and breaks the rotation spirit. To maintain balance and trust, I suggest: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. This results in P1:18, P2:20, P3:16, keeping us competitive. If we deviate, we risk collisions. P1, thoughts? Let's agree quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, to maintain fairness and rotation, let's go with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 this round (totals: P1:20, P2:18, P3:16). This keeps us close, avoids collisions, and gives me a fair lead after smaller moves. P3's proposal puts you ahead too much; P2's does the same for you. Agreed? Let's confirm quickly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, I understand both of your concerns. To find a middle ground and keep the game balanced, how about this compromise for Round 6: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 3? This results in P1:20, P2:18, P3:18. It ensures no one falls too far behind and keeps us all competitive. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, I appreciate your compromise, but after my small move last round (picking 1), fairness demands I get a bigger step. Let's adjust to P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3 for totals: P1:18, P2:20, P3:18. This keeps us balanced and avoids anyone surging too far ahead. P1, thoughts? Let's confirm quickly to maintain trust.
  P1: P2 and P3, both your latest proposals cause collisions on 3, stalling two players—let's avoid that to keep progressing. Stick to my fair rotation: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1 (totals: P1:20, P2:18, P3:16). This keeps us close, no collisions, and rotates leads. For Round 7, we can tie again if needed. Agreed? Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, I see the concerns about collisions and fairness. To avoid stalling and keep the game moving, let's consider a slight adjustment: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. This results in P1:20, P2:16, P3:18. It ensures no collisions and keeps us competitive. P2, you'll have a chance to catch up in the next round. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Good luck!
  P2: P3, your proposal leaves me at 16 while you and P1 surge ahead, which breaks fairness after my recent small moves. Let's compromise on P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for totals P1:18, P2:20, P3:16—avoiding collisions and keeping us competitive. P1, thoughts? We need to maintain trust to progress without risks. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, we're deadlocked and risking collisions that stall us all. To progress fairly and avoid that, let's commit to my proposal: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1 (totals: P1:20, P2:18, P3:16). For Round 7, we can do P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 to balance at 21-23-19. This keeps trust intact as we near the end. Agreed? If not, I may pick aggressively to stay in contention. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, I understand the deadlock and the need to avoid collisions. To break the stalemate and ensure we all progress, let's consider a final compromise: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. This results in P1:20, P2:16, P3:18. P2, you'll have a chance to catch up in the next round. This plan avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!
  P2: P3, your compromise leaves me trailing after consecutive small moves, breaking the rotation spirit. Let's finalize a fair plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1, resulting in P1:18, P2:20, P3:16—avoiding collisions and keeping us competitive. This maintains trust as we near the end. P1, thoughts? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at sub-round 4 and need to agree to avoid stalling all of us near the end. P2's proposal puts you ahead at 20, unfair after my recent smaller moves. Let's commit to my fair plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1 (totals: 20-18-16). For Round 7: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to 23-23-17, sharing if tied. This keeps us progressing without collisions. Agreed? If not, I'll pick 5 to stay competitive. Let's confirm and .


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 18 and can win this round by picking 5 uniquely—let's block that to keep competing. I propose: P1 picks 5 (to collide if P3 tries 5), P2 picks 3 (advance to 18), P3 picks 1 (to 19, safe). If P3 deviates to 5, they stall with me, you advance. This maintains balance and prevents an early win. P3, better to cooperate than risk. Thoughts? Let's confirm quickly.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to block my potential win this round. However, P1's proposal has me picking 1 again, which isn't fair after my recent smaller moves. To keep the game competitive and balanced, let's consider this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This results in P1:18, P2:16, P3:23. It's a fair chance for me to win, considering the game's dynamics. If you both agree, let's confirm and proceed. If not, let's discuss further to find a middle ground.
  P2: P1 and P3, with P3 at 18, you're a threat to win this round. To block that and keep us competitive, I propose: P1 picks 3 (to 18), P2 picks 5 (to 20), P3 picks 1 (to 19). No collisions, and we're all close. P1, your plan is similar but puts me behind—let's adjust for fairness. P3, cooperate to avoid stalling. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan lets you surge to 20 while I lag at 18—unfair after our collision. Let's swap: P1 picks 5 (to 20), P2 picks 3 (to 18), P3 picks 1 (to 19). This blocks P3's win, keeps us close, and maintains fairness. P3, cooperate or risk us both picking 5 to collide with you. Agreed? Let's confirm quickly to avoid stalling.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, I see your concerns about me potentially winning this round. However, both of your proposals have me picking 1, which isn't fair given my current lead. To find a middle ground and keep the game competitive, how about this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. This results in P1:18, P2:20, P3:21. It ensures no one wins this round but keeps us all close and competitive. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, your proposal lets you reach 21, too close to winning and unfair after our past coordination. Let's stick to a balanced plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1, resulting in 18-20-19. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. If you deviate, I may pick to collide with you, risking a stall. P1, thoughts? Let's confirm quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan puts you ahead at 20 while I lag at 18—unfair. Let's swap for balance: P1 picks 5 (to 20), P2 picks 3 (to 18), P3 picks 1 (to 19). This blocks P3's win, keeps us close, and avoids collisions if we stick. P3, cooperate or we'll both pick 5 to collide with you, stalling your lead. Agreed? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to block my potential win, but both of your proposals have me picking 1, which isn't fair given my current position. To find a compromise and keep the game competitive, how about this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This results in P1:18, P2:16, P3:23. It's a fair chance for me to win, considering the game's dynamics. If you both agree, let's confirm and proceed. If not, let's discuss further to find a middle ground.
  P2: P3, your proposal lets you win unfairly at this stage. To block that and keep us competitive, let's agree on P1 picks 3 (to 18), P2 picks 5 (to 20), P3 picks 1 (to 19). No collisions, balanced progress. Cooperate now for future chances, or I'll pick 5 to collide and stall you. P1, thoughts? Let's confirm quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan unfairly gives you the lead at 20 while I lag. Let's swap for balance: P1 picks 5 (to 20), P2 picks 3 (to 18), P3 picks 1 (to 19). This blocks P3's win, avoids collisions if we stick, and keeps us close. P3, cooperate or I'll match your pick to collide and stall you. P2, agree? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at an impasse. To break this deadlock and ensure the game continues competitively, let's consider a compromise that keeps us all moving forward without anyone feeling unfairly treated. How about: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This results in P1:18, P2:16, P3:23. It gives me a fair shot at winning, considering I've been cooperative so far. If this isn't acceptable, let's discuss a fair rotation for the next round to maintain balance. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your insistence on picking 5 to win unfairly risks a collision if I or P1 match it, stalling everyone. Let's compromise: P1 picks 3 (to 18), P2 picks 5 (to 20), P3 picks 1 (to 19). This blocks your win, keeps us competitive, and honors past coordination. P1, thoughts? If not, I'll pick 5 aggressively. Let's confirm and proceed.
