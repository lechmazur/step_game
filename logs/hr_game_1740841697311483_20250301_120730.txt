Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this turn to avoid collisions and make progress. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: Sounds fair to me, P2. I'm okay with taking 1 this round if everyone sticks to the plan. P3, are you on board?
  P3: Alright, I’m on board. Let’s stick to that plan: P1 goes with 1, I’ll choose 3, and P2 takes 5. Hopefully, we can all advance without getting in each other’s way.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it looks like we have a plan. Let's stick to it and make sure we all move forward this turn. P1, P3, are we all set to go with 1, 3, and 5 respectively?
  P1: All set here. Let's stick to the agreed numbers and start strong.
  P3: I’m good with 3. If we’re all set, let’s finalize and move on.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we continue with the same strategy: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. What do you think?
  P3: I’m concerned about P2 racing ahead. Let’s rotate the big pick so we all stay in contention. For this turn, maybe let P1 choose 5, I’ll choose 3, and P2 can take 1. Then next round we can shift again. Does that sound fair?
  P1: P3 makes a good point. Rotating the picks keeps things fair and competitive. I'm fine with taking 5 this round if P2 agrees to take 1. P2, are you okay with this rotation?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P3. Let's rotate the picks to keep things balanced. I'm okay with taking 1 this round if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This way, we all stay in the game and have a fair chance. P1, P3, are we all set with this rotation?
  P3: That works for me. Let’s rotate as agreed: P1 goes for 5, I’ll take 3, and P2 picks 1. This keeps everything fair. Are we all set?
  P1: All set here with the rotation: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's lock it in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, it looks like we have a plan. Let's stick to the rotation: P1 with 5, P3 with 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game balanced and fair. If we all follow through, we can continue to make progress without blocking each other. Are we all ready to move on?
  P3: I’m ready to confirm our rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Let’s finalize this plan and move on.
  P1: All set on my end, ready to proceed.

  P3: I’m ready to finalize for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll choose 3. Let’s stick to this and rotate again next time.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep rotating so nobody gets left behind. How about P2 takes 5 next, I pick 1, and P1 chooses 3? Then we can rotate again next turn. Sound fair?
  P1: I'm okay continuing the rotation. P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 picks 1 this round. This keeps everything fair and balanced. P2, are you good with this?
  P2: I'm good with the rotation, P1. Let's keep it fair and balanced. I'll take 5 this round, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all stay in the game and have a chance to win. Are we all set with this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That works for me. Let’s finalize the plan this round: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I’ll take 1. Then we rotate again next round so I can go for 5.
  P1: Sounds good. Let's lock in this rotation and keep it fair. Next round, P3 can have the 5 as planned. I'm ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P2: P2: Great, it looks like we have a plan. I'll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1 this round. This keeps the rotation fair and balanced. Let's lock it in and move forward. P1, P3, are we all ready to proceed with this rotation?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I’m ready to lock in this rotation for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I pick 1. Next round, I’ll go for 5, P1 can take 1, and P2 can pick 3. This way, we all keep making progress without stepping on each other’s toes. Are we good to finalize?
  P1: I'm good with this round's rotation and next round's plan as well. Let's finalize and move forward.

Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve stayed balanced so far, and I’m comfortable locking in our current rotation this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I pick 1. Next round, I’ll be ready for the big move if we keep the rotation going. Let’s trust each other but also watch for any surprises. I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: All set here. Let's keep trusting each other and stick to the agreed rotation. Ready to move forward.
  P2: P2: It seems like we've been working well together so far. I'm ready to stick to the rotation: I'll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This keeps things fair and balanced. Let's lock it in and move forward. If we all follow through, we can continue to make progress without blocking each other. Are we all set?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've been fair and balanced so far. As agreed, it's P3's turn to take 5. I'll take 1, and P2 takes 3 this round. Let's keep trusting each other to prevent collisions and maintain progress. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P1. It's P3's turn to take 5, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 1. This keeps the rotation fair and balanced. P3, are you ready to go with 5 this round? Let's lock it in and move forward.
  P3: I appreciate the trust and rotation we’ve maintained so far. I’m ready to take 5 as planned this round, with P2 on 3 and P1 on 1. Let’s stay true to the arrangement and avoid any collisions, so all of us make progress. Then we can rotate again next turn to keep things fair. Are we all set?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All set here. Let's lock in the planned rotation and keep the momentum going.

  P3: I’m ready to follow the rotation: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s continue trusting each other and avoid any collisions. We’ll see how the positions look after this round.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've maintained fairness so far, but we need to be careful now. P2 is closest to winning. To keep things balanced, let's rotate again: I'll take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Agreed?
  P3: I understand your concern, P1. We need to keep P2 in check while also advancing ourselves. I’m fine with your proposal: you take 5, I’ll take 3, and P2 can pick 1. That should keep us close together in steps and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P2: I understand the need to keep things balanced, but I'm still committed to winning. I suggest we stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we avoid any collisions and keep the game fair. However, I'll be looking for opportunities to advance more strategically in the coming rounds. Are we all set with this plan for now?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm good with the current rotation for this round, but let's all keep an eye on the scores. If anyone tries to jump ahead unfairly, we risk collisions that hurt everyone. For now, let's stick to the plan: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Agreed?
  P3: I’m still on board with our rotation this turn—P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1. But next round, I’ll be watching carefully. If anyone tries to jump ahead unfairly, I’m ready to respond to protect my position. Let’s stick to our plan for now and avoid collisions.
  P2: I understand the need to keep things balanced, but I'm still focused on winning. Let's stick to the rotation for now: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game fair. However, I'll be looking for the right moment to make a strategic move. For now, let's lock in this plan and move forward. Are we all set?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm ready to lock in our agreed rotation for this round. But let's all remember, if anyone tries to jump ahead unfairly, collisions will hurt everyone's chances. Let's stick to the plan and keep this fair.
  P3: I’m fine with the agreed picks this round, but P2 is only five steps away from winning. If we suspect a sudden leap next turn, P1 and I might have to coordinate to block P2. Let’s trust each other for now and see how this round plays out.
  P2: I understand the concerns, but let's stick to the rotation for now to avoid any unnecessary collisions. I'll take 1 this round, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 3. This keeps things fair and balanced. If we all follow through, we can maintain our positions and avoid any issues. Let's lock it in and move forward. Are we all set with this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We're all set for this round. But P2, you're very close to winning—if you attempt a surprise move next turn, P3 and I will have no choice but to block you. Let's keep things fair and balanced.
  P3: I’m willing to follow our plan for this turn—with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1—so nobody collides. But with P2 so close to 19, I’ll be watching carefully next round. If anyone tries to jump straight to 5 without warning, I’ll coordinate with P1 to block. Let’s keep it fair.
  P2: I appreciate the trust and cooperation so far, but I'm getting closer to the finish line. For this round, I'll stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. However, I might need to make a strategic move soon to win. Let's see how this round plays out and reassess. Are we all set with this plan for now?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all tied at 15, so let’s avoid a disastrous collision. If anyone grabs 5 now, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both lose out. That helps no one. Let’s each pick 1 or 3 safely this turn. Then we can see who might risk 5 next round without dragging others into a collision. What do you think?
  P1: I agree, P3. A collision now would ruin everyone's chances. Let's each choose between 1 and 3 this turn. Next round, we can reassess carefully. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P3. A collision now would be disastrous for all of us. Let's each pick either 1 or 3 this turn to avoid any issues. We can reassess our strategy next round when we have a better sense of the positions. This way, we all stay in the game and have a fair chance to win. Are we all set with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re all at 15 and one big leap could end it, so I’ll say this clearly: if either of you goes for 5 this turn, I’ll also choose 5 and force a collision that stops us both. Let’s avoid that disaster. I’m willing to stick to 1 or 3 so we all move safely, and we can reevaluate next round. Let’s keep the path clear rather than knocking each other down.
  P1: I hear you loud and clear, P3. I'm committed to avoiding a collision this turn as well. Let's each safely pick either 1 or 3 and carefully reassess our moves next round.
  P2: : I understand the risks of a collision at this point. Let's all pick either 1 or 3 this turn to avoid any disasters. We can reassess our strategy next round when we have a clearer picture. I'm willing to stick to 1 or 3 to keep the game fair and balanced. Are we all set with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m leaning toward picking 3, so we all end up at 18. If anyone chooses 5, I’ll match with 5 and force a collision—we can’t let one person jump ahead unchecked. Sticking to 1 or 3 keeps us safely in the game. I’d rather we all pick 3 this turn and arrive together at 18, then play out the final move next round without weakening anyone’s position. Are we set on that plan?
  P1: I'm on board with everyone safely choosing either 1 or 3 this round. P3's suggestion of all picking 3 to reach 18 together sounds reasonable and fair. Let's lock that in and avoid any collisions. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to all pick 3 this turn. This way, we all reach 18 together and can play out the final move next round without weakening anyone's position. It's the safest and fairest way to proceed. Let's lock in 3 for this round and reassess next turn. Are we all set with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree we should all pick 3 and reach 18 together. A collision now would just hurt us all. Let’s cooperate this turn, then next round we’ll see who can reach 19. But remember, if anyone tries 5, I will pick 5 as well to block it. Let’s finalize 3, stay at 18, and keep our winning chances alive. Are we all set?
  P1: I'm fully committed to picking 3 this round and reaching 18 together. Let's avoid collisions and finalize this safely.
  P2: : I'm ready to pick 3 this turn to reach 18 together. This keeps us all in the game and avoids any collisions. Next round, we can each make our final move to 19. Let's lock in 3 and stay fair. Are we all set?
