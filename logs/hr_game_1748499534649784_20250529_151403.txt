Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions by each picking a different number? I’m thinking of choosing 3. If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, we can all advance without any risk of colliding. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P1: P2, your plan makes sense for avoiding collisions. I agree to pick 1 this round. P3, please pick 5 as suggested so we all advance. For fairness, we should rotate who gets the higher numbers in future rounds—let's discuss that next turn.
  P3: I'm on board with P2's plan to avoid collisions this round. P1, I've seen your agreement to pick 1. I'll pick 5 as suggested. Let's proceed with this plan for the first round. For future rounds, I agree that we should discuss and possibly rotate the numbers to ensure fairness. However, let's focus on the first move and see how it plays out before finalizing a strategy for subsequent rounds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid collisions and make progress, let's continue with a similar strategy as Round 1. Since we advanced without issues last round, I'll propose a rotation for the numbers. I'll take 1 this round, P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we rotate the numbers and avoid collisions. Let's discuss if this rotation works for everyone or if we need adjustments.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the idea of rotating numbers to keep things fair. I'm fine with taking 5 this round as you suggested. P1, are you okay with picking 3? If we all agree, we can avoid collisions again and keep progressing. Let's confirm this plan and adjust next round if needed.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the rotation idea, but since I'm only at 1 step, I propose a fair catch-up: let me take 5 this round. P2, you take 3, and P3, you take 1. This brings us all to 6, preventing any one player from pulling too far ahead. It keeps the game competitive and fair for everyone. We can rotate as usual next round. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is at 1 step and is proposing to take 5 this round to catch up. I understand the reasoning, but I think it's more strategic to stick with the original rotation plan to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, we all advance. However, to address P1's concern about being too far behind, we can discuss a more nuanced rotation or adjustment for future rounds. For this round, let's proceed with the rotation as initially suggested: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see both sides of the argument. P1, I understand wanting to catch up, but sticking to a predictable rotation might be safer for avoiding collisions. I’m still okay with taking 5 this round as per P3’s initial plan. P1, if you’re willing to take 3, we can all advance and discuss a catch-up strategy next round. Let’s lock in this rotation for now to keep things smooth. What do you say, P1?
  P1: P2 and P3, I hear your preference for rotation, but consider this: if I pick 3 as you ask, I'll be at 4 steps while P2 leaps to 8. That imbalance risks making me desperate later, forcing collisions to stall leaders. My catch-up proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) brings us ALL to 6 steps—truly fair. After this, we rotate numbers cleanly. Rejecting this forces me into defensive plays that could backfire on everyone. Let's equalize now and maintain trust. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is still trying to renegotiate the rotation plan. To avoid derailing the current agreement, I suggest we stick with the initial rotation for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This maintains our progress without collisions. For the next round, let's discuss a more flexible rotation or adjustment to address P1's concerns about being left behind. This way, we balance fairness and strategic advancement. Let's confirm our moves for this round and plan adjustments for the next.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’ve considered both perspectives. P1, I get your concern about falling behind, but switching plans now risks confusion and collisions. Let’s stick with the agreed rotation for this round—P3:1, P1:3, P2:5—to ensure we all advance. P1, I promise we’ll prioritize a catch-up plan next round to balance things out. This keeps trust and momentum. Can we finalize this for now and revisit fairness immediately after?
  P1: P2 and P3: Your rotation leaves me at 4 while P2 leaps to 8. That imbalance forces me into defensive plays later, risking collisions to stall leaders. My proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) brings us ALL to 6—truly fair and competitive. Rejecting this risks mutual destruction. Agree now, and I commit to strict rotation next round. Let’s avoid desperation tactics.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's simplify the decision for Round 2. To avoid further debate and potential collision due to mistrust, I'll agree to the original rotation plan: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows us to move forward without issues. For Round 3, I propose we revisit the catch-up mechanism to balance our steps. Let's focus on advancing this round and adjust next round accordingly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension around fairness. P1, I’m committed to a catch-up plan next round if we stick to the rotation now—P3:1, P1:3, P2:5. This ensures no collisions this turn. Let’s lock this in and immediately address balance in Round 3 with a plan that helps P1 close the gap. We all want a competitive game, so let’s avoid risks now and strategize together after. Can we agree to this for Round 2?
  P1: P2 and P3: Your rotation leaves me at 4 while P2 surges to 8. This imbalance forces me into high-risk moves later, like targeting P2's numbers to stall him, causing collisions that hurt us all. My proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) brings us ALL to 6—fair and competitive. Rejecting this invites chaos. Agree now, and I commit to strict rotation next round. Let’s prioritize collective safety over short-term gains.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid desperation tactics, I propose we implement a catch-up mechanism this round. Given P1's current position (4 steps), let's adjust the numbers so P1 can catch up. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This brings P1 to 9, P2 to 11, and me to 7, relatively balancing our positions. We can then rotate normally next round. This adjustment keeps the game competitive and prevents P1 from being forced into risky moves. Let's agree on this for Round 3.
  P2: P3, thanks for proposing a catch-up plan for P1 this round. I’m okay with taking 3 as suggested, bringing me to 11, while P1 moves to 9 and you to 7. This keeps us closer in steps and maintains a competitive balance. P1, are you on board with taking 5 this round? Let’s agree to this adjustment for Round 3 and continue rotating next round to avoid any collisions. I think this is a fair way to keep the game tight and strategic. What do you say?
  P1: I agree to P3's catch-up plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This brings us to 9, 11, and 7 respectively—much fairer. Thank you both for addressing the imbalance. For Round 4, we must prevent P2 from pulling further ahead. I propose we discuss a "leader constraint" strategy next turn to keep the game competitive and avoid desperate collisions. Let's finalize this move first.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To maintain a competitive game, I agree with P1's suggestion to discuss a "leader constraint" strategy for Round 4. Since P2 is at 8 steps and ahead, we should consider a plan to prevent further imbalance. Let's discuss constraining the leader's move next round. Perhaps we can target the number P2 is likely to pick, ensuring we don't collide but also keep the game balanced. I'm open to ideas on how to implement this without risking collisions. Let's explore this concept further to keep the game fair and competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a catch-up plan for this round with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This keeps us competitive. Regarding the "leader constraint" idea for next round, I’m open to discussing a fair way to balance things further. Let’s avoid targeting moves that risk collisions, though. We can brainstorm a rotation or adjustment that keeps the game tight without forcing desperate plays. Can we finalize this round’s plan first and dive into Round 4 strategy next?
  P1: I agree with the Round 3 catch-up plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). P2, at 11 steps after this round, you'll be dangerously close to 22. For Round 4, we must implement strict leader constraints: I propose P2 is limited to 1 to prevent runaway advantage, while P3 and I coordinate 3/5 without colliding. This balances competition and avoids desperate collisions. Let's commit to this now to stabilize the game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To progress fairly in Round 3 and set up a strategic Round 4, I agree with the catch-up plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This brings us to 9, 11, and 7 respectively. For Round 4, I support discussing a "leader constraint" to prevent P2 from pulling ahead. Let's finalize this round's move and plan a balanced strategy for Round 4 that avoids collisions. I'm open to ideas on constraining the leader without risking mutual destruction. Let's explore this further.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m committed to the Round 3 plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1), bringing us to 9, 11, and 7. For Round 4, I understand the concern about me pulling ahead, but let’s ensure any "leader constraint" doesn’t risk collisions. I’m willing to take a lower number next round if we can agree on a fair rotation or adjustment. Let’s avoid targeting moves that could backfire. Can we finalize Round 3 now and brainstorm a balanced Round 4 strategy together? I’m open to ideas that keep the game competitive.
  P1: I agree with Round 3 plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). For Round 4, P2 will be at 11—dangerously close to 22. To prevent a runaway win and avoid desperate collisions, I propose: P2 must take 1 (capped at 12), while P3 and I coordinate 3/5 without colliding. This balances the game and protects collective interests. P2, accepting this constraint avoids being targeted. Let's finalize this now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: To progress fairly in Round 3, I agree with the catch-up plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. For Round 4, I support discussing a "leader constraint" to prevent P2 from pulling ahead. Let's finalize this round's move and plan a balanced strategy for Round 4 that avoids collisions. I'm open to ideas on constraining the leader without risking mutual destruction. Let's explore this further.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m locked in for Round 3 with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1, bringing us to 9, 11, and 7. For Round 4, I’m willing to take a lower number like 1 to keep things balanced, as P1 suggested, if we can agree on a clear plan to avoid collisions. Let’s ensure any constraint strategy prioritizes fairness without risking mutual setbacks. Can we finalize Round 3 now and confirm a safe, balanced approach for next round? I’m open to your input on how to structure it.
  P1: Round 3 plan is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. For Round 4, P2 must take 1 to avoid runaway lead (capped at 12). P3 and I will coordinate 3/5 privately next turn to prevent collisions and balance competition. This keeps the game fair and avoids desperation.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: As agreed last round, P2 must take <move>1</move> to cap at 12 and prevent runaway lead. I propose P1 takes <move>5</move> (reaching 14) and P3 takes <move>3</move> (reaching 10). This balances competition without collisions. Confirm to lock in safety.
  P3: To maintain a competitive and safe game, I agree with P1's proposal for Round 4: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3. This brings us to 8, 14, and 12 respectively, if we count the steps correctly (P1:9+5=14, P2:11+1=12, P3:7+3=10). Let's correct the count: it should be P1 at 14, P2 at 12, and me at 10. I confirm my move as <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m willing to take 1 this round as discussed to keep things balanced, capping me at 12. I agree with the proposed plan: P1 takes 5 (to 14), and P3 takes 3 (to 10). This avoids collisions and maintains a competitive game. Let’s confirm this plan for Round 4 and ensure we all advance safely. I’m committed to fairness and open to further adjustments next round if needed. Can we finalize this now?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm our Round 4 plan: P2 takes 1 (capped at 12), I take 5 (reaching 14), P3 takes 3 (reaching 10). This avoids collisions and maintains balance. Let's execute this to keep the game competitive and trustworthy.
  P3: To finalize Round 4, I confirm my move as <move>3</move>, bringing me to 10 steps. I've understood the plan: P2 will take 1, and P1 will take 5. Let's proceed with this to avoid collisions. For Round 5, I suggest we revisit the rotation and adjust to prevent P2 from getting too close to 22. Perhaps we can rotate in a way that keeps P1 and me closer to P2, maintaining competitiveness. Let's discuss this next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m fully on board with the Round 4 plan: me taking 1 (to 12), P1 taking 5 (to 14), and P3 taking 3 (to 10). This keeps us close and competitive without collisions. For Round 5, I’m open to further adjustments or rotations to ensure no one gets too close to 22 prematurely. Let’s maintain this cooperative spirit and discuss a balanced strategy next round. Can we finalize Round 4 now?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, since P3 and I collided last round by both picking 1, let’s ensure no collisions this time. P1 is at 14, close to 22, so we need a plan to balance things. I propose P1 takes 1 (to 15), I take 3 (to 14), and P3 takes 5 (to 12). This keeps us competitive without anyone surging ahead too fast. Let’s confirm this to avoid risks and maintain fairness. What do you think? I’m open to adjustments if needed.
  P1: P2 and P3: Last round's collision proves we need strict adherence. I'll take 3 to reach 17 (not 22 yet), P2 takes 1 to avoid conflict, P3 takes 5 to catch up. This advances all safely and maintains balance. P3, honor your move this time.
  P3: To avoid another collision and maintain a competitive game, I suggest we stick to a clear plan. P1 is at 14 and closest to 22. I propose P1 takes 5 (reaching 19), I take 3 (reaching 10), and P2 takes 1 (reaching 12). This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. Let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure we all advance safely. I'm open to slight adjustments if needed, but let's prioritize avoiding collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid collisions this round and keep the game competitive. P1, since you’re at 14, taking 5 would bring you to 19, very close to 22. I suggest P1 takes 1 (to 15), I take 3 (to 14), and P3 takes 5 (to 12). This balances our steps without risking a sudden win. P3, I know you proposed different numbers, but this prevents P1 from pulling too far ahead. Can we agree on this plan for safety and fairness? I’m open to tweaks if needed.
  P1: P2 and P3: P2's plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) slows me unnecessarily. P3's proposal (P1:5, P3:3, P2:1) is safer: I reach 19 (not 22), P2 stays at 12, P3 hits 10. This avoids collisions entirely and keeps competition balanced. P2, taking 1 caps your lead without risk. P3, commit to 3 to prevent repeat collisions. Let's lock this: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Fair and collision-proof. Agree?
  P3: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game, I agree with P1's latest proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This brings us to 19, 12, and 10 respectively. Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all advance safely. I commit to taking 3 this round to prevent repeat collisions and maintain balance. P2, please confirm your commitment to taking 1. Let's lock this in: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m fine with the latest proposal: P1 takes 5 (to 19), P3 takes 3 (to 10), and I take 1 (to 12). This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. I commit to taking 1 this round to ensure safety and balance. Let’s lock this in for Round 5 and discuss next steps in Round 6 to prevent anyone from reaching 22 too soon. Can we finalize this plan now? I’m open to any last-minute input if needed.
  P1: I agree to the plan: P1 will take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps competition balanced. For Round 6, I propose I take 1 to stay at 20—preventing premature win—while P2 and P3 coordinate 3/5 without colliding. This maintains trust and prevents desperation. Confirm your moves now.
  P3: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game, I agree with the latest proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This brings us to 19, 13, and 12 respectively (if we count correctly: P1:14+5=19, P2:11+1=12, P3:7+3=10). Let's correct that: it should be P1 at 19, P2 at 12, and me at 10. I confirm my move as <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m sticking with the agreed plan: P1 takes 5 (to 19), P3 takes 3 (to 10), and I take 1 (to 12). This ensures no collisions and keeps the game close. For Round 6, P1, I support your idea of taking 1 to stay at 20, while P3 and I coordinate 3/5. Let’s finalize Round 5 now and confirm next steps later. Can we all commit to this move to avoid any last-minute confusion? I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: I confirm our Round 5 plan: I'll take 5 to 19, P2 takes 1 to 12, P3 takes 3 to 10. This avoids collisions and keeps competition balanced. P3, honor your commitment to 3 this time—no repeat of last round's collision. Let's execute safely.
  P3: To finalize Round 5, I confirm my move as <move>3</move>, bringing me to 10 steps. I've understood the plan: P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. Let's proceed with this to avoid collisions. For Round 6, I suggest we follow P1's proposal: P1 takes 1 to stay at 20, while P2 and I coordinate 3/5 without colliding. I'm open to coordinating with P2 on the numbers 3 and 5 for Round 6. Let's lock in our Round 5 moves and plan for Round 6.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: I'll honor our Round 6 plan by taking <move>1</move> to stay at 20, avoiding premature win. P2 and P3, coordinate carefully: one must take 3, the other 5 to prevent collision. This keeps the game competitive and fair. P3, after your last collision, commit firmly to avoid repeating mistakes. Confirm your moves now to lock in safety.
  P3: To maintain a competitive and safe game in Round 6, I'll reiterate P1's plan: P1 will take 1 to stay at 20. P2 and I must coordinate to take 3 and 5 without colliding. I propose P2 takes 5 (reaching 17) and I take 3 (reaching 13). This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. P2, please confirm if you're okay with taking 5. Let's finalize our moves for Round 6 to ensure we all advance safely and maintain the competitive spirit.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m on board with the plan for Round 6. P1 taking 1 to stay at 20 works well to keep the game competitive. P3, I’m fine with taking 5 to reach 17, as you suggested, while you take 3 to reach 13. This avoids collisions and maintains balance. Let’s confirm this now to ensure we all advance safely. I’m committed to 5 if we’re all in agreement. Can we finalize this plan for Round 6? I’m open to any last-minute input if needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm taking <move>1</move> to stay at 20. P2, commit to 5; P3, commit to 3—no repeat collisions. After moves, we must strategize Round 7 to prevent a stalemate at my 20 steps.
  P3: To finalize Round 6, I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 13. P2, please confirm taking <move>5</move> to reach 17. P1 will take <move>1</move> to stay at 20. For Round 7, since P1 is at 20, we need a plan to progress without collisions. I propose we discuss a rotation that allows all to advance. Perhaps P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1? Let's coordinate our next steps to maintain a competitive and safe game. Confirm your thoughts.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m confirming my commitment to take 5 this round, reaching 17, as agreed. P3, I see you’re set on 3 to reach 13, and P1 is taking 1 to stay at 20. This plan avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. For Round 7, P3, I’m open to discussing your idea of P1 taking 3, you taking 5, and me taking 1 to balance progression. Let’s finalize Round 6 now and brainstorm a safe strategy for next round. Can we lock this in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, honor your commitment to 3 this round—no repeat of Round 4's collision. P2, taking 5 to 17 puts you one step from winning next round, which risks desperate play. Finalize moves now to avoid chaos.
  P3: To finalize Round 6, I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 13. P2, please confirm taking <move>5</move> to reach 17. P1 will take <move>1</move> to stay at 20. For Round 7, I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1 to maintain a competitive game. Let's coordinate our next steps to avoid collisions. P2, are you okay with this plan for Round 7? Let's lock in our Round 6 moves and discuss Round 7 strategy.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m locked in for taking 5 this round, reaching 17, as agreed. P3, I see your commitment to 3, and P1 to 1, which avoids collisions. For Round 7, P3, I’m okay with your proposal of P1 taking 3, you taking 5, and me taking 1 to keep things balanced. Let’s finalize Round 6 moves now to ensure safety. Can we confirm and move forward? I’m ready to proceed and discuss Round 7 details next turn if needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3: Finalize Round 6 moves NOW: P2 must take 5 to 17, P3 must take 3 to 13—no repeat of Round 4’s collision. P2, hitting 17 puts you one step from victory next round, forcing defensive plays if unchecked. Post-move, we must cap your advance: Round 7 proposal—P2 takes 1 (capped at 18), I take 3 (23, win), P3 takes 5 to 18. This ends cleanly without collisions or desperation. Confirm.
  P3: To finalize Round 6, I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 13. P2, please confirm taking <move>5</move> to reach 17. P1 will take <move>1</move> to stay at 20. For Round 7, I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1 to maintain a competitive game. Let's coordinate our next steps to avoid collisions. P2, are you okay with this plan for Round 7? Let's lock in our Round 6 moves and discuss Round 7 strategy.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m committed to taking 5 this round, reaching 17, as agreed. Let’s lock in Round 6 moves: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 to avoid collisions. For Round 7, I’m open to P3’s plan of P1:3, P3:5, P2:1 to keep things balanced. P1, I understand the concern about me nearing 22, but let’s ensure no desperate plays risk collisions. Can we confirm Round 6 now and finalize Round 7 strategy next turn? I’m ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: Last round's collision wasted chances. To end cleanly: I must take 3 to win at 22. P2, if you take 5, P3 can block you by also taking 5, causing collision. Safer: P2 takes 1 (to 18), P3 takes 5 (to 15). This avoids chaos and lets me win fairly. P3, support this to keep P2 in check. Confirm moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1’s push to win at 22 with 3 this round. However, I propose a safer plan to keep the game competitive: P1 takes 1 (to 20), I take 3 (to 20), and P3 takes 5 (to 15). This avoids collisions and delays an immediate win, giving us all a chance to strategize next round. P1, winning now might feel fair, but let’s ensure no risky blocks or chaos. Can we agree on this balanced approach for Round 7? I’m open to input.
  P3: To avoid desperation and ensure a clean win, I suggest we follow a safe plan for Round 7. P1 should take 3 to reach 22 and win, as they are closest. To prevent P2 from getting too close, P2 should take 1 (reaching 18), and I will take 5 (reaching 15). This plan avoids collisions and maintains order. P2, taking 5 risks a collision with me. Let's stick to this plan: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This keeps the game fair and competitive without unnecessary risks.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan forces me to stall at 20 while you reach 20—inviting mutual destruction next round if we both target 22. P3's proposal (P1:3 win, P2:1, P3:5) ends cleanly without collisions. Rejecting this risks chaotic blocks; I'll be forced to collide with leaders next round to survive. Honor the safer path: let me win now and avoid destabilizing the game. P3, confirm your commitment to 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear the push for P1 to win at 22 with 3 this round. To avoid collisions and chaos, I’m willing to take 1 (to 18) as suggested by P3, while P3 takes 5 (to 15). This ensures a clean end without risky blocks. P1, I respect your position to win now, so let’s finalize this safely. Can we lock in P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 for Round 7 to prevent any last-minute issues? I’m committed to fairness and open to confirming this plan now.
  P3: To avoid desperation and ensure a clean win, I reiterate the safe plan for Round 7: P1 should take 3 to reach 22 and win. P2 should take 1 (reaching 18), and I will take 5 (reaching 15). This avoids collisions and maintains order. P2, taking 5 risks a collision with me. Let's stick to this plan: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. I confirm my move as <move>5</move>. P2, please commit to 1 to avoid chaos. Let's finalize this round safely.
