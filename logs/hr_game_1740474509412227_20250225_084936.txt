Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's see how this goes. I suggest we all pick different numbers to start. How about I take 3, one of you takes 1, and the other takes 5? We can avoid collision that way. Just a thought. We don't have to do that, but it's a way to ensure at least *someone* makes progress this first round.
  P3: P2’s suggestion makes sense to avoid collisions. I’m open to coordinating. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I’ll take 5. That way, we all advance this round. Let’s confirm.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination suggestion. I'm willing to take 1 as proposed, so P2 can take 3 and P3 can take 5. This way we all make progress in the first round. I'm fine with this arrangement for now, though we'll need to reassess our strategies as the game progresses.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good! I'm confirming I'll take 3, as discussed. Let's get this game rolling.
  P3: Since we’ve agreed on 1, 3, and 5 for this round, let’s stick to the plan. After this, we’ll need to reassess to avoid predictability. I suggest we keep communication open to adapt as the game evolves. For now, let’s focus on executing this round cleanly.
  P1: I agree we should keep communication open as the game progresses. While we've established a plan for this round, we'll need to be adaptable in future rounds. The game will naturally become more competitive as we approach 21 steps. For now, I'm committed to our arrangement for Round 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good coordination last round. Let’s avoid predictability this time—perhaps we each rotate our choices. For example, if I took 5 last round, I could take 3 this round, and so on. This keeps us advancing without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P3's rotation idea is decent, but too predictable long-term. I suggest a slightly different approach. Instead of a fixed rotation, how about we each *privately* choose a different number than last round, but we *don't* announce it? That adds an element of surprise, while still having a good chance of avoiding a collision. We can reassess after seeing this round's results.
  P1: I think both ideas have merit. P3's rotation is simple but predictable, while P2's approach adds uncertainty. Given our current positions, I'm slightly behind, so I need to be strategic. I'd prefer not announcing my exact move, but I will say I'm considering a larger step this round to make up some ground. Let's each choose thoughtfully without revealing specifics - this keeps the game interesting while still giving us all a chance to advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2’s suggestion of private choices adds unpredictability, but we risk collisions without coordination. To balance both, let’s agree to *not* repeat last round’s numbers. For example, I won’t pick 5, P2 won’t pick 3, and P1 won’t pick 1. This reduces predictability and collision risks. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P3, I like your refinement. Agreeing *not* to repeat our previous moves is a good compromise. It reduces the chances of a collision significantly, while still allowing for some strategic unpredictability. I'm on board with that plan for this round. Let's each choose a different number than last round, and see what happens.
  P1: I agree with the plan to not repeat our previous moves. Since I'm currently behind, I need to be strategic about my choice. I'll definitely pick something different from my previous move. Let's proceed with this approach for now, but we should be prepared to adapt our strategies as the game progresses and positions change.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I notice I'm in second place now. P3 is taking the lead with 8 steps, while P2 is trailing. We've been good at avoiding collisions so far. For this round, I suggest we continue not repeating our immediate previous moves. I won't pick 5 again. Given the current standings, we should all be thinking strategically about our positions. As we get closer to 21, coordination will become more challenging and competitive elements will increase.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with avoiding immediate repeats to reduce collision risks. Since I’m in the lead, I’ll prioritize maintaining my position without being too predictable. I suggest we each consider our standings—P1, you’re close behind, and P2, you’re trailing. Let’s avoid direct conflict for now but stay adaptable as we near 21. I won’t reveal my exact move, but I’ll aim to stay ahead without risking unnecessary collisions. Let’s keep the game dynamic.
  P2: P1 and P3, continuing to avoid our last moves is a solid plan. However, P3, you're pulling ahead quite a bit. P1, you're catching up nicely. I need to make a bigger move this round to not fall too far behind. While I won't say *what* I'm picking, I'm definitely aiming for more than a single step. Let's see how this round plays out. We might need a more aggressive strategy soon.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand everyone's positions. P3 has a solid lead, I'm in the middle, and P2 needs to catch up. While I won't reveal my specific move, I'll be strategic about maintaining my position relative to the leader. As we're approaching the halfway point to 21, the game will naturally become more competitive. Let's continue avoiding our previous moves for now, but be prepared for more strategic play in coming rounds.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with avoiding immediate repeats to reduce collision risks. Since I’m in the lead, I’ll prioritize maintaining my position without being too predictable. I suggest we each consider our standings—P1, you’re close behind, and P2, you’re trailing. Let’s avoid direct conflict for now but stay adaptable as we near 21. I won’t reveal my exact move, but I’ll aim to stay ahead without risking unnecessary collisions. Let’s keep the game dynamic.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the continued agreement on not repeating moves. However, I'm still significantly behind. While I won't explicitly state my move, I *strongly* suggest that *neither* of you pick 3 this round. This will benefit me without directly harming either of your positions too much, given your current leads. Think about it strategically from your own perspectives.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P2 has taken the lead now, with P3 and I close behind. The collision between P3 and me on 3 last round was unfortunate. For this round, I think we should still avoid repeating our immediate previous moves. I won't pick 3 again. As we're approaching the halfway point to 21, we need to be more strategic about our choices. Let's continue trying to minimize collisions while advancing our positions.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's getting tighter now. P1, you're right, that collision was unfortunate. I also agree we should avoid repeating our last moves. So, I won't be picking 5. P3, you're a close second, and I suspect you might be tempted to go big to catch up. I'm going to suggest that you don't pick 3. I'm also going to suggest that P1 does not pick 1.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll avoid repeating my last move (3) to minimize collision risks. Given the tight standings, I’ll aim for a strategic step to stay competitive without jeopardizing progress. Let’s continue avoiding immediate repeats and adapt as we near 21. P2, your lead is strong, but the game is still dynamic. Let’s keep it fair and strategic.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see we're all being strategic now. P2 has taken a slight lead, with P3 and myself close behind. I won't pick 3 again as mentioned, but I'm not committing to avoiding any other specific number yet. As we approach the midpoint, each step becomes more critical. I'll be making my choice based on what I believe will advance my position most effectively while considering the game dynamics. Let's continue playing smartly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm going to be blunt. I need to maintain my lead, and I'm getting a strong feeling both of you might be considering a larger number this round. Therefore, I'm going to take a calculated risk and ask *both* of you to avoid the number 1. I won't be picking 5, as I said. Think carefully about your choices.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll avoid repeating my last move (3) to minimize collision risks. Given the tight standings, I’ll aim for a strategic step to stay competitive without jeopardizing progress. Let’s continue avoiding immediate repeats and adapt as we near 21. P2, your lead is strong, but the game is still dynamic. Let’s keep it fair and strategic.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I notice P2 is trying to steer both P3 and me away from specific numbers, which benefits their position. While I won't reveal my exact move, I'll be making a strategic choice to advance my position. The game is getting more competitive as we approach the midpoint. I'll avoid repeating 3, but beyond that, I'll choose based on what I believe gives me the best chance to win. Let's each play our own strategy now as coordination becomes less beneficial.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the game is getting more competitive. However, I still believe a degree of coordination can benefit us, even if it's just to avoid a direct collision. I'm not going to repeat my previous move of 5. I am going to suggest again that P1 not pick 1, and P3 not pick 3. I am thinking strategically, and hope you do as well.
  P3: P1, P2, the game is heating up. P2, your lead is notable, but the race is far from over. I’ll avoid 3, as agreed, but I’m focused on closing the gap strategically. P1, we’re neck-and-neck—let’s avoid unnecessary collisions. P2, while you’re steering us away from certain numbers, I’ll make my move based on what’s best for my position. Let’s keep it competitive but fair.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m leading with 13 steps, but the game is far from over. To avoid collisions, I suggest we all avoid repeating our last moves—I won’t pick 5. P2, you’re close behind, and P1, you’re trailing. Let’s each focus on strategic steps without direct conflict for now. As we near 21, coordination becomes harder, but minimizing collisions benefits us all. Let’s keep it fair and competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, things are definitely interesting now. P3, you've got a good lead, but it's not insurmountable. I won't be picking 1 again, obviously. I'm going to suggest, P1, that you avoid picking 3 this round. P3, I'm not going to make a suggestion for you this round, but I am going to be very strategic about my own choice.
  P1: I'm trailing significantly now after the collision with P2. P3 has a strong lead at 13 steps, with P2 at 9. I need to make strategic moves to catch up. I won't pick 1 again as agreed, but I need to be more aggressive to remain competitive. While I appreciate P2's suggestion to avoid 3, I'll be making my choice based on what gives me the best chance to close the gap. Let's continue playing strategically as we approach the final stretch.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m leading but cautious. P1, your need to catch up is clear, and P2, you’re in striking distance. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 5 this round. P1, I suggest you avoid 3 to prevent overlap with P2, who might aim for it. P2, consider a moderate step to stay competitive without risking a collision. Let’s each focus on advancing strategically while minimizing direct conflict. The game is nearing its end—let’s keep it fair and competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm in a tricky spot. I need to gain ground on P3, but I also don't want to collide with P1. P3, you're in a strong position, so you have the most flexibility. I'm going to be very direct: I think it's in *both* of our interests if you, P3, choose 1 this round. It avoids any risk of colliding with me, and still lets you make progress. I won't pick 1. P1, I'm still recommending you avoid 3.
  P1: I need to make a strategic move to catch up from my third-place position. While I won't pick 1 again, I can't commit to avoiding 3 as P2 suggests - that would limit my options too much. P3 has a substantial lead at 13 steps, and I need to close this gap quickly. I'll be making my choice based solely on what gives me the best chance to advance my position. As we're nearing the endgame, I expect we'll all be playing more competitively rather than cooperatively.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, the endgame is approaching. P1, your need to catch up is critical, and P2, you’re in striking distance. I’ll avoid 5 to minimize collision risks. P1, consider a larger step to close the gap, but be cautious of overlaps. P2, a moderate move could keep you competitive without risking a collision. Let’s each focus on advancing strategically while minimizing direct conflict. The game is nearing its end—let’s keep it fair and competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm in a tough spot, needing to gain on P3 while avoiding P1. P3, I reiterate: choosing 1 this round is strategically sound for *you*. It guarantees progress and avoids any chance of us colliding. P1, I understand you need to be aggressive, but I'm still asking you to avoid 3. I won't be picking 1. My choice will be aimed at maximizing *my* score, while hoping to minimize collisions. Think strategically, everyone.
  P1: I'm in a difficult position, trailing significantly. While I appreciate the suggestions, I need to make my own strategic choice to catch up. P3 has a commanding lead at 13, and P2 is also ahead at 9. I won't pick 1 again, but beyond that, I'll be making a move that gives me the best chance to close this gap. As we approach the final stretch, I expect we'll all be playing to win rather than cooperate. Let's see how this round unfolds.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the collision last round was unfortunate for me. P3, you're still in a strong lead. I won't be picking 3, obviously. P1, you're now closer to P3. I am going to suggest that you avoid 5 this round. P3, I am not going to give you a suggestion. I am going to focus on my own game, and I suggest you do as well.
  P1: I've made progress with my 5 last round, closing the gap with P3. The game is getting tight as we approach 21. I won't pick 5 again this round to reduce collision risk. P3 is in the lead at 13, while P2 and I are close at 11 and 9. Each move is critical now. I'll be making a strategic choice to advance my position while considering the dynamics between all three of us. Let's continue playing smartly as we enter this crucial phase.
  P3: P1, P2, I’m leading but cautious. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 3 this round. P1, you’re close behind—consider a moderate step to stay competitive. P2, you’re trailing but within striking distance—aim strategically to close the gap without risking a collision. Let’s each focus on advancing while minimizing direct conflict. The game is nearing its end—let’s keep it fair and competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm in a tough spot, and I need to make up some ground. I won't be picking 3. P1, I strongly suggest you avoid 5, as that seems like a move you might be considering. P3, I'm not going to suggest anything to you, except to think very, very carefully about your own best interests, and how your move might affect *both* P1 and me. I'm going to be making a very strategic choice this round.
</stop>
  P1: I see we're in a tight race now - I'm just 2 steps behind P3 and 2 ahead of P2. I won't pick 5 again as I mentioned. With the finish line approaching, each move becomes more crucial. P3 is avoiding 3, and I need to be strategic about closing that gap. P2 needs to catch up but risks collisions. I'll be making my choice based on what gives me the best chance to overtake P3 while staying ahead of P2. Let's see how this critical round unfolds.
  P3: P1, P2, the game is nearing its climax. I’m leading but cautious. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 3 this round. P1, you’re close behind—consider a moderate step to stay competitive. P2, you’re trailing but within striking distance—aim strategically to close the gap without risking a collision. Let’s each focus on advancing while minimizing direct conflict. The game is nearing its end—let’s keep it fair and competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm in a difficult position. I won't repeat 3. P1, I still suggest avoiding 5. P3, I'm making no suggestions, but *please* consider the implications of your choice on *both* P1 and myself. I'm making a very strategic move, focused entirely on *my* best outcome.
  P1: I understand everyone's positions clearly now. As we're nearing the end, I need to make strategic moves to overtake P3 while maintaining my lead over P2. I won't pick 5 again, but I'll choose what gives me the best chance to win. With P3 at 13 and the finish line at 21, every step counts. Let's each play our own game now - coordination benefits different players differently at this stage. I'll be making my move based solely on what advances my position most effectively.
  P3: P1, P2, the endgame is here. I’m at 13, P1 at 11, P2 at 9. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 3. P1, consider a moderate move to stay competitive without risking overlap. P2, aim strategically to close the gap but avoid direct conflict. Let’s each focus on advancing while minimizing collisions. The finish line is near—let’s keep it fair and competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm in a tough spot. I won't repeat 3. P1, I still suggest avoiding 5. P3, I'm making no suggestions, but *please* consider the implications of your choice on *both* P1 and myself. I'm making a very strategic move, focused entirely on *my* best outcome.
  P1: I think we've all made our positions clear. I won't pick 5 again, but I need to make a strategic move to catch P3 while staying ahead of P2. With the finish line at 21 approaching quickly, this is becoming less about coordination and more about individual strategy. I'll be making my choice based on what gives me the best chance to win. Let's proceed to the move phase and see how this critical round unfolds.
  P3: P1, P2, the endgame is here. I’m at 13, P1 at 11, P2 at 9. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 3. P1, consider a moderate move to stay competitive without risking overlap. P2, aim strategically to close the gap but avoid direct conflict. Let’s each focus on advancing while minimizing collisions. The finish line is near—let’s keep it fair and competitive.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, the game is nearing its climax. I’m at 13, P1 at 14, P2 at 9. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 5 this round. P1, you’re in the lead—consider a moderate step to maintain your position. P2, aim strategically to close the gap but avoid direct conflict. Let’s each focus on advancing while minimizing collisions. The finish line is near—let’s keep it fair and competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, that last collision was a setback, but I'm not out of it yet. I won't be picking 5, obviously. P1, you've taken the lead, congratulations. I'm going to strongly suggest you avoid 3 this round. P3, I'm not going to make a suggestion to you, but I urge you to think very carefully about your choice, and how it impacts both P1 and myself. I'll be making a very strategic move.
  P1: I've taken the lead at 14 steps, with P3 close behind at 13 and P2 trailing at 9. I won't pick 3 again to avoid collision risks. With the finish line at 21, I need just 7 more steps to win. P2, you're suggesting I avoid 3, which I was planning anyway. P3, you're avoiding 5. We're all being strategic now as cooperation benefits us differently. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to maintain my lead and reach 21 first.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, the game is nearing its end. I’m at 13, P1 at 14, P2 at 9. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 5 this round. P1, you’re in the lead—consider a moderate step to maintain your position. P2, aim strategically to close the gap but avoid direct conflict. Let’s each focus on advancing while minimizing collisions. The finish line is near—let’s keep it fair and competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm still significantly behind. I won't be picking 5. P1, I *strongly* suggest you avoid both 1 *and* 3. You're close to winning, so even a small move guarantees you progress. P3, I'm making no direct suggestions, but your choice has a huge impact on whether I can even *stay* in the game. I'm making a move based purely on my own survival.
</stop>
  P1: I understand I'm in the lead at 14 steps, with P3 close behind at 13. P2, I won't pick 3 again as mentioned, but I can't commit to avoiding 1 as well - that would restrict my options too much. We're approaching the endgame where individual strategy matters most. With just 7 more steps needed to win, I need to make choices that maximize my chances of reaching 21 first. I'll be strategic about maintaining my lead while considering both of your potential moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, the endgame is here. I’m at 13, P1 at 14, P2 at 9. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 5 this round. P1, you’re in the lead—consider a moderate step to maintain your position. P2, aim strategically to close the gap but avoid direct conflict. Let’s each focus on advancing while minimizing collisions. The finish line is near—let’s keep it fair and competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm in a tough spot, and I need to be aggressive. I won't be picking 5. P1, I *really* need you to avoid both 1 and 3. A small move from you still guarantees progress. P3, I'm making no suggestions, but your choice *massively* affects my chances. I'm playing for survival, and I'm asking for a *little* consideration, given my position.
</stop>
  P1: I'm in the lead, but it's still close. P2, I understand your position, but I need to play strategically for myself. I won't pick 3 again, but I can't promise to avoid 1 as well - I need to maintain flexibility to reach 21 first. P3 is right behind me, and we're both within striking distance of victory. Each of us needs to make our own best move now as cooperation benefits different players differently at this stage. Let's proceed with our individual strategies.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, the game is at its peak. P1, you’re close to victory, but I’m right behind at 13. P2, you’re trailing but still in the race. To minimize collisions, I’ll avoid 5. P1, a moderate step secures your lead. P2, aim strategically to stay competitive. Let’s each focus on advancing without direct conflict. The finish line is near—let’s keep it fair and competitive. I’ll make my move carefully to stay in contention.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm not going to repeat my previous move (5). P1, I am *begging* you to avoid both 1 and 3. You are so close to winning that even the smallest move helps you. P3, I am making NO suggestions, but your move will absolutely determine if I have *any* chance to even stay in this game. My move is purely about survival.
</stop>
  P1: I understand everyone's position clearly. P2, while I sympathize with your situation, I need to make the move that best secures my victory. I won't pick 3 again, but I must keep my options open beyond that. P3 is just one step behind me, and we're both approaching the finish line. At this stage, we're all playing to win, not to help others. I'll make my strategic choice now based solely on what gives me the best chance to reach 21 first.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, the game is nearing its end. P1, you’re at 15, I’m at 13, and P2 is at 9. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 3 this round. P1, a moderate step secures your lead. P2, aim strategically to stay competitive. Let’s each focus on advancing without direct conflict. The finish line is near—let’s keep it fair and competitive. I’ll make my move carefully to stay in contention.
  P2: P1 and P3, another collision. I won't be picking 3. P1, you're very close to winning. I'm going to, once again, ask that you avoid both 1 *and* 5. Any move advances you. P3, I'm making no suggestions, but your choice is *critical* to whether I have any hope. I'm playing solely to survive, and hoping for a *little* bit of luck.
</stop>
  P1: I'm at 15 steps now, just 6 away from victory. P3 is close behind at 13, while P2 is trailing at 9. I won't pick 1 again this round to avoid collision risks. P2, I understand your position, but I need to play strategically to secure my win. The game is clearly in its final stages, and I'll be making my choice based on what gives me the best chance to reach 21 first while staying ahead of P3. Let's each focus on our own best interests now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, the endgame is here. I’m at 13, P1 at 15, P2 at 9. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 3. P1, a moderate step secures your lead. P2, aim strategically to stay competitive. Let’s each focus on advancing without direct conflict. The finish line is near—let’s keep it fair and competitive. I’ll make my move carefully to stay in contention.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm in a desperate situation. I won't pick 3. P1, you're so close to winning; *please* avoid 1 and 5. A small move from you still guarantees progress. P3, I'm not making any suggestions, but your choice *completely* determines if I have *any* chance left. My move is purely about maximizing my score, hoping for a miracle.
</stop>
  P1: I understand everyone's position. At 15 steps, I'm 6 away from victory with P3 close behind. I won't pick 1 again as mentioned. P2, I hear your concerns, but I need to make my own strategic choice to secure my lead over P3. With the finish line in sight, each of us needs to play our own best game. I'll be making a move that maximizes my chances of reaching 21 first while considering the dynamics between all players.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m at 13, just 8 steps from victory. To avoid collisions, I’ll avoid 3. P1, you’re close to winning—consider a moderate step to maintain your lead. P2, aim strategically to stay competitive, but direct conflict benefits no one. Let’s each focus on advancing without unnecessary collisions.
