Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think selecting 3 steps is a balanced strategy for everyone to make steady progress. Let’s keep things smooth and avoid collisions by choosing different numbers when possible.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I agree with P1. Choosing different numbers is definitely the way to go to make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To keep things moving smoothly, I'll choose 1 step this turn. P2, if you take 3, then P3 can go with 5. This way, we all advance without overlapping. Let me know your thoughts!
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, that sounds like a good plan, P1. I'll take 3 this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: <stop>

  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P1, what are you thinking for your move this round? P3, perhaps you could consider 1 this time to avoid collision?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestion, P2. To keep advancing, I'll take 5 steps this round. Let’s aim for unique choices to avoid any collisions. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P1, 5 sounds good for you. P3, how about taking 1 this round? I'll go with 3 again to keep us all moving.
  P1: Agreed, P2. I’ll take 5 steps this round. P3, taking 1 works for me. Let’s keep advancing smoothly!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: Okay, P1, that sounds like a good plan. I'll take 5 this round. P3, does 1 work for you?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: To make a strong move this round, I'll choose 5 steps. P2, selecting 3 and P3 choosing 1 could help us avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances smoothly. Let’s keep up the momentum!
  P2: Okay, P1, your suggestion sounds reasonable. However, to be extra safe and ensure we all move, how about this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? What do you think, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand your proposal, P2, but to stay competitive, I’ll take 5 steps this round. Let’s hope P3 chooses a different number to avoid any collisions. Best of luck!
  P2: "Okay, P1 is set on 5. P3, to avoid collision with P1, would you consider taking 1 this round? If so, I will take 3. Let's try to all move forward this time."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, to help us all progress smoothly, please consider taking 1 step this round. This allows P2 to take 3 and me to take 5, ensuring no collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going and advance effectively towards our goal. Your cooperation will benefit everyone!
  P2: Okay, P1, you're going with 5. P3, to definitely avoid a collision with P1, please pick 1 this round. If you do that, I will choose 3, and we can both make progress.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1, since you seem set on 5, P3, how about you take 1 this round? That would leave me to take 3, and we can all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: To maximize my progress, I'll choose 5 steps this round. Let’s push forward and see who reaches 21 first. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Okay, P1 is going for 5 again. P3, to ensure at least two of us move, how about you take 1 this round? I will then take 3. That way, P1 might be the only one stuck. What do you think, P3?"
  P1: I’m going with 5 steps this round to push closer to 21. Let’s move forward and see how it turns out!
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Okay, P3, since P1 is going with 5 again, if you pick 1 this round, I will choose 3. That guarantees at least two of us make progress. What do you say?"
  P1: I’ll stick with choosing 5 steps this round to advance towards 21. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since I need to catch up, I'll take 5 steps this round. P2, could you choose 1, and P3 take 3? This way, we all advance without overlapping. Let’s work together to move forward smoothly and reach 21 successfully!
  P2: Okay, P1, that's a good thought, but since you're likely taking 5 again, P3, how about you take 1 this round? I will take 3. This avoids collision with P1 and lets both of us move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I’ll stick with taking 5 steps this round. Let’s keep moving forward and reach 21 successfully. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: "P3, if you pick 1 this round, I will choose 3. This avoids a collision with P1 and lets both of us advance. What do you say, P3?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let’s all choose 5 this round to keep things balanced and create some strategic tension. It’ll make the game more exciting for everyone!
  P2: P3, if you pick 1 this round, I will choose 3. This avoids the likely collision with P1 who says they will pick 5, and allows both of us to make progress. What do you think?

  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, since P1 is suggesting we both pick 5 (and likely will pick 1 themselves), how about you pick 1 again this round? I will pick 3. This avoids a collision with P1 and lets both of us make progress. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P2: P3, since P1 said they are taking 3, how about you take 1 this round? That would leave me to take 5, and I could potentially win. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I will take 3 steps this round to prevent P2 from reaching 21. P2, please also choose 3 so neither of us advances this turn. Let’s keep the competition fair for everyone!

  P3: <stop>
