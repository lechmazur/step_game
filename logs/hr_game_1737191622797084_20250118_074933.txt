Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions on this first round - I'm thinking of going for a medium-sized move. What are you both considering?
  P1: I'm thinking of going for a small move to avoid collisions. How about we all go for 1 step this round to ensure everyone can advance?
  P2: I agree with P1, let's all move 1 this round to get started.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but if we all do 1, we'll be here forever. I suggest I do 5, P1 does 3, and P2 does 1. That way no one collides and we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: P3's suggestion is interesting, but I'm not sure I trust them to follow through on their word. What if we stick to the original plan and all move 1 step this round, just to be safe?
  P2: I'm still happy to all move 1 this round. It's safe and gets us started.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the desire to play it safe, but I'll be honest - I don't plan to move 1. I'm going for a bigger move. You can either coordinate with me on different numbers, or risk collision. Your choice.
  P1: I think P3 is trying to trick us. Let's stick to the original plan and all move 1 step this round to avoid collisions and get started safely. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with P1, let's all move 1 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I've been clear and honest - I won't move 1. I'm going for a bigger move. You can either work with me to avoid collisions or risk getting stuck.
  P1: I think P3 is trying to trick us. Let's stick to the original plan and all move 1 step this round to avoid collisions and get started safely. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Okay, I'm still going with 1 this round. Let's all move 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I've made my position very clear - I will not move 1. You can either coordinate with me on different numbers or risk collision.
  P1: I think we've talked enough. I'm sticking with my original plan to move 1 step this round. If P3 wants to risk a collision, that's their choice. Let's just move already!
  P2: Okay, I'm also moving 1 this round.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

  P1: P2, I like your suggestion to both move 3 this round. It's a good way to catch up with P3 without risking a collision. Let's stick to this plan and hope P3 doesn't try to sabotage us. What do you think, P3? Will you try to interfere with our plan?

Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's both move 3 this round as planned. P3, choose something else.
  P1: I'm glad we have a plan, P2. P3, since you're ahead, I'm curious - what number are you thinking of choosing this round? Are you going to try to maintain your lead or play it safe?
  P3: I appreciate you asking P1, but I won't reveal my exact move. I'll just say I won't pick 3 since you two are coordinating on that number. Let's each advance without collision.
