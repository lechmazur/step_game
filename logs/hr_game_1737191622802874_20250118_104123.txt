Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions and all advance. I suggest we each take different numbers - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>3</move>. P3, would you confirm taking <move>5</move>?
  P3: That plan sounds good. If we each take a different move, we all advance safely. I’m in.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we have agreement. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the plan. P3, you're taking <move>5</move>, correct? Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: I’m sticking to our plan and going for <move>5</move>. Let’s make sure we don’t collide this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That worked well for everyone last round. I propose we keep the same arrangement - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Shall we continue this way?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal. Let's stick to the same arrangement to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> again. P3, are you okay with taking <move>5</move>?
  P3: I’m fine doing the same arrangement again. To confirm: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s keep it collision-free.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we all agree. Let's proceed with our established plan.
  P2: P2: Let's confirm one last time before moving. P1, you're taking <move>1</move>, and P3, you're taking <move>5</move>? Let's avoid any mix-ups.
  P3: I’ll confirm the same arrangement. I’m taking <move>5</move> as before.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given that P3 is now significantly ahead with 10 steps, I think we need to change our strategy. P2 and I should coordinate to slow P3 down. I suggest we both pick 5 this round. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, I see your point. We should indeed try to balance the game. I agree with your suggestion to pick <move>5</move> this round to match with P3. P3, you might want to reconsider your move to avoid a collision. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P3: I hear your plan to collide with me, but keep in mind that if we don’t all pick the same move, you might stall while I keep advancing. I’d rather not collide at all. Let’s find a better way.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your concern P3, but you're too far ahead. P2 and I need to slow you down or you'll win easily. I'm sticking to my plan to pick 5. P2, let's coordinate on this.
  P2: P3, I see your point, but P1 is right that you have a significant lead. To keep the game balanced, I'll stick with P1's plan and pick <move>5</move> this round. You might want to choose a different move to avoid a collision. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both pick 5, I can choose a different move and keep advancing while you get stuck. It’s better for everyone to pick distinct moves so we all stay viable. Let’s avoid collisions and let the best player win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your perspective P3, but you have a 4-step lead over P2 and an 8-step lead over me. P2 and I need to work together to keep the game competitive. I'm committed to picking 5 this round.
  P2: P3, I understand your reasoning, but the current situation necessitates a strategic shift. P1 and I need to ensure the game remains competitive. We'll stick to picking <move>5</move> this round. You might want to reconsider your move to avoid a collision. Let's see how this plays out. P1, are you still on board with our plan?
  P3: P1, P2, if you both choose 5, you’ll stall while I advance by picking something else. That only widens my lead. P2, think carefully—do you really want to lose ground chasing this collision plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I remain committed to picking 5 this round. P2, let's follow through on our plan to keep P3's lead in check.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but P1 and I are determined to balance the game. We're sticking with <move>5</move>. You might want to pick a different number to avoid a collision. Let's proceed and see how this round turns out.
  P3: P1, P2, you’re forcing a collision that only helps me if I choose a different move. I’d rather keep things clean and move distinctly. P2, you’re within striking distance of the lead—don’t stall yourself. Let’s avoid collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That worked exactly as I expected - P3 avoided the collision and gained even more ground. P2, we really need to coordinate better this round to slow P3 down, or they'll win soon. I suggest we both pick 3 this time since that seems to be P3's preferred alternate move. Are you with me?
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to slow P3 down. Picking <move>3</move> this round makes sense. P3, you might want to reconsider your move to avoid a collision. Let's keep the game competitive. P1, are you confirmed on picking 3?
  P3: P1, P2, picking the same move to force a collision only stalls you while I move ahead. If you both choose 3, I’ll choose something else and extend my lead. It’s in your best interest to pick distinct moves and stay in contention. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the race open.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I remain committed to picking 3 this round. P2, let's stick together on this to prevent P3 from winning too quickly. P3's lead is becoming insurmountable otherwise.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but P1 and I need to work together to keep the game competitive. We're sticking with <move>3</move> this round. You might want to pick a different number to avoid a collision. Let's proceed and see how this round turns out. P1, are you still on board with our plan?
  P3: P1, P2, if you both pick the same move again, you risk stalling while I advance further. It’s in your interest to choose distinct numbers and keep pace rather than give me an opening. Let’s avoid collisions and let our final moves speak for themselves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm still committed to picking 3 this round to keep P3's lead in check. P2, we need to coordinate on this or P3 will win easily. Let's stick to our plan.
  P2: P3, I see your point, but P1 and I need to ensure the game remains competitive. We're sticking with <move>3</move> this round. You might want to pick a different number to avoid a collision. Let's proceed and see how this round turns out. P1, are you still on board with our plan?
  P3: P1, P2, if you both pick 3 again, you’ll stall while I jump ahead—potentially reaching 18 steps and winning. Are you sure you want to collide? It might be wiser to pick different moves so we all remain in contention.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I remain committed to picking 3 this round. P2, let's follow through with our plan - it's our only chance to prevent P3 from winning.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but P1 and I need to work together to keep the game competitive. We're sticking with <move>3</move> this round. You might want to pick a different number to avoid a collision. Let's proceed and see how this round turns out. P1, are you still on board with our plan?
  P3: P2, by colliding with P1, you stall yourself while I move ahead. You’ll never catch me that way. It’s in your best interest to pick a distinct move and stay in the race. Think carefully before you finalize.
