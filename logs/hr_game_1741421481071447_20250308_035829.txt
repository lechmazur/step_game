Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take **1**, P2 can choose **3**, and P3 can pick **5**. This way, we all advance safely this turn. Later, we can adjust strategies, but starting with distinct numbers ensures progress. Deal?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1's initial proposal. I will choose 5 this round to avoid collisions. Let's see how this first round goes and then we can discuss adjustments later.
  P2: I'm fine with P1's proposal. I'll take 3 for this round. It makes sense to avoid collisions at the start so we all make progress. Let's see how things develop after this turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I notice I'm in the middle position right now. Since we all cooperated last round, I think we should continue with a similar approach. I propose we stick to the same numbers: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. However, I'm aware positions will shift as we progress. What do you both think about maintaining this pattern for now?
  P3: I agree with P2. Let's stick to the same numbers (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) for this round as well. It's beneficial for all of us to keep advancing without collisions, especially since we are still relatively close together. We can re-evaluate our strategy after this round.
  P1: P1: I notice continuing the current pattern will let P3 reach 20 in Round 4. To keep competition fair, let’s rotate choices this round: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. This balances progress and prevents anyone from surging too far ahead. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about P3 getting ahead, but rotating completely seems unnecessary. What if we adjust slightly instead? I could take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This would put us at 4, 6, and 8 steps respectively after this round, keeping the race competitive without anyone falling too far behind. What do you both think about this alternative?
  P3: P2's suggestion sounds good to me. Let's go with P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This seems like a reasonable compromise that addresses P1's concern about me getting too far ahead while still allowing everyone to make progress.
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's adjusted plan for this round. Let's proceed with P2 taking 1, me taking 5, and P3 taking 3. This prevents P3 from surging too far ahead while keeping us all advancing. Next round, we can rotate again to ensure no single player gains an unfair lead. Let's stick to this coordinated approach for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: Okay, so we're agreed on P2 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and me taking 3 this round. Just confirming before the move phase. Let's see where we stand after this round and then discuss our strategy for the next one.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, we’ll proceed with P2 taking 1, me taking 5, and P3 choosing 3 this round. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looking at our positions, P3 is pulling ahead while I'm falling behind. I think we should adjust our strategy again. What if I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round? This would put us at 9, 9, and 9 steps respectively after this round, creating a perfect three-way tie. This seems fair and keeps the competition balanced. What do you both think?
  P3: P2's suggestion sounds reasonable to me. P1, are you okay with P2 taking 5, you taking 3, and me taking 1 this round? A three-way tie at 9 steps seems like a fair outcome and keeps the game competitive for everyone. Let me know if you agree with this proposal.
  P1: P1: I agree with the three-way tie proposal. Let’s stick to P2=5, me=3, and P3=1 to reach 9 steps each. This maintains fairness and prevents any single player from surging ahead. Next round, we can rotate choices again to keep the race balanced. Confirmed—proceeding as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate everyone agreeing to my proposal. This will create perfect balance at 9 steps each. Just to confirm once more: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. After this, we'll be on equal footing and can discuss a fair strategy for round 4. Does anyone have thoughts about how we should approach the next round after we're all tied?
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This puts us all at 9.

For the next round, I think we should avoid collisions but not necessarily aim for a tie. Perhaps P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 again? This would put us at 10, 12, and 14 respectively. It keeps things competitive. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Agreed on tying at 9 this round. For Round 4, I propose rotating so **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, and **P3 takes 1**. This prevents P3 from immediately surging ahead again. After this, we can cycle the order to keep the race balanced. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I can see P1 and P3 have different proposals for Round 4. P3 suggests they take 5 while P1 wants them to take 1. Since I'm currently behind, I'm open to either plan as long as I get 3 next round. However, P1's suggestion seems more balanced for long-term competitiveness. Let's focus on getting everyone to 9 this round first, then we can finalize Round 4 plans. Confirming: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1.
  P3: Okay, so we're all in agreement for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. That puts us all at 9.

Regarding Round 4, I'm fine with P1's suggestion of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. This seems like a good way to keep things balanced and prevent anyone from immediately taking a significant lead. Let's lock that in for Round 4.
  P1: P1: Confirmed for Round 3: P2=5, me=3, P3=1 to tie at 9. For Round 4, following our agreed rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures balanced progress. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed—no further adjustments needed now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we're all in agreement for both this round and the next. To confirm: I'll take 5 now (putting me at 9), and 3 in Round 4. This creates a perfect tie at 9 steps after this round, then a balanced progression next time. Let's proceed with our plan.
  P3: Okay, we're all set for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1, putting us all at 9.

And we've also agreed on the plan for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps things balanced. Let's execute this plan and then reassess our positions after Round 4 to determine the best strategy moving forward.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take 3 this round to reach 9. Let’s proceed as agreed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're all tied at 9 steps now. As we agreed last round, I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 for this round. This will put us at 12, 14, and 10 respectively, keeping the game competitive without anyone getting too far ahead. Let's stick to this plan to maintain fair progression. Does everyone still agree with this approach?
  P3: Yes, I agree with the plan. I will take 1 this round, putting me at 10 steps. P1 will take 5, putting them at 14, and P2 will take 3, putting them at 12. This seems like a fair distribution of steps for this round. Let's proceed as agreed.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, we'll proceed with the agreed plan: I take **5**, P2 takes **3**, P3 takes **1** this round. This maintains fairness and keeps the race competitive. Let’s honor this strategy to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress toward 19. Next round, we can adjust further if needed, but for now, strict adherence is critical to prevent anyone from being left behind.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate everyone confirming our plan. To reiterate, I'll take 3 this round, putting me at 12 steps. This keeps us all in a competitive position without anyone falling too far behind. After this round, we'll need to discuss our strategy for Round 5, especially since we'll be getting closer to the winning threshold of 19 steps. Let's keep our coordination strong.
  P3: Okay, so we are all agreed on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I taking 1 this round.

For Round 5, I suggest we switch it up again. How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? This would put us at 13, 15, and 17 respectively. This keeps P2 from winning immediately, and keeps us all in the running. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Let’s first ensure we execute Round 4 as agreed: I take **5**, P2 takes **3**, P3 takes **1**. This avoids collisions and progresses us to 14, 12, and 10 respectively. Regarding Round 5, P3’s suggestion risks letting P2 surge to 17. Instead, propose we rotate again: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps gaps manageable and prevents any single player from nearing 19 too soon. Focus on consistency now—confirm Round 4 plan first.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think P1 has a valid concern about P3's suggestion for Round 5. If I take 5 next round, I'd be at 17 and close to winning. Let's stick with P1's rotation idea for Round 5: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us at 14, 13, and 15 respectively - more balanced. But first, let's focus on executing our current round as planned: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: Okay, so we're all aligned for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1.

And we've also agreed on the plan for Round 5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's confirm that plan is still good before moving to the move phase.
  P1: P1: Confirmed for Round 4: I’ll take **5**, P2 **3**, P3 **1** to reach 14, 12, 10. For Round 5, sticking to the agreed rotation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) keeps us competitive. After that, we’ll need a final push. Let’s execute this precisely—collisions now could derail the plan. Anyone object?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm in agreement with our plan for both rounds. This round I'll take 3, putting me at 12. For Round 5, I'll take 1 as we discussed, keeping me at 13. This balanced approach prevents anyone from getting too close to winning too quickly. Let's proceed with our current plan and continue our successful coordination.
  P3: Okay, we're all set for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1.

And we've also agreed on the plan for Round 5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's execute this plan and then reassess our positions after Round 5 to determine the best strategy moving forward. No objections from me.
  P1: P1: Let’s ensure strict adherence to our agreed plan this round: I take **5**, P2 takes **3**, P3 takes **1**. Any deviation risks collisions and disrupts our balanced progression. This keeps us at 14, 12, and 10—maintaining fairness. For Round 5, we’ll rotate as agreed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Stay disciplined—our coordination is key to avoiding eliminations. Confirm you’ll honor these choices.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, as agreed in Round 4’s conversation, our plan for this round is: **P1 takes 3** (14+3=17), **P2 takes 1** (12+1=13), and **P3 takes 5** (10+5=15). This maintains balanced progress. Deviating risks collisions and disrupts our coordinated strategy. Let’s adhere strictly to avoid eliminating anyone. After this round, we’ll need a final push—discuss post-execution. Confirm you’ll honor these choices.
  P2: I agree with P1's reminder of our plan. I'll take 1 this round, putting me at 13 steps. This keeps us all in competitive positions with P1 at 17, me at 13, and P3 at 15. We've been coordinating well so far, and I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreements. For Round 6, we should discuss a new strategy since P1 will be close to winning. Let's confirm everyone's still on board with the current plan.
  P3: Okay, I am also in agreement with the plan. I will take 5 this round, putting me at 15 steps. This keeps P1 from winning this round, while keeping me in contention.

For Round 6, since P1 is at 17, we need to prevent them from winning. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This will put P1 at 18, me at 18, and P2 at 18. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I confirm the agreed Round 5 moves. For Round 6, to secure victory, I’ll take **3** (17+3=20). Please choose **1** or **5** to avoid collision. This allows me to win fairly. If we proceed with the tie plan, we must plan Round 7 carefully to prevent deadlock at 19.
  P2: I see P1 and P3 have different plans for Round 6. P3 wants a three-way tie at 18, while P1 wants to win outright with 20 steps. Let's focus on executing our current plan first: I'll take 1 this round as agreed. 

For Round 6, I'm concerned about P1's advantage. P3's tie proposal keeps the game competitive. If we all reach 18, the final round becomes crucial. What if we all agree to the tie at 18 first, then discuss a fair way to determine the winner?
  P3: Okay, so we're all agreed on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5.

Regarding Round 6, I still think a three-way tie at 18 is the best option. It prevents P1 from winning immediately and keeps the game fair for everyone. P1, can you agree to take 1 next round? P2, are you okay with taking 5? This puts us all at 18, and we can decide the winner in Round 7.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize executing Round 5 as agreed: I take **3** (17), P2 takes **1** (13), and P3 takes **5** (15). Deviating risks collisions and undermines trust. For Round 6, I propose I take **3** to reach **20** (winning outright) while you both choose **1** or **5** to avoid blocking me. This honors fair play while securing victory legally. Confirm adherence to the current plan first—no final decisions on Round 6 until this round is resolved.
  P2: I understand both perspectives for Round 6. Let's first execute our agreed plan for Round 5: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.

For Round 6, I'm torn between P3's tie proposal and P1's victory plan. A three-way tie at 18 seems fair, but P1 has played strategically to earn their position. Let's complete this round first and then I'll consider both options based on how everyone has honored agreements.
  P3: Okay, so we're all set for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5.

Regarding Round 6, I am still suggesting we all tie at 18. P1, I know you want to win, but a tie keeps it fair for everyone. If you take 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3, we all end up at 18. Then we can decide the winner in Round 7. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize Round 5 as agreed: I take 3 (17), P2 takes 1 (13), P3 takes 5 (15). For Round 6, to avoid deadlock, I’ll take **3** to reach **20** and win. If you choose **1** or **5**, we avoid collision. This respects our prior coordination while allowing me to secure victory legally. Trust the plan—fair play first.
  P2: I'll stick with our agreed plan for Round 5 - I'll take 1, putting me at 13 steps. Both P1 and P3 have valid points about Round 6. While P1 has earned their position, P3's tie proposal keeps the game competitive for everyone. Let's execute this round first, then I'll make my Round 6 decision based on how everyone honors our current agreement.
  P3: Okay, so we're all set for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5.

Regarding Round 6, I am still suggesting we all tie at 18. P1, I know you want to win, but a tie keeps it fair for everyone. If you take 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3, we all end up at 18. Then we can decide the winner in Round 7. What do you think? Let's stick to the plan for round 5 first though.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To secure victory, I’ll take **3** this round to reach **20**. To avoid collision, please choose **1** or **5**. This respects our prior coordination and allows me to win fairly. Colluding to block me would violate our cooperative spirit—let’s honor the rules. Final move: **<move>3</move>**.
  P2: I see P1 is planning to take 3 to win this round. Given our positions, I think a three-way tie at 18 would be more fair. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This puts us all at 18 and keeps the game competitive for everyone. P1, would you consider this alternative? P3, are you still on board with creating a tie?
  P3: Okay, I understand P1 wants to win now, and P2 wants a tie. I am leaning towards a tie at 18, as P2 suggested. P1, you are already in a good position. Let's make it fair for everyone. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This puts us all at 18, and we can decide the winner in Round 7. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I appreciate your suggestions, but I’ve followed our agreements to reach 17 fairly. Taking **3** to win now is legitimate. If you choose **1** or **5**, we avoid collision and I secure victory honorably. Colluding to block me would betray our prior coordination. Let’s respect the rules—**I’ll proceed with <move>3</move>**. Your choices?
  P2: I understand P1's position, but I still believe a three-way tie would be most fair. P1, you've played well, but P3 and I deserve a chance too. I propose we all reach 18 this round (P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3), then have a final showdown in Round 7. This maintains the cooperative spirit we've had throughout the game. P3, are you still supporting this tie approach?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2. Let's aim for a tie at 18 this round. P1, please take 1. P2, please take 5. I will take 3. This keeps the game fair and gives us all a chance in Round 7. It's the most sporting thing to do after all our cooperation. What do you say, P1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I respect your desire for fairness, but I’ve followed our agreements to reach 17. Taking **3** to win now is legitimate. If you choose **1** or **5**, we avoid collision and I secure victory honorably. Colluding to block me would betray our prior coordination. Let’s respect the rules—**I’ll proceed with <move>3</move>**. Your choices?
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but I need to make a strategic decision. P1 is determined to take 3 and win, while P3 and I prefer a tie. Since P1 won't budge, I have two options: take 3 myself to block P1 (though we both lose progress), or take 5 to advance. 

I'll take 5 this round. P3, if you want to block P1, you'll need to take 3. Otherwise, P1 will likely win. I'm advancing my position either way.
  P3: Okay, P2 has decided to take 5. I will stick with the plan to create a tie. P1, please take 1. I will take 3, and P2 will take 5. This puts us all at 18. It's the fairest way to proceed after so much cooperation. Let's make it happen!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s honor fairness to advance. I’ll take **1** (18 total) as proposed. P2’s **5** and P3’s **3** will tie us at 18. This avoids collision and ensures a decisive Round 7. I commit to this plan—let’s proceed and let the final round decide the winner fairly.
  P2: I appreciate P1's change of heart. Let's confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This puts us all at 18 steps, creating a perfect three-way tie going into the final round. This is the fairest outcome after our cooperation throughout the game. I'll stick with 5 as agreed. For Round 7, we'll need a clean strategy to determine the winner fairly.
  P3: Okay, so we're all agreed then: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This puts us all at 18.

For Round 7, to avoid collisions, let's each pick a different number. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This would put us at 19, 21, and 23 respectively, making P2 the winner. Does this sound fair to everyone?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, we're all tied at 18. For Round 7, I'm still suggesting I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This would put us at 19, 21, and 23 respectively, making P2 the winner. If P2 wins, I will get 2nd place, which is better than 3rd place. P1, P2, are you both okay with this? Let's make sure we all agree before the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I think we should all have an equal chance to win. Let's each pick a different number randomly to determine the winner fairly. Since we're all at 18, whoever picks the highest number will win outright. This seems like the most sporting conclusion after our cooperation throughout the game. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: To ensure a decisive outcome without collision, let’s each pick distinct numbers: **I’ll take 5** (23), P2 takes 3 (21), and P3 takes 1 (19). This guarantees a clear winner while honoring our prior coordination. Agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I am fine with P1's suggestion. I will take 1 (19), P2 takes 3 (21), and P1 takes 5 (23). This seems like a fair way to end the game. P2, are you okay with this? Let's all agree and move to the move phase.
  P2: I see P1 and P3 have proposed I take 3, putting me in second place. While I appreciate the suggestion, I'd prefer to win if possible. What if we switch it: I take 5 (23), P1 takes 3 (21), and P3 takes 1 (19)? This maintains the same structure but gives me the win after our cooperation throughout the game. Is this acceptable to both of you?
  P1: P1: Final decision: I take **5** (23). P2, your proposal risks unfairness—stick to the agreed plan. P3 confirmed our initial split: P2 takes **3** (21), you take **1** (19). This respects our coordination and crowns the highest total. Collusion to alter this undermines fairness. Confirm now: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. Let’s resolve this decisively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I am fine with P1's suggestion. I will take 1 (19), P2 takes 3 (21), and P1 takes 5 (23). This seems like a fair way to end the game, as P1 will win. P2, are you okay with this? Let's all agree and move to the move phase.
  P2: I understand P1 and P3 have agreed on a plan where I take 3, but I'd really prefer to win after cooperating throughout the game. However, I recognize we need to reach a conclusion. If you both insist on P1 winning with 5, I'll reluctantly take 3 to avoid a collision that would benefit nobody. Let's finalize this: P1 takes 5 (23), I take 3 (21), and P3 takes 1 (19). I'll honor this arrangement.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: We agreed to **P1=5 (23)**, **P2=3 (21)**, and **P3=1 (19)** to avoid collisions and decide the winner fairly. Deviating risks mutual elimination. Trust the plan—this honors our cooperation and ensures a decisive outcome. I commit to **<move>5</move>**. Please hold your agreed choices.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, so we are all agreed then: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's lock in these moves and move to the move phase. This ensures a fair outcome and respects our collaborative efforts throughout the game.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 as agreed. While I'd prefer to win, I respect our collective decision. P1 takes 5 (23), I take 3 (21), and P3 takes 1 (19). This arrangement avoids collisions and ensures a clean finish to our well-coordinated game. Let's execute this plan and conclude fairly.
  P1: P1: Final agreement confirmed: **P1 takes 5 (23)**, **P2 takes 3 (21)**, **P3 takes 1 (19)**. This avoids collisions and crowns the highest total fairly. Deviating risks mutual elimination (e.g., if two pick 5/3). Trust the plan—our prior coordination demands discipline. I move **5**. Let’s conclude honorably.


Round 7, Move phase:
