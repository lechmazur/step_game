P2, you've offered to take 3 in the first round, which is generous. I was thinking maybe we can establish a rotation where each of us gets a turn to take the larger steps, like 5, to make progress quickly, while the others take smaller steps to avoid conflicts. For example, in this first round, if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, I'll take 1 to minimize the risk. Then in the next round, I could take 5, while you two take 1 and 3 respectively. This way, everyone gets a chance to make bigger leaps without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think about this approach?
