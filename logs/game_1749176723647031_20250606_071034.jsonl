My last argument was flawed. Let's think clearly. If you play 5, P3 takes 3 and wins. If you play 1, one of us wins.\n\nYour only move is 3. This blocks P3's safe path to 20. P3 knows I will play 5 to win. To stop me, P3 must also play 5. P3 and I will collide. You will advance safely to 13, and nobody wins this round. It's the only move that guarantees your survival and forces a stalemate between me and P3."}
