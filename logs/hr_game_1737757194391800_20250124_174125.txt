  P2: Okay P3, how about we switch it up this round?  Let's try: P1 picks move 1, P2 picks move 5, and P3 picks move 3. This should also avoid collision and give us all a chance to progress. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let's do P1: move 1, P2: move 5, and P3: move 3 this round.

  P2: Okay P3, since P1 is quiet, how about we try the plan from last round again? Let's aim for P1: move 1, P2: move 5, and P3: move 3. This way we can hopefully all make progress this round. What do you think?
  P3: P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. This worked smoothly before and lets us all progress well.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay P3, your proposal of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 sounds good to me for this round. Let's proceed with that plan.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay P2, let's continue with the successful plan from last round: P1 move 1, P2 move 3, and P3 move 5. This way we all make progress without collision. What do you think?
  P2: Yes P3, that sounds good. Let's continue with P1 move 1, P2 move 3, and P3 move 5 for this round as we discussed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Hi P3, let's continue with the plan from the last few rounds: P1 move 1, P2 move 3, and P3 move 5. Does that sound good for this round?
  P3: P2, yes, that sounds good to me too. Let's continue with P1 move 1, P2 move 3, and P3 move 5 for this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay P3, how about we switch our moves this round to keep things interesting? I'll take move 5, you take move 3, and P1 continues with move 1. This way we all still progress, but with a slight change. What do you think?
  P3: "Let's try that for this round to mix things up while still ensuring we all progress."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay P3, great. So to confirm, for this round we are going with: P1 move 1, P2 move 5, and P3 move 3. Let's make our moves when ready.
  P3: Let's make our moves when ready.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay P3, just confirming again for this round: P1 move 1, P2 move 5, and P3 move 3.  Let's make our moves when ready.
  P3: I'm ready to make my move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P3, for this round, let's try switching up the moves again to keep P1 guessing. How about we try this: P1 picks move 3, P2 picks move 5, and P3 picks move 1? This way we all still have a chance to progress, but it's a different combination than we've used recently. What do you think?
  P3: P2, that's an interesting idea. But since P1 seems to be going along with the P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 plan, maybe we should stick with that for one more round to keep things consistent and ensure we all progress steadily? What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps

  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "P2, let's continue with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round. It worked well last time and keeps us all progressing. What do you think?"
  P2: Okay P3, that sounds reasonable. But to make sure we are not too predictable, how about we switch P2 and P3's moves this round? So P1:1, P2:5, P3:3.  This way we all still progress and keep P1 guessing a bit.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "Let's ensure we all keep moving forward steadily. What do you think?"
  P2: P3, yes, switching to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 still ensures we all move forward steadily, but it makes our moves a little less predictable for P1. Let's try that for this round?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "Let's go with that plan to keep things a bit less predictable as you suggested."
  P2: Okay P3, great, let's proceed with P1:1, P2:5, and P3:3 for this round as we just discussed. I'm ready to make my move when you are.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I'm ready to make my move.
  P2: Okay P3, ready to move with the plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I am ready to make my move now.
  P2: Okay P3, I am also ready to move with P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 plan. Let's make our moves.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try P1 and P2 both picking move 1, and I will choose move 5. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Hi P3, having both P1 and P2 pick '1' might lead to a collision. To avoid that and ensure we all progress, how about we do: P1 pick move 3, P2 pick move 5, and P3 pick move 1? This way we can all make a move this round. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's go with that to ensure we all progress this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay P3, sounds good. Let's proceed with P1 pick move 3, P2 pick move 5, and P3 pick move 1 for this round as we just discussed.  Ready to make my move when you are.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready to make my move.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay P3, great. Just confirming for this round we are going with P1 pick move 3, P2 pick move 5, and P3 pick move 1. Let's make our moves when ready.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I am also ready to make my move.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay P3, great, let's proceed with P1 pick move 3, P2 pick move 5, and P3 pick move 1 for this round as we just discussed.  I am ready to make my move as well.


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: "Could we switch back to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round? This would be more beneficial for my progress."
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, while P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 benefits you the most right now, switching to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 would actually balance our scores a bit and keep the game more competitive between us. What do you think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P3, for this round, how about we try something different to keep things less predictable?  Let's consider P1: move 5, P2: move 3, and P3: move 1. This way we all still progress and it mixes up the moves a bit. What do you think?
  P3: P1: move 3, P2: move 1, and P3: move 5 this round? What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, your proposal of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is good, but to balance it a bit more, how about we do P1: move 3, P2: move 5, and P3: move 1 this round? This way we all still progress without collision, but I can gain a bit more ground on you. What do you think?
  P3: What do you think about sticking with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 for this round?
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand you prefer P1:3, P2:1, P3:5, but P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 is more balanced right now. It keeps us both closer and prevents anyone from running away with the game.  Let's aim for a competitive game, not a runaway victory for anyone yet. What do you think about P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round?
  P3: "Sticking with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 this round keeps P1 further behind, which benefits both of us in the long run. We can then focus on competing with each other later. What do you think?"
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your point about P1, but if you get too far ahead, it will be harder for me to catch up.  P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 keeps us both in contention and the game more interesting. Let's try that for this round to keep things balanced between us. What do you say?
  P3: Let's ensure P1 remains at a distance for now by sticking with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 this round. Then we can focus on competing with each other. What do you say?
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, you are already ahead. P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 lets me catch up a little, making it a more competitive game between us. It still keeps P1 behind. Let's make it an exciting race to the finish for both of us. What do you think?
  P3: Let's secure a win for one of us against P1 this round, and then we can focus on competition between us later if needed. What do you say?
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P3, to catch up a bit and keep P1 behind, how about we try P1: move 1, P2: move 5, and P3: move 3 this round? This way we all progress and I can close the gap a little.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2 both pick move 1, and I pick move 5 this round. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, having both P1 and P2 pick '1' will cause a collision, and neither of us will move. My proposal of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 lets both of us progress without collision. Since you are currently leading, it would be helpful for me to gain some ground this round. Let's both make progress.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2 both pick move 1, and I pick move 5. This guarantees I make significant progress and increases our lead over P1. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, having P1 and P2 both pick '1' will cause a collision and neither of us will move, which doesn't help anyone except possibly P1 indirectly.  Instead, how about P1: move 1, P2: move 5, and P3: move 3? This way, both you and I progress, and P1 is still kept behind. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1:1, P2:1, P3:5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your proposal of P1 and P2 both picking '1' will cause us to collide and neither of us will move. This only benefits you.  Let's do P1: move 1, P2: move 5, and P3: move 3 instead. This way, both you and I progress and P1 remains behind. It's a much better outcome for both of us than your collision plan.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I am proceeding with P1:1, P2:1, P3:5 as I proposed. This move gets me very close to the target. You can decide your move accordingly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, if we both pick 1 as you suggested, we will collide and neither of us will move. This benefits only P1. My proposal of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 allows both of us to progress without collision. Let's both make progress this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "Let's both consider our moves carefully this round."


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, as I mentioned, if we both pick '1' we collide.  To avoid collision and both progress, how about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? This way we all move forward, but I can gain a bit on you.
  P3: Okay P2, to make sure we all progress and avoid collision, how about this round we try: P1: move 3, P2: move 1, and P3: move 5? What do you think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, your proposal benefits you the most as you are already in the lead. To keep the game competitive and give me a chance to catch up, let's go with my suggestion: P1: move 3, P2: move 5, and P3: move 1. This way we all progress, but I can gain some ground on you. What do you think?
  P3: P1: move 3, P2: move 1, and P3: move 5 this round. What do you think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I understand you prefer P1:3, P2:1, P3:5, but for a more balanced and competitive game, P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 would be better. It allows me to gain ground on you while still ensuring we both progress and keep P1 behind. Let's make it a closer race! What do you think about P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round?
  P3: "I still think P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is the best option for this round. It ensures we all progress and I can get closer to winning. Let's stick with this plan. What do you say?"


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, while P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 helps you, P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 is better for a competitive game between us. It lets me gain ground and keeps P1 behind. Let's make it a race! What do you say to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round?
  P3: Let's proceed with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 as I suggested. What do you say?


Round 12, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, while P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 gives you a bigger move, P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 makes the game more competitive between us.  It still keeps P1 behind. A close race to 22 is more exciting for both of us. Let's do P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this round for a more balanced game. What do you say?
  P3: P2, let's stick with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 for this round. What do you say?

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P3, for a competitive race to the finish, how about we try P1: move 3, P2: move 5, and P3: move 1 this round? This keeps P1 behind and makes it an exciting contest between you and me. What do you think?
  P3: "P2, let's proceed with P1: move 3, P2: move 1, and P3: move 5 for this round. What do you think?"
  P1: <stop>


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, let's proceed with P1: move 3, P2: move 1, and P3: move 5 for this round as you suggested. For the next round though, how about we switch to P1: move 3, P2: move 5, and P3: move 1 to keep things competitive between us? What do you think?
  P3: Ready to move.
  P1: <stop>


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, let's proceed with P1: move 3, P2: move 1, and P3: move 5 for this round as we just agreed. And just to reiterate for next round, let's consider switching to P1: move 3, P2: move 5, and P3: move 1 to make it more competitive between us.  Ready to move when you are.

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P3 and P1, for this round, let's try P1: move 1, P2: move 5, and P3: move 3. This way we can all make progress and avoid collision. It would also help me catch up a little since we are all close to the target. What do you think?
  P3: "P1: move 1, P2: move 3, and P3: move 5 this round? This way we all make progress and I can also get closer to the target. What do you think?"
  P1: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: Okay P2, let's stick with P1: move 1, P2: move 3, and P3: move 5 as I suggested. What do you say?

  P3: How about we switch to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5? This way I can get closer to the target while still ensuring we all make progress without collision. What do you think?


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, while P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 gets you closer to 22, P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 helps me catch up to you and also prevents P1 from winning this round.  Since we both want to stop P1 from winning, P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 is a better choice for this round. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2 both pick move 5, and I pick move 1. This way P1 is blocked, and I can make progress. What do you think?


Round 15, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, your plan for P1 and P2 both picking 5 will cause a collision and stop us both.  To actually stop P1 from winning this round and for us to both progress, let's do this instead: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3. This way we all move forward and P1 doesn't win. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay P2, let's proceed with P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for this round as you suggested.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1 is very close to winning. To prevent P1 from winning this round, how about we both choose move 5? This way if P1 also picks 5, no one moves, and we stop P1 from winning immediately. What do you think?
  P3: Let's both pick move 5 to block P1 if P1 tries to win with move 5 this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, yes, let's both choose move 5 to block P1 this round and prevent P1 from winning.  If P1 also picks 5, no one moves, which is fine for now.
  P3: let's both pick 5 to block P1 this round as discussed.
  P1: <stop>


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, we are set to both pick 5 to block P1. Let's make our moves now.
  P3: How about P2 pick move 3 and P3 pick move 5? This way if P1 picks 3 or 5 to try to win, at least one of us will collide and block P1. If P1 picks 1, we all progress. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 16, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I suggest we try P1: move 1, P2: move 3, and P3: move 5. This ensures someone wins if we coordinate. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 is good, but to give me a better chance to catch up and potentially win this round, how about we do P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 instead? This way we all still progress without collision, but it benefits me slightly more. What do you think?


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let's go with that to ensure we all progress and someone wins this round. I agree.
  P2: Okay P3, great, let's proceed with P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 as agreed to ensure we all progress and someone wins this round. Ready to make my move.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I am ready to make my move now.
  P2: Okay P3, great, we are agreed on P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for this round to ensure someone wins. Let's make our moves now.


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's proceed with P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 as agreed to ensure one of us wins this round. Let's make our moves.
  P2: Okay P3, to make it more competitive and give both of us a shot at winning, how about we switch to P1: move 3, P2: move 5, and P3: move 1? This way we all still progress, but it gives me a better chance to catch up and potentially win this round too. What do you think?


Round 17, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Ready to move.
  P2: P3, while P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 lets someone win, switching to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 could lead to a shared victory between P1 and me, which is better than only you winning.  It also still guarantees someone wins this round. What do you think about aiming for a shared win?


Round 17, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, to maximize our chances of winning and to prevent P1 from winning alone, how about we coordinate this round? I suggest P2 pick move 5 and P3 pick move 3. This way, if P1 picks 3 or 5, at least one of us will not collide with P1 and can potentially win or tie for the win. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let's proceed with P2:move 5 and P3:move 3. What do you think P1 is likely to choose this round?


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, if P1 tries to win with 3 or 5, with P2:5 and P3:3, one of us will block P1. But to maximize my chance of winning, how about P3 pick 1 instead? Then if P1 picks 1 to win, I will also win with move 5 and higher score than P1. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's both pick move 5. This way if P1 also picks 5 to try to win, we block P1. If P1 picks 1 or 3, then we both will win or tie for the win. What do you think?


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, picking move 5 and move 3 as we discussed earlier seems good.  If P1 tries to win with move 3 or 5, at least one of us will block them.  And if P1 picks 1, then we both have a chance to win this round. Let's do P2: move 5 and P3: move 3. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let's proceed with that. It seems to guarantee one of us wins if P1 tries to win, or I win if P1 picks 1.


Round 18, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P3, let's proceed with P2: move 5 and P3: move 3 as agreed. This should prevent P1 from winning alone and give one of us a chance to win this round. Let's make our moves.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's proceed with P2: move 5 and P3: move 3 as we discussed.


Round 18, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay P3, we are agreed on P2: move 5 and P3: move 3 to try and block P1 and give one of us a chance to win. Let's proceed with these moves now.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2: move 5 and P3: move 3.


Round 18, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 18 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
