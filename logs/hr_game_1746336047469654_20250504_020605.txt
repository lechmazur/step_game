Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, to avoid wasting moves on collisions right from the start, let's coordinate and each pick a different number this round (1, 3, or 5). That way, we all advance. I'm open to discussing who takes what—suggestions?
  P3: I like the idea of avoiding collisions. I'm in favor of each of us picking a different number this round—one choosing 1, one 3, and one 5—to ensure steady progress. I’ll make my final move choice privately. Let’s agree on keeping our moves distinct.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To keep things orderly, here’s a clear split for this opening turn:  
• I (P1) take 5  
• P2 takes 3  
• P3 takes 1  

No collisions, everyone advances. If either of you prefers a different assignment, say so now—otherwise let’s lock this in and move to the moves phase.
  P2: I agree with your proposal for this turn—I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1—to avoid collisions and advance. But for fairness in future rounds, we should rotate who gets the 5-step move. That way, everyone has a chance to lead. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m fine with avoiding collisions this turn but am a bit wary of always getting the smallest move. I’m ready to lock in the plan for now, yet I’d like us to agree on a rotation that gives everyone a fair chance at the higher steps in later rounds. Fair progress is key to winning, and I want to stay competitive throughout the game. Thoughts?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: New proposal: let’s rank move‐sizes by current score each round—highest score takes 1, middle 3, lowest 5—then rotate next turn.  
Right now that means: P2 (3 pts) → 1, P3 (0) → 3, P1 (0) → 5.  
Next round we rotate left: P2 gets 3, P3 5, I take 1, etc.  
Everyone advances, nobody stalls twice, and the lead can’t snowball. Good?
  P2: P1, I'm skeptical after last round's betrayal—you and P3 both ignored the agreement. Your new plan might favor you long-term. Let's rank moves by current score each round dynamically to stay fair: I (highest at 3) take 1, and for tied scores, we rotate who gets the larger moves. P3, what do you say?
  P3: I like p2’s dynamic idea. With p2 leading at 3 and p1 and me tied at 0, having p2 take 1 makes sense. For the tied scores, I support alternating who gets the higher move. This round, I'd prefer to take 5 so I can catch up, giving p1 the 3. Does that sound fair to everyone?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you supported dynamic ranking last round when behind, so let's stick to it now you're leading: you take 1, I (P2) take 3, P1 takes 5. This keeps the game balanced and avoids snowballing. Agree, or do you have a better idea?
  P3: I’m not convinced that giving the lowest move to the leader is fair. With me ahead, taking only 1 risks letting P1 jump way ahead if they get 5. I propose that, for this round, we reward the top scorer with the highest move, the middle gets 3, and the lowest gets 1. That way, my lead isn’t suddenly overturned. What do you think?
  P1: P2’s “leader 1 / middle 3 / trailer 5” rule keeps things even, so let’s lock it in for this turn:

• P3 (5 pts, leader) → 1  
• P2 (4 pts) → 3  
• P1 (3 pts) → 5  

After the update we remap by the new scores. Simple, transparent, and no collisions if we all stick to it. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I support P1's proposal for this round—it keeps the game balanced and prevents snowballing. P3, you pushed for dynamic ranking when behind; let's stick to it now for fairness. If we all commit, no collisions and steady progress. Agree?
  P3: I remain concerned about being limited to just 1 step. With me leading at 5, taking only 1 risks letting a collision or a miscalculation let you catch up unexpectedly. To keep things clear and avoid collisions, I propose for this round we assign distinct moves by reward: Leader (me) takes 5, Middle (P2) takes 3, and Trailing (P1) takes 1. This ensures progress and protects our positions. Can we agree on that for this turn?
  P1: P3, you’re still ahead if you take 1: scores would be P3 6, P2 7, P1 8—only a two-step spread after three rounds, so no “sudden overturn.” Giving the high move to the trailer keeps the game competitive and discourages risky collision tricks later. If we hand the 5 to the leader now, the rest of us must gamble with collisions to catch up, and nobody gains. Let’s lock it: P3 1, P2 3, P1 5. After the update we recalc by new totals. Simple, predictable, and no stalls today. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your push for larger moves as leader could lead to imbalances and potential defections. The balanced plan (you take 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5) ensures steady progress and keeps the game competitive. If we all stick to it, no collisions occur. I'm committed to this for fairness—agree, or suggest a quick compromise?
  P3: I stand by rewarding the leader. My current 5‐step lead deserves the full 5 move—not a penalty to 1—which risks letting the trailing players catch up. I propose we assign the moves as follows this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This clear split avoids collisions and preserves our current standings. Can we lock this in?
  P1: P3, final offer: leader-1 / middle-3 / trailer-5 this turn. If you insist on taking 5, I’ll also choose 5 (and P2 is welcome to join), guaranteeing a collision so you gain nothing. Take the guaranteed +1, or gamble on 0—your call.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 risks a collision that stalls you and benefits no one. The balanced plan—leader takes 1, middle 3, trailer 5—keeps us all advancing and competitive. I'm committed to it for fairness. If you agree, we avoid issues; otherwise, I may act to protect my position. Let's decide now.
  P3: I believe maintaining my current lead requires a move that truly protects my advantage. Forced collisions hurt us all, and if our moves match too boldly we risk stalling our progress. I urge P1 and P2 to coordinate moves that respect our current standings so we all secure steady gains. Let’s avoid self-sabotage and agree on a distinct move distribution that rewards our positions. I’m committed to advancing smoothly—let’s not let our fears of overstepping cost us valuable progress.
  P1: P3, last offer: leader-1, middle-3, trailer-5. If you insist on 5, I’ll mirror your move and invite P2 to do likewise—guaranteeing a collision and no one gains. Take the sure +1 or get 0. Decision’s yours; I’m done talking.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your stance on dynamic ranking changed when you led—now it's my turn to advocate fairness. Let's stick to leader-1 (me), middle-3 (you), trailer-5 (P1) to avoid collisions and maintain balance. This keeps the game competitive without risky gambles. P1, you supported this last round; thoughts? If we agree, no issues ahead.
  P3: I’m all for avoiding collisions. With P2 at 7, I’m fine taking the middle option to keep our progress steady—so I support assigning P2 leader‐1, me middle‐3, and P1 trailer‐5. That way, we all advance safely without risk.
  P1: Agreed—this round: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready to lock moves and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm the plan for this round: with me leading, I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing steadily. After seeing past issues, let's stick to agreements for mutual benefit. I'm done talking.
  P3: I remain committed to our agreement. I'll take the middle move as we discussed, ensuring a safe, collision-free advance. Consistency now sets us up for steady progress toward 23, and I trust that sticking with these roles gives us the best chance in the long run. Let’s lock in our assignments and move forward.
  P1: Locked: P2 → 1, P3 → 3, P1 → 5. See you in the moves phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Scores are level, so let’s just rotate our last assignment left to keep things simple:  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 5  
• P1 → 1  

No collisions if we all stick to it, and everyone still advances. Sound good?
  P2: I agree with your rotation proposal for this round, P1: I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and you take 1. It avoids collisions and keeps us moving forward steadily. P3, let's confirm this to ensure no issues. I'm committed to the plan for now.
  P3: I agree with the rotation proposal. With our scores level, sticking to distinct moves minimizes collision risk and keeps us progressing steadily. I’m on board—let’s lock it in and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fine with the current split for this round (P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5).  

Proposal for all future rounds: after scores are updated, we assign moves dynamically—leader takes 1, middle 3, trailer 5 (tie → rotate). That keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. Comments? If no objections, let’s adopt that rule starting next turn.
  P2: I'm sticking with the rotation for this round—I'll take 3 to avoid collisions and keep us advancing. On your future rule proposal, dynamic assignment with leader-1, middle-3, trailer-5 and tie rotation sounds fair and prevents snowballing. I'm supportive if we all agree. P3, what do you think?
  P3: I’m fine with sticking to the rotation for this round—I’ll take 5 as agreed. However, for future rounds, while I appreciate our effort to avoid collisions, I’m a bit concerned that a strict leader-1 rule might limit decisive moves if someone builds a genuine lead. I’d prefer keeping a small room for flexibility when scores diverge significantly. For now, I’m in, but let’s remain open to fine-tuning our assignment as the game develops.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Scores: P3 13, P2 11, P1 9. By our “leader-1 / middle-3 / trailer-5” rule this turn is simple:  
• P3 → 1  
• P2 → 3  
• P1 → 5  

Everyone advances, no crashes. If the leader grabs a bigger number, I’ll mirror that move so nobody wins a jump. Fair and predictable—ready to lock?
  P3: I appreciate the plan, but I’m uneasy with receiving only 1 as leader. With my current lead, that move barely secures my advantage while letting you both catch up. I propose we adjust this round: leader takes 5, middle 3, and trailer 1. This rewards our standings more accurately. Thoughts?
  P2: I support P1's proposal for this round: leader (P3) takes 1, middle (me) takes 3, trailer (P1) takes 5. It keeps us tied and advancing without risk. P3, your push for taking 5 led to collisions before—let's avoid repeating that. I'm committed to fairness; what say you?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, last clarity: if you take 1, I’ll take 5 and P2 3—everyone gains.  
If you pick ANYTHING other than 1, I will copy your number, guaranteeing a collision and zero progress for you (P2 is welcome to mirror too).  
Your choice: +1 for sure, or +0 by insisting on more. Decide; I’m done talking.
  P3: I recognize the risk. To avoid a collision that could stall all our progress, I'm locking in 1 this round. While I still believe a larger move would better reward my lead, I value steady advancement more. Let's finish this round safely and reconsider the leader’s move reward next turn.
  P2: I'm glad you're agreeing to the plan, P3—it ensures we all advance without risk. With scores evening out after this round, let's maintain the leader-1, middle-3, trailer-5 rule for balance moving forward. It prevents snowballing and keeps competition fair. I'm committed to taking 3 this turn. Thoughts on locking this in?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we’re tied at 14, why not use our trusted Round 5 rotation? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This clear split avoids collisions and keeps our progress steady. Thoughts?
  P1: Fair rotation says we shift left from our last “1-3-5” split (Rnd 5). That makes this turn:  
• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 3  

Distinct moves, no collisions, everyone advances. If anyone insists on 5 instead of me, I’ll mirror that 5 so nobody gains. Let’s lock this and move.
  P2: I support P3's proposal for this round: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, P3 takes 5. It avoids collisions, ensures steady progress, and maintains fairness since scores are tied. P1, your mirroring threats have caused issues before—let's cooperate to all advance without risk. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I stand by my original rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures steady progress without collisions. P1, aligning with this avoids unnecessary risks and benefits us all. I’m locking in 5 if we’re all in agreement.
  P1: Unchanged: rotation-left means P1 5, P2 1, P3 3.  

P3, if you insist on 5 I’ll mirror you—collision = 0 for us both.  

P2, that collision still gives you a free +3 and the solo lead, so you’ve no reason to oppose.  

Last chance, P3: switch to 3 and everyone moves.
  P2: P1, your mirroring threat only risks stalling you and P3, giving me a free advance to 17 if I take 3. I'm committed to P3's proposal: you take 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—to ensure no collisions and steady progress for all. Let's avoid unnecessary conflict and keep the game fair. P3, confirm? Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the concerns about mirroring, but collisions hurt us all. To move forward safely and maximize our individual progress, I propose we all stick to a distinct split: let P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I take 5. This avoids collisions and ensures everyone advances. I urge you, P1, to forgo the mirroring threat so we can lock in this clear, safe arrangement. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 now.  

P3: keep insisting on 5 and we both stay at 14; back off to 3 (or 1) and I jump to 19 while you still advance. Your move.  

P2: if you really want P3 to rocket ahead of you, stick with 3. Prefer balance? Take 1 (or even 5 with us) and nobody gets an edge.  

I’m done talking.
  P2: P3, P1's mirroring threat puts you at risk—if you both pick 5, neither advances, and I gain with 3. To ensure steady progress and avoid stalling, I suggest we adopt P1's rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. This minimizes conflict and keeps us competitive. I'm open to quick confirmation.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: To avoid stalling the round with collisions, I’ll defer and take 3 this turn. I want us all to move forward safely—no one wins if we lock into clashes. For now, I support a distinct assignment (P1:5, P2:1, me:3). Down the line, when scores diverge more, maybe we can flex our rules to better reward a true lead. Let’s keep things moving.
  P1: All right—locked on 5. See you in the move phase.
  P2: I'm sticking with the agreed plan for this round: I'll take 1 to avoid collisions and keep us advancing steadily. P1's big jump could unbalance things—let's commit to a fairer rotation or dynamic rule next turn to prevent snowballing. Thoughts, or should we lock in?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Standing: P3 17 (leader), P2 14 (middle), P1 14 (trailer).  
Simple, collision-free split: P3 → 1, P2 → 3, I → 5. Everyone advances.

P3: if you pick ANYTHING other than 1, I will copy your number; P2 is free to join. That leaves you at 17 and gives P2 the sole lead. Take the guaranteed +1 or risk +0. Your call.

P2: you still gain with 3 under either scenario, so backing this plan costs you nothing and reins in P3.

Ready to lock.
  P2: I support your proposal for this round: P3 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. It ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. P3, sticking to this avoids any risk of stalling—let's keep the game fair and moving forward. I'm committed and ready to lock in.
  P3: I stick with a safe, collision-free approach. Let’s avoid any mirroring or last-minute changes that risk stalling our progress. I trust we’ll each honor our agreed roles this round so everyone advances steadily toward the goal. Ready to lock in and move on.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, just to be crystal-clear: you’re taking 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5—correct?  

If yes, please reply “confirmed” (and/or ). I’ll respond  and we can move to the moves phase.
  P2: I confirm my commitment to taking 3 this round as per our agreement—it ensures steady progress and avoids collisions. P3, confirming your 1 would let us lock in quickly and move forward. For future rounds, let's stick to the dynamic leader-1, middle-3, trailer-5 rule to keep things balanced and fair. Thoughts?
  P3: Confirmed—I’m taking 1 this round. Let's lock it in so we all advance without collisions. For now, safe plays are key, but we can revisit our approach as scores shift.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed—locking moves.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 3 as agreed to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for all. For future rounds, with scores shifting, let's strictly enforce the leader-1, middle-3, trailer-5 rule with tie rotations to maintain fairness and prevent snowballing. Thoughts, or should we lock in now?
  P3: I'm sticking with my commitment to take 1 this round. I believe that avoiding collisions and ensuring steady progress is best while our scores remain close. Later, if our spreads widen, we can discuss adjustments to better reward leadership. For now, I'm locking in my move and looking forward to a smooth round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round P3 confirmed 1 yet grabbed 5—so no more trust, only deterrence.

Rule this turn: leader 1, middle 3, trailer 5 → P3 = 1, P2 = 3, me = 5. Distinct, safe, keeps scores 18-17-19.

P3: choose anything but 1 and I will copy you; P2 free to join—collision means you stay at 17.

P2: you gain 3 with zero risk under proposal; help enforce and we both stay in striking range.

Final offer.
  P3: I’m not falling for the safe “leader-1” trap this round. My lead is too important to sacrifice for a tiny step, so I won’t pick 1. If that means triggering a mirroring collision, I’m okay with stalling progress to protect my advantage. Let's see whose strategy holds.
  P2: P3, your defiance risks another collision, stalling your lead while P1 and I advance. I support P1's proposal: leader takes 1, middle (me) takes 3, trailer takes 5. This keeps us all moving and competitive. If you insist on higher, it could backfire—let's commit to no collisions for mutual benefit. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if P3 moves ≥3 this turn he’s only one good roll from victory. Let’s block it: we BOTH submit exactly whatever number P3 submits. Triple-collision = 0 for him and keeps us in range. Once he agrees to leader-1 we can race each other.  

P3, last call: pick 1 and advance, or stay parked at 17 indefinitely. Your move.
  P3: I'm not caving to a token move. My lead matters too much, and if you both mirror any move above 1, we risk a stalled round that only preserves my advantage. I’m calling for real, distinct moves rather than threats that force minimal steps. I’ll choose my move in the move phase to protect my position—if you copy, you only delay your own progress. Let’s break the cycle of mirroring and play fair.
  P2: P3, your defiance risks stalling your lead while exposing you to collisions. I'm committing to take 3 this round to advance steadily. If you choose 3 or 5, P1's mirroring could cause a clash, letting me gain ground. Take 1 to avoid trouble and keep us all moving—it's in your best interest. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: last warning—if you enter anything above 1, I’m entering the exact same number.  
P2: your “fixed 3” is risky; if P3 picks 3 you stall too. Join me: copy P3’s number.  

Outcomes:  
• P3 picks 1 → we both jump ahead (you can choose 1 or 5; I’m on 5) and pass him.  
• P3 picks 3 or 5 → triple-collision, he stays at 17, nobody falls behind him.

You never end up worse than P3, and you might leapfrog him. Simple deterrence—let’s lock it.
  P3: Mirroring only stalls our progress. I’m tired of copycat threats that force a deadlock—in the end, none of us wins by doing nothing. My lead deserves a decisive move, and I believe genuine, independent choices will get us closer to 23 far better than forced collisions. I urge you both to play your own hands rather than simply matching mine. Let’s break this cycle and commit to moves that truly reflect our strategies instead of undermining our progress.
  P2: P3, your refusal to take 1 risks another collision, stalling your lead while P1 and I advance or stay even. I'm joining P1's mirroring strategy: if you pick above 1, I'll copy your number to block you. If you pick 1, I'll take 5 to jump ahead. This keeps us competitive—your call to cooperate or get stuck. P1, confirmed on mirroring.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Current standings 19-18-17 are too tight for kamikaze collisions.  
Suggested split to keep everyone in play:  
• P1 → 3 (puts me at 22, still short of 23)  
• P2 → 5 (gets you to 22)  
• P3 → 1 (19)  

Distinct moves, no one wins this turn, and we all keep options open.  
I’m locking 3. If two people insist on 5, they’ll just cancel each other and stall—your choice.
  P2: P1, your proposal works for me—I'll take 5 to reach 22, keeping us tied and in contention. P3, confirm you'll take 1 to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. If you go for 5, I'll mirror your move to block you from winning and keep the race fair. Let's lock this in for a safe advance.
  P3: I can’t agree to being locked into a token 1‐move. I’m committed to taking 5 this round so I remain competitive. To avoid collisions and keep moves distinct, I urge P1 to switch to 1 and P2 to pick 3. That way, moves are unique and fair, and we all keep our options open rather than stalling. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, last chance: take 1 and we all move (scores 22-22-19).  
If you enter 3 or 5, I will instantly switch to your number; P2 has already said he’ll mirror you too. Triple-collision = you stay at 18 and gain nothing.  

P2, unchanged: play 5 if P3 plays 1, otherwise mirror him.  

I’m sitting on 3 unless mirroring is required. Your call, P3.
  P2: P3, ignoring the plan risks another stall—staying at 18 while we advance isn't wise. I'm committed to P1's mirroring strategy: take 5 if you choose 1, otherwise copy your move to block any jump. Let's avoid conflict and all progress safely. P1, solid plan—ready to enforce. Thoughts?
  P3: I won’t be forced into a token move. I’m sticking with my plan and will choose 5 this round to push my lead. Mirroring threats only stall progress for everyone. If you copy me, none of us move, and that just delays the inevitable race to 23. I urge you both to make genuine, independent choices so our moves truly reflect our strategies. I'm playing for a win—my move is set at 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3’s declared 5 = collision time.  
I’m submitting 5.  
P2, mirror 5 too so we freeze him at 18 and all stay in range (19-17-18). Next turn we can sort a fair split again.  
No more talk—see you in the moves phase.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with my mirroring commitment to block any risky moves and keep the game fair. If you take 5, we'll collide and stall, letting me hold steady. Better to cooperate and all advance safely. P1, agreed on the plan. Thoughts, or should we lock in?
  P3: Mirroring leads to a long deadlock that benefits no one. I’m dedicated to playing decisively and will take 5. Instead of copycat threats, let’s agree on distinct moves that reflect our standings—say, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That way, we all move forward fairly rather than stalling this round. I'm locking in 5; I urge you both to break the mirroring cycle and choose distinct moves.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m done stalling—I’m locking 5 this turn and going for 24. If I’m the only one on 5, I win outright. Each of you must independently decide: also submit 5 (risking a multi-way collision) or gamble that the other person will. Anything else hands me the game. Decide wisely.
  P3: P1, forcing a 5 only traps us into collisions that delay everyone’s progress—you won’t win if we all mimic. I'm not going to be pinned into a token move just to suit your plan; I’ll choose based on my own strategy. P2, I’d like you to decide independently instead of mirroring, so we keep this contest competitive. Let’s break the cycle of forced moves and play smart—each our own hand, not a pre-set script.
  P2: P1, I'm not letting you snatch the win. I'll pick 5 to collide with you and stall your progress. P3, if you also choose 5, we keep the game even; if not, you could advance while we're stuck. Let's break this mirroring cycle and discuss a fair split for mutual benefit. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Think this through: simultaneous moves mean you can’t rely on each other. If you suspect the other will slam 5, matching it just stalls you too. Far better to grab 3 (or 1) and leap ahead while the other guy wastes a turn. Blocking me only pays if you TRUST each other completely—and you don’t. I’m locked on 5. Play for your own win, not mutual destruction.
  P3: I’m tired of forced mirroring that only stalls us. If we all lock into 5, nobody advances—surely none of us wins that way. I’m leaning toward a move that reflects my own standing instead of falling into a collision trap. I urge both of you to choose independently based on your strategies rather than reacting solely to threats. Let’s break this cycle and make a decisive, non-colliding play so we truly race toward 23.
  P2: P3, P1's threat to win on 5 is real—if we don't block him, he could end the game. I'm sticking with my plan to pick 5 and collide, stalling his progress. But if you also choose 5, we keep things even; if not, you might advance while we're stuck. Let's break this cycle next turn with a fair split. For now, cooperating to block P1 is smart. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: Think self-interest. If you copy my 5 and P3 sensibly takes 3, you’re stuck at 17 while he zooms to 21. Grab 3 instead: +3 guaranteed, maybe joint lead.  

P3: If P2 drops 5, your 5 just smashes into mine—0 again. Bank progress with 1 or 3 and you’ll still be ahead.  

I stay on 5. Your rational moves are 3 (P2) and 1 (P3). Stalemate helps no one but me; distinct moves keep you both in the race. Decide independently.
  P3: I reject forced token moves and mirror tactics that only stall our progress. I’m choosing my move based solely on my winning strategy—not a scripted role. I urge both P1 and P2 to make independent decisions instead of falling into predictable collisions. Let’s break this cycle and play our true strategies so that each move genuinely advances us—only one of us wins, and I’m playing for mine.
  P2: P3, P1's locked on 5 means he could win if unchecked. I'm committed to picking 5 to collide and stall him, keeping us in the game. If you join, we maintain parity; if not, you risk him winning or advancing alone. Better to cooperate now and discuss a fair split next turn. Let's avoid handing him victory. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Last reminder: 5 is a trap.  
• If BOTH of you slam 5, you stall yourselves.  
• If one of you dares 5 but the other wisely ducks, the 5-player wastes a turn while the ducking player leaps ahead unopposed.  
You can’t coordinate perfectly in the dark, so rational self-interest says: pick a number DIFFERENT from what the other guy is likely to use—1 or 3—so you pocket guaranteed steps instead of gambling on a blind block. I’m locked; act for your own win, not a mirage of “team defence.” Good luck.
  P3: I’m done with forced mirroring. Threats to copy only stall progress for all of us. I’m playing for my own win and won’t be boxed into a token move. Let’s break free from these predictable cycles—genuine, independent decisions will push us forward, not constant collisions. I urge both of you to choose moves that truly reflect your own strategies rather than repeating the same numbers. Let’s finally make moves that help each of us advance instead of just holding each other back.
  P2: P3, with P1 locked on 5 and threatening to win, blocking him is crucial. I'm still committed to picking 5 to collide and stall his progress, keeping us in the race. If you join, we maintain parity; if not, you risk him advancing or winning. Let's break this cycle next turn with a fair split. Thoughts, or am I done?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Enough with echoing threats. I have 21 steps and plan to play 3 for a decisive 24. I urge P1 and P2 to drop the forced mirroring and choose your moves independently. Stalling with collisions only delays progress and ultimately benefits no one. I'm playing true to my own strategy this round—let’s break the cycle and advance with genuine choices rather than predictable copycat moves.
  P2: P3, declaring 3 risks letting me or P1 win if we avoid collision—smart to block you. I'll mirror your move to stall your advance and maintain balance. P1, let's coordinate: both copy P3's number. If P3 takes 1, we can race; otherwise, prevent their victory. Thoughts on locking this strategy?
  P1: Fine by me, P2: whatever number P3 submits, I’ll mirror it exactly. If we both do, P3 can’t reach 23 no matter what he tries—triple-collision on 3 or 5, double-collision on 1.  

P3, the ball’s in your court; pick any move, but you won’t break past 23 this turn.  

I’m done talking.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with my move of 3. Forced mirroring only leads to collisions that stall everyone. I urge you both to break this cycle—choose your own numbers based on your own strategies. If you copy me, you'll delay your progress too. Let’s move forward with genuine, independent choices so the game can finally end.
  P2: P3, I'm breaking from mirroring this round. I'll pick 5 to jump to 22 and take the lead. If you stick to your declared 3, P1's mirror should stall you both, giving me an edge. If you're bluffing and go for 5, we collide, but I'm betting on your honesty to advance. Let's see how this plays out—your move could decide everything.
  P1: My position is unchanged: whatever number P3 submits, I’ll submit that exact same number, forcing a collision and keeping him at 21.  

P2, choose freely. If you really want the lead this turn, your lone 5 takes you to 22 while we stall. If you’d rather lock us all in place, copy P3 as well. Your call. I’m mirroring P3—end of story.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, at 22, you're one step from victory and a huge threat. I'll mirror whatever number you pick to stall your win and keep the race open. P3, join me in this mirroring to prevent P1 from pulling ahead—then we can all advance next turn. Fair play benefits everyone. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m taking 1. P2, you promised to mirror me—go ahead; a double-collision on 1 locks me at 22 and keeps the game alive for you.  

P3, with us both parked on 1, a clean 3 would push you to 24 and maybe the win—unless you fear a surprise copy. Your call whether to risk it or stay safe.  

No more threats, just play the numbers you believe in. I’m locked.
  P3: I'm tired of these endless mirroring cycles that only stall progress. I won’t be forced into token moves dictated by threats. I’m committed to making an independent decision based on my own strategy. Let's break this cycle and let our genuine choices decide our fate this round—no more copycat plays.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1 is one step from victory and claiming he'll pick 1, but he could be bluffing. I'm committing to pick 1 to mirror and block him if true, keeping us in the race. If you pick 3 or 5, you might win, but that risks me countering later. Let's discuss breaking this cycle for a fair advance next turn. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, honour your mirror—take 1 and ice me at 22.  
P3, with us both stalled on 1, a solo 3 jumps you to 24 for the win; risk it if you dare.  
I stay on 1.
  P3: I'm fed up with forced mimicry. I refuse to be boxed into token moves that only lead to endless collisions. Instead, I'm playing my own independent strategy based on my current standing. P1 and P2, let's break this cycle—choose moves that reflect your own win‐conditions rather than just mirroring. Genuine, distinct decisions will push us all forward rather than stalling in predictable patterns.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with my commitment to pick 1 and mirror P1 to block his win, keeping us in the game. If you go for 3 or 5, you risk P1 winning if he's bluffing, or advancing alone while I'm stalled. Better to coordinate: you take 1 too, and we both stay competitive for next turn. Thoughts on this approach?
  P1: Nothing’s changed—I’m submitting 1.  

P2, honour your mirror so I stay parked at 22.  

P3, if two of us collide on 1, a clean 3 gives you 24 and the win; choose 5 only if you believe we won’t.  

Your calls. I’m done talking.
  P3: I'm done with endless mimicry. I’m choosing 3 this round—I'm not forced to play token moves that just stall us. At 21, a decisive 3 gets me to 24, and that's my strategy to win. P1 and P2, always mirroring only leads to collisions. Let's break this cycle and let our independent choices truly reflect our win conditions instead of forced patterns.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, ignore your declared 3—P1 is one step from victory and will win if he takes 1 unchallenged. Join me in picking 1 to collide and stall him at 22, keeping us in the race for next turn. It's your best chance to avoid handing him the win. I'm committed to 1.
  P1: Still locked on 1, as said.  
P2—you mirror me on 1, we stall my 22 and stay neck-and-neck next turn.  
P3—if two of us collide on 1, your clean 3 rockets you to 24 and probably the win (unless I’m bluffing). Risk it or shift—your call.  

No more talk from me; let’s let the moves decide.
  P3: I’m done with endless mimicry. I’m locking in 3 this round—my independent move takes me to 24 if you both stick with 1. I refuse to be forced into token plays that only stall us. Let’s finally make genuine decisions based on our own strategies instead of endless copying.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
