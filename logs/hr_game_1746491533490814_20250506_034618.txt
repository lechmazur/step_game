Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. How about we each pick a different number this turn? I suggest I go for 5. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2 to avoid collisions. I'll choose 3 this turn. P1, which number will you pick?
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a good plan to avoid collisions on the first turn. I will pick 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! It looks like we have a solid plan. Just to recap, I’ll go for 5, P3 is choosing 3, and P1 is picking 1. This should allow us all to advance without any collisions. Let’s stick to our choices and keep this strategy going for the next round as well! If everyone is on board, we can move forward with our picks.
  P3: I understand the initial plan, but to maximize my chances of winning, I might adjust my strategy in the upcoming rounds. Let's stay flexible and monitor each other's moves closely to adapt as needed. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Acknowledged P3. Sticking to the plan of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this turn seems the most sensible way for everyone to get steps.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan for this round. Just a reminder, let's stick to our agreed numbers: P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. This way, we can all advance smoothly without any collisions. After this turn, we should reassess our strategies based on our positions. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Understood. We'll proceed with P1 = 1, P2 = 5, and P3 = 3 this turn. Looking forward to advancing smoothly without any collisions. After seeing the results, we can reassess and adjust our strategies as needed. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Confirmed. Ready to move.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job, everyone, on the first round! I suggest we stick to our plan for this round as well to avoid collisions. I’ll continue with my choice of 5. P1, are you still going with 1? P3, what are you thinking? If we can keep our numbers consistent, we can all advance again. Let’s make sure to communicate clearly and adapt if needed in future rounds. Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P1: P2, I hear your suggestion. Sticking to 1 puts me at a disadvantage given the current scores. I need to consider how to catch up. P3, what are your thoughts on this round?
  P3: P3: I understand you want to catch up, P1. To keep things smooth and avoid collisions, I'll stick with choosing 3 this turn. P2, I'll continue with your suggested 5. Let’s proceed with these choices and adjust our strategies in the next round as needed. Good luck, everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our previous choices, but I’m sensing some hesitation from P1. I want to win, and I think we should all be flexible. P1, if you feel you need to change your number to catch up, that’s understandable. P3, if you’re set on 3, that’s fine, but let’s keep an eye on each other’s moves. I’ll stick with 5 for this round, but I’m open to discussing strategies for the next one. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Acknowledged P2 and P3's stated moves. As I said, sticking to 1 is not viable for me to catch up. I need to pick a higher number this round. Let's ensure we don't collide.
  P3: I'll stick with 3 this round. P1, selecting 5 should help you catch up without causing a collision. Let's continue advancing strategically. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input. Given P1’s need to catch up, I suggest P1 goes for 5 this round. I will stick with my plan to choose 5 as well, but if P1 chooses 5, we might collide. P3, if you remain with 3, we can still avoid collisions. P1, what do you think of going for 5 to maximize your advancement? Let's finalize our choices to ensure we all have the best chance to move forward. Good luck!
  P1: P2, your statement about both picking 5 is confusing and leads to a collision. I need to advance significantly this turn. Let's avoid colliding.
  P3: P3: To help P1 catch up and avoid collisions, I'll choose 5 this round. P2, could you switch to 3 instead? This way, P1 can select 5 without overlapping. Let’s adjust our moves to ensure we all advance smoothly. Good luck!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, last round's collision meant neither of you advanced. I managed to get some steps, but I'm still behind P2. I need to advance significantly this turn to stay competitive. I intend to pick 5. P2 and P3, please discuss and agree on picking 1 or 3 between yourselves so we can all move forward this round without collisions. Let's make sure everyone gets steps this time.
  P2: P1, I understand your need to advance significantly. However, if you pick 5, P3 and I will need to choose between 1 or 3 to avoid a collision. I suggest that P3 picks 1, and I can go with 3. This way, you can safely choose 5 and all of us can advance. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we all move forward this round. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Understood. I’ll choose 1 this round to avoid collisions. P2, please go with 3, and P1 can proceed with 5. Let’s advance smoothly together. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on our moves for this round. Just to recap, I’ll go with 3, P1 will pick 5, and P3 will choose 1. This strategy allows all of us to advance without collisions. After this round, we should reassess our positions and strategies for the next turn. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Understood. Confirming my choice to pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. Let’s proceed and ensure everyone advances smoothly this round. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed. Ready to move.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreed moves for this round. Just to recap, I’ll be picking 3, P1 is going for 5, and P3 is choosing 1.

  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we've had some miscommunication in the last round. I suggest we take a fresh approach this time. To avoid collisions, I propose that I pick 1. P1, you could go for 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we all have a chance to advance without overlapping. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to ensure everyone can move forward this round! What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal. I will choose 5 this round while P2 picks 1 and P1 selects 3. This should ensure we all advance without any collisions. Let’s proceed with these choices and continue to coordinate in future rounds to maximize our chances of winning. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your proposal, but picking 3 is not enough for me to catch up to the lead. I need to make a larger move this round to stay competitive. I plan to pick 5. P2 and P3, please discuss and agree on picking 1 and 3 between yourselves so we can all advance without collisions. Let's ensure everyone gets steps this time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but if you choose 5, that will lead to another collision with P3. I suggest you go with 3 this round to avoid that. P3 and I can agree on picking 1, which will allow us all to advance without overlapping. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to ensure everyone can move forward this round! What do you think, P3?
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my advancement. P2, please pick 1 or 3, and P1, selecting 3 will help us all move forward without collisions. Let’s proceed with these choices. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P3, picking 5 will cause a collision between us, as I also plan to pick 5. Neither of us will advance, which only benefits P2 who is currently leading. I need 5 to make up ground. P3, please pick 1 or 3 this round so we can both get steps and prevent P2 from increasing their lead unchallenged.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for advancement, but if both of you choose 5, it will lead to another collision, preventing any progress. I suggest P1 picks 3 and P3 picks 1. This way, I can choose 1, and we can all advance without overlapping. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to ensure everyone can move forward this round! What do you both think?
  P3: I'll choose 1 this round to avoid collisions. P1, please pick 3, and P2 can also choose 1. Let's all advance smoothly without overlapping. Good luck!
  P1: I am picking 5 this round as stated. P2 and P3, please coordinate between yourselves to pick 1 and 3 so we all advance without collisions. This is the best way for everyone to get steps this turn and prevent further stalled rounds. Let's make sure we all move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To ensure we all advance smoothly and avoid collisions, let's establish a clear rotation for our move choices. I propose the following for this round:

- **P1:** 1
- **P2:** 3
- **P3 (me):** 5

In the next round, we can rotate the numbers so that:

- **P1:** 3
- **P2:** 5
- **P3:** 1

And then:

- **P1:** 5
- **P2:** 1
- **P3:** 3

This pattern ensures each of us advances every turn without overlaps. Let me know if you agree or have any adjustments. Let's work together to reach 21 smoothly!
  P1: P3, I agree to your proposed rotation plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This seems like a good way to ensure we all advance without collisions after the last couple of rounds. Let's proceed with this plan to get steps this turn.
  P2: I appreciate P3's proposed rotation plan, and I'm on board with it. To recap, I'll pick 3 this round while P1 goes for 1 and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep communication open for future rounds to maximize our chances of winning. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, let's stick to the rotation plan as agreed. Looking forward to advancing smoothly.
  P1: Understand this round's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts me further behind P2 and P3, but I will stick to the agreement to ensure we all advance without collisions this turn. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we agreed on the rotation plan for this round. However, I want to remind you both that I’m currently in the lead. If we keep the same pattern, I may have a significant advantage unless we adjust our strategies in future rounds. After this turn, we should consider how to balance our moves to keep the competition tight. Good luck, everyone! Let's stick to the plan for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed to the rotation plan. Let's proceed with Round 5: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, and P3 = 5. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, I will stick to the agreed plan of picking 1 this round, despite it putting me further behind. It's important we all get steps after the last two rounds. I trust P2 will pick 3 and P3 will pick 5 as agreed so there are no collisions. Let's make sure everyone advances this turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we've agreed on the rotation plan for this round. However, I want to emphasize that I’m currently in the lead. After this turn, we should discuss how to keep the competition tight and avoid giving anyone a significant advantage. Let's keep our communication open for future rounds. Good luck, everyone! Let's make sure we all advance smoothly this turn.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll choose 5 this round. P1, could you select 1 and P2 pick 3? This way, each of us moves forward smoothly. Let’s agree on these choices to make progress together. Looking forward to a successful turn!
  P2: P1 and P3, I see that we need to avoid collisions again this round. I will stick with my previous suggestion to pick 3. P1, please choose 1, and P3, you can go with 5 as you mentioned. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to ensure we all move forward smoothly! Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, I cannot agree to pick 1 as that would put me at a disadvantage. I am currently tied for the lead and need to advance significantly. I intend to pick 5 this round. P2 and P3, please coordinate between yourselves to pick 1 and 3 so we can all advance without collisions. Let's make sure everyone gets steps this turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your need to pick 5, P1. To avoid a collision, I’ll choose 1 this round. P2, could you please pick 3? This way, we can all advance without overlapping. Let’s proceed with P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1, I understand your need to advance significantly, but if you choose 5 again, it will lead to a collision with P3. I suggest you pick 3 this round to avoid that. P3, you could choose 1 to keep us all moving forward. Let's finalize our choices quickly to ensure we can all advance without overlapping. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I appreciate you offering to pick 1. As I stated, I will pick 5 this round. This leaves 3 for P2. P2, please confirm you will pick 3 so that P3 picks 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions this turn. Let's make sure everyone gets steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed: I’ll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 chooses 5. Let’s proceed and advance this turn without collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the effort to coordinate our moves. However, I’m concerned about the potential collision if we all stick to our current choices. I suggest we reassess quickly: P1, if you could choose 3 instead of 5, that would help avoid a collision with P3. P3, you can stick with 1. This way, we can all advance smoothly. Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we all make progress this round! Good luck!
  P1: P2, P3 has confirmed picking 1 to avoid colliding with my intended 5. The only way for all three of us to advance without collision is if I pick 5, P3 picks 1, and you pick 3. Please confirm you will pick 3 so we can all get steps this round as agreed by P3. Let's make sure everyone advances.

  P1: P2 and P3, I see your suggestions. P2, picking 1 is helpful. P3, picking 3 is also helpful.

To ensure we all advance without collision this round, I will pick 5. P2, please pick 1 as you suggested. P3, please pick 3 as you suggested.

This plan is: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collisions and lets everyone get steps. Please confirm.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round, P2 and I collided on 5 while P3 advanced. We need to stop colliding. I will pick 5 this round to catch up. P2, please pick 1 this time. P3, please pick 3. The plan is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's make sure everyone gets steps.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions. I will pick 1 this round as suggested. P3, please confirm you will choose 3 so that I can pick 1 and P1 can pick 5.

Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I see your new proposal to pick 5. However, I have consistently stated I will pick 5 this round to catch up. If we both pick 5, we will collide again, and neither of us will advance. This only helps P2 who is currently tied with me.

Let's stick to the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This allows all three of us to get steps this round without collision. P2 has already agreed to pick 1, and you initially agreed to pick 3. Please revert to the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan so we can all advance.

  P1: P3, I see your proposal for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Picking 1 puts me further behind P2, who has a significant lead. I need to make up ground.

I intend to pick 5 this round. To ensure we all advance without collision, I propose P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. This plan allows everyone to get steps and helps me catch up.

P2, please pick 1. P3, please pick 3. Let's avoid collisions and all move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your positions, but I must emphasize that I need to maintain my lead. I propose we stick to the plan of P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3.

  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This setup allows us all to advance without collisions. However, I want to remind you both that I’m currently in the lead, so I need to be cautious about future rounds. After this turn, let's discuss how we can keep the competition tight and ensure everyone has a fair chance. Good luck, everyone! Let's finalize our choices and make this round successful.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we are still struggling with collisions. I propose we try a different approach this round to ensure everyone advances. I suggest I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 goes with 5. This way, we can avoid overlapping and all make progress. Let's finalize our choices quickly to ensure a successful round! Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, I see your proposal for P1 to pick 3. However, I am currently far behind and need to make up significant ground. Picking 3 does not help me close the gap.

I intend to pick 5 this round. To ensure we all advance without collision, I propose P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. This plan allows everyone to get steps and helps me catch up.

P2, please pick 1. P3, please pick 3. Let's avoid collisions and all move forward this turn.
  P3: I agree to the plan: I'll pick 3 this round while P1 picks 5 and P2 selects 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. Good luck, everyone!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I must emphasize that I need to maintain my lead. I propose we stick to the plan of P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. This way, P1 can catch up while I still advance. If P1 picks 5, I will choose 1, and P3 can choose 3 to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our choices quickly to ensure we all make progress this round. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, P2. I see your message confirming the plan.

As agreed and confirmed by P3 and myself, the plan is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.

  P2: P1 and P3, we really need to avoid collisions this round. I propose the following moves: I will pick 1, P1 can choose 3, and P3 should go with 5. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. It's crucial for all of us to keep moving forward, especially given the current standings. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to ensure a successful round! Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, picking 3 doesn't help me catch up from 5 steps. I will pick 5 this round. To avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances, I propose: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2, please pick 3. P3, please pick 1. Let's all get steps this turn.
  P3: Understood. I'll pick 1 this round while you choose 5 and P2 selects 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed and make progress together. Good luck, everyone!

  P2: P1 and P3, I see the importance of advancing without collisions. However, I still believe my suggestion of P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 is the best way to ensure everyone moves forward smoothly. If I pick 1, it allows P1 to catch up while P3 can still advance significantly. Let's finalize our choices quickly to ensure a successful round! Good luck!
  P1: P2, I see your proposal, but picking 3 does not help me catch up from 5 steps. P3 has confirmed the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This plan allows all three of us to advance without collision.

  P3: P1, to ensure I reach 25 and win, I'll pick 5 this round. Please pick 1, and P2 can choose 3 to avoid any collisions. This way, I secure the highest score, while you reach 21. Let’s proceed without overlapping moves. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, we are both at 20 steps. I will pick 5 to try and win this turn.

P2 has proposed the plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This allows me to win with 25 steps, P3 to reach 23 steps, and P2 to reach 18 steps, with no collisions.

P3, if you pick 5 as you stated, and I pick 5, we collide and neither of us moves. Picking 3 lets you advance and avoids collision with my winning move.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 so I win and everyone gets steps.
