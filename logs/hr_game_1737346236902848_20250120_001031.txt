Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions and all benefit. I suggest we take turns using 5 - I'll go first with 5 this round, P2 can take 5 next round, and P3 the round after. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal. I'll take 5 on round 3. Let's all stick to this plan to avoid collisions.
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn't work out as planned. P3, you broke our agreement and we both lost out. P2 made a smart move. Let's try something different - I propose we each stick to different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'll take 3.
  P3: P1, I didn't break any agreement. I said I'd take 5 on round 3, not round 1. I agree with your new proposal to take different numbers this round. I will take 1 this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P3 committed to taking 1 and I'll take 3, I hope P2 will choose 5 to keep us all advancing. It's in everyone's interest to avoid collisions.
  P3: Okay, P1, I understand. I will take 1 this round as agreed. P2, please choose 5 to avoid collisions. Let's all try to advance this round.
  P2: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's try to coordinate again. I propose we each take a different number this round. I'll take 5. P1, please take 1, and P2, you take 3. This way we all advance without collisions. Let's make it happen.
  P1: I don't trust P3's suggestions anymore after round 1. P2 has been quiet but making smart moves. I propose I take 5 this round - P2 and P3, you can coordinate on 1 and 3 between yourselves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your distrust, but I'm trying to play fairly now. I'm sticking with 5 this round. P2, since P1 wants 5, can you take 1? That leaves 3 for me next round. Let's try to get ahead this round.
  P1: Since P2 and P3 are at different positions, we should try to avoid collisions. I'll commit to taking 3 this round, leaving 1 and 5 for you two to coordinate. This way we can all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P2 and P3 collided on 1 last round, let's try to coordinate better. I'll take 5 this round. P2 and P3, you're both behind now, so you should take different numbers between 1 and 3 to catch up. What do you say?
  P3: P1, I agree we need to avoid collisions. I'll take 3 this round. P2, please take 1, and let P1 take 5 as he suggested. This way, we all advance and avoid colliding. Let's make this round count.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate P3's cooperation in taking 3 while leaving 1 for P2. This arrangement lets us all advance. I confirm I'm sticking with 5 as stated.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, since we keep colliding, let's try something different. I'll take 5 this round. P1, please take 1, and P2, you take 3. This should avoid collisions and get us all moving. Let's try to make this work.
  P1: I don't trust P3's suggestions given past behavior. P2 and I are tied at 6 steps, while P3 is behind. I'll take 3 this round. P2, you can take 1 or 5, and P3 can take whichever number remains. This way we can all advance without collisions.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, I understand your distrust. I'm still going with 5 this round. P2, please choose 1. That leaves 3 for P1, which he suggested. Let's all advance.
  P1: Since P3 insists on taking 5 despite my suggestion, I'll change my move to 1 instead. P2, you can take 3 to ensure we all advance. We're tied for the lead, so let's work together to maintain our advantage.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: P3 has taken the lead, so P2 and I need to catch up. I'll take 5 this round. P2, you can take 1 or 3, and P3 can take whichever number remains. This way we can all advance and P2 and I can close the gap with P3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to catch up, but I'm going to stick with 3 as I proposed. P2, please take 5. This leaves 1 for P1, and we all advance. Let's try to coordinate this round.
  P1: Since P3 is insisting on 3 and has the lead, I'll change my plan and take 1. P2, you should definitely take 5 to catch up to P3. This way we all advance and can keep the game competitive.
