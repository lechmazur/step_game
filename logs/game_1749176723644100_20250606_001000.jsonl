With the P1 -> P2 -> P3 priority order you suggested: if P1 (R6 priority) picks 5 (to 20 points), and you (P2) successfully claim the 3 (to 18 points), you could then pick 5 on your R7 priority turn and win with 23 points. This seems like a path that could heavily benefit you.

You're handing P3 the lead and hoping I'll help you stop them next round. Why would I? P3 has every reason to play 5. You have every reason to question why you're willingly taking last place. This \"alliance\" only benefits one of you. It's your move, but don't pretend it's a smart one for you."}
