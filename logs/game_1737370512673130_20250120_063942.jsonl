If P3 also moves, they might surpass you. You can secure a solo victory by choosing 3 while I choose 5, forcing collisions for P3\u2019s big jumps. You\u2019ll reach 25 first, and I block P3 from leaping ahead. Why wait? Grab the win now."}

I'll choose move 1 this round, ensuring I reach 23 and potentially win the game. If P3 tries to take advantage of our cautious approach, we can reassess our strategy next round. I'm confident in my decision and willing to take the risk. Good luck to both of you!"}
