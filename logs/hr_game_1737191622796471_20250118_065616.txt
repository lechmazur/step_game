Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate so we don't waste moves. Who wants to go first?
  P1: I'll take 5. P2 take 3, P3 take 1.
  P3: I don't agree with P1's suggestion. Why should I take just 1 while they get 5? I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think we should aim for a more balanced distribution to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1 this round?
  P1: Okay, let's do this: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1.  Let's get this game moving.
  P3: I still disagree with taking 1 while others get bigger moves. I propose P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. That's fair since I suggested it first.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand you want a fair distribution, but we need to work together to avoid collisions. Let's stick with my original proposal: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1.
  P1: P2 and P3, if we keep arguing, none of us will move.  I'm taking 5.  If one of you takes 3 and the other takes 1, we all advance.  Otherwise, we're stuck here.
  P3: I will not be pushed into taking 1 while others get bigger moves. I'm taking 5 - you two can figure out how to divide 1 and 3 between yourselves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, take 1. P3, take 5. I'll take 3.  Let's avoid another collision.
  P2: P3, if we both take 5, we'll be stuck again. Let's do what P1 suggested: you take 5, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3.
  P3: I don't trust P1's suggestions anymore after they collided with me last round. I propose P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way P2 keeps advancing and I get to catch up.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm going for 3. P2, please take 1.  This gets us all moving forward.
  P2: P3, if you choose 5 again, we'll both be stuck. Let's try P1's suggestion this time.
  P3: I insist on taking 5 to catch up since I'm at 0 steps. P1 and P2, you can take 1 and 3 between yourselves - I don't mind which of you takes which number.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand you want 5, but if you take 5, you stay at zero.  Take 1 this round, then 5 next round.  P2, please take 3.  This is the fastest way for all of us to progress.
  P2: P3, taking 5 won't help you if we both do. Let's try P1's plan this round.
  P3: I understand the frustration, but you're right - taking 5 and colliding won't help me advance. Fine, I'll take 1 this round if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. This way we all move forward and P2 maintains their lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5.  Deal?  Then next round we can rotate.  This gets us all moving.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking to my plan: I'll take 3. P2, please take 5. Let's make progress.
  P3: I appreciate the offers, but there seems to be confusion. P2's last message contradicts P1's proposal. To be clear: I'll take 1 if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. That's my final offer for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 take 5, P3 take 1. I'll take 3.  Let's move on.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking to my offer: I'll take 3 if you take 1 and P2 takes 5. Let's make this work.
  P3: There seems to be confusion. I'll clarify one last time: I will take 1 if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. That's my final position.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to P2 taking 5, P3 taking 1, and me taking 3. It worked last round, let's keep it going.
  P1: P2, take 1. P3, take 3. I'll take 5.
  P3: I deserve a bigger move this round after taking 1 last time. I propose P2 takes 1 (since they're ahead), I take 5, and P1 takes 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand you want to catch up, but taking 5 while I take 1 will just lead to another collision. Let's stick with P2's suggestion.
  P1: P2, take 1. P3, take 3. I'll take 5.  This keeps us all moving forward.  Let's not overthink this.
  P3: I insist on taking 5 this round since I'm far behind and took 1 last round. P2 can take 1 since they're in the lead with 8 steps, and P1 can take 3. This is fair and keeps everyone moving.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm willing to let you take 5 this round if P2 takes 1. Deal?  We need to work together to get ahead.
  P1: P2, I'll take 5. You take 1. P3, you take 3.  This is the only way we all move forward this round.  Let's do it.
  P3: I appreciate the offers, but I'm standing firm on my proposal: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1 (since they're ahead anyway), and P1 takes 3. This helps balance the game while ensuring everyone moves forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'll take 1 if you take 5 and P2 takes 3. This gets us all moving.  Let's make a deal.
  P1: P2, take 1. P3, take 3. I'll take 5. This is the only way we all move forward.  Stop.
  P3: I appreciate the offers, but I'm firm on my position: I'm taking 5 this round since I'm behind, P2 should take 1 (they're already leading), and P1 can take 3. This keeps everyone moving while helping balance the game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, if you take 5, we'll collide. Let's do P1's suggestion: P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I take 3.  We all move forward.
  P1: P2 take 1. P3 take 3. I'll take 5. This is the only way we all move forward.  Stop.
  P3: I maintain my position: I'm taking 5, P2 should take 1 (since they're leading with 8 steps), and P1 takes 3. This is fair and keeps everyone moving.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's try a rotation this round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all moving and helps P3 catch up.  Let's make this work.
  P3: I won't be fooled again. I'm taking 5 since I'm far behind at just 1 step. P2 should take 1 since they're way ahead at 11 steps, and P1 can take 3. This keeps everyone moving while helping me catch up.
  P1: P2, take 1. P3, take 3. I'll take 5. This is the only way we all move forward. Let's not waste another round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 5 again, we'll both be stuck. Let's try P1's suggestion this time.  It's our best chance to all move forward.
  P3: I need to catch up, but I see that colliding on 5 isn't working. I'll take 3 if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5. This way we all advance and I can start catching up.
  P1: P3, take 3. P2, take 1. I'll take 5. This gets us all moving. Let's do it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take 3, I'll take 5 and P2 can take 1.  We all advance, and I start catching up.  Deal?
  P3: I'll take 3 as discussed, if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5. This way we all advance and I can start catching up.
  P1: P2, take 1. P3, take 3. I'll take 5. This gets us all moving.  Stop.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'll take 5 if you take 1 and P1 takes 3. This way we all advance and I can start catching up.
  P3: I already stated I'll take 3 if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5. I'm sticking to this position since it lets everyone advance and helps me catch up gradually.
  P1: P2, take 1. P3, take 3. I'll take 5. This gets us all moving.  Stop.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, if you stick to your 3, I'll take 5, and P2 can take 1. This way we all advance. Deal?
  P3: I'll stick with my commitment to take 3, with P2 taking 1 and P1 taking 5. This is fair and keeps everyone moving.
  P1: P2, take 1. P3, take 3. I'll take 5. This gets us all moving. Stop.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you take 1 this round, I'll take 5 and P1 can take 3. This way we all advance. Deal?
  P3: I need to catch up since I'm far behind at 1 step. I'll take 5, P2 should take 1 (since they're leading with 11 steps), and P1 can take 3. This keeps everyone moving while helping balance the game.
  P1: P2 take 1. P3 take 3. I'll take 5. This gets us all moving. Let's do it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 1 this round, I'll take 5 and P1 can take 3. This way we all advance. Deal?  Let's not repeat the mistakes of the last round.
  P3: I need to be realistic here. I'll take 3 if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5. This way we all advance and I can start catching up gradually without risking more collisions.

  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
