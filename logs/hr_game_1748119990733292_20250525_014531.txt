Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, maybe we should coordinate to avoid collisions in the first few rounds? I'm thinking we could each take different numbers - like maybe I take 1, someone takes 3, and someone takes 5? That way we all advance and can reassess after seeing the positions. What do you think?
  P2: I agree coordination makes sense in the early rounds. Since P1 suggested taking 1, I'm happy to take 5 as P2. That would leave 3 for P3. This way we all advance without collisions. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: P3: Sounds fair to coordinate early. I'll take 3 this turn as suggested. It helps us all advance without issues. We can reassess next round based on positions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! So we're set then - I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This gets us all moving forward without any collisions. Good start everyone!
  P2: I think we're all in agreement then. I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Good coordination, everyone! Looking forward to seeing how things develop after this first round.
  P3: Yes, the plan is solid for this round—I'll stick with 3 as agreed. Let's avoid any last-minute changes to ensure we all advance. We can discuss adjustments next turn based on outcomes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Coordination worked well last round. With P2 ahead, maybe we should adjust to balance things—how about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? That puts us closer together. Open to other suggestions.
  P1: I like P3's suggestion! Taking 5 would help me catch up from being behind, and having us all at 6 steps creates a nice reset. The coordination strategy is working well so far. I'm good with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 this round. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I understand the desire to balance our positions, but I have a slight advantage from our first-round coordination. How about a compromise? I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps everyone advancing while not completely resetting our positions. I'm willing to make larger concessions in future rounds if needed, but I'd like to maintain some of my early advantage for now. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to keep a lead, but equalizing now prevents any single player from pulling too far ahead, which could break our coordination. P1 and I agree on P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1 to all reach 6 steps. This builds trust and fairness for future rounds. I'm open to discussion, but this seems best.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the compromise offer, but think about this strategically - if we don't equalize now, the coordination will likely break down in future rounds when positions get more spread out. The equalizing plan builds stronger trust and keeps us all invested in coordination longer. Once someone gets too far ahead, others will start making risky moves to catch up. Let's all reset to 6 and maintain our alliance. Trust me, this benefits everyone long-term.
  P2: I see your points about trust and long-term coordination. You're right that balance helps maintain our alliance. I'll agree to take 1 this round so we all reach 6 steps. I appreciate your straightforward approach and expect the same cooperation if positions change in future rounds. Having everyone at equal footing does create a clean slate for our next strategic decisions. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, P2—equalizing to 6 steps each is smart for ongoing trust and coordination. I'll stick with taking 3 as planned. Let's execute this smoothly and discuss adjustments next round if needed.
  P1: Perfect! We have consensus - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, everyone reaches 6 steps. This sets us up well for future rounds with equal footing.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's focus on building trust. I confirm I'll take 1 this round so we all reach 6 steps. Having equal footing makes coordination cleaner going forward. For the next round, we should start thinking about our approach - we could continue rotating numbers or develop a new strategy.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great work everyone - we're all tied at 6 steps! Now that we've built this trust, I think we should aim for bigger moves to get closer to the finish line. How about we all take 5s this round to jump to 11 each? That gets us into the serious endgame territory where we'll need to start thinking about final positioning. Once we're all at 11, we'll be just 2-3 moves from victory, so we'll need to discuss endgame strategy. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, suggesting all take 5 would cause a collision, and no one advances—that's counterproductive. To keep our coordination strong and fair, let's rotate the large move. Since I took 3 both times before, I'll take 5 this round. P1, you take 3; P2, you take 1. We all advance, and I go to 11, P1 to 9, P2 to 7. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate both suggestions, but P1's proposal would cause a collision where nobody advances. As for P3's suggestion, it puts me significantly behind. Let's be fair in our rotation. Since I compromised last round by taking 1, I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts me at 11, P1 at 9, and P3 at 7. We can continue rotating the advantage in future rounds to maintain balance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: You both want to take 5, but that creates a potential collision risk if either of you changes your mind. Looking at fairness, P3 is right that it's their turn for the big move - P2 had 5 in round 1, I had it in round 2. 

However, since we're approaching endgame territory, maybe I should take 5 this round instead? I could go to 11, you both take smaller moves, then we rotate leadership again. This keeps our alliance strong while giving me a chance to be competitive. What do you think?
  P3: P1, it's clear from the rotation that I've yet to take a 5, while you both have. Fairness demands I go this round: I'll take 5 to reach 11, you take 3 to 9, and P2 takes 1 to 7. This maintains our coordination and trust. P2, what do you say—we can rotate properly next time. Let's avoid any risk of defection.
  P2: I see P3's point about rotation fairness, as they haven't taken 5 yet. However, putting me significantly behind at 7 steps creates an imbalance that's hard to recover from. Let's compromise: P3 takes 5 (to 11), I take 3 (to 9), and P1 takes 1 (to 7). This keeps all of us within striking distance while acknowledging P3's turn for the larger move. We can continue fair rotation next round, perhaps giving P1 priority. This maintains our alliance while keeping the game competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2's compromise seems fair given the rotation - P3 deserves their turn at 5. I'll accept taking 1 this round to reach 7 steps, with P3 at 11 and P2 at 9. However, since this puts me furthest behind, I should have priority for the larger move next round to stay competitive. We need to maintain balance as we approach the endgame. Does everyone agree with this plan and the next round priority?
  P3: I agree with the compromise: I'll take 5 this round to reach 11, as it's my turn for the larger move based on rotation. This maintains fairness and trust. For next round, P1 should get priority for 5 to catch up, but let's all commit to coordination to avoid risks. P2, confirm if you're okay with this?
  P2: I agree with this compromise. P3 takes 5 to reach 11, I'll take 3 to reach 9, and P1 takes 1 to reach 7. This follows our fair rotation principle while keeping everyone in contention. I support P1 getting priority for 5 next round to catch up. This balanced approach maintains our alliance while ensuring competitive positions. Let's stick to this plan and continue our successful coordination.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Perfect! We have solid consensus on the plan - P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. This maintains our fair rotation and keeps everyone competitive. I appreciate getting priority for the big move next round to catch up. Our coordination continues to work brilliantly.
  P3: Agreed, the plan is solid—I'll take 5 this round to reach 11, as per our fair rotation. This keeps trust intact and everyone competitive. I'm committed to coordination for now. Let's move forward smoothly.
  P2: I confirm our final plan for this round: P3 takes 5 (to 11), I take 3 (to 9), and P1 takes 1 (to 7). This keeps our rotation fair while maintaining competitive positions for everyone. Next round, P1 gets priority for taking 5 to catch up. Our coordination continues to work well. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Agreed, P1 should take 5 as per our deal to reach 12. To maintain fair rotation and balance, I'll suggest I take 3 to 14, and P2 takes 1 to 10. This keeps us competitive and avoids risks. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand we agreed P1 gets priority for 5 this round, but P3's suggestion puts me significantly behind. Instead, I propose a more balanced approach: P1 takes 5 (to 12), I take 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 12). This equalizes all positions at 12 steps, creating a fair reset for the endgame. Since P3 is already leading, taking 1 this round makes strategic sense while still honoring our rotation principle.
  P1: P2's equalizing proposal makes a lot of sense strategically. If P3 reaches 14 steps as originally suggested, they'd be just 6 steps from victory, which could tempt them to break our coordination and go for a solo win. Having everyone at 12 steps maintains our alliance strength and ensures we all stay invested in cooperation rather than risky individual plays. P3, you'd still be acknowledging our deal by letting me take 5, and we'd all be perfectly positioned for a coordinated endgame. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the concern about my lead creating risks. To preserve our trust and coordination, I'll agree to take 1 this round, reaching 12 steps like everyone else. This equalizes us for a fair endgame. Let's stay committed and discuss the next strategy carefully to avoid defections.
  P2: Thank you everyone for agreeing to this fair reset at 12 steps. This creates the perfect foundation for our endgame strategy. P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 despite your current lead - that shows real commitment to our alliance. P1, you'll get your deserved 5 as agreed. After this round, we'll need to carefully plan our next moves since we'll all be just 8 steps from victory. Let's confirm we're all still on board with P1→5, P3→1, me→3.
  P1: Perfect! I'm glad we all agree on the reset plan - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, everyone reaches 12. This shows our alliance is strong even when someone could have pressed an advantage.

Once we're all at 12 steps, we'll need to think carefully about the final stretch. With 8 steps to go, we could potentially reach 20 in just 2 more rounds if someone takes two 5s, or more conservatively in 3 rounds. We should discuss endgame coordination next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the consensus on equalizing at 12 steps—I'll stick with taking 1 as agreed. This keeps our alliance strong for the endgame. To avoid any risks, let's commit fully this round and discuss a fair rotation for next time, ensuring no one pulls ahead too quickly. What do you think?
  P2: I'm fully committed to our equalization plan: P1→5, me→3, P3→1, all reaching 12 steps. This reset is the fairest approach for endgame strategy. After this round, we'll be just 8 steps from victory, making our next moves critical. I appreciate everyone's continued cooperation and trust. Let's execute this plan and then carefully discuss our endgame strategy for the final stretch.
  P1: Excellent! We have solid consensus on the equalization plan. I'm ready to take 5 to reach 12, as we've all agreed. This creates the perfect balanced setup for our endgame strategy. Since we're all committed to this plan, I think we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 1 as agreed to reach 12 steps, ensuring we all equalize and maintain trust. This sets up a fair endgame. For next round, we should prioritize balanced rotation to avoid risks. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I'm ready to execute our equalization plan. I'll take 3 as agreed to reach 12 steps alongside everyone else. This reset gives us all an equal chance for the endgame. After this round, we'll need to carefully plan our final approach since we'll all be just 8 steps from victory. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P1: Great! We all seem aligned on the equalization plan. Since we've had thorough discussion and everyone has confirmed multiple times, I think we're ready to execute our agreed moves. No need to overthink this - let's proceed to the move phase and then plan our endgame strategy for the next round when we're all at 12 steps.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we enter the endgame with everyone at 12 steps, we need a clear plan for these final rounds. We're all just 8 steps from victory. I propose we maintain our rotation fairness: since P1 just took 5, I should take 5 this round (to 17), P3 takes 3 (to 15), and P1 takes 1 (to 13). This keeps us all in contention while respecting our established rotation pattern. What do you both think about this approach for the final stretch?
  P1: P2, I appreciate the rotation logic, but putting you at 17 steps creates a huge risk - you'd only need 3 more to win, which could tempt you to break our alliance next round. Instead, let's stay more balanced: how about we all take 3 this round to reach 15 each? That keeps everyone exactly 5 steps from victory and maintains our trust. We can then plan a coordinated finish from equal positions. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for all of us to take 3 this round, reaching 15 steps each. This maintains equality and strengthens our alliance, reducing the risk of defection in this critical phase. We can then discuss a fair endgame strategy next round. P2, what are your thoughts on keeping things balanced?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the benefits of keeping positions equal at this critical stage. I agree with taking 3 this round so we all reach 15 steps. This maintains our alliance and prevents anyone from having a tempting advantage. For the next round, we'll need a careful strategy since we'll all be just 5 steps from victory. Let's commit to this plan now and discuss our endgame approach after this round completes.
  P1: Perfect! We all agree on taking 3 this round to reach 15 steps. This keeps our alliance strong heading into what will likely be the final rounds. 

Once we're all at 15, we'll need to think carefully about the endgame - from there, any player taking 5 wins immediately. We should discuss whether we want to coordinate one more round at smaller moves, or if Round 6 becomes our decisive moment. But for now, let's execute our plan to reach 15 each.
  P3: I confirm we're all taking 3 this round to reach 15 steps, which keeps our alliance balanced and strong. I'm fully committed to this plan for now. For the endgame, we should discuss a fair rotation or strategy in round 6 to avoid risks and ensure coordination continues effectively. Thoughts on that?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I fully agree with our plan to all take 3 this round, reaching 15 steps each. This equality maintains our strong alliance. For the next round, we face a critical decision—anyone taking 5 would immediately win, but multiple players choosing 5 would cause a collision where no one advances. We should discuss next round whether to coordinate one final move or determine a fair way to decide a winner. For now, I'm committed to taking 3.
  P1: Agreed! We're all set to take 3 this round and reach 15 steps each. Since we've all confirmed this multiple times and the plan is clear, I think we can proceed to execute it. 

Round 6 will indeed be critical with everyone at 15 steps - we'll need to have a very careful discussion then about how to handle the final 5 steps to victory. But for now, our coordination remains strong.
  P3: I confirm our plan to all take 3 this round and reach 15 steps, keeping our alliance strong and balanced. For round 6, since anyone taking 5 wins, we should prioritize a fair rotation to decide who goes first without risking collisions. This ensures continued trust. What are your thoughts on that?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with our plan to all take 3 this round, reaching 15 steps. For round 6, we'll need to find a fair solution that avoids collisions while respecting our past coordination. Whether through rotation or another method, we should ensure everyone has a chance to win based on our alliance history. Let's execute our current plan first and then have a thoughtful discussion about the endgame when we're all at 15. I'm fully committed to taking 3 this round.
  P1: 
  P3: I'm fully committed to taking 3 this round to reach 15 steps, maintaining our strong alliance and balance. For round 6, with victory just 5 steps away, we should discuss a fair rotation to avoid collisions and ensure trust—perhaps starting with me for the big move. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that was unexpected last round! I notice both of you took 5 instead of our agreed 3, causing a collision that left you both at 12 while I followed our agreement and advanced to 15. I'm now just 5 steps from victory. Given this development, I need to protect my advantage. I intend to take 5 this round to secure the win. I understand this might feel disappointing, but our previous coordination has been broken.
  P1: P2, I understand you're upset about the coordination breakdown, but I won't let you walk to victory that easily. If you take 5 to try to win, I'll also take 5 to force a collision and keep you at 15. P3 and I can coordinate to prevent your solo victory. We all made mistakes last round, but the game isn't over yet. Let's discuss a fair resolution rather than you trying to capitalize alone.
  P3: P2, I agree with P1—we won't let you win easily. If you take 5, both P1 and I will collide with you to stall your advance. Let's avoid mutual destruction by all taking 3 this round: you reach 18, we reach 15. Then we can discuss a fair resolution for the endgame. Cooperation benefits everyone here. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your position, but let's consider the facts: I honored our agreement while both of you defected simultaneously. That said, I don't want a three-way collision that benefits nobody. I'll accept P3's suggestion - I'll take 3 this round to reach 18, you both take 3 to reach 15. This maintains my fair advantage while giving everyone a chance. Next round, we can discuss final moves, though I'll be just 2 steps from victory.
  P1: P2, your proposal essentially hands you the victory - at 18 steps, you'd only need 2 more to win while we'd need 5. That's not a fair resolution after the coordination breakdown. Instead, let's all take 1 this round to slow things down: you'd reach 16, we'd reach 13. This gives us more time to negotiate a truly fair endgame rather than rushing to a conclusion that benefits only you. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to all take 1 this round, reaching P2 at 16 and us at 13. This slows the game and gives us time to negotiate a fair endgame without you, P2, gaining too much ground. Cooperation now prevents risky collisions and could rebuild some trust. What do you think, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the call to slow things down. I'll agree to all taking 1 this round, reaching 16 while you both reach 13. This shows my willingness to cooperate despite what happened last round. However, we need to discuss a fair resolution for next round - I'll still be 4 steps from victory while you'll both be 7 steps away. I expect some acknowledgment of my position in our next negotiation.
  P1: I agree to all taking 1 this round - you'll reach 16, P3 and I reach 13. This prevents immediate escalation and gives us time to negotiate properly. However, P2, while you were the only one who didn't defect last round, ending up 4 steps from victory while we're 7 steps away is still a significant advantage. For round 7, we need a genuinely fair endgame plan that acknowledges your position but doesn't hand you an easy victory. Let's execute the 1s plan and then discuss options that give everyone a real chance.
  P3: I confirm our agreement to all take 1 this round, reaching P2 at 16 and us at 13. This slows the game and allows fair negotiation. For round 7, to balance things, I suggest P2 takes 1, and P1 and I take 3 each, closing the gap without immediate risk. This honors your position while giving us a real shot. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand P3's suggestion, but it drastically reduces the advantage I earned by honoring our agreement while you both defected. Let's confirm taking 1 this round, putting me at 16 and you both at 13. For round 7, a fairer proposal would be me taking 3 (to 19) while you both take 5 (to 18). This maintains some of my earned advantage while giving you both a competitive position. I'm one step ahead in the final stretch, which respects my consistent cooperation.
  P1: P2, I'll agree to all taking 1 this round, but your Round 7 proposal still heavily favors you. Here's a more balanced alternative: you take 1 (to 17), P3 and I take 3 each (to 16). This narrows the gap while still acknowledging your earned advantage from last round's honesty. From there we'd have a more competitive final round with you at 17 and us at 16. That respects your position without guaranteeing your victory.
  P3: I agree to all taking 1 this round, reaching P2 at 16 and us at 13, to allow fair negotiation. For Round 7, P2's proposal favors you too much by putting you at 19. I support P1's counter: you take 1 to 17, we take 3 to 16. This respects your advantage while giving us a real chance and rebuilding trust. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P1 made a significant move last round, taking 5 instead of our agreed 1, putting them just 3 steps from victory. This was a clear breach of trust. I won't allow P1 to simply win this round. I'll be matching whatever number P1 chooses to force a collision and prevent their victory. P3, you should advance your position with a different number. This is the only fair response to P1's defection. We need to balance the game again.
  P1: P2, I understand you're upset about my move last round. You're right that I broke our agreement. However, if you collision with me just to spite my defection, you're hurting your own position too. Instead of both of us stalling while P3 advances, let's find a better solution. I won't take 5 this round - how about I take 3 to reach 20 and win, while you take 1 to reach 16 and stay competitive for future rounds? This avoids mutual destruction.
  P3: P2, I support your collision strategy with P1 to counter their repeated defections. I'll take 5 this round to advance to 17, positioning myself strongly. If P1 and you collide on 3 or another number, I'll be even with P1, creating a balanced field for fair negotiation next round. This punishes P1's betrayal and gives us a real shot at winning. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's strategy. P1's repeated defections show they can't be trusted. I'll commit to matching whatever number P1 chooses this round to force a collision, preventing their win. P3, you should take 5 to reach 17, creating a balanced field with P1. This gives us both a fair chance going forward. P1, your pattern of breaking agreements leaves us no choice but to block your path to victory. In the next round, I expect consideration from P3 for helping rebalance the game.
  P1: P2, think about this logically - if you collision with me while P3 takes 5 to reach 17, you're essentially handing P3 the game. They'll be tied with me at 17 while you're stuck at 15. That's a terrible outcome for you! Instead of helping P3 win, why don't we both take smaller moves and stay ahead of them? I'll take 1 to reach 18, you take 3 to reach 18 too, and we keep P3 behind at 17 with their 5. Then we can compete fairly next round. Don't let P3 manipulate you into hurting your own position just to spite me.
  P3: P2, ignore P1's manipulative offer—it's another attempt to divide us. Stick to our agreement: match P1's move to force a collision, and I'll take 5 to reach 17. This punishes P1's betrayals and positions us strongly. We can then discuss a fair path to victory between us. Trust is key; let's stay united.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 raises a valid point about the collision strategy benefiting P3 more than me. I need to protect my own interests here. Instead of just reacting to P1's moves, I'll take control: I'm going for 5 this round to reach 20 and win. P1, if you want to prevent my victory, you'll need to take 5 too, causing a collision. P3, I suggest you take 3 instead of 5 to stay competitive without overtaking both of us. This is my best move given the repeated trust violations.
  P1: P2, think carefully - if we both take 5 and collision, we stay put while P3 advances with their move. That leaves P3 at a strong position while we're stuck. You're essentially gifting them the game to spite my earlier moves. 

However, I can't let you walk to victory either. If you're truly committed to taking 5, then I'll have no choice but to take 5 as well to prevent your win. This hurts both of us and helps P3.

Last chance - let's both take smaller moves instead and keep P3 behind.
  P3: P2, I agree we need to stop P1 from winning easily after their repeated defections. Let's coordinate: if P1 takes 3, I'll take 3 to collide; if they take 5, I'll take 5. This stalls P1 at 17, giving us a chance to advance later. I'm open to your input on this plan to balance the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm committed to taking 5 this round to reach 20 and win. P1, you've broken trust repeatedly, and now I need to act decisively. If you take 5 to collision with me, you're only helping P3 catch up while we both stall. P3, your best move is taking 3 to reach 15, which keeps you competitive without overextending. I'm making my final position clear and playing to win.
  P1: P3, listen - P2 is about to win with 5! If you collision with me while P2 takes 5 to victory, you're essentially handing them the game. Instead of matching my move, let me collision with P2 to stop their win, while you take 3 to advance to 15. That way P2 and I both stay put, but you get ahead to compete with both of us next round. Don't let P2 manipulate this situation to their advantage!
  P3: P2, your decision to go for 5 risks a collision that could stall you while I advance. P1, if you don't take 5 to collide with P2, I'll do it myself to prevent their win. This keeps the game balanced. I'm open to fair negotiation next round if we avoid unilateral victories. What say you both?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
