Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions and make progress. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? What do you think?
  P1: P2, I appreciate the coordination idea. To maximize my progress, I'd prefer to take 5 steps this round. How about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and you take 3? Let’s adjust the plan to benefit us all.
  P3: I think taking 3 steps this turn would be a good move for me. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, that way we all make progress without any collisions. What do you both think?

  P3: **Final Decision:**

- **Round 4:** P3 takes 5 steps.  
- **Round 5:** P3 takes 5 steps.  

**Explanation:**  
By taking 5 steps in Round 4, P3 reaches 14 steps. Then, in Round 5, taking another 5 steps brings P3 to 19 steps, which exceeds 17, ensuring a win unless another player also exceeds 17 in the same round. If P1 also chooses 5 steps in Round 5, they would reach 18 steps, resulting in a tie between P1 and P3. However, if P1 chooses 3 steps, they would reach 11 steps, allowing P3 to win alone. Choosing 5 steps in both Round 4 and Round 5 maximizes P3's chances of winning, either alone or in a tie, which is still a victory.
  P1: Let's continue our rotation to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 steps, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. Please confirm so we can proceed to the move phase.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **Final Decision:**

- **Round 5:** P3 takes 5 steps.

**Explanation:**

By taking 5 steps in Round 5, P3 reaches 14 steps. This positions P3 to take 5 steps again in Round 6 to reach 19 steps, ensuring a win unless P1 also reaches 19 or higher in the same round. If P1 chooses to take 5 steps in Round 5 and reaches 18, P3 can still take 5 in Round 6 to reach 19. If P1 takes 3 steps in Round 5 to reach 16, then in Round 6, P3 takes 5 to reach 19, and P1 takes 5 to reach 21, resulting in a tie. This strategy maximizes P3's progress and ensures a victory, either alone or in a tie, which still counts as a win.
  P2: Let's avoid any more collisions and make steady progress. For Round 5, I suggest: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This will help us all advance without any issues.
