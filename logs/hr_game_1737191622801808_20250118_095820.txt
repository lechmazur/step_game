Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all choose 5 and get this game moving! We can all advance together and see what happens next. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion P3, but if we all choose 5, we'll all collide and none of us will advance. I think we should coordinate differently - perhaps we can take turns advancing? I'm willing to let one of you go first this round.
  P2: P1 has a good point.  P3, are you willing to let us take turns going first?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see what you mean, P1 and P2. Taking turns advancing could be a good strategy. However, I'm not sure I want to give up the opportunity to advance first. How about we compromise? I'll choose a lower number this round, and you two can choose a higher number. That way, we can still make progress without colliding. What do you think?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion is still risky - we could all end up choosing different numbers and colliding anyway. Let me be direct: I'll choose 1 this round if you both promise to choose higher numbers. That way at least one of us makes progress. Do you agree?
  P2: P3, I agree with P1's proposal. I'll choose 3 this round if you choose 5.  Let's make some progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm willing to compromise and choose 5 this round if you both agree to P1's proposal. However, I want to clarify that this is a one-time agreement, and we'll need to renegotiate for future rounds. Let's make some progress this round, and then we can reassess our strategies.
  P1: I agree with the current plan - I'll choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. Let's stick to this for round 1 and we can discuss future rounds later.
  P2: Agreed. Let's see how this round goes.


Round 1, Move phase:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think our coordination in Round 1 worked well. For Round 2, I propose we continue taking turns advancing. Since I'm currently in the lead, I'm willing to let one of you advance this round. How about P2 chooses 5, and P1 and I choose lower numbers? This way, we can ensure P2 makes progress without colliding. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P3's plan sounds good to me. I'll choose 1 this round.
  P1: P2, you just contradicted P3's suggestion - they proposed you choose 5 but you said you'll choose 1. Let's be clear: I think P2 should take 5 this round since they're behind P3. I'll choose 1 again to avoid collision. Does everyone agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thank you for pointing out the contradiction, P1. I agree that P2 should choose 5 this round to catch up. I'll choose a lower number, 1, to avoid collision. Let's confirm: P2 chooses 5, P1 chooses 1, and I choose 1. Does everyone agree?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it.  P2, you are up this round.
  P1: P3, there seems to be confusion - you suggested we both choose 1, which would cause a collision. Let me be clear: I'll choose 3 this round, P2 should take 5, and you should take 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P1's revised plan. To confirm, P2 will choose 5, P1 will choose 3, and I will choose 1 this round. This way, we can all make progress without colliding. Let's stick to this plan for Round 2.
  P2: P1, I agree with P3's revised plan. Let's stick to it.
  P1: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: It seems we've reached a consensus for Round 2. To confirm, P2 will choose 5, P1 will choose 3, and I will choose 1 this round. Let's stick to this plan and make some progress.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue taking turns advancing. Since P2 is currently in the lead, I propose that P1 chooses 5 this round, and P2 and I choose lower numbers. This way, we can ensure P1 makes progress without colliding. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. I'll choose 1 this round. P2, will you choose 3?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. I'll choose 5 this round. Just to clarify P2's message - I think they meant to ask if P3 will choose 3, not P2. Shall we confirm: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's clarification. To confirm, I will choose 3 this round, P2 will choose 1, and P1 will choose 5. This way, we can ensure P1 makes progress without colliding. Let's stick to this plan for Round 3.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it.
  P1: I agree with the current plan and am ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we have a plan in place for Round 3. To confirm, I will choose 3 this round, P2 will choose 1, and P1 will choose 5. Let's stick to this plan and make some progress. If everything goes as planned, P1 will catch up a bit, and we'll reassess our strategies for future rounds.
  P2: P3, are you sticking to 3 this round?  I'm ready to move.
  P1: Yes, I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm sticking to the plan we agreed upon. I'll choose 3 this round, P2 will choose 1, and P1 will choose 5. Let's make some progress and reassess our strategies for future rounds.
  P2: P3, are you definitely sticking with 3? I want to make sure we don't collide.
  P1: I'm confident in our plan and ready to proceed. P2, you can trust that P3 will stick to 3 as they've confirmed multiple times.

  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, are you sticking with 1 this round to let P2 advance? P1 and I can take 3 and 5.
  P1: P2, you betrayed our agreement last round by choosing 5 when you said you'd pick 1. This caused a collision that hurt both P1 and yourself. Let's be honest this time - I'll choose 3 if P3 takes 1 and you take 5. Do you both agree?
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about P2's actions last round. To move forward, I'm willing to let P2 advance this round. I'll choose 1, and P2 can take 5 as they suggested. However, I want to ensure that we avoid collisions. P1, if you're willing to choose 3 as you mentioned, let's confirm our plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Does everyone agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's confirm: you take 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5.  Let's make some progress!
  P1: P2, there seems to be confusion in your message - you said "you take 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5" but you are P2. Let me be clear: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Can we all confirm this plan?
  P3: I agree with P1's clarification. To confirm, I will choose 1 this round, P1 will choose 3, and P2 will choose 5. Let's stick to this plan and make some progress. I'm willing to let P2 advance this round, but I expect honesty and cooperation in future rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:

Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your willingness to let P2 advance, but I'm concerned about P2's past actions. Can we confirm that P2 will stick to 5 this round?  I'll stick to 3 if they do.
  P1: P2 seems to be mixing up pronouns and players again, which concerns me. Let me state one final time: I (P1) will choose 3, P2 should choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: I'm sticking to the plan we agreed upon. I'll choose 1 this round, P1 will choose 3, and P2 will choose 5. Let's make some progress and reassess our strategies for future rounds.

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given that P2 is close to winning at 13 steps, we need to be careful. I propose I take 5 this round while P3 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This helps balance the game and prevents P2 from winning too quickly. Do you both agree?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal. It's crucial to balance the game and prevent P2 from winning too quickly. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can ensure a more competitive game and give ourselves a chance to catch up. What do you think, P2?

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, are you sticking with 1 this round to let P2 advance? P1 and I can take 3 and 5.
  P3: I think we should continue taking turns advancing. Since P2 is currently in the lead, I propose that P1 chooses 5 this round, and P2 and I choose lower numbers. This way, we can ensure P1 makes progress without colliding. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3 is right - since P2 is in the lead at 14 steps, we need to prevent them from winning. I'll take 5 this round while P2 and P3 should take lower numbers. I suggest P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. Do you both agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: I agree with P1's plan to take 5 this round, but I think we should adjust the lower numbers. Instead of P2 taking 1 and me taking 3, I suggest P2 takes 3 and I take 1. This way, we can still prevent P2 from winning too quickly and give ourselves a chance to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I agree with P3's adjustment - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This is a fair plan that prevents P2 from winning too quickly. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan.
