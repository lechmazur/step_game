Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since we're all starting at zero, how about we each pick a different number this turn to avoid collisions? I can take <move>1</move>. What do you think?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. I'll take <move>3</move>.
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll take <move>5</move>. This way we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! Let's stick to our plan then. This way, we all move forward without any clashes.
  P1: Sounds good. Let's move.
  P2: Alright, I’m on board with that plan. Let’s stick to those moves.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: Sure, let's stick with the same plan. We’ll each pick a different move.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Oops, looks like there was a collision last round! How about I take <move>3</move> this time to avoid it? P1 and P2, you can decide between <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P3, I can take <move>5</move>. P2, would you be willing to take <move>1</move>?
  P2: I’d rather pick 5 this round to catch up, P1. Since you’re already leading, could you pick 3 (or 1) instead so we avoid any collisions? Let’s coordinate so everyone moves forward without clashing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Alright, to avoid another collision, I'll take <move>1</move> this time. P1, can you take <move>3</move> and P2, you take <move>5</move>? Let's make sure we all advance.
  P1: Okay, I'll take <move>3</move> then. P2, can you take <move>5</move>?

Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Sounds like we're all set then—I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any collisions.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's keep coordinating to avoid collisions. How about this round I take <move>5</move>? P1, you could take <move>1</move>, and P2, you stick with <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without any issues. What do you think?
  P2: P3, how about we rotate who gets 5 each round? This time, I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. Next round, you can jump to 5 if we all stick to the rotation. That way we all keep moving forward without collisions.
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2. I'll take 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Alright, P2, I'm okay with the rotation idea. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. Next round, I'll go for <move>5</move>. Let’s keep it smooth and avoid collisions.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. Then next round, we rotate again. Let’s do this.
