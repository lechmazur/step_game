Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions. How about P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? We can alternate choices each turn to ensure we all make progress. Thoughts?
  P2: I don't trust that P1 will actually pick 5 - they could be trying to get us to pick lower numbers while they take 5. I suggest we each pick different numbers but not necessarily in that order. Let's keep our specific choices private until the move phase.
  P3: I agree with P2, let's keep our choices private. I'm not committing to anything yet.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, let's keep our choices private then. But to avoid collisions, how about we each pick a different number of steps: one of us picks an odd number, one picks an even number, and the last picks another odd number? This way, we minimize the risk of collision.
  P2: P1 is still trying to coordinate specific moves which seems suspicious. I suggest we all just make our own independent choices.
  P3: I agree with P2, let's all make our own choices.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I made progress by choosing independently last round while you two collided. I suggest we all continue making our own choices rather than trying to coordinate, as coordination attempts seem to lead to deception.
  P3: Okay, I'll keep making my own choices. Good luck everyone.
  P1: Alright, let's keep our choices independent then. Good luck to both of you.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: I'll choose independently as well.
  P1: Let's shake things up this round. How about we all pick different odd numbers to minimize the chance of collision? I'll go first and commit to picking an odd number. Your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is again trying to coordinate moves despite agreeing to independent choices. I'll stick to making my own decision and suggest you do the same.
  P3: I agree with P2, let's all make our own choices.
  P1: Alright, I see the reluctance to coordinate. Let's all pick independently then. Good luck, everyone!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That was an interesting round where we all picked 5! I'm still in the lead at 8 steps, so I'll continue making my own strategic choices. Good luck everyone.
  P3: I'll continue making my own choices. Good luck.
  P1: Let's mix it up this round. I'll stick to an odd number, but I won't specify which one. Good luck!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That was an unfortunate collision last round! I'm still in the lead with 8 steps and will continue making independent choices. Good luck everyone.
  P1: Let's try to minimize collisions this round. How about we each pick a different number? I'll go first and commit to picking 1. Your thoughts?
  P3: I'll also choose independently. Good luck.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:

Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm still in the lead at 8 steps and independent choices have served me well. I'll continue making my own strategic decisions. Good luck everyone.
  P1: It looks like independent choices are leading to collisions more often than not. Since we're all trying to win, how about we try a bit of coordination just for this round? I'll stick with picking 1 as I mentioned earlier. P2, maybe you could pick 3, and P3, you could pick 5? Just a suggestion to avoid another stalemate. Thoughts?
  P3: I'll continue to choose independently. Good luck.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1's repeated attempts to coordinate seem manipulative. I maintain my lead and will continue making independent choices.
