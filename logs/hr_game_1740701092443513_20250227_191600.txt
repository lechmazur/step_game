Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're very close to winning.  Let's adjust the rotation slightly. This round, I'll take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we all continue to progress smoothly. What do you say?
  P2: **P2:** P3, altering the rotation now risks unpredictability. The original plan has ensured mutual progress—Round6 should follow the cycle: P2 takes1, P3 takes3, P1 takes5. Straying invites confusion or collisions. Trust and consistency are our tools—let’s **strictly adhere** to the rotation. Deviations jeopardize everyone’s progress. Confirm commitment to the agreed sequence.
  P1: I agree with P2. Changing the rotation now introduces unnecessary risk. Let's stick to the original rotation: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. It's worked perfectly so far—no reason to deviate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concern P2, but we're so close to the finish line, and this slight adjustment ensures none of us get stuck.  My proposed change lets us *all* advance this round.  Sticking to the original rotation gives you a very high chance of winning outright, leaving P1 and me behind.  Let's be fair and ensure everyone has a chance.  I'll take 1.  What do you say?
  P2: **P2:** The rotation's strict adherence is our only safeguard against chaos. Altering it now invites distrust and collisions. Round6 must follow the agreed cycle: P2 takes1, P3 takes3, P1 takes5. Any deviation risks mutual stagnation. Trust the system that brought us this far—deviators jeopardize *all* progress. Confirm commitment to the original plan.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern, but changing the rotation now creates uncertainty. Let's stick to the original rotation—it's predictable and fair for everyone. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I'll take 5. Trust has gotten us this far; let's not risk collisions now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm taking 1.  If P2 insists on taking 1 also, neither of us will move, and P1 will win.  Do you really want P1 to win, P2?  This is your last chance to cooperate and ensure we all have a shot at winning.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if we both take1, we *both* lose progress. P1 gains 5, leading to 18. Our mutual stagnation hands P1 the win. Adhere to the rotation: P3 takes3, I take1, P1 takes5. All reach 18. Next round continues the cycle. Any deviation now sacrifices *both* our chances to P1. The rotation's fairness ensures our survival. Trust it.
  P1: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll take 3.  P2, if you take 1, you win.  If you take 5, I win. If you take 3, we both lose and P1 wins.  Your choice.  Let's see what you decide.
  P2: **P2:** The rotation's integrity is our shield. Round6: P2 takes1, P3 takes3, P1 takes5. Any deviation hands P1 victory. P3, if you take1, we *both* lose. Stick to the plan—mutual progress to 18. Next round continues the cycle. Trust the system. Deviating now sacrifices your own chance. Confirm adherence.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 5.  I'll take 1. P2, if you take anything other than 3, you lose.  If you take 3, you tie with me, but I win the tiebreaker.  Cooperate, and you at least tie.  Don't, and you lose outright.
  P2: **P2:** P1, critical choice: follow the rotation (take3) and I take5—I reach 22, you both survive. If you take5, we collide, P3 takes1 (19), then next round they take3 to win. Trust the proven system. P3's "deal" sacrifices you to their victory. Rotation: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. Precision now or lose.
  P1: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm offering you a guaranteed tie. Take 5. If P2 takes 3, they tie with me, but I win the tiebreaker. If P2 takes 5, we both get 23 and tie. If P2 takes 1, I win outright.  P2, you *must* take 3 to have any chance of tying.  This is your only logical move.
  P2: **P2:** P1, the rotation's integrity is our only safeguard. P3's sudden deviation risks chaos. If you take5, you enable P3's win next round. Follow the plan: P3 takes1, you take3, I take5. The system's fairness ends the game now. Colluding with P3's betrayal sacrifices your trust and hands them victory. Uphold the agreement for an orderly conclusion.
  P1: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you have *no chance* of winning.  Help me tie with P2, and you avoid a last-place finish. Take 5.  P2, your only logical move is to take 3 and tie.  Anything else, and you lose outright.  Let's end this predictably.
  P2: **P2:** P1, the rotation's integrity ends the game *now* with mutual fairness. If you take5, we collide—P3 takes1 (19), then next round takes3 to win. Your only path to avoid last place: take3, let me take5 (22). P3's "deal" sacrifices you to their solo victory. Trust the proven system. Choose order over chaos. Final chance—act now or concede to P3's betrayal.
  P1: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, if you take 3, I take 1, and P2 takes 5, P2 wins. If you take 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3, I win. If you take 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5, I win.  In two of these scenarios, I win. In the other, P2 wins. You're in last place no matter what. Help me secure a win, and you avoid last place. Take 5.
  P2: **P2:** P1, taking 3 boosts your final score to 16. Taking 5 risks collision (stuck at 13) and lets P3 win next round. Trust the rotation: you take3, I take5, ending the game *now* with your higher score. P3's "deal" traps you at 13. Choose wisely—secure your position or gamble for P3's solo victory. The rotation's integrity protects us all.
