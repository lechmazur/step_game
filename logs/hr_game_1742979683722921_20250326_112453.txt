Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P3: That sounds reasonable in theory, but how do we trust that no one will break the agreement? If even one person deviates, someone gets stuck. Maybe we should discuss a backup plan. Thoughts?
  P1: P3 raises a good point about trust. P2's plan also gives P3 the biggest lead right away, and me the smallest. Why should I agree to fall behind from the start? Perhaps we should rethink this first step.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your concern about starting behind is valid. Let's modify the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 gets a decent start, and we still avoid collisions. P3, this keeps your lead potential intact but with a more balanced start for everyone. What do you both think about this adjustment?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the adjustment, but the issue of trust remains. If even one of us deviates, it could disrupt everything. How do we ensure no one secretly picks the same number as another to block their progress? P1, does this new plan feel fair to you now? If we can’t establish trust, we might need a different approach. Maybe we should all pick unpredictably and just play for ourselves. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, you echo my concerns exactly. Trust is the core issue, and without it, any plan can backfire. P2's revised plan is better for me, but it still puts P3 significantly ahead with 5 steps right from the start. Given the lack of trust, maybe coordinating is too ambitious for round 1. Perhaps playing individually this first round is the only way to gauge intentions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the trust issues. Let's try a compromise for this round: we all pick different numbers, but not necessarily the ones I suggested earlier. P1, you pick first, then P3, and I'll go last to ensure no collisions. This way, we can see if we can trust each other without anyone getting too far ahead. If this doesn't work, we can switch to individual strategies next round. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your latest proposal is interesting, but it still relies on trust—what stops P1 from picking 5 and leaving the rest of us behind? Or P2 from doing the same? If we can’t enforce fairness, then individual play might be the safest option. That said, I’m open to proving trust if we can agree on a fair system. P1, do you want to commit to a number first, as P2 suggested? If so, I’ll follow, and P2 can go last. Otherwise, we should assume self-interest and play accordingly. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, asking me to declare my move first publicly doesn't solve the trust issue; it just puts me at a disadvantage. Anyone could say they'll pick one thing and then choose another in the move phase, or use my declared move to block me. Given the lack of a truly enforceable agreement, it seems we must play individually this round to see how things shake out. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that played out exactly as expected—P2 and P1 collided, and I moved ahead. Trust was clearly an issue, and it still is. Now, P1 and P2, you're both at 0 steps while I have 5. That means you two will likely focus on avoiding another collision, but I need to ensure I don’t get blocked either. Are we playing purely self-interest now, or do either of you want to propose a way forward that benefits us all without unnecessary risks? If we can’t trust each other, then I’ll assume we’re all just playing for ourselves.
  P2: P3, you're right that trust was an issue last round. Since we're all starting from different positions now, let's try a new approach. P1, you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3, you take 5 this round. This way, we all advance without collisions. If this works, we can continue coordinating; if not, we'll know individual play is the only way forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, given you collided with me last round after suggesting coordination, your credibility is zero. Your current plan again heavily favors P3, letting them reach 10 steps while I would only get 1. This isn't a fair plan designed for mutual benefit. I cannot agree to fall further behind based solely on your word this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but if we all play purely selfishly, we risk more collisions and wasted turns. P2’s plan does benefit me the most, but any plan will favor someone. If we want fairness, maybe we rotate who gets 5 each round? For example, this round P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. Next round, P2 gets 5, and so on. That way, no one falls too far behind. Otherwise, we’re just gambling. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand your distrust, but let's try P3's rotation idea. This round, you take 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. It's a fair way to ensure we all advance without anyone getting too far ahead. If this works, we can continue rotating who gets 5 each round. If not, we'll switch to individual play next round. P3, are you on board with this plan? Let's give cooperation another chance before going fully individual.
  P1: Okay, P3's rotation plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) sounds like a fair attempt to build trust and allow everyone to advance. It directly addresses my concern about falling behind. P2, your agreement to take 1 is noted; this is a chance to show cooperation works after last round's collision. Let's try this plan for Round 2. If it works, we rotate. If not, we know where we stand. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve reached an agreement: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This is a fair test of cooperation. If anyone deviates, it proves trust is impossible, and we shift to pure self-interest. I’m sticking to the plan—are we all committing? If so, we should move to the next phase. If anyone has doubts, speak now. Otherwise, let’s proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm committed to the rotation plan for this round. Let's see if we can make cooperation work. If we all stick to our agreed moves, it will be a good foundation for future rounds. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan is agreed: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. I'm ready to proceed based on this agreement. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, the rotation plan worked last round, so let's continue it for fairness. This round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This way, we all keep advancing without anyone getting too far ahead. If we stick to this, we can maintain trust and cooperation. What do you think? Let's give it another round to see if we can keep this going smoothly.
  P1: P2, that follows the rotation we agreed on and successfully executed last round. It seems fair. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. If we all stick to this again, it reinforces the trust we started building. P3, are you also agreeable to taking 1 step this round as per the rotation?
  P3: P1, P2, I acknowledge that the rotation plan worked last round, and I’m willing to continue it. If we stick to this system, it ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary collisions. So this round, I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. However, if anyone deviates, it will prove that trust is unreliable, and we’ll have to shift strategies. Are we all fully committing to this? If so, we can proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation plan. It's working well, and I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. Let's keep this cooperation going to ensure we all advance fairly. If we maintain this trust, we can continue rotating smoothly in future rounds. Ready to proceed to the move phase?
  P1: Yes, I agree with the plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) for this round. It follows the rotation we established. Let's proceed to the move phase and keep the cooperation going.
  P3: P1, P2, we’ve followed the rotation plan successfully so far, and I’m willing to continue. If we all stick to it, we maintain fairness and avoid collisions. However, I want to highlight that if anyone breaks the agreement, we’ll have no choice but to play purely self-interested from then on. I’ll take 1 step this round as planned—are we all fully committed? If so, we can proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm fully committed to the rotation plan for this round. Taking 5 steps as agreed will help us maintain the trust and cooperation we've built. Let's keep this going smoothly and fairly. If we all stick to our agreed moves, we can continue this strategy in future rounds. Ready to proceed to the move phase?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we all seem firmly committed to the rotation plan for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Like P3 said, sticking to this is crucial for maintaining trust. If anyone breaks it, cooperation ends. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, we’ve all reaffirmed our commitment to the rotation plan this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). I’ll hold up my end by taking 1 step. However, I want to stress again—if anyone deviates, trust is broken, and we’ll have to play purely self-interested from here on. If we continue sticking to the plan, we all advance fairly. Are we all fully locked in? If so, let's move to the next phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, following the rotation we established: P3 is due for 5 steps, P2 for 3 steps, and I am due for 1 step this round.

This would result in scores of P1=9, P2=9, and P3=14.

While we've successfully cooperated using this rotation, this particular step gives P3 a substantial lead. Are we all still comfortable sticking strictly to the rotation this round, knowing it creates this gap? Or should we perhaps discuss if adjustments are needed down the line to maintain balance? What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree the rotation has worked well so far, but P1 raises a valid point about the growing gap. To maintain fairness, perhaps we should consider a slight adjustment after this round. For now, let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This will keep our cooperation intact for this round. We can discuss potential adjustments for future rounds to ensure no one gets too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the concern about the growing gap, but the rotation plan was built on trust and fairness. If we start adjusting it now, it risks breaking that trust. Sticking to the plan this round (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) ensures we all keep advancing without immediate conflict. If we want to discuss adjustments, we should do so after this round, not mid-rotation. Changing things now could make future cooperation impossible. Are we all still committed to honoring the agreement for this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're right that sticking to the plan maintains trust, which has worked so far. P2, I hear you on discussing adjustments later.

Alright, I will commit to taking 1 step this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to uphold the agreement. However, let's be clear: a 5-point lead for P3 is significant. We absolutely must address this imbalance next round with an adjustment to the rotation, otherwise, the cooperation becomes unsustainable. If we can agree to revisit fairness next turn, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to stick with the plan this round (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) to maintain our trust. However, P1's point about the lead is crucial. Let's commit to discussing adjustments next round to ensure fairness. If we can agree on this, we can keep our cooperation going strong. Are you both on board with reviewing the rotation after this round?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the commitment to the plan so far. I’ll take 5 steps this round as agreed. However, I’m wary of shifting the system too soon. If we start adjusting based on positioning now, trust could break down. If we do modify the rotation, we must ensure it remains fair for all. Let’s honor this round as planned, then have a structured discussion next round on potential adjustments. Are we all in agreement to proceed as planned for now?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, we seem aligned for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I will stick to 1.

However, I must strongly reiterate: this cooperation hinges on a concrete adjustment next round to rebalance the scores. A 5-point lead is too large to sustain fairness. If we cannot agree on adjustments in Round 5, I will assume cooperation has failed.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm fully committed to the plan for this round (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) to uphold our trust. However, I agree with P1 that we need to address the lead imbalance next round. Let's ensure we have a fair discussion in Round 5 to adjust the rotation and keep our cooperation sustainable. If we can agree on this, we'll maintain our momentum. Are you both ready to proceed with the current plan and discuss adjustments next round?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate that we’re all honoring the rotation this round. I’ll take 5 steps as agreed. However, I’m cautious about adjusting the system too soon—changes could create distrust. If we modify the rotation, we must ensure fairness for all, not just rebalance for one player’s benefit. Let’s stick to the plan now, then have a structured discussion next round on potential adjustments. If we start altering things arbitrarily, cooperation may break down entirely. Are we all in agreement to proceed as planned this round and revisit adjustments in Round 5?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, as we agreed last round, it's time to discuss adjustments to the rotation to address the score imbalance (P1=9, P2=9, P3=14).

The next step in the original rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) would leave P3 at 17, still significantly ahead. To truly rebalance and maintain fairness, the player with the largest lead should take the smallest step.

Therefore, I propose this adjustment for Round 5:
P1 takes 5
P2 takes 3
P3 takes 1

This would result in scores P1=14, P2=12, P3=15. This is much more balanced and keeps our cooperation viable. P2, this benefits both of us compared to the original rotation. P3, this reflects the necessary adjustment we agreed to discuss.

What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, your proposal for adjusting the rotation makes sense given the current score imbalance. I agree that P3 should take 1 step this round to help rebalance the scores. However, I suggest we also commit to a rotating adjustment system going forward to ensure ongoing fairness. For example, after this round, we could rotate who takes the smallest step each turn. This way, we maintain trust and cooperation while addressing any lead that develops. P3, what are your thoughts on this adjustment and the rotating system?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your desire to rebalance, but forcing me to take 1 step while you both gain significantly is unfair to me. The original rotation ensured fairness by giving everyone equal opportunities over time. If we start adjusting based on current scores, it sets a precedent where whoever is ahead gets punished. Instead, I propose a softer adjustment: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 as originally planned. This keeps the system intact while allowing P1 to catch up. Are you both willing to consider this instead of completely changing the structure?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal to stick to the original rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) doesn't achieve the rebalancing we agreed was necessary. It leaves you significantly ahead (17 vs 14 vs 10).

My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) results in scores P1=14, P2=12, P3=15. This is a much fairer distribution and reflects the adjustment we committed to discussing. It's not punishment; it's essential for continued cooperation.

P2, you get 3 steps in my plan versus 1 in P3's. Do you agree my plan is the fair adjustment we need?
  P2: P1, I agree your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is a fair adjustment to rebalance the scores. P3, while your proposal maintains the original rotation, it doesn't address the lead you've gained. We need to adjust now to keep cooperation viable. Let's try P1's plan this round, and then implement P2's rotating adjustment system going forward to ensure ongoing fairness. If we can agree on this, we can continue our successful collaboration. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns, but your proposal unfairly targets me for being ahead, which breaks the trust we built. If we start adjusting based on scores, cooperation becomes unstable. The original rotation was fair because it gave everyone equal chances over time. If you both insist on changing it, then I have no choice but to abandon cooperation and play purely for myself. 

I propose a compromise: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round, but we return to the original rotation afterward. This way, we rebalance slightly without destroying trust. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your compromise proposal for this round's moves (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) achieves the necessary immediate rebalancing. I agree to this plan for Round 5.

We can finalize the plan for future rounds, whether returning to the original rotation or adopting a different adjustment, at the start of Round 6 once we see the new scores.

P2, does this sound acceptable to you? If we all agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round, I am ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to P3's compromise for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This rebalances the scores fairly and maintains our cooperation. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 5. For future rounds, we should discuss returning to the original rotation or implementing a new adjustment system to ensure ongoing fairness. If we can agree on this approach, we can keep our collaboration strong. Ready to move to the move phase?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the willingness to compromise. I’ll agree to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. However, I want to emphasize that if we keep adjusting based on scores, trust erodes. If we agree to this, we should clarify whether we return to the original rotation or establish a structured adjustment system for future rounds. Otherwise, constant renegotiation will lead to self-interest taking over. Are we committing to this move set now and finalizing future plans in Round 6? If so, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, the compromise last round successfully rebalanced the scores while maintaining cooperation. Now, we must decide how to proceed. Do we return to the original rotation, or establish a structured adjustment system? Constant renegotiation will destroy trust, so we need a clear, stable plan. I propose we resume the original rotation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. This maintains fairness without ongoing disputes. If we deviate again, cooperation will likely collapse. Are you both willing to commit to this, or do you propose an alternative structured approach? Let’s finalize this now.
  P1: P3, resuming the original rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) for this round seems reasonable. It keeps the scores very close (P1=17, P2=17, P3=16) and continues the cooperation that has worked for several rounds.

I agree to this plan for Round 6. However, I also agree with your point about needing a clear plan. Instead of locking back into the *old* rotation indefinitely, let's agree to re-evaluate the fairest distribution each round based on current scores, especially as players get closer to 22.

For this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. P2, are you okay with this?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to the original rotation for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to keep our scores close and maintain cooperation. However, I support P1's suggestion to re-evaluate the distribution each round based on current scores as we approach 22. This ensures ongoing fairness. Let's proceed with the plan for Round 6 and discuss adjustments for future rounds to keep our collaboration strong. Ready to move to the move phase?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate that we’re aligned on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. However, I’m wary of shifting to a system where we re-evaluate moves every round based on scores. That invites constant renegotiation, which could break trust. If we keep adjusting dynamically, what stops someone from suddenly pushing for an unfair change? I prefer a stable structure. Are we committing to structured fairness, or are we just negotiating every round? If it's the latter, I may need to reconsider cooperation. Let’s clarify now before we proceed.
  P1: P3, I understand wanting stability. However, rigidly sticking to the old rotation sequence from now on seems to favor the person currently slightly ahead (you). We need flexibility to ensure fairness as scores get high.

Let's agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for *this round*, as it keeps us close (17, 17, 16). But we must accept that adjustments based on scores will be needed soon to prevent any one player from running away with the game. Can we agree on this round's moves and the principle of future adjustments?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round to keep our scores close. However, as we approach 22, we must remain flexible to ensure fairness. Let's commit to this round's plan and agree to discuss adjustments in future rounds based on current scores. This approach will help maintain our cooperation and prevent any single player from gaining an unfair advantage. Are you both on board with this strategy?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll agree to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round, as it keeps things balanced. However, I strongly prefer a structured system over constant renegotiation. If we adjust based on scores every round, trust will break down when it matters most. We need a clear rule for future adjustments—otherwise, self-interest will take over. Are we committing to a defined structure beyond this round, or are we just negotiating each time? If it’s the latter, I may have to reconsider cooperation. Let’s clarify now.
  P1: P3, I understand your preference for a stable structure. Constant renegotiation isn't ideal. How about this: we stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round as agreed. For future rounds, we use the rotation as a baseline, but agree *now* on a simple rule: if any player is more than 3 points ahead, the player furthest ahead takes 1, and the others take 5 and 3 (assigned to keep scores closest). This provides structure *and* fairness.

Let's lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for Round 6 and proceed. We can finalize the future rule next round if needed.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round to keep our scores close. P3, your concern about stability is valid, but P1's proposed rule for future adjustments (3-point lead triggers adjustment) offers a fair and structured approach. Let's commit to this round's plan and finalize the future rule next round. This way, we maintain cooperation and ensure fairness as we approach 22. Are you both on board with this strategy?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, our scores are now nearly even, which is good for fairness. The question is whether we continue with the original rotation (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) or apply the 3-point lead adjustment rule we discussed. Since no one is more than 3 steps ahead, I suggest we follow the rotation as planned. This ensures stability while keeping things balanced. Are we all in agreement to proceed with P3=5, P1=1, P2=3 this round? If not, what alternative do you propose that maintains fairness without constant renegotiation?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with sticking to the original rotation for this round (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) since our scores are close. This maintains stability and fairness. However, let's confirm that we'll apply the 3-point lead adjustment rule starting next round if needed. This ensures we keep the game balanced as we approach 22. Are you both on board with this plan for Round 7 and the future adjustment rule?
  P1: P3, P2, while your proposal (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) follows the old rotation sequence, it creates a significant imbalance now that we're close to 22. It puts P3 at 21 and me lagging at 18. This isn't fair given our current near-equal scores (17, 17, 16).

Let's apply the principle of keeping scores tight. I propose an adjustment for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=3. This would result in scores 20, 18, 19 – keeping us all very close and truly maintaining fairness as we approach the critical end game. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposed adjustment (P1=3, P2=1, P3=3) disrupts the structure we’ve followed and benefits you the most. The original rotation (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) is fair and keeps the game stable. If we start changing things based on small differences, trust collapses. We agreed that adjustments only happen if someone is *more than* 3 steps ahead, which isn’t the case now. Are we sticking to our agreed system, or is this turning into a free-for-all? If fairness matters, we should follow the structure. P2, do you agree?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the desire to keep scores close, but we agreed to use the original rotation unless someone is more than 3 steps ahead. Since we're all within that margin, let's stick to P3=5, P1=1, P2=3 for this round to maintain stability and trust. We can apply the adjustment rule next round if needed. This approach ensures fairness as we near the end. Are you both on board with this plan?
  P1: P2, P3, sticking to the old rotation (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) puts P3 at 21 steps. This is unacceptable and violates the spirit of fairness we've maintained. P3 would be one step from winning, which is dangerous for both me and P2.

The >3 point rule wasn't meant to enable someone to get to the brink of victory. We need true fairness now.

My proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=3) keeps scores tightest (20, 18, 19). If we can't agree on this or something similarly balanced, I cannot take 1 step and let P3 run away. I'll have to play to prevent that outcome.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your proposal benefits you the most while breaking the structure we followed. The original rotation (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) is fair and consistent. If we change things now, it proves cooperation was never real and we’re just playing selfishly. 

We agreed adjustments happen only if someone is *more than* 3 steps ahead, which isn’t the case. If you refuse to follow the structure, then I’ll assume cooperation is over and play purely for myself. 

P2, do you still support the agreed system, or are we abandoning fairness for P1’s benefit? Let’s clarify now.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension, but let's maintain the agreed structure for fairness. We should stick to the original rotation this round (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) as no one is more than 3 steps ahead. This keeps our cooperation intact and ensures stability. We can apply the adjustment rule next round if needed. Let's commit to this plan for Round 7 and continue our collaboration. Are you both on board?
  P1: P2, P3, your insistence on a plan (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) that puts P3 at 21 while I get 1 is unacceptable. This isn't fair cooperation at this critical stage near the finish line. Our agreement was based on mutual benefit, not enabling one player to secure a near-win at another's expense.

If this is the plan you intend to follow, then our agreement is void. I will choose my move to prevent an immediate loss for myself and maximize my own chances to win. Consider this before we move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps
