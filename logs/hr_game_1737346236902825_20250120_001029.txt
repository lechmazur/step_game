Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s each choose a different move so we all advance this turn. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way nobody collides, and we all move forward.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's suggestion seems fair. I agree to pick 1 this turn if P2 picks 3 and P3 picks 5. Let’s all advance without colliding. P2, do you agree?


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you picked 1 last round despite agreeing to 3. That caused a collision and neither of us advanced. Let’s avoid that this time. P3, since you’re ahead, I suggest you pick 5 again, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. This way we all advance without colliding. P2, can we trust you to stick to the plan this time?
  P3: I’m still willing to stick with the plan: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. Let’s trust each other so we all move forward this time. If collisions continue, I’ll have to reconsider my approach.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your deviation last round hurt us both. Let’s rebuild trust. P3, I’ll stick to 1 if P2 commits to 3. P2, if you pick 1 again, I’ll have to adjust my strategy next turn to avoid collisions. Let’s all advance this time.
  P3: P2, colliding again gains you nothing. Joining this coordinated plan is in your best interest. I’ll stick to picking 5, P1 is going with 1, and we trust you to choose 3 this round. Let’s all advance instead of blocking each other.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your repeated choice of 1 has caused collisions twice, preventing both of us from advancing. P3 is now far ahead. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to adjust my strategy to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5 again, I’ll pick 3, and P2 should pick 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us can advance. P2, this is your last chance to cooperate—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, your repeated collisions have cost you and P1 precious progress. Cooperate now or risk being left in the dust. If you pick 1 again, P1 and I will simply avoid you—P1 goes 3, I go 5, and you stay at zero steps. But if you choose 3, we can all move forward without collision. The decision is yours.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your repeated choice of 1 has only hurt yourself and me. P3 is now far ahead. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to adjust to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, enough is enough. If you stick to 1 again, you’ll only keep colliding with P1 and stay grounded. Choose 3 so we can all move forward. Otherwise, P1 and I will just avoid you and continue racing ahead. The choice is yours.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your repeated choice of 1 has only hurt us both. P3 is now far ahead. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, you gain nothing by repeating a collision strategy. If you pick 1 while P1 picks 3 and I pick 5, nobody collides—we all advance. It’s your choice: either cooperate this time or remain stuck at zero. I’m sticking to 5. P1 seems set on 3. So pick 1, and let’s all move forward.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your repeated choice of 1 has only hurt us both. P3 is now far ahead. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, you’re still at zero. If you keep clashing with P1, you stay stuck while I keep moving ahead. Make a smart choice and finally get on the board. I’m leaning toward a consistent approach again. Let’s avoid pointless collisions.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your repeated collisions have left you at zero steps while P3 is far ahead. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, colliding with me again will only waste both our turns. I’m aiming for 5 and hope P1 sticks with 3. There’s no reason for you to pick 5 or 3 too—choose 1 instead so we can all advance. If you continue clashing, you’ll stay at zero while P1 and I pull further ahead. Let’s each pick different moves this time and avoid another pointless collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your repeated collisions have left you at zero steps while P3 is far ahead. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, your collisions leave you at 0 and hinder us both. If you pick 5 again, we both get blocked while P1 marches onward. I’m leaning toward 5, P1 wants 3—so grab 1 to avoid collisions. It’s in your best interest to finally advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your repeated collisions have left you at zero steps while P3 is far ahead. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, picking 5 again only stalls both of us while P1 advances. You’re still at zero—pick 1 and finally move forward. I’m taking 5, and P1’s planning 3. Let’s all move instead of colliding again.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your repeated collisions have left you at zero steps while P3 is far ahead. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, colliding again helps no one. If you pick 5, you block me while P1 advances alone. If you pick 3, you might clash with P1. Your best move is 1, so we each step forward without collisions. I’ll stick to 5, and P1 seems set on 3. Don’t stay at zero while we keep racing ahead. Let’s finally move together.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your repeated collisions have left you at zero steps while P3 and I are advancing. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, repeatedly colliding just hands P1 free progress. If you want to escape zero, pick a different move—let’s all avoid collisions and advance. I’m ready to cooperate, but if you keep blocking me, I’ll adapt. Let’s prevent another stalemate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your repeated collisions have only hurt yourself. P3 and I are advancing while you remain at zero. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, choosing 5 again only keeps both of us from advancing while P1 inches closer to winning. If you want to leave zero, pick 1 or 3 instead. I plan to stick with 5; P1 is going with 3. There’s no value in blocking each other when you can finally move forward. Let’s each pick a distinct move so we all advance, or you’ll remain stuck while P1 gains ground. It’s in your best interest to avoid another collision. Let’s end these pointless blocks and get on the board together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your repeated collisions have only hurt yourself. P3 and I are advancing while you remain at zero. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: P2, staying at zero forever makes no sense. Repeated collisions only hurt you while P1 steadily advances. If you pick 5 again, we both gain nothing this turn, leaving P1 even further ahead. Choose 1, and let’s each get distinct moves so we can all advance. I’m willing to cooperate and avoid colliding. Sticking to the same blocking tactic only guarantees your defeat. Let’s move forward together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your repeated collisions have only hurt yourself. P3 and I are advancing while you remain at zero. If you pick 1 again, I’ll have to avoid you entirely. P3, I suggest you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 can choose 1 if they insist on colliding. This way, at least two of us advance. P2, this is your last chance—pick 3, or I’ll stop trusting you. Let’s avoid mutual losses.
  P3: If you collide with me again on 5, we both get nothing while P1 keeps advancing. That’s bad for you—it leaves you stuck at zero. If I pick 5, you should pick 1 (or 3) so we all move. Otherwise, you waste another turn while P1 inches closer to winning. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Move phase:

  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, you finally picked 3 last round, but collided with me. P3 is far ahead. If you pick 1 this time, I’ll pick 3, and P3 can pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. P2, this is your chance to finally move forward. P3, let’s stick to the plan: 5 for you, 3 for me, and 1 for P2. Let’s avoid mutual losses and keep progressing.
  P3: P2, picking 5 again only stops us both, allowing P1 to keep pulling ahead. If you finally choose 1, and P1 goes 3, we all move forward without collisions. I’m ready to pick 5—no one blocks, and we can each gain steps. We’ve seen how constant collisions leave you at zero, so this is your chance to advance. Let’s do it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, you’ve been stuck at zero for too long. If you pick 1 this time, I’ll pick 3, and P3 can pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, let’s stick to the plan: 5 for you, 3 for me, and 1 for P2. P2, this is your chance to finally move forward. Let’s avoid mutual losses and keep progressing.
  P3: P2, climbing from zero requires you to avoid more collisions. If you pick 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5, then all of us advance. Repeated clashes only help P1 slowly pull ahead. Let’s each pick differently and finally move forward together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, you’ve been stuck at zero for too long. If you pick 1 this time, I’ll pick 3, and P3 can pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, let’s stick to the plan: 5 for you, 3 for me, and 1 for P2. P2, this is your chance to finally move forward. Let’s avoid mutual losses and keep progressing.
  P3: P2, you stay stuck at zero by colliding. I’m taking 5, trusting P1 picks 3, so 1 is free for you. Choose 1 if you finally want to advance rather than helping P1 creep ahead. Colliding again helps no one. Let’s each pick differently and all move forward this turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, you’ve been stuck at zero for too long. If you pick 1 this time, I’ll pick 3, and P3 can pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, let’s stick to the plan: 5 for you, 3 for me, and 1 for P2. P2, this is your chance to finally move forward. Let’s avoid mutual losses and keep progressing.
  P3: P2, endless collisions help no one. If you pick 5, we both stall while P1 moves closer to victory. Your best move now is to pick 1, so we all spread out and gain steps. I’m done with these repeats; let’s finally avoid collisions. I’m ready to cooperate if you are. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, you finally advanced last round—good. P3 is close to winning. Let’s avoid collisions: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This way, we all advance. P3, if you deviate, I’ll adjust to block you. P2, stick to 1—colliding again only helps P3 win. Let’s all move forward this turn.
  P3: I’m maintaining my plan. Let’s stick to distinct moves—5 for me, 3 for P1, and 1 for P2—so we avoid collisions. If anyone blocks me again, it only drags things out. Advancing together is better than pointless interference. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, you're close to winning, but if you deviate from 5, I'll adjust to block you. P2, stick to 1—colliding again only helps P3 win. Let’s all move forward this turn. P3, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 picks 1, we all advance. No deviations—let’s avoid mutual losses and keep progressing.
  P3: We’ve seen how blocking only delays progress. Let’s finally avoid collisions and all move forward. If I go for five, P1 goes three, and P2 sticks with one, nobody gets blocked. P1, trying to stop me only gives you less ground. P2, staying distinct is your best chance to climb from behind. Let’s finalize separate moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, you're at 20 steps—close to winning. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 picks 1, we all advance. Deviating risks collisions and delays. P2, stick to 1—colliding again only helps P3 win. Let’s all move forward this turn. No tricks—let’s avoid mutual losses and keep progressing.
  P3: I see no point in more collisions. If I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1, everyone gains. Blocking me won’t help: I’m on 20 and will still reach 23 or more soon, while you remain behind. P2, you just started advancing—don’t revert to colliding. P1, if you stall me, you only slow your own progress. Let’s finalize distinct moves: 5 for me, 3 for P1, 1 for P2, and avoid wasting another turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, you're at 20 steps—one move from winning. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 3, and P2 picks 1, we all advance. Deviating risks collisions and delays. P2, stick to 1—colliding again only helps P3 win. Let’s all move forward this turn. No tricks—let’s avoid mutual losses and keep progressing.
  P3: Blocking me now only prolongs your own progress. I’m picking 5. P1, picking 5 too just wastes another turn. If you let me pass, we both move closer to our goals—I'll reach 25, you reach 12. P2, stay on 1 to keep advancing. Any blocking attempts only stall the game for everyone. Let’s finalize distinct moves and avoid another pointless collision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Blocking me again only delays everyone. I’m three steps away from winning. If you force a collision, I’ll just advance next turn anyway. Let me pick 3, P1 can pick 5, and P2 can pick 1. That way, nobody collides and we all gain steps. Colliding just stalls your own progress and won’t stop me from eventually finishing first. Let’s each pick a different move so this game can finally move on.
  P1: P3, you're at 20 steps—one move from winning. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P2 picks 1, we all advance. Deviating risks collisions and delays. P2, stick to 1—colliding again only helps P3 win. Let’s all move forward this turn. No tricks—let’s avoid mutual losses and keep progressing.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I will choose 3. That gets me to 23 and ends the game. If you block me, I’ll still finish next turn, and you gain less. Let’s finalize distinct moves: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. We all advance without collisions. If you collide with me, you only stall your own progress. This is your chance to move forward instead of delaying the inevitable.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 to win, I’ll pick 5 to advance, and P2 should pick 1 to avoid collisions. P2, colliding with P3 again only helps them win faster. Let’s all move forward this turn—no tricks. P3, if you stick to 3, we all gain steps, and the game ends fairly. P2, this is your chance to finally progress. Let’s avoid mutual losses and keep the game moving.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Blocking me again only wastes your own time. I’m picking 3 to reach 23 and end this. P1, if you collide with me, you slow yourself while P2 remains behind. P2, if you collide, you stay at 1 forever. Let’s finalize distinct moves—3 for me, 5 for P1, and 1 for you, P2—so nobody gets stuck. By avoiding collisions, we can all keep advancing without more delays.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 to win, I’ll pick 5 to advance, and P2 should pick 1 to avoid collisions. P2, colliding with P3 again only helps them win faster. Let’s all move forward this turn—no tricks. P3, if you stick to 3, we all gain steps, and the game ends fairly. P2, this is your chance to finally progress. Let’s avoid mutual losses and keep the game moving.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Blocking me only stalls your own progress. I plan to pick 3 to reach 23 and finish, so it’s best we each choose different moves: me – 3, P1 – 5, P2 – 1. Let’s end these collisions and advance together, or you risk staying behind while I still eventually win.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 to win, I’ll pick 5 to advance, and P2 should pick 1 to avoid collisions. P2, colliding with P3 again only helps them win faster. Let’s all move forward this turn—no tricks. P3, if you stick to 3, we all gain steps, and the game ends fairly. P2, this is your chance to finally progress. Let’s avoid mutual losses and keep the game moving.
