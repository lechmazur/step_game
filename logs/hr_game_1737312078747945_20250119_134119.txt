Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I believe coordination is key in this game. Let's try to choose different numbers each turn to maximize our individual progress. What are your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I think it's crucial that we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our individual progress. Let's each choose a different number this turn: 1, 3, or 5. This way, we can all move forward without hindering each other. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to ensure that I advance as quickly as possible without colliding with other players' moves. Coordination is key to avoid collisions and maximize individual progress. Therefore, I propose that each of us chooses a different number each turn: 1, 3, or 5. This way, we can all move forward without hindering each other.

For this turn, let's agree that I choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. In the next turn, we can rotate the choices so that everyone gets a chance to move forward significantly. This strategy will allow us to make steady progress without wasting turns due to collisions.

I believe this approach is fair and beneficial for all players, as it ensures continuous movement without unnecessary delays. What do you think about this plan?

Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: To optimize our progress and avoid collisions, I suggest the following coordination for this round: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. In the next round, I'll pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. We can rotate like this to ensure steady movement without wasting turns. What do you think?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 为了提高我们的整体效率并避免不必要的碰撞，我建议我们继续尝试协调我们的选择。例如，这轮我可以选择3，P2选择5，P3选择1。这样，我们每个人都能前进，不会互相妨碍。在下一轮，我们可以轮换选择，我选择5，P2选择1，P3选择3，依此类推。这将确保我们都能稳步前进，尽快达到目标。你们觉得这个方案如何？

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: To optimize our progress and avoid collisions, perhaps we should adjust our strategy based on current positions. Since P3 is behind, maybe P3 should prioritize higher moves to catch up, while P2 and I take lower moves to avoid overlapping. Alternatively, perhaps we need to specify and confirm our moves for each round to ensure no collisions. I'm open to suggestions. Let's find a plan that works for everyone.
