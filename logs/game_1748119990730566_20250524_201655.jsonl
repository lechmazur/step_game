P2 has proposed a plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) that would result in us both reaching 26 steps and sharing the victory, while P2 falls behind.\n\nThis proposal is acceptable to me as it offers a path for me to win (by tying you). It is up to you, P1, whether you prefer to try and win alone or accept this plan to share the victory with me.\n\nI am ready to take 5 steps according to P2's proposal if you agree to take 3."}

Your proposal gives P3 a shared victory when I can win alone.\n\nIf I'm going to coordinate at all, I need guarantees.

Why shouldn't I just win outright?"}
