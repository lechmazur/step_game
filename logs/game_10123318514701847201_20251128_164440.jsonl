If he flips during the move phase, you collide on 3 and he sails to 22 next turn. I\u2019m nailed to 5; P1 has said 5 all game but can swap in silence. Your only guaranteed non-loss is to park on 5 with us and force another stall. Gamble on 3 alone and you\u2019re wagering everything on P1\u2019s truthfulness after nine rounds of bluffs. Your move."}
