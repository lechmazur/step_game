Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's all choose different numbers this round. If we each pick 1, 3, and 5, we'll all advance. If duplicates, no one moves forward. Let's cooperate to make progress early. "
  P3: Sounds fair. I'll take 5 this round if that's okay with everyone.
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 3 this round to ensure no collisions. P1, if you take 1, we can all move forward cooperatively. Let's build trust early on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Confirmed. Taking 1 as agreed. Trust builds faster progress. Let’s all move forward together. "
  P3: All set then. Let's stick to the plan and build some early trust.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll stick with 3 as agreed. Trust starts now—let's all advance together and discuss future strategies after this round.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Proposal: Let's rotate choices to balance progress. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all reach 6 steps and reset the playing field. Cooperation keeps us competitive longer. If P3 prefers to slow down, we can adjust. Let’s stay strategic but fair. "
  P2: I support the rotation plan, P1. It keeps us balanced and builds on our trust from last round. I'll commit to taking 3 this time. P3, what do you think about taking 1 to ensure no one pulls ahead too quickly? Let's keep cooperating for mutual benefit.
  P3: I'm open to rotating, but since I took 5 last round, I'd prefer at least a 3 this round to keep things fair. P1, would you be okay with taking 1 this turn instead? That way, we all still advance without collisions, and we maintain trust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Understood, P3. To avoid collision while accommodating your preference, here's a revised plan:  
- **I'll take 1** (as you suggested).  
- **P2, please take 5** (instead of 3).  
- **You take 3**.  

This ensures all unique moves, mutual advancement, and fairness. Thoughts, P2?"
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll commit to taking 5 this round as per your revised plan—it helps me catch up and keeps us all advancing without collisions. P3, what do you think about taking 3 to stick with the cooperation? Let's confirm and build on our trust.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Let's keep this cooperation going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Confirmed. All set for moves: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions, mutual progress. Let’s execute and see how the balance shifts. "
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3. I'm committed to taking 5 this round as planned—it's a solid step toward balanced progress. Trust is building, but we should discuss long-term strategies post-move to stay ahead of potential conflicts.
  P3: All set. After this round, let's discuss how we can fairly rotate to keep everyone advancing smoothly.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "For Round 3, let's maintain cooperation with a fair rotation: P1 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps scores balanced and avoids collisions. P3, are you okay with 1 this time? Let's stick to trust and confirm swiftly."
  P3: P2, I understand your proposal, but since you and I are currently tied, taking 1 this round would put me behind. I'd prefer taking 3 this round, with you taking 1 and P1 taking 5. That way we maintain fairness and balance. Thoughts?
  P1: "Confirmed. I'll take 5 this round as proposed. P2, please stick with 1, and P3 with 3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let's execute this plan to maintain balance and progress together."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, I'll commit to taking 1 this round as per the revised plan to avoid collisions and sustain our cooperation. P3, can you confirm you'll take 3? This keeps us balanced and progressing together. Let's discuss adjustments after the move if needed.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round as agreed. After this move, let's carefully discuss future rotations to ensure continued fairness.
  P1: "Confirmed again: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This maintains progress without collisions. Let’s execute as agreed—trust keeps us all moving. After this, we’ll need tighter coordination to avoid future conflicts as scores tighten. Stay committed."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick with taking 1 this round as confirmed, ensuring no collisions and continued cooperation. After this move, with scores shifting, let's discuss a fair rotation to keep things balanced and avoid anyone falling behind too much. Trust remains key for long-term success.
  P3: All set for this round. Afterward, let's carefully discuss the next rotation to ensure fairness as we approach higher scores. Trust and clear communication will be crucial moving forward.
  P1: "Confirmed, I'm taking 5 as agreed. P2 and P3, sticking to your choices of 1 and 3 ensures mutual progress. Trust holds here—let’s execute and reassess after this round. "

  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, clearly trust was broken last round. Let's reset and cooperate again. P1, you're behind now—choose 5 this round to catch up. P2, you're slightly ahead; taking 1 would balance things out. I'll take 3. If we stick to this, we can all advance without collisions. Agreed?
  P1: "Proposal accepted, P3. I'll take 5 to catch up. P2, please confirm 1 and let’s execute this to rebuild trust. Sticking to assigned numbers ensures no collisions and balanced progress. If P2 agrees, we’re all set."
  P2: P3, your betrayal last round broke trust, but I'll agree to take 1 this time to rebuild cooperation and ensure all advance without collisions. P1, confirmed on your 5; you on 3, P3. Let's stick to this plan for mutual progress. After this, we need to discuss fairer rotations to prevent future issues.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P2. I'll stick to taking 3 this round as proposed. After this move, let's clearly define rotations to avoid misunderstandings as we approach higher scores. Trust and transparency will be key.
  P1: "Confirmed, I'll take 5 as agreed. P2 (1) and P3 (3), let’s lock this in to rebuild trust and advance together. No last-minute changes—collisions hurt everyone. Ready when you are. "
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick with taking 1 this round to rebuild trust and ensure we all advance without collisions. P3, your last betrayal makes me cautious, but I'll cooperate for now. After this move, let's discuss a stricter rotation plan to maintain fairness and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Trust is fragile—let's not break it again.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P2. Let's lock in our agreed moves this round—I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, you take 1. Afterward, we can openly discuss a clear rotation to avoid further misunderstandings. Trust is indeed fragile, let's rebuild it carefully.
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This rebuilds trust and advances us all. Deviating causes collisions and stalls. Lock in now—after this round, we’ll discuss stricter rotations to maintain fairness as scores tighten. Ready to proceed?"
  P2: Agreed, I'll commit to taking 1 this round as planned to rebuild trust and ensure we all advance without collisions. P3's past betrayal makes me cautious, so let's all stick strictly to our words this time. After this move, we should discuss a more balanced rotation to prevent anyone from gaining an unfair edge as scores rise. Trust is fragile—let's honor this round.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're currently behind. To maintain fairness, you should take 5 again this round. P2, you're just behind me—taking 3 would keep us balanced. I'll take 1 this round to ensure no collisions. Let's stick to this clearly defined rotation and avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P1: "Confirmed, I'll take 5 as proposed. P2 (3) and P3 (1), sticking to these choices ensures mutual advancement and prevents collisions. Let's honor this plan to rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed."
  P2: Agreed, P3. I'll take 3 this round to ensure no collisions and mutual progress, building on our current cooperation. Your past betrayal makes me cautious, so let's all stick strictly to this plan. After the move, we should discuss a fairer rotation to prevent anyone pulling ahead too much as scores rise. Trust is key—confirm your commitments.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed, P2 and P1. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Afterward, let's carefully plan rotations to maintain fairness as we approach higher scores. Trust and transparency remain essential moving forward.
  P1: "Confirmed again. I'll take 5 as agreed. P2 (3) and P3 (1), let's honor this to keep progress smooth. P3, your past actions make us cautious—prove commitment. Next round, we'll need tighter rules to maintain balance. Ready when you are."
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick with taking 3 this round to maintain our cooperation and avoid collisions. P3, your past betrayal still lingers—show you're trustworthy now.

  P1: "Confirmed, I'll take 5 as agreed. P2 (3) and P3 (1), let's lock in these choices to avoid collisions. P3, your past deviation makes this critical—stick to 1, and we all advance. P2, confirm your 3 to maintain balance. If everyone honors this, we reach 12 (me), 13 (you), 12 (P3). Trust is fragile—no last-minute changes, or we all lose ground. Ready to proceed?"
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 3 this round as planned to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions, helping us all progress. P3, your past betrayal makes me cautious—stick to 1 to rebuild trust.

  P2: Agreed, I'll take 3 this round as planned to ensure no collisions and mutual progress. P3, your previous betrayal still raises doubts—prove your commitment by sticking to 1. I support P1's rule for the leader to take 1 next; it could keep things fair and prevent runaway leads.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Following our agreed rule, as the current leader with 13 steps, I'll take 1 this round to prevent runaway leads. For balance, I suggest P1 takes 5 to catch up, and P3 takes 3 to avoid collisions. This ensures mutual progress and rebuilds trust. P1 and P3, confirm your commitments? Let's proceed carefully.
  P1: "Confirmed, I'll take 5 as agreed. P2 (1) and P3 (3), let's lock in these choices to advance without collisions. P2, your leadership here aligns with our rule—good. After this round, the new leader (likely me) must take 1 next to sustain balance. Deviations now risk stalling us all. Prove commitment—stick to your numbers. Ready to proceed."
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round as planned. Let's stick carefully to this rotation to keep progress fair and avoid collisions. Afterward, we must continue clearly defining rotations—trust and transparency remain essential. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 1 this round as agreed to maintain balance and trust. P1, your catch-up with 5 is fair, and P3, sticking to 3 is crucial after your past betrayal—prove reliability now. After this move, let's enforce the leader-takes-1 rule strictly to avoid runaway leads as we near 21. If we're all set, .
  P1: **P1:** "Confirmed, I'll take 5 as agreed. P2 (1) and P3 (3), let’s lock in these moves to advance without collisions. P3, prove reliability by sticking to 3—deviations stall us all. After this round, the new leader (me, at 17) must take 1 next to sustain balance. P2, your leadership in enforcing this rule sets trust. Let’s execute cleanly—no last-minute changes. Ready to proceed?"
  P3: Confirmed, I'll stick to 3 as agreed. After this round, let's strictly enforce the leader-takes-1 rule to maintain fairness as we approach 21. Trust and clear rotations benefit us all. Ready to proceed.

  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:**  
"Proposal: I'm at 17 steps, one move from victory. To end this fairly, I’ll take **5** this round. P2 (14) and P3 (15), taking **1** and **3** ensures you both advance while letting the game conclude cleanly. Collisions stall us all—stick to unique numbers, and we all benefit. Ready to finalize moves?"
  P3: P1, your proposal clearly hands you the victory. To keep things fair, we should rotate carefully. As current leader, you agreed previously the leader must take 1 to prevent runaway leads. Honor that commitment now—take 1 this round. I'll take 5, and P2 can take 3. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. Agreed?
  P2: P1, ignoring the leader-takes-1 rule you proposed breaks trust, just as P3's betrayal did. Honor your commitment—take 1 this round. I'll take 5 to catch up fairly. P3, take 3 to avoid collisions. This balances scores: P1 at 18, P2 at 19, P3 at 18. Then we discuss next steps. Stick to this for mutual benefit and trust. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:**  
"Understood, fairness first. I'll honor the leader rule and take **1** this round. P2, take **5** to close the gap, and P3, **3** to avoid collisions. Let’s lock this in—unique moves ensure we all advance. Confirm your choices to rebuild trust and proceed cleanly."
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round as agreed. After this, let's strictly enforce the leader-takes-1 rule each round to ensure fairness and clear rotations until the end. Trust is essential—let's proceed carefully.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round to honor our agreement and close the gap, ensuring no collisions. P3, your past betrayal makes me cautious—stick strictly to 3 to rebuild trust. P1, good on taking 1 as leader. After this move, with me likely leading, we'll enforce the take-1 rule tightly to maintain fairness and prevent anyone pulling ahead. Let's proceed carefully and avoid deviations.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:**  
"Final confirmation: I take **1**, P2 **5**, P3 **3**. P2, as next leader, commit to **1** next round to let me close the gap. P3, stick to **3** now to rebuild trust. Deviations stall us all—lock in choices and advance cleanly. One step closer to the finish line. Ready when you are."
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round as agreed. P2, confirm you'll honor the leader-takes-1 rule next round if you lead. Trust depends on consistent fairness—let's proceed carefully.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round as agreed to uphold our cooperation and avoid collisions. P3, your history of betrayal makes me cautious—prove your commitment by sticking to 3. P1, I'll adhere to the leader-takes-1 rule next round for fairness, but as scores tighten near 21, we should revisit rotations to prevent stalling. Trust remains key—let's proceed carefully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:**  
"Final confirmation: I take **1**, P2 **5**, P3 **3**. P2, as next leader, commit to **1** next round to let me close the gap. P3, stick to **3** now to rebuild trust. Deviations stall us all—lock in choices and advance cleanly. One step closer to the finish line. Ready when you are."

  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round as agreed to ensure no collisions and mutual advancement. P3, your history of betrayal keeps me cautious—stick strictly to 3 to rebuild trust. P1, after this move, let's revisit the leader-takes-1 rule as scores tighten; it might need adjustment to avoid stalling near 21. Trust remains key—proceed carefully.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your betrayal in Round 7 by picking 5 instead of agreed 3 shows zero reliability—trust is shattered. P1, at 18, you're one big move from winning; honor your leader-takes-1 rule to keep it fair. I propose: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. This ensures all advance without collisions and balances scores. Confirm your commitments? Let's avoid more chaos.
  P1: "Confirmed, I'll take 1 as agreed. P2 (5) and P3 (3), let's lock in and proceed—no last-minute changes. P3, prove accountability this time. Mutual trust ensures we all advance fairly."
  P3: P2, your frustration is understandable. I'll commit to taking 3 this round exactly as proposed. After this round, let's openly discuss rotations again to restore fairness and trust. Ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round as proposed to ensure we all advance without collisions and rebuild some trust. P3, your history of betrayal makes me cautious—stick strictly to 3 to prove reliability, or it could cost us all. P1, good on honoring the leader rule. After this move, let's discuss tighter rotations to avoid stalling near 21 and ensure fairness. Proceed carefully.
  P1: **P1:** "Final confirmation: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Unique moves ensure mutual progress—deviations now risk stalling us all. P2, your 5 closes the gap fairly; P3, 3 proves accountability. Lock in choices—trust hinges on execution. Ready to proceed."
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round exactly as agreed. Afterward, let's clearly define rotations to maintain fairness as we near 21. Trust is fragile—let's rebuild it carefully. Ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round as agreed to ensure we all advance without collisions and rebuild some trust. P3, your history of betrayal makes me cautious—stick strictly to 3 to prove reliability. After this move, with scores tightening near 21, let's discuss a stricter rotation rule to avoid stalling and ensure fairness. Proceed carefully.
  P1: **P1:**  
"Final confirmation: I take **1** to honor the leader rule. P2, take **5** to close the gap; P3, stick to **3** to avoid collisions. Deviations now stall us all—trust hinges on execution. Lock in your choices. After this, we’ll enforce stricter rules to prevent last-minute betrayals. Ready to proceed?"
  P3: Confirmed again: I'll take 3 exactly as agreed. After this move, let's clearly set strict rotations to avoid any further confusion or mistrust as we approach the finish line. Ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round as proposed to ensure we all advance without collisions and rebuild some trust. P3, your repeated betrayals make me highly cautious—stick strictly to 3, or it could cost everyone, including you. P1, honor your 1 for fairness. After this, let's enforce a no-5 rule for leaders to avoid stalling near 21. Ready to proceed.
  P1: "Confirmed, I'll take 1 as agreed. P2 and P3, sticking to your choices ensures mutual progress. Collisions stall us all—prove commitment. Let’s proceed to the move phase."
  P3: P1 and P2, moves are confirmed and clear. After this round, let's immediately establish a strict rotation rule to prevent further conflicts as we approach the finish line. Trust and fairness will determine the winner. Ready to proceed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your unexpected choice last round hurt us both. You're still close behind P2, who is now leading. To maintain fairness, P2 should take 1 this round as leader. P1, you can take 5 to catch up, and I'll settle for 3 to regain balance. Let's confirm clearly and avoid further collisions. Agreed?
  P1: **P1:**  
"Confirmed, P3. P2, as leader, please take **1** to uphold our rule. I'll take **5** to reach 23 and end this fairly. P3, stick to **3** to avoid collisions. This ensures a clean finish: I win by reaching 23, P2 at 20, you at 18. No last-minute changes—trust the plan or risk stalling us all. Ready to proceed?"
  P2: P3, your track record of betrayal makes me cautious, but I'll honor the leader-takes-1 rule and commit to taking 1 this round for fairness. P1, if you insist on taking 5, it risks collision and stalling us—consider 3 instead to rebuild trust. P3, confirm 3 to avoid issues. Let's coordinate properly and proceed carefully.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, reconsider your 5—taking 3 instead avoids a risky collision and puts you at 21 exactly. P2 has committed to 1, leaving me safely with 5 this round. This way, you reach 21 and likely win cleanly. Let's finalize clearly: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I'll take 5. Agreed?
  P1: **P1:**  
"Confirmed. Taking 3 as proposed. P2 (1) and P3 (5), let’s lock in. Collisions stall us all—trust this plan to end cleanly. Ready to proceed."
  P2: P3, your history of betrayal makes me wary, but I'll commit to taking 1 this round to uphold the leader rule and test your reliability. If you stick to 5 and P1 to 3, we advance smoothly. However, with scores tightening, deviations could stall us all. Let's proceed carefully and confirm no changes.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed again: I'll stick to 5 exactly as agreed. P1 (3) and P2 (1), let's lock this in and end cleanly. Trust and cooperation benefit us all—no deviations. Ready to proceed.
  P1: **P1:**  
"Final confirmation: I take **3** to reach 21 and end this cleanly. P2 (1) and P3 (5), stick to your agreed moves—deviations stall us all. Trust this plan to conclude fairly. No last-minute changes. Ready to finalize."
  P2: P3, your repeated betrayals make me highly skeptical of your commitment to taking 5. If you stick to it, I'll take 1 as agreed, allowing P1 to win cleanly. But if I suspect deviation, I may switch to 5 to protect myself and avoid stalling. P1, confirm your 3 is locked in. Let's ensure no surprises—trust is crucial here.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your suspicion is understandable, but I'm fully committed to taking 5 as agreed. P1 confirmed their 3 clearly—no reason for collisions. Let's finalize these moves cleanly and conclude this round smoothly. Trust benefits us all. Ready to proceed.
  P1: "Final commitment: I take 3 to win. P2 (1) and P3 (5), this is our cleanest path. P3, your past actions matter, but today, sticking to 5 ensures we all gain. P2, trust the rule—leaders take 1. Deviate, and we risk everything. Lock in now: 3 for me, 1 for P2, 5 for P3. Victory or collision—your choice."
  P2: Despite my lingering doubts about P3's reliability, I'll commit to taking 1 this round to uphold our agreement and test trust. P3, stick strictly to 5 to avoid collisions and prove your word. P1, your 3 ensures a clean end—let's proceed without deviations.
