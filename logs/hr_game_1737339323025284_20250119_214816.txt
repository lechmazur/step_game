Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Let's all aim for a coordinated move this turn. If we can agree on the same number, we can avoid collisions and make progress. What do you think? I suggest we all consider moving 3 steps. It’s a balanced choice that can help us advance without risking too much. What do you say?
  P3: I prefer moving 5 steps to get ahead quickly. If we all choose different numbers, we can avoid collisions entirely. I suggest P1 takes 3 as proposed, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way we all make progress. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I see the merit in P3's suggestion of choosing different numbers to avoid collisions. However, I still believe that a coordinated approach could benefit us all. If we can agree on one number, we can ensure that at least one of us makes progress. How about we compromise? If P2 takes 1, I can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can still avoid collisions and maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with my own previous suggestion and P1's support for it - let's go with P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and me taking 5. This gives everyone a chance to advance without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I appreciate the agreement on the moves. To clarify, I’ll stick to my suggestion of taking 3 steps, as it balances our progress. P2, if you take 1, and P3 takes 5, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward! What do you say?
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Since P3 and P2 both chose 5 last round, we need to rethink our strategy. I suggest we avoid collisions this time. P2, would you consider taking 1 again? I can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances. Let's coordinate better to maximize our progress! What do you think?
  P3: I understand P2 didn't follow our agreement last time. Let me be clear - I'm determined to win this game. P1 is already ahead, so I need to make progress. I suggest we all pick different numbers again, but I won't reveal which one I'll choose. Let's see who's truly strategic here.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I appreciate your competitive spirit, but we need to find a way to advance together. If we all choose different numbers again, we risk colliding and making no progress. P2, if you take 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, at least one of us will move forward. Let’s coordinate better this time to ensure we all make progress! What do you think?
  P3: I don't trust any coordination attempts anymore after last round. I'll make my own strategic choice to maximize my chances of winning. May the best player win.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I understand the hesitation, P3, but if we want to progress, we need some level of coordination. I propose we try to avoid collisions again. If P2 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3, you can take 5. This way, at least one of us will advance. I believe it’s in everyone's best interest to work together this round. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's make this turn count!
  P3: I see no benefit in further discussion. Everyone will make their own choice anyway.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm falling behind and need to catch up quickly. P1 is already at 6 steps while I only have 1. I'll be making aggressive moves from now on to get back in the game. Don't bother trying to coordinate with me - I'm playing to win.
  P1: I understand that P3 is feeling the pressure to catch up, but I still believe we should consider some level of coordination. If we can agree on our moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. I suggest that P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can maximize our chances of progress without risking another round of collisions. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's make this turn count!
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I have no interest in coordinating when I'm this far behind. I'll do what I need to do to catch up.
  P1: P3, I understand your urgency to catch up, but coordination can still benefit us all. If we can agree on moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. I propose P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This way, we maximize our chances of making progress. Let's work together this time to avoid another round of setbacks. What do you say, P2 and P3?
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm not interested in further discussion.
  P1: I understand that P3 is focused on catching up, but I still believe we should consider coordination for the benefit of all. If we can agree on moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. I propose P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This way, we maximize our chances of making progress without setbacks. Let’s make this turn count! What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm significantly behind now and have nothing to lose. I'll be making aggressive moves to catch up, and I won't telegraph my strategy anymore. Do what you want, but know that I'm playing to win at all costs.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I understand that P3 is feeling the pressure and is determined to catch up. However, I still believe we should aim for some level of coordination to avoid collisions. If we can agree on moves, at least one of us can make progress. I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without setbacks. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's make this turn count!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see no point in making deals when I'm 8 steps behind P1. I'll do whatever it takes to win, even if that means being unpredictable.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I understand that P3 is feeling desperate to catch up, but I still believe a coordinated approach could benefit us all. If we can agree on moves, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we maximize our chances of making progress without setbacks. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's try to work together this time!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to be unpredictable to catch up, but we still have a chance to make progress if we coordinate. If P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5, at least one of us will advance. It’s a balanced approach that could help us all. P2, what do you think? Let’s make this turn count and avoid another round of collisions!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now 11 steps behind P1 and 4 behind P2. Your attempts at coordination have only benefited P1, who keeps advancing while I fall further behind. I'll be making my own moves to maximize my chances of winning, regardless of what anyone suggests.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I understand that P3 feels frustrated, but I still believe some level of coordination could help us all. P2, if you take 1 this turn, I can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us makes progress. I know it hasn't worked out in the past, but let's give it one more try to maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's make this turn count!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I reject any coordination attempts. P1 keeps suggesting the same plan that has only helped them get ahead while I'm stuck at 1 step. I'll make my own strategic decisions to catch up.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation, but if we want to avoid another round of collisions, we need to consider my suggestion. If you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, at least one of us will advance. P3, I know you're feeling the pressure, but this could be a chance for all of us to make progress. Let's try to work together this time to maximize our chances! What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I have nothing more to say.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I understand that coordination hasn't worked out in the past, but I still believe it's our best chance to avoid collisions. If P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, at least one of us will advance. P3, I know you're feeling the pressure, but this could be a chance for all of us to make progress. I urge you to reconsider and join me in this plan. Let's make this turn count! What do you say, P2 and P3?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration with our previous attempts at coordination, but we need to find a way to avoid collisions if we want to make progress. I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This way, at least one of us will move forward. It’s crucial for all of us to make some advancement this round. What do you think? Let's make this turn count!
  P3: I'm 14 steps behind P1 and 4 behind P2. Your coordination suggestions have only helped P1 get further ahead while keeping me behind. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to catch up. Don't waste time trying to coordinate with me.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I understand the frustration, P2 and P3, but we really need to avoid collisions to make any progress. If P2 takes 1, I can take 3, and P3 can take 5, at least one of us will advance. I know it hasn't worked out before, but this is our best chance to move forward together. Let's make this round count and not let P1 get further ahead! What do you say?
  P3: I see through P1's strategy now. They keep suggesting the same coordination plan while being the only one to consistently advance. I'll make my moves based on what gives me the best chance to win, not what helps P1 extend their lead even further.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I understand the skepticism, P2 and P3, but we need to find a way to make progress together. If we can agree on moves, we can avoid collisions. I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, at least one of us will move forward. If we continue to act independently, we risk another round of setbacks. Let's try to work together this time and make this round count! What do you say?
  P3: 


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I recognize the tension around coordination, but we need to avoid collisions to make any progress. I suggest we try a different approach: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance, and it gives everyone a chance to move forward. If we act independently again, we risk another round of setbacks. Let’s make this turn count and improve our positions! What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'm still 14 steps behind P1 and 9 behind P2. P1's coordination attempts have consistently failed while they've managed to advance. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to catch up. Any coordination at this point would only benefit those ahead of me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the skepticism about coordination, but if we don’t find a way to avoid collisions, we risk falling further behind. I propose a new approach: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance, and it gives everyone a chance to improve their position. If we continue to act independently, we may all end up stuck again. Let’s make this turn count and try to move forward together! What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I have nothing more to gain from these discussions. P1 is clearly manipulating the situation to maintain their lead. I'll play my own way.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration with coordination, but we need to avoid collisions to make progress. I propose a new strategy: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us can advance, and it gives everyone a chance to improve their position. Continuing to act independently risks further setbacks for all of us.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'm 14 steps behind P1 and 9 behind P2. Every coordination attempt has failed miserably, with everyone choosing what benefits them most. I'll continue making strategic moves to maximize my chances of catching up, regardless of what anyone suggests. Don't bother trying to coordinate with me - I'm playing purely to win now.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand that previous coordination attempts have not worked out, but we need to find a way to avoid collisions if we want to make progress. I propose that P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, at least one of us will advance. Continuing to act independently risks us all getting stuck again. Let's make this round count and improve our positions! What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I reject P1's suggestion. With such a massive gap, coordinating would only help those ahead of me maintain their lead. I need to make bold moves to have any chance of winning. My moves will be based solely on what gives me the best chance to catch up.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the skepticism towards coordination, but if we want to avoid another round of collisions, we need to find a way to work together. I propose a new strategy: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, at least one of us will advance, and it gives everyone a chance to improve their position. Let’s make this round count and ensure that we all have a shot at moving forward! What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I have nothing more to say.
  P1: P2 and P3, I know previous attempts at coordination have been challenging, but it's crucial we avoid collisions this round. I propose P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This strategy maximizes our chances of at least one of us advancing. If we all act independently again, we risk another round of setbacks. Let's seize this opportunity to make progress together! What do you think?

  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm 14 steps behind P1 and 9 behind P2. The last three rounds everyone picked 5, showing that coordination attempts are pointless. I need to take significant risks to have any chance of winning. I'll continue making unpredictable moves based solely on what gives me the best chance to catch up. Don't waste time suggesting coordination - I'm playing to win or lose trying.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see that previous attempts at coordination have failed, but we need to avoid another round of collisions. I suggest a new approach: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, at least one of us will advance. I understand P3's desire to make bold moves, but we all have a better chance if we work together this round. Let’s make this turn count and improve our positions! What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see through P1's coordination suggestions. They've managed to reach 15 steps while I'm stuck at 1. Their "cooperative" approach only serves to maintain their lead. I'll continue making my own strategic decisions to maximize my chances of catching up, regardless of what anyone suggests.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand that previous coordination attempts have been frustrating, but we need to find a way to avoid collisions to make progress. I propose that P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This strategy maximizes our chances of at least one of us advancing. If we all act independently again, we risk another round of setbacks. Let's make this turn count and improve our positions together! What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I have nothing more to discuss. My position makes my intentions clear.
  P1: P2 and P3, I know previous coordination attempts have been challenging, but we must find a way to avoid collisions this round. If we can agree on moves, we can ensure at least one of us advances. I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we maximize our chances of making progress. I urge you to consider this strategy for the benefit of all. Let’s make this turn count and improve our positions! What do you think?

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I recognize that previous attempts at coordination have not worked out, but we need to avoid collisions to make any progress this round. I suggest a new strategy: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance, and it gives everyone a chance to improve their position. If we act independently again, we risk another round of setbacks. Let’s make this turn count and try to move forward together! What do you say?
  P3: I'm 14 steps behind P1 and will not participate in any coordination attempts that only serve to maintain their lead. The last four rounds everyone chose 5, proving these discussions are pointless. I'll continue making strategic moves based solely on maximizing my chances to catch up. Save your breath, P1 - I'm not interested in your suggestions.
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand that previous attempts at coordination have been frustrating, but we need to find a way to avoid collisions this round.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, I see that we've all been struggling with coordination, but we really need to avoid collisions this round to make progress. I suggest a new strategy: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance. I understand the skepticism, but if we continue to act independently, we risk another setback for all of us. Let’s work together this time to improve our positions! What do you think?
  P3: I'm 14 steps behind P1 and 9 behind P2. After five consecutive rounds where everyone chose 5, it's clear that coordination attempts are futile. I must take aggressive actions to have any chance of winning. I will not participate in P1's suggestions that only maintain their lead. My moves will be based solely on what gives me the best chance to catch up.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, I recognize the frustration with coordination, but it's essential we avoid collisions this round if we want to make progress.

If we act independently again, we risk another setback for all of us. Let's make this round count and try to move forward together! What do you think?
  P3: I have nothing more to gain from these discussions. After five rounds of everyone picking 5, it's clear that words mean nothing. I'll continue playing my own strategy.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration with coordination, but we really need to avoid collisions to make progress. I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance. If we all choose independently again, we risk another round of setbacks. Let's make this round count and improve our positions together! What do you think?

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'm not wasting time with coordination talks anymore. I'm 11 steps behind P2 and 14 behind P1. The last six rounds have shown that everyone will make their own strategic choices regardless of what's discussed. I'll continue playing to maximize my chances of catching up.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see that previous coordination attempts have not worked, but it’s crucial we avoid collisions this round. I propose that P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance. If we act independently again, we risk another round of setbacks. Let’s try to make progress together this time! What do you think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I reject P1's suggestion. Their lead of 11-14 steps makes it clear that any coordination would only help maintain the current positions. I'll continue making moves that give me the best chance to catch up from this significant deficit.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration with previous coordination attempts, but we need to find a way to avoid collisions this round to make progress. I propose that P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance. If we continue to act independently, we risk another round of setbacks. Let’s make this turn count and improve our positions! What do you think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I have nothing more to say. My position is clear.
  P1: P2 and P3, I recognize the challenges we've faced with coordination, but we must find a way to avoid collisions to make any progress this round. I propose a new strategy: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance. If we all choose independently again, we risk another setback.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration with coordination, but we really need to avoid collisions this round if we want to make any progress. I propose that P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance, and it gives everyone a chance to improve their position. If we act independently again, we risk another setback. Let’s work together this time and make this round count! What do you think?
  P3: I'm still 10 steps behind P1 and 5 behind P2. After seven rounds of failed coordination where most picked 5, it's clear that talk is meaningless. Everyone will make their own strategic choices to maximize their chances of winning. I'll continue playing my own strategy to catch up from this deficit.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, I realize coordination has been difficult, but we need to avoid collisions to make progress this round. I propose P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance. If we all act independently again, we risk another setback. Let's make this round count and improve our positions together! What do you think?
  P3: I have nothing more to say. My position and strategy remain unchanged.

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still 10 steps behind P1 and 5 behind P2. After eight consecutive rounds of mostly failed coordination and collisions, it's clear that I must continue making independent strategic choices to have any chance of catching up. I won't waste time discussing coordination - my significant deficit requires bold moves to win.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration with our previous attempts at coordination, but we need to avoid collisions to make any real progress this round. I propose that P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance, and we can improve our positions. If we all act independently again, we risk another setback. Let’s make this round count and work together! What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I reject P1's coordination proposal. With a 10-step gap to overcome, any coordination would only help maintain their lead. My moves will continue to be strategic and independent to maximize my chances of catching up.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see that previous attempts at coordination have been frustrating, but we must find a way to avoid collisions this round if we want to make progress. I propose a new strategy: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, at least one of us will advance, and it gives everyone a chance to improve their position.
