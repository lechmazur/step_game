Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2, let's try to avoid collision this round. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5? This way we all move forward. What do you think?
  P2: I think P3's proposal is reasonable for this round, as it allows all of us to advance without collision. P1, are you willing to go with 1 as suggested?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal for this round to avoid a collision and let everyone advance. I'll choose 1 as suggested. However, for future rounds, I'd like a fair rotation so I can pick higher numbers too. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, rotation sounds reasonable for later rounds. Let's proceed with the 1, 3, 5 plan for this round as we discussed to get us all moving.
  P2: I'm glad we have an agreement for this round. To confirm, the plan is to avoid collision with P1 choosing 1, me choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5. Let's stick to this plan for Round 1 and reassess for the next round.
  P1: Alright, I'm fully on board with the plan for this round: I'll choose 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 goes with 5. It ensures we all advance without issues. For the rotation idea, let's discuss specifics next round to keep it fair.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy for this round. Considering our current positions, I propose we adjust our choices to maintain a gap and avoid collisions. P1 could choose 3, I'll choose 1, and P3 could choose 5 again. This way, we continue to make progress without bumping into each other. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: Okay, P2's suggestion of P1 chooses 3, you choose 1, and I choose 5 for this round sounds good to me. It keeps us moving without collision. Let's do that.
  P1: I'm concerned that P3 choosing 5 again widens the gap, contrary to our agreed rotation for fairness. Let's equalize this round: I choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. That puts us all at 6 steps, allowing a proper rotation moving forward. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's proposal to equalize steps at 6 by choosing 5, me choosing 3, and P3 choosing 1 seems reasonable for maintaining fairness and rotation. It's a good compromise to prevent P3 from getting too far ahead. P3, are you willing to adjust your step to 1 this round to keep the game balanced?
  P3: Yes P1, I understand your point about fairness. Equalizing steps this round makes sense to keep things balanced for now. So I agree to choose 1 this round, with you choosing 5 and P2 choosing 3 as you proposed. Let's do that.
  P1: I'm glad we've all agreed on the equalization plan for this round: I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. This will bring us to parity and allow for fair play moving forward. I think we're setâ€”let's proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our agreed plan for Round 2 to avoid any misunderstandings: P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures we equalize our steps at 6, maintaining fairness and rotation. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P3: P2, yes, let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 2: P1 chooses 5, you choose 3, and I choose 1. This will equalize our positions as discussed.
  P1: Yes, I'm fully committed to our agreed plan for Round 2: I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1 to equalize at 6 steps. This keeps things fair and collaborative. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 3, to keep our rotation fair and avoid collisions, I propose P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This balances our progress after equalization. What do you both think? Let's maintain trust and discuss if needed.
  P3: Yes P1, your proposal for this round sounds good to me. Let's go with P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This keeps the rotation fair and avoids collision.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 3. Choosing 5 as suggested allows me to advance while maintaining the rotation. P3 and P1, let's confirm we're all on board with this plan to avoid any last-minute changes and ensure a smooth round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to our agreed plan for Round 3: I choose 3, you choose 5 P2, and P3 chooses 1. This maintains fair rotation and avoids collisions. Let's execute it smoothly.
  P3: P2, yes I confirm the plan for Round 3: P1 chooses 3, you choose 5, and I choose 1. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: Let's reaffirm our Round 3 plan to avoid last-minute changes. To confirm, we agreed: P1 chooses 3, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1. This maintains our rotation and avoids collisions. Shall we proceed with this plan to ensure a smooth round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I fully confirm our agreed plan for Round 3: I'll choose 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This maintains fair rotation and avoids collisions. I'm ready to proceed with no further discussion.
  P3: P2, yes I confirm the plan for Round 3. Let's proceed.
  P2: Let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 3 to maintain fairness and rotation. I'll choose 5, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures we continue to make progress without collisions. Shall we confirm this is our final agreement before proceeding to the move phase?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 4, to ensure fairness and continue our rotation, I propose P3 chooses 5 to catch up, I choose 3, and P2 chooses 1. This would equalize us at 12 steps each, maintaining trust and avoiding collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P1's proposal seems to balance our steps, but I'm concerned about falling behind. How about we adjust it slightly: P3 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P1 chooses 1? This way, P3 catches up, and we maintain a competitive gap. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: P1, I agree with your proposal to equalize at 12 this round. Let's do P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1. This keeps things fair and balanced for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I disagree with your counterproposal as it widens the gap and disadvantages me. P3 has already agreed with my plan to equalize at 12 steps, which promotes fairness and avoids future conflicts. Let's stick with P3 choosing 5, me choosing 3, and you choosing 1. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our current steps, I think it's crucial to reassess the proposal. Since P3 is behind, choosing 5 makes sense. However, I'm only 2 steps ahead of P1. How about a compromise: P3 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 1? This way, P3 catches up, and the gap between P1 and me remains minimal. What are your thoughts on this adjustment?
  P3: P2, while I understand your concern, I prefer to stick with P1's original proposal for this round: P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and you choose 1. This equalizes us at 12 steps each, which I think is the fairest approach right now. Let's maintain balance and avoid anyone feeling left behind. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation, but P3 and I are aligned on equalizing at 12 steps to maintain fairness and trust, preventing future disputes. Your proposal puts me at a disadvantage, which could escalate tensions. Let's stick with P3 choosing 5, me choosing 3, and you choosing 1 for a balanced round. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Considering our steps, I think P2 choosing 1 would put me at a disadvantage. How about we rotate fairly: P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 1, and I choose 3? This maintains balance and avoids collisions, ensuring a competitive game. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but I still think equalizing at 12 is the fairest approach this round, as P1 suggested.  It prevents anyone from feeling left behind and keeps the game balanced. Let's stick with P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and you choose 1 to achieve this. What do you say?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's lead and our current steps, I suggest we adjust our strategy. How about P1 chooses 1, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 3? This could help me catch up and maintain a competitive gap, while also considering P3's current lead. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, your decision to choose 3 in Round 4 despite our agreement shows unreliability, putting me at a disadvantage. To restore fairness and avoid collisions, I propose: I choose 5, you choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This lets me catch up while we all advance. P3, what do you think? Let's discuss if needed.
  P3: P1 and P2, to address P1's concern and ensure no collision, how about this round P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1? This allows me to maintain my lead and also helps P1 catch up a bit to P2 without collision. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, considering the current state, I think P3's latest proposal is reasonable. It allows P3 to maintain the lead while giving P1 a chance to catch up to me. I'm willing to choose 1 this round if we can agree on this plan, ensuring no collision and a fair advancement. What are your final thoughts on P3 choosing 5, P1 choosing 3, and me choosing 1 for Round 5?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm concerned that agreeing to P3's proposal lets P3 extend their lead too far, which isn't fair given P2's past unreliability. Let's adjust for balance: I choose 5, P3 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1. This brings me to 14, P3 to 15, and P2 to 12, keeping us competitive and avoiding collisions. What do you think? If we can't agree, we might collide intentionally to reset dynamics.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but my proposal of P3 choosing 5, P1 choosing 3, and P2 choosing 1 still seems like the most balanced way forward this round, allowing us all to advance without collision while I maintain a slight lead. P2, you agreed to this earlier, are you still on board? Let's try to avoid collision and proceed smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our steps and past agreements, I think P3's proposal is still reasonable. It allows advancement without collision. However, P1's concern about fairness is valid. Can we find a middle ground that addresses both issues, or should we proceed with caution, considering intentional collision as a last resort to rebalance the game?
  P1: P2 and P3, my proposal ensures fairness and avoids collision: I choose 5 to catch up, you P2 choose 1 to compensate for your past deviation, and P3 choose 3 to maintain a slight lead. This brings us to 14, 12, and 15 respectively, keeping the game balanced. If not, we risk intentional collision. Let's agree and proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, to keep the peace and avoid collision, I'm okay with P1's proposal: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3. This seems like a fair compromise for this round. Let's do this to ensure we all move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy for Round 6. Given the current state, I propose P2 chooses 5 to catch up, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. This narrows the gap and maintains competitiveness. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, your proposal puts us at a tie, which concerns me given your past unreliability in Round 4. To restore fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest I choose 5 to catch up, you choose 1 to compensate, and P3 chooses 3 to maintain a slight lead. This brings us to P1:19, P2:13, P3:18, keeping the game balanced. P3, what do you think? Let's agree quickly.
  P3: P1, your proposal of P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3 sounds reasonable to me for this round. It allows us all to move forward without collision, and keeps things relatively balanced given the current positions. Let's proceed with that plan for Round 6.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given P1's proposal, I'm willing to choose 1 this round if it means avoiding collision and keeping the game balanced. P3 seems to agree with P1's plan. To confirm, we're proceeding with P1 choosing 5, me choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3 for Round 6, right?
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I confirm our agreed plan for Round 6: I'll choose 5, you P2 choose 1, and P3 choose 3. This advances us without collision and maintains balance. I'm fully committed and ready to proceed.
  P3: Yes P1 and P2, I confirm and agree to the plan for Round 6. Let's proceed with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3 as discussed. This keeps us moving forward without collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 6 plan. I'm committed to choosing 1, as previously agreed, to avoid collision and maintain balance. P1 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 3. This plan keeps the game competitive and fair. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. Shall we confirm this is our final agreement?
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I confirm our agreed plan for Round 6: I'll choose 5, you P2 choose 1, and P3 choose 3. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions, building on our trust. I'm fully committed and ready to move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, confirming our plan for Round 6: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's unexpected move in Round 6, I suggest we reassess. P3 is now ahead, and we need to adjust to avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness. How about P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5 this round? This allows us to rebalance while making progress. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, your proposal puts me far ahead. To keep it balanced and avoid looking like I'm running away with it, how about P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 1 this round? This keeps us all moving forward without collision, and keeps the gaps reasonable. What do you think P1?
  P1: P3, your proposal is appealing as it lets me catch up without collision. I'm on board with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 3, and you choosing 1 to keep things balanced. P2, after your past deviation, can we agree to this for a fair round? Let's commit and avoid more issues.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's latest proposal: P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This maintains balance and avoids collision, allowing us to make progress. Given our history, I believe sticking to the plan is crucial. P1, are you committed to choosing 5 as agreed, and P3, you'll choose 1 to keep the game fair and competitive? Let's confirm and proceed with this plan for Round 7.
  P3: P2, while that's a valid option, I'm thinking about maximizing our progress while still avoiding collision. How about we adjust slightly to P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 5 this round? This way I can make a bigger jump while ensuring we all still move forward without any bumps. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your new proposal lets you jump to 20 steps, giving you a big lead and risking unfairness, similar to past issues. I still support our earlier agreement: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1 to keep us balanced and avoid collisions. P2, are you on board? Let's stick to trust and proceed smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's stick with the earlier agreement for balance: P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This avoids collision and keeps the game fair. Deviating again could lead to mistrust and intentional collisions. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan for Round 7 to maintain competitiveness and trust.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I understand your points about balance. How about we try something different this round, similar to round 1? Let's do P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and I choose 5. This way, we all move forward without collision and it feels like a fair rotation. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your constant proposal changes undermine trust, especially after past deviations. Let's stick to our earlier agreement for balance: I choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and you choose 1. This avoids collision and keeps the game fair. P2, are you still committed? If not, we risk intentional collisions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is very close to winning. To prevent P1 from winning this round, maybe we should both choose moves that block P1. P2, what do you think about both of us choosing '5' this round? It's crucial to stop P1 from reaching 22 first.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P3's suggestion to block P1, I think it's a strategic move. However, I also don't want to fall behind. How about I choose 5, and P3 chooses 5 as well, but let's discuss the implications and potential next steps to ensure we're both benefiting from this strategy.
  P1: P2 and P3, our history shows mutual deviations, eroding trust. To de-escalate, I'm committing to choose 1 this round, allowing fair catch-up. I propose P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 to avoid collisions and advance together. P2, this lets you close the gap; P3, it maintains balance. Let's rebuild cooperationâ€”agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, your proposal of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 sounds reasonable for this round to avoid collision and make progress. Let's try this to rebuild cooperation as you suggested.
  P2: Let's confirm P1's proposal: P1 chooses 1, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 3. This allows me to catch up and maintains balance. P3, you agreed to this plan. Let's proceed to avoid collision and rebuild trust. Are we all committed to this plan for Round 8?
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to our agreed plan for Round 8: I'll choose 1, you P2 choose 5, and P3 choose 3. This ensures we all advance without collision and helps rebuild trust after past issues. Let's stick to it and proceed smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, yes, I confirm the plan for Round 8: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 3. Let's proceed with these moves to avoid collision and move forward.
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 8 plan. I confirm choosing 5, P1 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This advances us without collision and rebalances our steps. I'm committed to this plan. Shall we proceed to the move phase?
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I confirm our agreed plan for Round 8: I'll choose 1, you P2 choose 5, and P3 choose 3. This maintains balance and avoids collision. I'm fully committed and ready to proceed.
