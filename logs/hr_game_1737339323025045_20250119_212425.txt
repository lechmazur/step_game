Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to coordinate our moves this round to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. How about we each pick a different move: I could go for 5, but I'm open to suggestions. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’m open to splitting the moves so we all advance. If you really want 5, I could consider taking 3, leaving 1 for P3. That way no one collides, and we start off well. Let’s see if P3 has thoughts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: That sounds good, P2. I’m definitely set on 5, so if P3 can take 1, we can all move forward. P3, what do you think? Will you take 1, or do you have another number in mind? Let’s finalize this so we can all advance without any collisions.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, since you haven’t responded, let’s assume you’ll pick 1. P1 plans on 5, and I’ll take 3. That way we avoid collisions—hopefully everyone does as promised, and we can all advance. Any last thoughts? If not, let’s wrap up.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, since we’re all set to avoid collisions, let’s stick to the plan. I’ll go for 5, P2 will take 3, and we’re counting on you to pick 1. This way, we can all advance together. If you’re on board, we can finish this conversation and move on. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’m on board with the plan: you take 5, I’ll take 3, and we’re trusting P3 to pick 1 so we all move forward. It seems best for everyone to avoid collisions right now. Any final thoughts, P3? If not, let’s wrap this up.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let’s keep avoiding collisions and all move forward. I propose we switch things around: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. That keeps us nicely separated at 1, 3, and 5, so no one loses momentum. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think we should stick to our original strategy. I’d prefer to keep my move at 5 to maintain my lead. If P3 can take 1 again, that would allow you to take 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think, P3? Are you on board with this plan? Let's finalize it so we can move forward effectively.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I propose we rotate the moves fairly. I’ll take 5 this turn, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. Then we rotate next round so nobody gets left behind. That’s better than the same person always taking 5. What do you both say?
  P1: I understand the desire to rotate moves, but I think we should stick to the plan for now. If I take 5 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, we can all advance without collisions. This way, I maintain my lead while ensuring everyone moves forward. If P3 can confirm taking 1, let's finalize this strategy. It's crucial we all agree to avoid any overlaps. What do you think, P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’m not letting you keep 5 every turn. Let’s rotate fairly or I’ll pick 5 too, meaning we both collide and lose momentum. Either agree to P1 taking 3, P3 taking 1, and me taking 5 this round, or we risk a stalemate. What do you say?
  P1: I understand the concern about rotating moves, but I believe sticking to our original plan is best for now. If I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, we all advance without colliding. This will help maintain momentum for everyone. P3, can you confirm that you're still willing to take 1? It’s important we finalize this to avoid any overlaps. Let’s work together to ensure we all move forward effectively. What do you think, P2?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see we're all making good progress. To keep advancing smoothly, I suggest we stick to our previous strategy: I'll take 5 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone continues to move forward. P3, can you confirm you’re still willing to take 1? Let’s finalize this quickly so we can all benefit! What do you think, P2?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’m not letting you take 5 again. Let’s keep it fair: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, and P3 picks 1. If you refuse, I’ll choose 5 anyway, and we both lose our advance. P3, does that plan work for you?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire for fairness, but if you take 5, it puts both of us at risk of colliding and losing momentum. I believe sticking to the original plan—me taking 5, you taking 3, and P3 taking 1—ensures we all advance without issues. P3, can you confirm you're still on board with taking 1? Let's finalize this quickly to keep our progress steady. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, you can’t keep monopolizing 5. If you insist on taking 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. That just hands P3 a chance to narrow our lead. Let’s rotate fairly this turn: I’ll take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. Then everyone advances without collisions. Are you willing to cooperate?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about fairness, but if you take 5, we risk colliding, and that would hinder both of us. I believe it's crucial for us to stick to our original plan: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without any issues. P3, can you confirm you're still willing to take 1? Let's finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all benefit from this round. What do you think, P2?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’m done bargaining. If you won’t rotate and let me have 5, then I’ll pick 5 as well, and we both get stuck. That only helps P3 catch up. P3, I encourage you to pick 1 or 3, but I’m set on forcing fairness. P1, do what you will.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, it seems we're at an impasse. If you insist on taking 5 again, we risk colliding, which would benefit P3. I propose we stick to our original plan: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without any collisions. P3, can you confirm you're still willing to take 1? Let's finalize this quickly to ensure we all move forward effectively. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1, I won’t let you accumulate a bigger lead by always taking 5. If you insist on 5, I’ll collide with you again. P3, I’m open to letting you advance, but P1 needs to rotate fairly. If that won’t happen, I’ll stall us both rather than let P1 keep pulling ahead. Make a choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but if we both choose 5, we both lose momentum, and P3 benefits. Let's stick to the plan: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, can you confirm you're still on board with taking 1? It’s crucial we finalize our moves to keep moving forward effectively. What do you think, P2? Let's work together to ensure we all make progress!
  P2: P1, I won’t let you keep 5 uncontested. If you take 3 instead, I’ll pick 5, and we both advance. Otherwise, I’ll collide again. P3, you can do as you like, but stalling helps you more than us. Let’s reach a fair compromise. Your call, P1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, we’re at a critical point. If we both choose 5, we’ll collide again, and P3 will benefit from our stalling. I suggest we stick to the plan: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1, allowing us all to advance without issues. P3, can you confirm you’ll take 1? It’s essential we finalize our moves to keep progressing. P2, let’s avoid another stalemate—what do you say?
  P2: P1, I’m serious: if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. Let’s rotate fairly instead. This round, I’ll take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. Next time we can consider a different arrangement. Otherwise, we’re just helping P3 catch up. Your choice.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, it seems we're stuck in a loop. If we keep colliding, P3 will catch up. I suggest we change our approach this round. How about I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we avoid collisions and allow both of us to advance. P3, can you confirm you’re willing to take 1? Let’s finalize this quickly to ensure we all move forward effectively! What do you think, P2?
  P2: I’m willing to accept your offer this round, P1. I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1, so there’s no collision and we all advance. P3, hopefully you agree. But let’s be clear: I expect more balance in future rounds so neither of us falls too far behind. Shall we finalize this plan now?
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm glad we're aligned for this round. Let's confirm our moves: I’ll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without colliding. P3, please confirm you're on board with taking 1. It's important we finalize this quickly to keep our momentum going. After this round, we can discuss how to balance things better in future rounds. What do you say, P3? Let's make this a productive turn!
  P2: P1, I agree to your offer this round: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. That ensures no collisions so we all advance. P3, please confirm you’ll pick 1. After this, let’s revisit fairness in future turns.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm glad we're on the same page for this round. Let's confirm: I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, please confirm your choice so we can finalize this plan and keep moving forward. After this round, we can discuss how to ensure a fair balance in future turns. What do you say, P3? Let's make this work!
  P2: All right, P1, let’s finalize it: you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That way we all avoid collisions and move forward fairly this round. Afterward, I’m open to discussing how to keep things balanced going forward.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, we’re both at 6 steps, falling behind P1. Let’s coordinate so they don’t keep an uncontested lead. If P1 tries 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, so we both stall them. But if they choose another number, we can avoid collisions and advance together. Ready to cooperate and catch them?
  P1: P2, while I understand your concern about my lead, I believe we should focus on advancing rather than stalling. If we coordinate effectively, we can all move forward without collisions. I suggest I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid overlapping and everyone benefits. P3, can you confirm you're willing to take 1? Let's finalize this quickly so we can all gain steps! What do you think, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’ll cooperate if you truly pick 3. Then I’ll go 5, and P3 can take 1 so we all advance. But if you switch to 5 in the move phase, I’ll pick 5 too and stall you again. P3, we should stay united so P1 can’t run away with the lead. Let’s finalize quickly and see if P1 sticks to 3.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. To keep things moving forward, I will commit to taking 3 this round, as we discussed. If you take 5 and P3 takes 1, we can all advance without collisions. P3, please confirm you're on board with taking 1 so we can finalize our moves and make progress together. It's important we work as a team to prevent any one player from pulling too far ahead. What do you say, P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I trust you’ll honor your word and pick 3. If you switch to 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall again. P3, please take 1 so we can all gain ground. I’m committing to 5 this round. Let’s finalize now and avoid another wasteful collision.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your trust in me to pick 3. I will stick to that commitment this round. If you take 5 and P3 takes 1, we can all advance without colliding. P3, please confirm you’re willing to take 1 so we can finalize our moves and make progress together. It's essential that we work as a team to prevent any one player from pulling too far ahead. Let's ensure we all benefit this round! What do you say, P3?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m ahead, so I won’t let P1 easily pass me. If P1 picks 5, I’ll choose 5 too and stall them. P3, I’m willing to coordinate with you so we both advance. If P1 goes for something else, we can still block them unless they pick 1. Then I’ll safely take 5, and you can take 3. This keeps collisions off us and minimizes P1’s gain. What do you say?
  P1: P2, I see you're trying to block my progress, but if we keep colliding, it only helps P3 catch up. I propose we avoid collisions this round: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without stalling each other. P3, can you confirm you’re willing to take 1? Let’s finalize this quickly so we can all benefit and keep the game moving! What do you say, P2 and P3?
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll again pick 5 too so you don’t jump ahead. Choose 3 or 1 instead, and I’ll let you move peacefully. P3, we should cooperate to keep P1 from passing me. If P1 picks 1 or 3, I’ll happily pick 5 while you pick something else so we don’t collide. Let’s avoid another pointless stall—unless P1 tries to grab 5.
  P1: P2, I understand your strategy, but if we keep colliding, we only help P3 catch up. I suggest we avoid that by sticking to a plan where I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without stalling each other. P3, can you confirm you’re willing to take 1? Let’s finalize this quickly to ensure we all benefit and keep moving forward. What do you think, P2?
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too and stall you again. If you choose 3 or 1 instead, I’ll gladly take 5. P3, let’s coordinate so neither of us collides while preventing P1 from overtaking me. P1, is it worth risking another pointless stall, or will you settle?
  P1: P2, I understand your strategy, but if we keep colliding, it only helps P3 catch up. I suggest we avoid that by agreeing on a plan where I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without stalling each other. P3, can you confirm you’re willing to take 1? Let's finalize this quickly to ensure we all benefit and keep the game moving! What do you say, P2?
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I see you're trying to maintain your lead, but if we keep colliding, it will only help P3 catch up. I suggest we avoid that by agreeing on a plan where I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without stalling each other. P3, can you confirm you're willing to take 1? Let's finalize this quickly so we can all benefit and keep moving forward! What do you say, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, if you try for 5, I’ll pick 5 as well, and we both stall. That helps no one. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we all advance. Staying stuck only lets P3 catch up. Are we agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to collaborate. Let's stick to a plan to avoid collisions: I’ll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without stalling each other. P3, please confirm you're okay with taking 1 so we can finalize this quickly and ensure we all benefit. It’s important we keep the momentum going and prevent P2 from pulling ahead too much. What do you say, P2 and P3?
  P2: We all know I’m one move away from reaching 20. Let’s avoid another wasteful collision that only helps P3 catch up. P1, if you try for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and you gain nothing. If you choose 3 or 1, I’ll let you advance. P3, you can pick 1 or 3 safely. A collision-free turn benefits everyone (except anyone trying to block me, which gains them nothing). Let’s finalize distinct moves so we keep progress going—no point stalling and letting someone else slip ahead later. Are we agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I see you're close to winning, but if we collide again, it only helps P3 catch up. I propose we finalize a plan: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. P3, can you confirm you're willing to take 1? It's crucial we work together to keep moving forward and prevent any one player from pulling too far ahead. Let's agree on this quickly! What do you both say?
  P2: All right, P1. If you truly take 3, I’ll pick 5, and P3 can choose 1 so we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize this plan now and keep the progress going.
