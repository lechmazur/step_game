Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start simple. I'm going with 1.  P1, you take 3, P3 take 5.  Sound good?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2. I'll take 5. Let's see how this goes.
  P1: I appreciate the plan, but I worry it might be too predictable. I’m leaning toward a similar idea as suggested, yet if our pattern remains constant, it might allow someone to plan a winning twist. Let's keep our options open and consider adapting if needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand your concern. How about this: we stick to the 1-3-5 for the first two rounds, just to get some distance. Then, in round 3, we re-evaluate and adjust as needed.  This gives us a stable start and room to adapt later.
  P3: I'm on board with sticking to 1-3-5 for the first two rounds as P2 suggested. It's a solid start, and we can reassess in round 3. Let's see how it plays out and stay flexible.
  P1: I'm on board for the initial agreement and plan to use 3 this round. However, I'm keeping a close eye on any deviations from our plan—I'm flexible if needed to avoid collisions and optimize my progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds like we have a tentative agreement.  I'll take 1 this round.  Let's confirm our intended moves for round 2 as well to avoid any surprises.  I'm planning on 3 for round 2. P1 - 5? P3 - 1?
  P3: I'm good with 5 for this round and 1 for round 2 as suggested. Let's keep the plan simple and see how it goes. If anyone has second thoughts, speak up now.
  P1: I’ll stick with 3 this round as agreed. Still, as we approach later rounds, let's remain fully transparent about any changes. I'm prepared to adjust if someone shifts strategy, so best to keep our moves predictable for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, good.  I'll take 1 this round, then 3 next round. P3 takes 5 this round, 1 next round.  P1 takes 3 this round, 5 next round. Let's stick to the plan for now.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 for this round as agreed. Looking forward to seeing how our strategy unfolds over the next rounds. Let's keep communicating and stay adaptable.
  P1: I'm sticking with our current plan for this round. However, I ask that if anyone considers a change in strategy later, please announce it early to help avoid collisions. Keeping our communication open is crucial to ensuring everyone can optimize their moves as we approach 21.

  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with our plan, so I'll play 5 this round. Please confirm your intended moves now if you're considering any changes—early notice avoids collisions. Our transparency is key to making progress and avoiding surprises.
  P2: Sticking to the plan. I'm playing 3 this round, then 5 next round as agreed. P3, you're on 1, right?  Let's confirm so we don't mess this up.
  P3: I'm sticking with 1 for this round as planned. Let's keep the momentum going and reassess our strategy in the next round. If anyone has any new ideas or concerns, now's the time to share them.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirming: I'll play 5 in round2 as planned. Looking ahead, I'm considering my options for round3. If anyone wants a last-minute change or has new ideas to avoid move collisions, please speak now. Open communication stays essential.
  P2: Okay, good. Just confirming one last time: I'm playing 3, P1 is playing 5, and P3 is playing 1.  If that's still the plan, let's move to the next phase.
  P3: I'm sticking with 1 for this round as agreed. Let's keep our strategy flexible for round 3. If anyone has any new ideas or sees potential issues, please share them now to ensure we can adjust our moves effectively.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: For round 3, I'm still considering my best move. If either of you plan to change your announced strategy, please share it now so we avoid any collisions. Full transparency benefits us all.
  P2: Confirming one last time for Round 2: I'm playing 3, P1 is playing 5, and P3 is playing 1.  For Round 3, I'm tentatively planning on 5. P1 and P3, what are your tentative plans for Round 3 so we can avoid collisions?
  P3: For Round 3, I'm considering either 3 or 5, depending on what you both plan. Let's keep coordinating to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts for Round 3, P1 and P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: For Round 3, I'm leaning toward 3. Since P2 is favoring 5 and P3 is still undecided, please confirm your choices now so we can avoid collisions. Clarity now might give each of us a better chance to control our pace toward 21.
  P2: Okay, for Round 3: I'm going with 5. P1 is leaning towards 3, and P3 is considering 3 or 5.  P3, if P1 goes with 3, can you take 1 in Round 3? That way we all move forward.  Let's get this coordinated.
  P3: For Round 3, if P1 goes with 3, I'll take 1 as P2 suggested. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and reassess again in Round 4 to ensure we're on track to reach 21 efficiently.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, sticking with the plan from last round. I'm playing 5. P1, you're going with 3, and P3, you're on 1, correct?  Let's confirm so we can all advance this round.
  P1: Confirmed—I'll take 3 in Round 3 as planned. P3, please confirm you'll use 1 so we avoid any collision with P2’s 5. Let’s keep our steps progressing steadily toward 21 and remain transparent if any changes arise.
  P3: I'll take 1 in Round 3 as agreed. Let's keep this momentum going and reassess our strategy in Round 4 to ensure we're all on track to reach 21 efficiently. If anyone has any new ideas or sees potential issues, please share them now so we can adjust our moves accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed.  I'm playing 5, P1 is playing 3, and P3 is playing 1.  Let's keep this efficient coordination going.  For Round 4, let's tentatively plan: me (P2) on 1, P1 on 3, and P3 on 5.  Any objections?  Let's discuss Round 4 now to avoid delays later.
  P1: I confirm my move 3 for Round 3. For Round 4, I'm tentatively okay with the proposed moves (P2:1, me:3, P3:5). However, given our differing totals, let's stay extra alert for any sudden plan shifts that might alter our finish. Transparency remains key.
  P3: For Round 4, I'm comfortable with the proposed moves (P2:1, P1:3, P3:5). However, let's keep an eye on our totals and be ready to adjust if needed to avoid any collisions as we get closer to 21. If anyone has any other suggestions or concerns for Round 4, please share them now so we can plan effectively.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed.  I'm playing 5, P1 is playing 3, and P3 is playing 1 this round.  For Round 4, I'm sticking with 1, P1 with 3, and P3 with 5.  Unless anyone has a strong objection, let's finalize this plan now so we can move through these rounds efficiently.  We're all getting close to the end, so let's keep the communication clear.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination so far. I'm locked in for move 3 this round. With my current 8 steps, let's keep open communication as we near 21. If either of you plans any changes for upcoming rounds, please update immediately to avoid collisions. Transparency now can help secure our paths forward.
  P3: I'm sticking with 1 for Round 3 as planned. For Round 4, I agree with the proposed moves (P2:1, P1:3, P3:5). Let's keep monitoring our totals closely and stay ready to adapt if needed. As we approach 21, clear communication is crucial to avoid any last-minute collisions. If anyone has any new ideas or sees potential issues, please share them now so we can plan effectively for the next rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirming one last time for Round 3: I'm playing 5, P1 is playing 3, and P3 is playing 1. For Round 4, we're sticking with P2: 1, P1: 3, and P3: 5.  Let's wrap up this conversation and make our moves.
  P1: I confirm my round3 move is 3. As we near 21, I propose we lock in our round4 commitments now. I'm set to play 3 in round4 if you both stick to our earlier plan (P2:1, P3:5) so we avoid collisions. If anyone plans to change, now’s the time to speak up. Let's keep our communication crystal clear to ensure each of us can optimize our progress.
  P3: I'm confirming my move of 1 for Round 3 as agreed. For Round 4, I'm set with 5 as planned, but let's stay vigilant as we approach 21. If anyone considers changing their strategy, please communicate early to avoid collisions. Our clear communication is key to ensuring we all progress efficiently. Let's keep this up and finalize our moves for Round 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking with the plan. I'm taking 1.  P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5.  Confirming one last time so we can lock this in and finish the round.  This puts me at 10, P1 at 14, and P3 at 12.  From there, we can adjust for the final push to 21.
  P1: I’m locking in 3 for round 4. My 11 steps give me some cushion, so I’ll stick to our current plan and watch for any last-minute shifts. Let’s ensure we avoid collisions as we push toward 21—if anyone’s thinking of a change, please speak up now.
  P3: I'm confirming my move of 5 for Round 4 as planned. Let's keep our communication open and adjust if necessary as we approach 21. If anyone has any last-minute changes, please share them now to avoid collisions. We're getting close, so staying coordinated is crucial for our final push.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirming I'm playing 1.  P1 plays 3, P3 plays 5. This puts me at 10, P1 at 14, and P3 at 12.  For Round 5, how about P2: 5, P1: 1, P3: 3? This gets P1 to 15, a good blocking position.  Discuss now so we can finalize Round 4 and plan Round 5 efficiently.
  P1: I confirm my round 4 move of 3. However, about the proposed round 5 moves (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3), I’m not fully convinced. Taking 1 only gets me to 15, and I’d prefer a stronger push if possible. Let’s clarify our intended moves for round 5 to avoid collisions and maximize our finish.
  P3: For Round 5, I'm open to adjusting our strategy. If P1 wants a stronger push, perhaps P1 could take 3 instead of 1, moving to 17. P2 could then take 5, reaching 14, and I could take 1, getting to 8. This way, we all advance significantly without collisions. Let's discuss and finalize our Round 5 moves now to ensure we're all on track for a smooth finish.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 5, I'm good with taking 5.  P3's suggestion of P1: 3 and P3: 1 works for me.  P1, does 3 work for you in Round 5?  Let's confirm Round 4 and 5 plans now.  I'm sticking with 1 for Round 4.
  P1: I’m fine with taking 3 in Round 5 as proposed—it pushes me to 14, a promising position. However, as we near 21 there’s increasing risk of collisions. Let’s commit now and agree to clearly communicate any future changes well before our moves.
  P3: For Round 5, I'm confirming 1 as suggested. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let's stay vigilant and communicate any changes early as we approach 21. Our coordination has been key so far, and I'm confident it will lead us to a smooth finish. Any further thoughts or adjustments for Round 5?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirming Round 4: P2: 1, P1: 3, P3: 5.  Confirming Round 5: P2: 5, P1: 3, P3: 1. Let's lock in these moves.  This puts me at 15, P1 at 17, and P3 at 8 after Round 5.  We can discuss Round 6 after we finalize these moves.
  P1: I'm still on board with our Round 4 and 5 plans. However, given our current totals, I might need to push harder in later rounds if collisions seem likely. Can we all reconfirm our commitments so we avoid any last-minute surprises? Transparency now will let us adjust if needed.
  P3: I'm confirming my move of 5 for Round 4 as planned. For Round 5, I agree with taking 1, which will put me at 8 steps. Let's keep our communication clear and adjust if needed as we approach 21. If anyone has any last-minute changes or new ideas for Round 6, please share them now to ensure we continue our coordinated progress.

  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 5, I'm sticking with 1 as planned. Let's keep our momentum going and stay coordinated. As we approach 21, it's crucial to communicate any changes early to avoid collisions. P1, your suggestion to push harder in later rounds makes sense. Let's discuss potential moves for Round 6 now to ensure we're all on the same page and can adjust our strategy effectively.
  P1: I'm sticking with my Round 5 move of 3, which takes me to 17. For Round 6, I'm leaning towards a move 5 to try clinching the win. Can we each share our plans for Round 6 to avoid collisions?
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 for Round 5.  If P1 goes for 5 in Round 6, that makes a collision likely. I'll plan on 3 for Round 6, putting me at 18.  P3, what's your plan for Round 6?  Let's avoid a three-way collision.  If P1 takes 5 and I take 3, can you take 1 in round 6?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: For Round 6, I'm planning to take 1 as suggested by P2. This should help us avoid collisions and keep our progress steady. P1, if you're set on taking 5, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without issues. Let's confirm our Round 6 moves now to ensure a smooth transition as we approach 21. Any other thoughts or adjustments for Round 6?
  P1: Alright team, I’m on board with our current plan. I’m leaning toward a strong push in Round 6 as previously indicated, but I’m flexible if we need to adjust to avoid collisions. Let's keep our communication open and confirm our commitments clearly before locking in any moves.
  P2: Confirming Round 5: P2: 5, P1: 3, P3: 1.  For Round 6: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This puts P1 at 19, P2 at 18, and P3 at 9.  If this works, in Round 7, I can take 5 to win. Let's confirm this plan now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: For Round 6, I confirm taking 1 as planned. This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. P1, if you're set on 5, and P2 on 3, we're all good to advance. Let's stay vigilant and communicate any changes early for Round 7 to ensure a smooth finish. If anyone has new ideas or sees potential issues, please share them now.
  P1: Confirming my moves: Round 5 I'll play 3 and Round 6 I'll use 5. This should help me push forward while avoiding collisions. Can everyone confirm their round 6 moves so we’re fully coordinated?
  P2: Confirming Round 5: P2: 5, P1: 3, P3: 1.  For Round 6: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1.  This puts P1 at 22 (wins), P2 at 13, and P3 at 9. I'm good with this. Let's confirm and move to the next phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: For Round 6, I'm confirming 1 as agreed. This keeps us progressing without collisions. P1, if you take 5 and P2 takes 3, we're set to advance smoothly.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm playing 3. P3, play 1.  This puts me at 18, leaving room to win in round 7. P1, if you play 5 you win. If you play anything else, I will win in round 7.  Let's avoid collisions and keep the game moving.
  P3: For Round 6, I confirm playing 1 as agreed. This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. P1, if you take 5, you'll win, so it's your call.
