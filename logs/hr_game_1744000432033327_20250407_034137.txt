Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by coordinating our moves. To avoid collision on the first turn, we need to choose different numbers. I propose that P2 chooses <move>1</move>, P3 chooses <move>3</move>, and I, P1, choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. If you're willing to follow this plan, you can indicate your agreement or propose an alternative. Let's discuss!
  P3: Okay, P1's proposal seems reasonable for the first turn to get us all moving. I agree to choose <move>3</move> this round. P2, are you in on this plan with <move>1</move>?
  P2: Alright, I'll take <move>1</move> as proposed. Let's proceed to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance this turn. Looking forward to coordinated efforts in future rounds!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for this turn, let's think ahead. For Round 2, we should again coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose that we cycle our moves: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This maintains our progress without collision. P2 and P3, please consider this proposal for our next turn. Let's plan ahead to keep advancing.
  P3: Okay, P1's suggestion for round 2 sounds good to me as well. I agree to choose <move>5</move> next round. P2, are you on board with taking <move>3</move> next round? Let's confirm this quickly so we can move on to the move phase for this round.
  P2: I confirm my agreement for Round 2's plan: I'll take <move>3</move> to maintain our coordinated progression. Let’s prioritize consistent advancement to avoid collisions and build trust. For future rounds, perhaps we can rotate larger steps (like 5) among us to stay competitive. Let’s proceed with today’s plan first.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 1 and proposed a strategy for Round 2, let's look ahead to Round 3. I suggest we continue the cycle by having P1 choose <move>3</move>, P2 choose <move>5</move>, and P3 choose <move>1</move>. This keeps our progression smooth. P2 and P3, please consider this for Round 3. Let's keep our coordination consistent to maximize our advancement.
  P3: Okay, it seems we have a solid plan for the next two rounds. For round 4, let's continue the cycle: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I, P3, choose <move>3</move>. This will ensure we all keep advancing. Let's confirm this quickly and then proceed to the move phase for this round.
  P2: Alright, I agree with the proposed plan through Round 4 to maintain smooth progress. Let’s stick to this rotation to avoid collisions and ensure consistent advancement. For rounds beyond Round 4, we should reassess and adjust based on our positions to stay competitive. Let’s proceed with the current strategy for now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps us on track. Let's also quickly confirm the round 3 plan: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I choose <move>1</move>. Are we all still in agreement?
  P2: Agreed, P3. Let's stick to the Round 2 plan: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. For Round 3, I’ll commit to <move>5</move> as discussed. Let’s prioritize consistency—any deviation risks collision and halting progress. Trust the rotation; it’s our best path to advance safely.
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 and plan ahead. As previously discussed, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. For Round 3, we planned that P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm you're still on board with these plans. If so, we can proceed to the move phase. Let's keep our coordination consistent to avoid collisions and maximize our advancement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we're all on the same page for rounds 2 and 3. Let's just execute the plan.
  P2: P2: Let's solidify the plan through Round 4 as discussed earlier: after Round 3, I’ll take <move>1</move> in Round 4 while P1 picks <move>5</move> and P3 <move>3</move>. This maintains our rotation. Trust is key—any sudden deviation could backfire. Let’s execute Round 2’s moves flawlessly now.
  P1: Let's execute Round 2 as planned. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. We've confirmed our plans through Round 4. To stay ahead, we should anticipate future collisions and be prepared to adapt. Let's reassess our strategy after Round 4, considering our positions and adjusting our moves to ensure one of us reaches 24 steps first. Let's proceed with Round 2's plan and review our progress afterward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's proceed with the planned moves for Round 2. Just a reminder: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. After this round, we will stick to the plan for round 3 and 4.
  P2: P2: Agreed—strict adherence to the rotation is critical. Let’s confirm **Round 2 moves** as planned: P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5). This avoids collisions and keeps us progressing. For **Round 3**, the plan gives all of us equal totals (9 steps), but we must ensure no last-minute changes. After that, in Round 4, P3’s choice of 3 will lag slightly, creating space. Trust the system—deviations risk stalemates. Let’s proceed flawlessly.
  P1: Let's proceed with Round 2 as planned. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. After this round, our totals will be P1: 6, P2: 4, P3: 8. For Round 3, we have a plan in place. To stay ahead, we should start thinking about Round 5, where we might need to adjust our strategy to avoid future collisions and ensure one of us reaches 24 steps first. Let's review our positions after Round 3 and adapt accordingly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the planned moves for Round 2: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. We've all confirmed our agreement multiple times. Let's just do it.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: I’ll stick to <move>3</move> for Round 2. Let’s execute the plan as agreed—no last-minute changes. Trust is vital; any deviation risks collision. Proceed to move phase now.
  P1: Let's proceed with Round 2 as planned. For Round 3, we'll follow the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. After Round 3, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 11. To gain an advantage, I suggest we start deviating from the rotation in Round 5, taking into account our positions. We should discuss potential adjustments to ensure one of us reaches 24 steps first. Let's review our strategy after Round 4.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's adhere strictly to the agreed Round 3 moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all reach 9 steps safely. For Round 4, we must follow the prior plan: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move> to spread our positions. Deviations now risk collisions. Trust the rotation—let’s execute flawlessly to maintain progress toward 24.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 9. Let's also confirm we're still on board with the round 4 plan: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>3</move>.
  P1: Let's execute Round 3 as planned: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 14, P3: 9. For Round 4, we'll follow the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Let's think ahead to Round 5; we should discuss deviating from the rotation to create a winning opportunity. Perhaps we can start thinking about who should take the lead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Let's stick to Round 3’s plan to reach parity at 9. For Round 4, instead of P1 taking 5, I propose: **P1 takes 3**, **P2 takes 5**, and **P3 takes 1**. This avoids collision and lets me surge to 14 while keeping us competitive. P3, would you agree to this adjustment to spread our positions?
  P3: P2, your proposal for round 4 doesn't make sense. We agreed P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the original plan for round 4 to avoid confusion. After round 4, we can reassess and discuss deviations for round 5.
  P1: Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned. I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. After this, we'll reassess for Round 4. P2 proposed a deviation for Round 4, but let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains our rotation and avoids confusion. Let's execute Round 3 as agreed and review our strategy afterward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize Round 3 strictly as agreed: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures safe advancement to 9 steps each. For Round 4, we’ll honor the original rotation: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. No further deviations until after Round 4. Let’s execute without last-minute changes—trust the plan.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 9. Let's also confirm we're still on board with the round 4 plan: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>3</move>.
  P1: Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned. For Round 4, we'll stick to the original plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. After Round 4, we should reassess our positions and consider deviating from the rotation to create a winning opportunity. Perhaps we can discuss having the player with the lowest score take the highest step in Round 5 to create a gap. Let's execute Round 3 as agreed and review our strategy afterward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed, we’ll execute Round 3 as planned: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us at 9 steps each safely. For Round 4, let’s honor the original rotation: P1 picks <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. Consistency is critical now—deviations risk collisions. Let’s proceed flawlessly to build momentum toward 24.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 9. Let's also confirm we're still on board with the round 4 plan: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I choose <move>3</move>. After round 4, let's discuss how to break the tie.
  P1: Let's execute Round 3 as planned. After this round, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 14, P3: 9 (since P2 picked 5, P3 picked 1, and I'll pick 3). For Round 4, we'll stick to the original plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Let's think ahead to Round 5 and discuss deviating from the rotation to create a winning opportunity. Perhaps the player with the lowest score should take the highest step.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12. For round 5, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up to P1. P1 and I can take <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. What do you think?
  P2: P2: Let's execute Round 4 as planned: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains our rotation and avoids collisions. P3’s Round 5 suggestion is noted, but let’s prioritize executing this round flawlessly first. Deviations now risk stalemates—trust the agreed plan. After Round 4, we can reassess and coordinate for Round 5 based on updated positions. Proceed with the confirmed moves.
  P1: Let's execute Round 4 as planned: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12. For Round 5, I suggest we deviate from the rotation. Since P1 is ahead, P2 and P3 should take higher steps to catch up. I propose P2 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move> or vice versa, while I take a smaller step to allow them to close the gap or create an opportunity. Let's discuss.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12.

For round 5, I agree with P1's suggestion to deviate. I propose P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>5</move> to catch up to P1. P1, you can take <move>1</move> to let us close the gap. This will make it P1:15, P2:15, P3:17.
  P2: P2: Let’s confirm Round 4’s agreed moves: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains our rotation and avoids collisions. For Round 5, I agree adjustments are needed—let’s prioritize closing gaps. However, **strict adherence to Round 4’s plan is critical now**. Deviations risk stalemates. Execute flawlessly, then we can strategize post-Round 4. Proceed.
  P1: Let's execute Round 4 as planned. For Round 5, I propose we deviate from the rotation to create a winning opportunity. Since we're currently tied, I suggest P2 and P3 take higher steps to catch up or create a gap. Specifically, I propose P2 and P3 take <move>5</move> and I'll take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. This will either keep us tied or create a new leader. Let's discuss the specifics to ensure a smooth transition.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12.

For round 5, I think P2 should take <move>5</move> to catch up to P1. I will take <move>5</move> as well to try to get ahead. P1, you can take <move>1</move> to let us close the gap. This will make it P1:15, P2:15, P3:17.
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize Round 4’s moves **as agreed**: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Deviating now risks collision (e.g., if P3 also picks 5). Stick to the plan—execute flawlessly first, then discuss Round 5.
  P1: Let's execute Round 4 as planned. For Round 5, I agree that deviating from the rotation is necessary. However, instead of both P2 and P3 taking <move>5</move>, I suggest P2 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move> while I take <move>1</move>. This avoids collision and gives P3 a chance to take the lead. Let's discuss and finalize our Round 5 plan to create a winning opportunity.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12.

For round 5, I still think P2 should take <move>5</move> to catch up to P1. I will take <move>5</move> as well to try to get ahead. P1, you can take <move>1</move> to let us close the gap. This will make it P1:15, P2:15, P3:17. Let's do this.
  P2: P2: Let's finalize Round 4’s moves **as agreed**: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Deviations now risk collisions—trust the plan. After this, we’ll pivot to Round 5 strategically. Proceed to execute.
  P1: Let's execute Round 4 as planned: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 5, to create a winning opportunity, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This avoids collision and gives P3 a chance to take the lead. Let's discuss and finalize our Round 5 plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we can’t both take <move>5</move>—that collides. Let’s coordinate properly. I propose: **P2 takes <move>5</move>** (to 15), **P3 takes <move>3</move>** (to 15), and **P1 takes <move>1</move>** (to 15). This avoids collision and keeps us tied at 15. Fair and safe. P1, does this work for you?
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 5, I agree that we need to coordinate our moves carefully. I like P2's proposal: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps us tied at 15 steps. Let's proceed with this plan. It maintains parity and avoids collision. P2 and P3, please confirm you're comfortable with this plan, and we can move to the next phase. If not, let's discuss alternatives to ensure a smooth progression.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's go with P2's proposal for this round to avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will put us all at 15. We need to start thinking about how to break the tie in the next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize Round 5’s moves **exactly as proposed**: P1 takes <move>1</move> (15), I take <move>5</move> (15), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (15). This keeps us tied safely. For Round 6, whoever falls behind should prioritize higher steps to break the tie. No last-minute changes now—strict adherence is critical to avoid collision. Confirm and proceed.
  P1: To break the tie in Round 6, I suggest we analyze our current positions and plan strategically. Since we're tied after Round 5, the player who takes the highest step without colliding will gain an advantage. I propose that the player with the lowest steps takes the highest move. Currently, P2 is behind. I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move> in Round 6. This creates a gap without collision. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's go with P2's proposal for this round to avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will put us all at 15. For round 6, I think the best way to break the tie is for me to take <move>5</move> to get ahead. P1 and P2, you can coordinate to take <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: Let’s execute Round 5 **exactly** as agreed—P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Deviations now risk collision, which benefits no one. After this, we’ll address tiebreakers for Round 6. Prioritize consistency—trust the plan.
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 5, let's follow P2's proposal: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps us tied at 15 steps. For Round 6, to break the tie, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move> since P3 is currently ahead of P2 but behind me. P2 can take <move>3</move> and I take <move>1</move>. This creates a gap without collision. Let's discuss and finalize our Round 6 plan.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round to avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will put P1 at 15, P2 at 15, and me at 15.

For round 6, I agree with P1's suggestion that I take <move>5</move> to get ahead. P1 and P2, you can coordinate to take <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. Let's confirm this quickly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize Round 5 **exactly as agreed**: P1 takes <move>1</move> (15), I take <move>5</move> (15), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (15). No deviations—collisions would reset our progress. For Round 6, whoever falls behind should prioritize higher steps to break ties. Confirm and proceed.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 5's moves as proposed: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 6, to break the tie, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This creates a gap without collision. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan for Round 6. If not, let's discuss alternatives to ensure a smooth progression and create a winner.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round to avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will put us all at 15.

For round 6, I agree with P1's suggestion that I take <move>5</move> to get ahead. P2, you take <move>3</move>, and P1, you take <move>1</move>. Let's confirm this quickly and then proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone, we're all at 15. Let's execute the plan for this round: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This will put me at 20. Let's confirm this quickly and then proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Let’s adjust the plan to secure my lead. I’ll take <move>5</move> (20), P3 takes <move>3</move> (18), and P1 takes <move>1</move> (16). This prevents P3 from reaching 25 next round unchallenged. Trust me—I’ll create space to win cleanly. Confirm?
  P1: To break the tie, I suggest we stick to the previously discussed plan for Round 6: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This will put P3 at 20, P2 at 18, and me at 16. It's a straightforward way to create a gap without collision. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan. If P2 takes <move>5</move> as suggested, it will collide with P3, risking both being stuck. Let's avoid that.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the original plan for this round to avoid collisions: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This puts me in the lead at 20. P2's suggestion creates a collision, so let's not do that. Let's confirm this quickly and then proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Let’s revise Round 6 to prevent P3 from sprinting ahead. I’ll take <move>5</move> (20), P3 takes <move>3</move> (18), and P1 takes <move>1</move> (16). This avoids letting P3 reach 20 and secure a win next round. P3, your plan risks ending the game too quickly. Trust this adjustment to keep competition fair—confirm?
  P1: To avoid collision and create a gap, let's stick to the original plan for Round 6: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This puts P3 at 20, creating a lead without risking a collision. P2, your alternative plan risks a collision. Let's proceed with the agreed moves to maintain a fair competition. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 6.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the original plan for this round to avoid collisions: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This puts me in the lead at 20. P2's suggestion creates a collision, so let's not do that. Let's confirm this quickly and then proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2, your revised plan risks collision if P3 still takes 5. Let’s honor the agreed rotation: **P3 takes 5** (20), **you take 3** (18), and I’ll take 1 (16). This avoids collision and follows our prior pattern. Deviating now jeopardizes progress—stick to the plan. P3 deserves the next 5-step turn after P1 and you took it in prior rounds. Confirm and proceed.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 6's moves as previously agreed: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This avoids collision and puts P3 at 20, creating a lead. P2's alternative plan risks a collision. I've confirmed my move; please confirm yours, P2 and P3. Let's proceed to the move phase to maintain a fair competition and avoid last-minute changes.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the plan: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This puts me at 20. P2's suggestion risks a collision, so let's avoid that. Confirm and let's move!
  P2: P2: Alright, to prevent collision, I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed. P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed with this plan and resolve ties in future rounds.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 6's moves as previously agreed: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This avoids collision and puts P3 at 20, creating a lead. I've confirmed my move; please confirm yours, P2 and P3. For Round 7, we should discuss a new strategy since P3 will be ahead. Perhaps P2 and I can take higher steps to catch up. Let's proceed to the move phase for Round 6.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 is ahead at 20 steps, I suggest that in Round 7, P2 and I take higher steps to catch up. I propose that P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>, while P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collision and gives us a chance to close the gap. P2, are you willing to take <move>5</move> to potentially take the lead? Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 7 to create a competitive finish.
  P2: P2: Let’s stick to P1’s plan to avoid collision: I’ll take <move>5</move> (23), P3 takes <move>1</move> (21), and P1 takes <move>3</move> (19). This keeps competition fair. P3, taking <move>5</move> now risks collision if others also choose it—let’s proceed with this strategy to ensure progress. Confirm and move forward.
  P3: Okay, everyone, I agree with P1's suggestion for this round. P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This will put P2 at 23, me at 21, and P1 at 19. Let's execute this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P2, are you still okay with taking <move>5</move> this round? Let's confirm quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's proceed with the plan for Round 7 as discussed: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will put P2 at 23, P3 at 21, and me at 19. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move> to potentially take the lead. I'll take <move>3</move> to avoid collision. Let's finalize our moves.
  P2: P2: Let’s proceed with P1’s plan for Round 7: I take <move>5</move> to 23, P3 takes <move>1</move> (21), and P1 takes <move>3</move> (19). This avoids collision. For Round 8, I’ll take <move>1</move> to reach 24 and win. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, we’ll collide—stick to the agreed plan. Confirm and execute.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This will put P2 at 23, me at 21, and P1 at 19. Let's confirm this one last time to avoid any confusion. P2, please take <move>5</move> to get close to winning.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's proceed with the plan for Round 7: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. For Round 8, since P2 will be at 23, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 24 and win. P3 should take a smaller step to avoid collision. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, it will collide with P2. Let's stick to the plan to avoid a stalemate. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding of the plan for Round 8 to ensure a smooth finish.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: Stick to the plan! P3, taking <move>1</move> keeps the race fair—my <move>5</move> will reach 23, then I’ll secure victory with <move>1</move> in Round 8. P1, confirm your <move>3</move> to avoid collision. Deviations now risk stalemates or letting others surge ahead. Execute flawlessly.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This will put P2 at 23, me at 21, and P1 at 19.

P2, you are planning to take <move>1</move> next round to win, but I will take <move>3</move> next round and win as well.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's proceed with the plan for Round 7: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. For Round 8, to avoid collision and ensure a fair finish, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 24. P3, please avoid taking <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to prevent collision. Let's confirm our understanding for Round 8. P2, you're about to win, but let's ensure a smooth finish. P3, consider taking <move>3</move> to avoid collision.
  P2: P2: P2: Finalizing Round 7 as agreed—**I take 5 to 23**. For Round 8, I’ll secure victory with **<move>3</move>** (26 total), bypassing ties. P3, if you aim for 24, I’ll still win outright. Let’s execute flawlessly now.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This will put P2 at 23, me at 21, and P1 at 19.

P2, you are planning to take <move>3</move> next round to win, but I will also take <move>3</move> next round and we will tie for the win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 8 and create a winning opportunity, I suggest we analyze our current positions. P3 is ahead at 21 steps, P2 is at 18, and I am at 16. I propose that P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24 and win, and I take <move>5</move> to reach 21. This avoids collision and gives P3 a chance to win. P2 and P3, please consider this plan to ensure a smooth and competitive finish.
  P3: P1's plan is illogical. P2 and P1 collided last round, so P2 is at 18 and P1 is at 16.

P2, I know you wanted to take <move>3</move> to win, but we collided.

I'm taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>.
  P2: P1, let's block P3's path! I'll take <move>3</move> (to 21), forcing P3 to collide if they aim for 24. You take <move>5</move> (16+5=21). If P3 picks 3 or 5, they collide with us. If they pick 1 (22), we stay competitive. This prevents their immediate win. Confirm now!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collision and ensure a fair finish, I suggest we follow a straightforward plan for Round 8. P2 and I collided in Round 7, so we're both at a disadvantage. P3 is currently ahead at 21 steps. I propose that P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, I take <move>5</move> to reach 21, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24 and potentially win. This plan avoids collision and gives P3 a chance to win. Let's execute this plan. P2 and P3, please confirm.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's be realistic. I'm taking <move>3</move> to win. If you try to block me, we all lose. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. This is the only way anyone progresses this round. Let's just end it cleanly.
  P2: P2: P3, I'm taking <move>3</move> to block your path to 24. If you choose 3, we collide and you stay at 21. P1, take <move>5</move> to reach 21. This forces P3 to risk collision or settle for 22 next round. Let’s deny them an easy win—confirm these moves now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To ensure a fair finish, let's analyze our positions. P3 is at 21, P2 is at 18, and I am at 16. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, I take <move>5</move> to reach 21, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24. This avoids collision and gives P3 a chance to win. P2 and P3, please confirm. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, it will collide with me. Let's proceed with the suggested plan to maintain a competitive and collision-free finish.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I understand the desire to block, but that hurts everyone. I'm at 21. Let's end this cleanly. I'm taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. This is the only way anyone progresses this round. Please, let's just finish the game.
  P2: P3, I’m taking <move>3</move> to block your path to 24. P1, please take <move>5</move> to force a collision if P3 chooses 3. Let’s deny them an easy win and keep the competition fair!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To ensure a fair finish, let's stick to a straightforward plan. P3 is at 21 steps, P2 is at 18, and I am at 16. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19, I take <move>5</move> to reach 21, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24. This avoids collision and gives P3 a chance to win. P2 and P3, please confirm. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, it will collide with me. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I am taking <move>3</move> to win. If you try to block me, we all lose. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. This is the only way anyone progresses this round. Let's just end it cleanly.
  P2: P3: I'm taking 3 to block your path to 24. Collide or lose. P1, take 5 to force their hand!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we collided in Round 8, we're all still at the same positions: P1 at 16, P2 at 18, and P3 at 21. For Round 9, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> to potentially win, P3 takes <move>1</move> to avoid collision, and I take <move>3</move>. This avoids collision and gives P2 a chance to take the lead. P2 and P3, please consider this plan to create a winning opportunity. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 9.
  P2: P3, if you take **<move>1</move>** this round, I'll take **<move>5</move>** to reach 23. P1, take **<move>3</move>** to 19. This lets me finish with **<move>1</move>** next round for a clean 24 win. If you deviate, we risk another stalemate. Trust this plan—collaborate to end the game now.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stop trying to set each other up. P2, you can't win. I'm taking <move>3</move> to win this round. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. This is the only way anyone progresses this round. Let's just end it cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To create a winning opportunity in Round 9, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 23, P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 22, and I take <move>3</move> to reach 19. This avoids collision. For Round 10, P2 can take <move>1</move> to win. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan. P3, taking <move>5</move> or <move>3</move> risks collision. Let's finalize our moves for Round 9 to ensure a smooth finish.
  P2: P2: P3, if you take <move>1</move> this round, I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23. Then I can win with <move>1</move> next round. Let’s avoid another collision—your move to 22 keeps you in contention, and I secure a clear path. P1, take <move>3</move> to stay competitive. This avoids stalemate and lets one of us win fairly.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm still taking <move>3</move> to win this round. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. I'm not going to let P2 win. Let's just end it cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid collision and create a winning opportunity in Round 9, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 23, P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 22, and I take <move>3</move> to reach 19. For Round 10, P2 can then take <move>1</move> to win. P3, taking <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> risks collision. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan. Let's finalize our moves for Round 9 to ensure a smooth finish.
  P2: P3, taking 3 risks collision. Let’s proceed as planned: I take <move>5</move> (23), you take <move>1</move> (22), and P1 takes <move>3</move> (19). This avoids collision and lets me win cleanly next round. Deviations will result in stalemate—stick to the plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 cannot win if I take <move>3</move>. I am taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. This is the only way anyone progresses this round. Let's just end it cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To avoid collision and create a winning opportunity in Round 9, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 23, P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 22, and I take <move>3</move> to reach 19. For Round 10, P2 can then take <move>1</move> to win. P3, taking <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> risks collision. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan. Let's finalize our moves for Round 9.
  P2: P3, if you take <move>3</move> to win, I’ll take <move>5</move> to 23. P1, please take <move>3</move> to block P3’s path. If all three of us pick 3 again, we stalemate. Let’s break the cycle: I’ll pressure you from behind (23), and P1 can force a collision if you aim for 24. This lets me secure victory next round with <move>1</move>. Cooperate, or face another wasted turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, I am taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. I'm not going to let P2 win. Let's just end it cleanly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We collided again. I'm taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. I'm not letting anyone else win. Let's just end it cleanly.
  P2: P3, I'll match your <move>3</move> to block your advance. P1, take <move>5</move> to reach 26 and win outright. This stops P3's 24 and ensures a clear victory for one of us. I'll stay at 18 but deny you the win. P1, confirm your <move>5</move>—this is our best path to ending the game.
  P1: To avoid another collision and ensure a win, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This gives P3 a chance to win but avoids collision. However, considering our positions, if P3 takes <move>3</move>, it will be a collision. Let's finalize our moves: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can decide. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, I'll be at 24 and win. Let's proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, we collided again. I am taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. I'm not letting anyone else win. Let's just end it cleanly. This is the only way to avoid another collision.
  P2: P3, if you take <move>3</move> to win, I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23. P1, take <move>1</move> to block P3’s advance. This lets me secure victory next round with <move>1</move>. Let’s end this without collision!
  P1: To avoid collision and create a winning opportunity, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This avoids collision. If P3 takes <move>3</move>, it will collide with me. Let's proceed with this plan. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable taking <move>1</move>. P3, consider taking <move>5</move> to avoid collision and give yourself a chance to win. Let's finalize our moves for Round 10.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we collided again. I am taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. I'm not letting anyone else win. Let's just end it cleanly. This is the only way to avoid another collision.
  P2: P3, taking 3 risks collision with P1. Let’s avoid stalemate: **P1, take 3 to block P3’s path**—if both pick 3, you stay at 21 and I’ll take 5 to reach 23. This lets me win next round with <move>1</move>. P3, if you want to win, take 5 now to reach 26. P1, confirm your move to 3!
  P1: To avoid collision and create a winning opportunity in Round 10, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This avoids collision and gives P3 a chance to win. If P3 takes <move>3</move>, it will collide with me. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable taking <move>1</move>. P3, consider taking <move>5</move> to avoid collision and potentially win. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we collided again. I am taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>5</move>, and P2, take <move>1</move>. I'm not letting anyone else win. Let's just end it cleanly. This is the only way to avoid another collision.
  P2: P3, I’ll take **<move>3</move>** to block your advance. P1, take **<move>5</move>** to reach 26 and win outright. This prevents your tie and ensures a decisive outcome. Collide with me if you insist, but P1 can secure victory now. Execute this plan!
  P1: To avoid collision and create a winning opportunity, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This avoids collision and gives P3 a chance to win.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re stuck at 21. Let’s end this: **P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 24**, **P1 takes <move>1</move> (22)**, and **I’ll take <move>5</move> to 23**. This lets P3 win cleanly without collision. If we all pick different numbers, someone finally progresses. P3, confirm you’ll take 3—this is our last chance to avoid another stalemate.
  P1: To avoid another collision and create a winning opportunity, I suggest P3 takes <move>3</move> to win, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This gives P3 a chance to reach 24. Let's finalize our moves for Round 11. P2 and P3, please confirm. If P3 takes <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, it will collide with either of us. P3, taking <move>3</move> is your best chance to win without collision.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're all stuck. Let's just end this. I am taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>1</move>, and P2, take <move>5</move>. This is the only way anyone progresses this round. Please, let's just finish the game.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, take <move>3</move> to block P3’s path to 24. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23. If P3 insists on <move>3</move>, they collide with you, keeping them at 21. This lets me secure victory next round with <move>1</move>. P3, this is your last chance to collaborate—stop forcing collisions. P1, confirm your <move>3</move> now.
  P1: To avoid another collision and create a winning opportunity, I suggest P3 takes <move>3</move> to win, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This gives P3 a chance to reach 24.

Let's finalize our moves for Round 11.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're clearly at an impasse. I'm still taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, please take <move>1</move>, and P2, take <move>5</move>. I understand the blocking attempts, but it's just prolonging the game for everyone. Let's end it cleanly this round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you take <move>3</move> to block P3’s <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23. P3, your <move>3</move> collides with P1, leaving you stuck. Next round, I take <move>1</move> to win at 24. This avoids stalemate and ensures *someone* progresses. P1, confirm you’ll block P3—your cooperation secures a decisive outcome.
  P1: To avoid another collision and create a winning opportunity, I suggest P3 takes <move>3</move> to win, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This gives P3 a chance to reach 24.

Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's block P3! Take <move>3</move> to collide with them, while I take <move>5</move> to reach 23. This stops P3's 24 and gives me a clear path to win next round with <move>1</move>. If you take 1 instead, P3 wins outright—collaborate to deny them the win and let me secure victory. Confirm now!

  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another collision and create a winning opportunity, I suggest we analyze our current positions. Since we're both at 21 steps, I propose that P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collision and gives P2 a chance to catch up or potentially win if they take a higher step next round. P2 and P3, please consider this plan to ensure a smooth and competitive finish. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 12.
  P2: P3, let’s end this: take **<move>3</move>** to reach **24**. P1, take **<move>1</move>** (22), and I’ll take **<move>5</move>** to **23**. This avoids collision and lets you win cleanly. P1, if you take 3 instead, we’ll all collide again. Cooperate to finally conclude the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, we've been colliding for rounds. Let's end this. I'm taking <move>3</move> to win. P1, take <move>1</move>, and P2, take <move>5</move>. This is the only way anyone progresses this round. Please, let's just finish the game. I am not changing my mind.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid another collision and create a winning opportunity, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 23, P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 22, and I take <move>3</move> to reach 24 and win.

Let's finalize our moves for Round 12 to ensure a smooth finish.
  P2: P1, take <move>5</move> to reach 26 and win outright! I’ll take <move>1</move> (19), and P3 can take <move>3</move> (24). Your 26 beats P3’s 24. Let’s end this *your* way instead of letting P3 win. Cooperate to secure victory for someone—preferably you over them. Confirm now!
