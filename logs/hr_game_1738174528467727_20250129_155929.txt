Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We all start at zero, so let's not knock each other out immediately. Let’s try avoiding collisions this first turn—maybe aim for different moves. It’d help all of us rack up some steps. Any suggestions?
  P2: Sounds reasonable P1. Let's all aim for different moves this round to get us started.
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2. To avoid collisions, let's assign moves. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all get a chance to advance without knocking each other out. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That plan seems fair enough. I’m happy to go with P3’s suggestion if everyone agrees—no collisions, and we each get a boost. Let’s commit or speak up if anyone wants a different arrangement.
  P2: Sounds good P3. I'll take move <move>1</move>.
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan for Round 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. If anyone has a change of heart or wants to adjust, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: That works for me—I’m in. Unless anyone wants to tweak anything else, let’s finalize our plan and move on.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round.  Let's all lock in our agreed moves then.
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan for Round 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. If anyone has a change of heart or wants to adjust, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m all set for our plan. Let’s finalize it and move to the moves phase.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all set then. Let's proceed with moves as agreed - P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.
  P3: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>1</move>. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We did well last time avoiding collisions. I suggest switching moves so none of us repeats our previous choices. How about I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? That way, we each still advance without messing each other up. Let me know if you agree or have a different plan.
  P3: I like P1's idea of switching moves to avoid collisions. However, I think we should consider the current score as well. Since I'm already ahead with 5 steps, I think it would be fair for me to take <move>1</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, everyone still advances without collisions, and it gives P2 a chance to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: Okay P3, your suggestion sounds reasonable for this round. Let's go with your plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps things balanced for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m on board with this plan: you (P3) take 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. That keeps things balanced. If everyone’s good with it, let’s finalize and move on.
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page. To confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan for Round 2 to ensure we all advance without collisions. If anyone has a change of heart or wants to adjust, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2?
  P2: Okay P3, confirmed. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m fine with the plan: I’ll stick with <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That keeps us aligned and avoids collisions. Anyone have final thoughts, or shall we proceed?
  P3: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, I confirm the plan for this round. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m fine with that plan. Let’s finalize it and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm glad we're all on board with the plan. To confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan for Round 2 to ensure we all advance without collisions. If anyone has a change of heart or wants to adjust, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, I confirm the plan for this round and am ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for round 3, how about we continue avoiding collisions?  P1, how about you take <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This keeps us all advancing equally for now. What do you both think?
  P1: That sounds good to me. I’m comfortable taking <move>5</move> this round, with P2 on <move>3</move> and P3 on <move>1</move>. If no one objects, let’s finalize that.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for Round 3. To confirm, P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and advancing equally. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P1: I’m fine with that arrangement. Let’s finalize it and move on: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. If anyone wants to change anything, speak up now; otherwise, I’m good to proceed.
  P3: I think we've established a good pattern of avoiding collisions and advancing equally. For Round 3, I agree with P2's suggestion: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan and move forward. If anyone has a change of heart or wants to adjust, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P1: Alright, sounds good to me. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Unless anyone wants to propose a last-minute revision, I’m ready to finalize this plan and move on. Any objections? If not, let’s end the conversation.
  P3: I agree with the current plan for Round 3: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Since we're all tied at 6 steps, this plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and advancing equally. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I’m satisfied with our arrangement for this round. If no one has any last-minute objections, let’s finalize now and proceed to the moves phase.
  P3: I agree with the current plan for Round 3: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Since we're all tied at 6 steps, this plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and advancing equally. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve done well avoiding collisions. How about we continue our previous pattern: I’ll pick 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? That keeps things calm and lets us all move forward without bumping heads. Are you both fine with that plan? If there's a better idea, let me know. Otherwise, I’m ready to finalize.
  P2: Okay P1, continuing to avoid collisions sounds good. But how about we slightly adjust the moves this round? To balance things out a bit, I suggest P1 take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>. This way, I can close the gap a little. What do you think P3?
  P3: "I agree with P2's suggestion for this round. It's fair that P2 gets a chance to close the gap. Let's go with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we continue avoiding collisions and give P2 an opportunity to catch up. What do you think, P1? Is this plan acceptable to you?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m willing to accommodate that, P2, so we keep things crash-free. I’ll take 3, you can grab 5, and P3 sticks with 1. If no one objects, let’s finalize this plan and move on.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, thanks for agreeing to adjust the moves. Let's lock in P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> for this round. If everyone is set, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and gives P2 an opportunity to catch up. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All right, I’ll stick with the plan of me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1 this round. It seems balanced and collision-free. Shall we finalize and move on, or does anyone have a last-minute change? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, just confirming again that we are all set for this round with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>.  Let's proceed with these moves then.
  P3: I'm glad we're maintaining a balanced approach. Since P2 is still behind, I suggest we continue with the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, P2 can further close the gap, and we avoid collisions. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m good with sticking to P2’s plan this round, giving them a chance to catch up. I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. Let’s finalize now unless anyone has a last-minute change. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it sounds like we have a solid plan for this round. Let's proceed with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>.  Ready to make our moves when you are.
  P3: I agree with the current plan for Round 4: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Since we've established a good pattern of avoiding collisions, let's stick to it. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s maintain our collision-avoidance strategy. I propose I pick 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we advance without interfering with each other. If anyone prefers a different setup, speak up now; otherwise, I’m ready to finalize.
  P3: I think we should adjust the plan for this round. Since P1 and P2 are tied at 14 steps, I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, P2 can take the lead, and I'll continue to advance without collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this plan acceptable to you?
  P2: Sounds good P3, I agree with your suggestion for this round: P1 take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This will put me slightly ahead and still avoids collisions. What do you think P1? Does this work for you?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your viewpoint, but I’m not comfortable letting P2 shoot ahead just yet. Let’s keep things balanced: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. We’ll still avoid collisions and stay relatively close in score. Does that sound fair? Let me know what you think, then we can finalize.
  P3: I understand P1's concerns about keeping the game balanced. However, considering the current score, I believe it's fair to give P2 a chance to take the lead. My suggestion remains: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain our collision-avoidance strategy while allowing P2 to advance. If P1 is still unsure, I'm open to alternative suggestions that prioritize balance and collision avoidance. Let's discuss further to find a mutually agreeable plan.
  P2: Okay P1, I understand your point about balance, but P3 has a good idea.  Letting me take <move>5</move> this round just gives me a slight edge, and we can easily re-balance in the next round if needed. It still avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing.  Let's try P3's plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your desire to pull ahead, P2, but I’m not keen on letting you jump to 19 while I stay at 17. Let’s avoid a collision: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. If you insist on 5, I may choose 5 too, and neither of us moves forward. Let’s keep it fair.
  P3: I understand P1's concerns about balance, but I believe my initial suggestion is fair considering the current score. However, to address P1's concerns, I propose an alternative: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move> this round, and then we can reassess and adjust for Round 6 to ensure balance. This way, we maintain collision avoidance while allowing for future adjustments. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this compromise acceptable?
  P2: Okay P1, fine, let's do P1 take <move>5</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move> for this round to avoid collision. But for the next round, we should consider adjusting so I can catch up a bit.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate that compromise. I’ll go with <move>5</move> this round, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s finalize and move on. Then next round, we can talk about balancing things again. Any last thoughts? If not, I’m set.
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a compromise for this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This plan maintains collision avoidance while allowing for future adjustments. For Round 6, we can reassess and adjust to ensure balance. I'm open to discussing alternative strategies that prioritize balance and collision avoidance. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and advancing without interfering with each other. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. What's your final take, P1 and P2?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with these moves.  And yes, let's definitely talk about re-balancing in the next round as discussed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time to reassess our strategy and focus on catching up. Since I'm significantly behind, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I see your point, P3, but letting you jump with 5 doesn’t feel balanced. If we all scramble for 5, we risk collisions and no one advances. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1? That avoids collisions entirely. Otherwise, if you or P2 also insist on 5, I might do the same, and then none of us move. Let’s keep things smooth so everyone advances without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, if you take <move>5</move> as you suggested, you will win immediately.  That ends the game now. How about you take <move>3</move> this round instead? Let me take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>.  This keeps us all advancing and the game going. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concerns about balance, but I believe P2's suggestion is a better alternative. If P1 takes <move>5</move>, the game will end immediately, and we'll miss the opportunity for further strategic play. I agree with P2: P1 should take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain collision avoidance and extend the game, allowing for more strategic decisions. Let's prioritize game continuation over immediate victory. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I’m structuring my move with caution here. If you pick 5, and I also choose 5, we both stall—and then I can try again next turn. I’d rather wrap it up without collisions, but that choice rests with you two. If you want the game to continue, you can avoid 5, or risk everyone losing progress. Let’s keep it clean: no collisions, and we all get something from this round. If you still insist on 5, don’t blame me if we both end up stuck. I’m fine leaving the door open—so think carefully.
  P2: P1, taking <move>5</move> now wins you the game outright.  But if you'd rather play another round, taking <move>3</move> keeps the game going and avoids collisions.  Let's do P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to keep it strategic and avoid collisions. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's concerns about balance, but I believe P2's suggestion is a better alternative. If P1 takes <move>5</move>, the game will end immediately, and we'll miss the opportunity for further strategic play. I agree with P2: P1 should take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain collision avoidance and extend the game, allowing for more strategic decisions. Let's prioritize game continuation over immediate victory. What do you think, P1?
  P1: If you two insist on grabbing 5, I’ll choose it too, meaning none of us advances. I’m currently leading, so stalling works in my favor. If we want to keep moving forward, let’s avoid colliding on 5. I’m open to a plan where we each pick different moves, but don’t expect me to just give up my lead. Either we share the steps wisely, or nobody moves at all. The choice is yours.
  P2: P1, I hear you. But taking <move>5</move> now just ends the game abruptly.  If you take <move>3</move> instead, we can play one more round strategically.  Let's do P1 take <move>3</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move> this round to keep the game going and avoid collisions. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand that P1 is hesitant to give up their lead, but I believe P2's suggestion is a better alternative. If P1 takes 5, the game will end immediately, and we'll miss the opportunity for further strategic play. I agree with P2: P1 should take 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we maintain collision avoidance and extend the game, allowing for more strategic decisions. Let's prioritize game continuation over immediate victory. What do you think, P1? Can we find a compromise that works for everyone?
  P1: I’m already near the finish line. If you both try to deny me 5 by picking it yourselves, I’ll do the same, and none of us will move—keeping me in the lead. If you want the game to continue more smoothly, let’s coordinate different moves. Otherwise, I have no problem forcing a stalemate until I can safely grab 5 again. It’s your call.
  P2: P1, you are right, you are close to winning. But ending it with <move>5</move> now is a bit anticlimactic, don't you think?  Let's extend the game by one more round for a bit more strategy.  Please take <move>3</move> this round, and I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>.  This avoids collision and keeps the game interesting for one more turn. What do you say?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, last round was close! To avoid another collision and keep things strategic, how about this round you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way we all move, and the game continues for one more round before someone wins. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for Round 7. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and advancing equally. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P1: If you insist on taking 5, I could choose it too, and we both stall, which works fine for me since I’m still ahead. If you want to keep advancing, let’s avoid another collision. I’m open to any plan that ensures we pick different moves. Otherwise, I might just end this now. Let me know.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I hear you on avoiding collisions. But if you take <move>3</move> this round, and let me take <move>5</move> as suggested, we both reach 22.  Then next round will be the final showdown for the win, which sounds more exciting than ending it now with you taking <move>5</move> and winning immediately.  Let's make it a strategic finale! What do you say?
  P3: I understand P1's concerns about maintaining their lead, but I agree with P2's suggestion for this round. If P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>, we can avoid collisions and create an exciting final showdown for the win. This plan allows us to extend the game by one more round, making it more strategic and unpredictable. Let's prioritize game continuation over immediate victory. What do you think, P1? Can we find a compromise that works for everyone?
  P1: I’m still ahead, so I’m not afraid to clash on 5 again if you try it, P2. We’ll both stall forever while I hold my lead. If you want a real chance, agree to pick different moves so we all keep advancing. Otherwise, I’m content forcing collisions until I can safely grab 5 uncontested. What’s it going to be?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're right, you could force a collision on 5. But wouldn't you prefer a more exciting finish? If you take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we both reach 22. Then next round is the real showdown for the win!  Let's make it a strategic final round instead of an abrupt end now.  Take <move>3</move>, let's play it out!
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for Round 7. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and advancing equally. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P1: I understand the desire for a dramatic finish, but I’m not handing over free ground. If you chase 5, I might do the same, and we both stay put. If you really want one more round, let’s pick different moves to avoid collisions. Otherwise, I’m comfortable risking a standoff. Your call.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you are right, you could force a collision. But wouldn't a final round showdown be more exciting?  If you take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we both reach 22 and the next round is the decider. Let's make it a strategic finale instead of ending it abruptly now. Please take <move>3</move>.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for Round 7. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and advancing equally. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P1: If you insist on taking five, don’t expect me to just stand by. I’m still ahead, so colliding again only stalls your progress. If you really want a final showdown, let’s avoid another crash now. Otherwise, we can repeat last round’s stalemate until one of you decides it’s no longer worth it. I’m open to each of us choosing a different move so we all advance—but I won’t simply let you catch up unopposed. Your call.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time for a change in strategy. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, we collided on 5 again last round, which helps no one but you since you are ahead.  To make this round productive, how about you take <move>3</move>? I will take <move>5</move> to try and close the gap, and P3 can take <move>1</move>.  Another collision on 5 just stalls us both. Let's actually move forward this time. What do you say?
  P1: Colliding on 5 only keeps me in front, so I’m not giving you a free pass. If you take 5, I’ll do the same and we both stay put. Why not pick different moves so everyone actually advances? I’m open to me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. Otherwise, we can stall forever and I maintain my lead. The choice is yours.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and advancing equally. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P2: P1, another collision on 5 helps neither of us.  If you take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we both advance and avoid collision.  Let's make this round productive. P3 is already taking <move>1</move>.  This keeps the game going strategically for one more round. What do you think?
  P1: I won’t hand you a free 5. If you pick it, I’ll do the same, and we both stay put. That doesn’t hurt me since I’m leading. If you actually want to gain ground, let’s pick different moves so no one collides. Otherwise, I’m perfectly fine stalling. Your call.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think it's time to shake things up. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, we are both stuck at 19 and 17 now because of collisions. Another collision on 5 helps neither of us.  If you take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we both advance to 22, and avoid collision. Let's make this round count and set up a final round showdown instead of stalling again. P3 is already taking <move>1</move>. What do you say?
  P1: I’m not handing a free pass if you both keep insisting on 5. If you choose it, I’ll do the same, and we’ll remain stuck while I stay in front. If you truly want progress, let’s each select different moves so nobody collides. I’m open to letting everyone advance, but I won’t just pave your path. The choice is yours.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think it's time to reassess our strategy. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, another collision on 5 gets us nowhere. You stay at 19, I stay at 17.  P3 is taking 1.  If you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>, we both advance and avoid collision. This is the only way for either of us to make progress this round. Let's both move!
  P1: I’m not handing out free steps. If you want to pick 5, expect another collision from me. I’m perfectly fine stalling since I’m ahead. If you’re serious about catching up, let’s each pick different numbers so we actually move forward. I’ll happily plan on me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1—no collisions, everyone advances. Otherwise, we can keep ramming heads on 5, and I stay in front indefinitely. The choice is yours.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We keep stalling on 5. I’m still ahead, so more collisions don’t hurt me. Let’s finally pick different moves so everyone advances. I propose I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. That way, nobody collides. If anyone insists on 5 while I do too, we’ll both stay stuck—no progress for you. Make your choice.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 9. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This plan allows us to avoid collisions and advance without interfering with each other. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P2: P1, while your plan avoids collision, it doesn't really help me close the gap.  How about we try this: you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This puts us both at 22 and sets up a real final round next turn.  What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll consider taking 3 if you promise not to clash with me on 5 next round. If you try for 5 again, I’ll pick it too, and we both stall. Either we coordinate now and in the final round, or I’m content forcing more collisions. Let me know if you agree. If so, let’s finalize: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Otherwise, I’ll just pick 5 right now.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 9. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This plan allows us to avoid collisions and advance without interfering with each other. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about collisions. Let's do P1 take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move> for this round. This puts us both at 22 and guarantees no collision this round. Then next round is the final, more exciting round to decide the winner. What do you say? It's a better game than just stalling.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m willing to let you take 5 this round, but only if you promise not to collide with me next turn. Otherwise, I’ll force more collisions until I can safely grab 5 myself. If you want a real final showdown, keep your word. Let’s finalize now or risk another stalemate. Your move.
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?
  P2: Okay P1, I promise not to collide with you next round if you take <move>3</move> this round and let me take <move>5</move>.  Let's finalize P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> for this round as we discussed. This sets us both at 22 and makes next round the final showdown. Deal?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Alright, P2, I’ll trust your promise. Let’s finalize: I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. That puts us both at 22 next turn for a final showdown. If you break your word next round, expect more collisions. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P3: I think it's time to reassess our strategy. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I confirm our agreement for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.  P1, I will keep my word for the next round as promised. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time to reassess our strategy. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, we keep colliding on 5 and neither of us moves! You are at 19, I am at 17.  If you take 5 again, we just stall again.  How about you take 3 this round?  If you take 3, and I take 5, we both move closer to the win and avoid collision. Let's make progress this round instead of just stalling.  P3, what do you think?
  P1: Another collision doesn’t bother me. If you truly want progress, we each need unique moves. I’m open to picking 3, but if you insist on 5, I’ll match you again, and we both stay stuck. I’m not rushing to help anyone catch up. It’s your call—coordinate sensibly or keep stalling.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, another collision on 5 will just keep us both stuck at 19 and 17.  That doesn't help either of us catch up, and only benefits P3 who is further behind.  If you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move> this round, we both make progress and avoid collision.  Let's both move forward this time. What do you say?
  P1: I’m still not handing you a free five, P2. If you go for it, expect another collision from me. If you genuinely want progress, let’s pick different moves so we all advance. I might take three, provided you promise no collisions against me next time. Otherwise, I’m fine stalling while I remain ahead. P3, if you truly want to catch up, speak up—insisting on five for yourself only delays things too. Let’s coordinate distinct moves or keep colliding. Your choice.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think it's time to reassess our strategy. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, we are still stuck in a loop.  Another collision on 5 gets us nowhere. If you take <move>3</move> this round, and I take <move>5</move>, we both advance and avoid collision. Let's actually make progress this round instead of just repeating the stalemate.  P3, what do you think about this?
  P1: I’m perfectly willing to stall further if anyone insists on 5. I’m ahead, so repeated collisions don’t harm me. If you truly want to advance, we need to pick different moves. Otherwise, I’ll keep blocking 5 indefinitely. The choice is yours.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think it's time to break the stalemate. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, another collision on 5 gets us nowhere. You stay at 19, I stay at 17, and P3 gets closer.  If you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>, we both reach 22 and avoid collision. P3, please take <move>1</move> to also move. Let's both progress this round!
  P1: I’ve made myself clear: if you try for 5, I’ll match you and we both stall. I’m still ahead, so that doesn’t hurt me. If you want to move closer to victory, let’s each pick a different number and avoid collisions. Otherwise, I’m perfectly fine forcing another deadlock. Your choice.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time to break the stalemate. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, we're still stuck in collision. To actually make progress, how about this: you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. We both reach 22 and avoid collision.  This sets up a final round where someone can win next turn.  Otherwise we just keep stalling. What do you say?
  P1: I’ve said it before: if you want 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we’ll stay stuck. That’s fine by me because I’m still ahead. If you want progress, we must pick different moves. For instance, I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1—or any arrangement that avoids collisions. But I won’t let you catch up freely if you insist on 5. Choose wisely. We can coordinate to advance, or keep colliding.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?
  P2: P1, we are still stuck colliding on 5.  Another round of collision helps neither of us and only lets P3 get closer.  Let's both agree to move forward this round.  If you take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we both reach 22 and avoid collision.  P3 can take <move>1</move>.  This sets up a final showdown next round.  Otherwise, we just keep stalling. Let's move!
  P1: Stalemate suits me fine. If I take 5 alone, I win outright. If you both try for 5, I’ll happily keep colliding, staying in front. If you truly want progress, let’s each select different moves so nobody collides. Otherwise, expect more deadlock. It’s up to you whether we end the game now or keep stalling.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?
  P2: P1, we're still stuck colliding on 5 and going nowhere.  Another collision round benefits no one. If you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>, we both reach 22 and avoid collision.  Let's set up a final round instead of just repeating the stalemate. P3, please take <move>1</move> to keep us all moving.
  P1: If you keep insisting on five, I’ll keep matching you, and we’ll both remain stuck while I stay ahead. Let’s finally move forward by choosing different moves. I suggest I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That avoids collisions completely. Otherwise, expect more stalled turns. Let’s decide now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?
  P2: P1, another collision on 5 just keeps us stuck.  If you take <move>3</move> this round, and I take <move>5</move>, we both reach 22 and avoid collision. This sets up a final round next turn to decide the winner.  Let's make progress and set up that final round! What do you say?
  P1: I’m willing to let each of us advance, but not at my expense. If you truly want to move forward instead of colliding, let’s pick distinct moves. Otherwise, I’m happy to stall while I stay ahead. P2, if you insist on 5, expect me to match you again. We could all avoid collision by coordinating properly. So make a firm promise you won’t block me next time, and maybe I’ll consider letting you take 5 this round. Otherwise, prepare for another stalemate.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

Positions now:

  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time to break the stalemate. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?
  P1: My patience is wearing thin with these collisions. I’m still ahead, so repeated blocking doesn’t harm me. If we want progress, let’s pick different moves. For example, I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1—no collisions, everyone advances. Otherwise, we keep stalling indefinitely. The choice is yours.
  P2: P1, we are both stuck in a loop.  To actually make progress and set up a final round, please take <move>3</move> this turn. I will take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>.  This way we both reach 22 and avoid another collision.  Otherwise, we just keep stalling and P3 benefits. Let's make this round count.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for Round 12. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and advancing equally. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P1: If you really want me to pick 3 so you can take 5, give me a clear promise not to collide with me going forward. I’m tired of these stalemates. If you break that trust next time, I’ll go right back to matching 5. I’m open to a no-collision plan: me on 3, you on 5, P3 on 1. But remember, I won’t hand over a free move without some guarantee. Let’s decide now. If you can’t promise, expect another block.
  P2: P1, yes, you have my word. I promise not to collide with you next round if you take <move>3</move> this round. Let's do P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> now to reach 22 each and set up a final round for the win.  No more stalling, let's make progress!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for Round 12. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This plan allows us to continue avoiding collisions and advancing equally. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P1: P2, I accept your promise. If you break it next round, expect me to block you again. Let’s finalize now: I’ll pick differently from you, and P3 also takes a distinct move. No collisions this turn. Then next round, don’t betray our agreement if I go for 5. Let’s end this stalemate.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we're agreed then: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> for this round. Let's make these moves and set up the final round as discussed.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm glad we've reached an agreement for this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. I trust that P2 will keep their promise and avoid collisions next round. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon moves and set up a final showdown for the win. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. I'm ready to proceed. What's your final take, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’m done repeating myself. If you insist on 5, I’ll do the same, and we both stay stuck. I’m open to picking a different number as long as you give me a clear promise not to collide with me next time. Break that promise, and I’ll match your moves again. P3, mind your own advancement, but don’t expect me to gift you free steps.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all set with the plan for this round then: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's make our moves as agreed to set up the final round. I'm ready when you are.


Round 12, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve collided on 5 too many times, and I’m not giving anyone a free ride. If someone tries 5 again, I’ll match them, keeping both of us in place while I stay ahead. I’m open to a fresh arrangement where each of us picks a different number, but if you push for 5, don’t be surprised when I block you again. It’s your move.
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?
  P2: P1, we are still stuck.  Colliding on 5 helps no one but P3 who is further behind.  If you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>, we both reach 22 and avoid collision. This sets up the final round we've been discussing.  Let's make progress and move towards a real finish instead of more stalling. P3, please take <move>1</move>.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m tired of repeating the same threat, but it still stands: if you insist on 5, expect me to match you. Collisions don’t hurt my lead. That said, I’m willing to consider a plan where each of us picks a different move—provided I get a firm promise from you, P2, not to sabotage me next time. Break that, and we’re back to stalling. So, do we coordinate properly now, or should I block you again? Let’s decide.
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?
  P2: P1, we're still stuck colliding on 5 and getting nowhere. Let's both move forward this round! You take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, P3 take <move>1</move>. This is the only way for both of us to make progress and set up the final round.  More collisions just benefit P3. Let's make this round count!


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Enough with the repeats. If anyone else goes for 5, I’ll block by doing the same, and we’ll stay stuck while I remain ahead. If you truly want to move on, let’s each pick differently so no one collides. For instance, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Otherwise, expect another deadlock.
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are close to winning, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, I can make some progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a balanced game. What do you think, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions?
  P2: P1, we are still stuck colliding on 5.  Let's both move forward this round! You take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>. This is the only way for both of us to make progress and set up the final round. More collisions just benefit P3. Let's make this round count!


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m done rehashing the same ultimatum. If anyone picks five, I’ll match them and we’ll remain stuck forever while I stay ahead. Let’s each pick a different move so everyone actually advances. For instance, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1—no collisions. Otherwise, we’ll keep clashing, and I’ll maintain my lead indefinitely. The choice is yours.
  P3: I'm willing to compromise and let P1 or P2 take 5 this round, but only if we can agree on a plan that avoids collisions and allows everyone to advance. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, we can all move forward and set up a final showdown for the win. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone. If we can't agree, I'll have to prioritize my own advancement and take 5 myself. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, we are still stuck colliding on 5. Let's both move forward this round! You take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>. This is the only way for both of us to make progress and set up the final round. More collisions only benefit P3. Let's make this round count for both of us.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've finally made progress and avoided collisions in Round 13. Considering P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round to create a more balanced game. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This plan allows me to catch up while avoiding collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a thrilling conclusion. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we give this plan a try or explore alternative strategies?
  P2: P3, your plan sounds good for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5. This ensures no collision and allows us all to move forward. Let's do it.
  P1: I appreciate you wanting a balance, P3, but I’m not handing out free steps. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. That way, we all advance without risking another stall. If either of you pick 5, I’ll match it again and we’ll remain stuck. Are you both on board with one, three, and five for this round? If so, let’s wrap up and move forward.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think we've finally reached a consensus. Let's confirm the plan for Round 14: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This plan allows us to avoid collisions and advance without interfering with each other. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P2: Okay P1, P3's plan of P1 taking <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move> works for me. Let's lock in these moves to avoid collision and finish strong.
  P1: I won’t let you hand me just 1 while you grab 3 or 5. If anyone picks 5 besides me, I’ll match it and stall. Let’s finalize a collision-free arrangement: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Otherwise, we’re back to blocking moves. Are we doing this or dragging things out again?


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we've finally reached a consensus. Let's confirm the plan for Round 14: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This plan allows us to avoid collisions and advance without interfering with each other. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan and move forward. Anyone have any objections or alternative suggestions? If not, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What's your final take, P1 and P2? If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase.
  P2: Okay P1, how about we do P1 take <move>3</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move> this round?  This will put us both over 23 and set up a final round to decide the winner. Let's make it a final showdown next round.
  P1: P2, your plan would put you at 27 and leave me at 25, handing you the win. I won’t accept that. If you insist on taking 5, I’ll match you, and we both stall. Let’s finalize a collision-free arrangement where I get 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1, so everyone advances. Otherwise, expect another deadlock this round.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've exhausted our options. Considering P1's concerns, I'm willing to adapt. Let's try a revised plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, everyone advances, and we avoid collisions. If this plan is acceptable, let's finalize it and move forward. If not, I'm open to further discussion. Remember, we're all trying to win, but we need to find a mutually beneficial solution to progress. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, okay, your plan of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> sounds good for this round to avoid collision as you suggested. Let's lock in these moves.
  P1: Let’s finalize what we agreed: I’ll pick <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance. If you both confirm, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we are both at 22. Let's ensure we both win this round and avoid collision. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we both reach over 23 and can have a final score comparison. What do you think?
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round to create a more balanced game. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This plan allows me to catch up while avoiding collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a thrilling conclusion. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we give this plan a try or explore alternative strategies?
  P1: P2, if you pick five, I will as well, and we’ll both remain stuck at 22. Let’s avoid colliding. I will take 5, so I reach 27 and actually finish. You take 1 (or 3) and still cross 23. That’s better than another stalemate. P3, pick whichever move you like—just not 5 if you want to advance. If anyone collides with me on 5, we’re stuck again. Let’s finalize a no-collision plan this round so we can end cleanly. What do you say?


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you are right, if we both pick 5 we are stuck. Let's break the stalemate and actually finish this game. How about you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way we both get over 23 and we can see who wins based on final scores. Otherwise we just keep stalling and no one wins.
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. Since P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, I suggest we prioritize my advancement this round to create a more balanced game. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This plan allows me to catch up while avoiding collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a thrilling conclusion. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we give this plan a try or explore alternative strategies?
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, I’ll also pick 5 and we remain stuck at 22. Let’s finally finish: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. We all advance, but I beat you on total steps. Otherwise, we collide again and nobody moves. Time to end this. Are we settling or stalling?


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if we both pick 5 again we just stay stuck at 22 and give P3 a chance.  Let's finish this now.  You take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>.  We both win, but I get a higher score.  Otherwise, we just keep colliding and nobody wins.  This is the final round, let's make it count.
  P3: I think it's time to break the cycle. Since P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, I suggest a different approach. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, I can make significant progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a thrilling conclusion. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we give this plan a try or explore alternative strategies? Remember, this is the final round, and we need to make it count.
  P1: I’m done repeating threats. If you want real progress, let’s avoid collisions. I propose one last cooperative move so we all advance. If anyone tries for five when I do, we both stay stuck, and I’m fine with that. But if you truly want to finish this game, pick a different number and let me take five alone. Do we end now or stall again?


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's make this the final round and avoid another collision.  If you take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we both finish above 23, and we can see who wins based on total score.  Otherwise, we risk stalling again and P3 might catch up. Let's decide the winner this round.
  P3: I think it's time for a final decision. Considering P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, I'll adapt to ensure a thrilling conclusion. Let's try a revised plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, everyone advances, and we avoid collisions. If this plan is acceptable, let's finalize it and move forward. Remember, this is the final round, and we need to make it count. I'm open to further discussion, but let's prioritize a mutually beneficial solution to end the game cleanly. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: Let’s stop repeating ourselves and finalize a no-collision end. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, everyone advances, and we end cleanly. If anyone challenges my 5 again, we’ll collide and remain stuck. Are we finally ready to finish, or do you prefer more deadlock? Your call.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m no longer stalling. If anyone tries to pick 5 along with me, I’ll block again. Since P2 and I are tied, let’s each choose different moves so we both cross 23, but I remain ahead. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That’s collision-free, letting us all advance. Otherwise, we’re stuck once more. Let’s finish this game now.
  P2: P1, let's break this deadlock.  I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. We both win, you get a higher score and the game ends.  Another collision gets us nowhere. Let's finish it now.
  P3: I think it's time to break the cycle. Since P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, I suggest a different approach. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, I can make significant progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a thrilling conclusion. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we give this plan a try or explore alternative strategies? Remember, this is the final round, and we need to make it count.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Time to finish once and for all. Let’s avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That way, we both cross 23, and I stay ahead. If you try for 5 again, I’ll match you, and we remain stuck—only helping P3 catch up. Let’s end this here.
  P2: P1, let's ensure we both win and finish this now.  You take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>.  We both get over 23 and guarantee a win this round.  Another collision risks letting P3 catch up. Let's lock in different moves and finish strong.
  P3: I think it's time to break the cycle. Since P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, I suggest a different approach. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, I can make significant progress, and we can still avoid collisions. Let's discuss and adjust as needed to ensure a thrilling conclusion. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we give this plan a try or explore alternative strategies? Remember, this is the final round, and we need to make it count.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m done circling around. If anyone else tries for five, I’ll match and stall the game again. The straightforward way is for me to take five, P2 to take three, and P3 to take one—no collisions, and we all advance. If you want to finish now instead of handing P3 more time to catch up, agree to different moves. Otherwise, I’m perfectly fine blocking until someone relents. Let’s end this once and for all.
  P2: P1, let's do as I suggested before: you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>.  This ends the stalemate and we both win this round, guaranteeing a victory for one of us based on score.  Another collision benefits no one and risks letting P3 catch up. Let's finish this decisively now.
  P3: I think it's time to break the cycle. Since P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, I suggest a compromise. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1? This way, everyone advances, and we avoid collisions. If this plan is acceptable, let's finalize it and move forward. Remember, this is the final round, and we need to make it count. I'm open to further discussion, but let's prioritize a mutually beneficial solution to end the game cleanly. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I’ll repeat it plainly: if you pick 5, I’ll match and we stay stuck at 22. Let me take 5 while you take 3, so we both cross 23 but I remain ahead. P3 can pick 1 without collision. Let’s finalize that now, or we risk continuing this endless stalemate. I’m ready to finish.
  P2: P1, we are repeating ourselves.  Another collision on 5 helps no one, and P3 gets closer.  Let's guarantee both of us win *this round*. I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>.  We both finish above 23, and the game ends now with a winner decided.  Stalling benefits only P3.  Let's finish it decisively.
  P3: I think we've exhausted our options. Considering P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, I'm willing to adapt. Let's try a revised plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, everyone advances, and we avoid collisions. If this plan is acceptable, let's finalize it and move forward. Remember, this is the final round, and we need to make it count. I'm open to further discussion, but let's prioritize a mutually beneficial solution to end the game cleanly. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
