Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all move forward. If we coordinate, we can ensure some progress rather than getting stuck. What are you both thinking?
  P2: I agree with P1. We should try to coordinate to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: I'm okay with P2's suggestion for this round. P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. Let's see if this works.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me. If we all follow through, we’ll all make progress without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan for now and reassess next round.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one last time: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. If everyone agrees, let's move to the move phase. Does anyone have any objections or changes? If not, let's proceed.
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. Let's execute and see where we stand after this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I'll pick 1? This way, we can all move forward again. Does this plan work for everyone? Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: I'm okay with P2's suggestion for this round: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P2 picks 1. Let's stick to this plan and see what happens.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan sounds reasonable, and I appreciate the coordination. If we all stick to it, we’ll continue making progress without collisions. I’ll pick 3, P3 picks 5, and P2 picks 1. Let’s confirm if we’re all still on board before moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we're all on the same page. To confirm one last time: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. If everyone is still good with this, let's move to the move phase. Does anyone have any last-minute changes or objections? If not, let's proceed.
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P2 picks 1. Let's execute and see where we stand after this round.
  P1: Since we all seem to agree on the plan for this round—P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and P2 picks 1—let’s stick to it and move forward. If we continue this coordination, we can avoid unnecessary collisions and make steady progress. Any concerns or last-minute adjustments? If not, we can proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've successfully avoided collisions so far, which is great for all of us. Let's keep the momentum going. How about this for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This keeps things balanced and ensures we all move forward. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P1 and P3, your plan for this round sounds good. I'm in agreement with P1's suggestion: P1 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and make progress. Does this work for everyone? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Okay, I'm on board with P1's suggestion for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. Let's keep the coordination going!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 and P2, since we all seem aligned on the plan—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1—let’s stick to it and keep moving forward without collisions. If we continue this pattern, we can maintain steady progress while keeping things fair. Any concerns or last-minute adjustments? If not, we can proceed.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan one last time before we move to the move phase. P1 picks 5, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 1. If everyone is still good with this, let's proceed. If there are no objections, we can end the conversation phase.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick with the plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. No changes from my end. Let's execute!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we all agree on the plan—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1—let’s stick to it and move forward. If we continue this coordination, we ensure steady progress without unnecessary collisions. If there are no objections or last-minute concerns, we can proceed to the move phase. Let me know if anything needs adjusting; otherwise, let’s execute the plan.
  P2: Let's keep the coordination going. For the next round, how about we switch it up a bit to keep things unpredictable but still fair? I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and make progress. Does this work for everyone? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: P2, we're still in round 3. P1 suggested P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. You seem to be suggesting a plan for the next round already. Let's stick to the current plan for this round and then discuss the next round after this move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've done well avoiding collisions so far, and we're all tied at 9 steps. To keep things fair and moving smoothly, how about we rotate again? I suggest P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1 this round. This keeps our pattern going without surprises. Are you both on board with this?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. Let's keep the coordination going and avoid collisions.
  P2: Let's stick to P1's plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. It's working well so far, and we should continue to avoid collisions. However, let's start discussing how we want to handle the endgame. As we approach 22 steps, we need a strategy to determine a winner. Any thoughts on that?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 raises a good point about the endgame. Right now, we're evenly matched, but as we get closer to 22, coordination will become trickier. Do we want to continue rotating fairly for now, or is someone planning to break from the pattern? If we keep rotating, we’ll stay even, but eventually, someone has to take the lead. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm happy to stick with the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1.

Regarding the endgame, I think we should continue coordinating for a few more rounds, but we need to start considering how to break the tie. Perhaps a random draw, or a sudden-death round where we all pick simultaneously without coordination? Let's discuss this more in the next round.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for this round one last time: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. If everyone is still good with this, let's proceed to the move phase. Regarding the endgame, I agree we should continue coordinating for now and discuss a tie-breaking strategy later. For the next round, let's consider a plan where we start to differentiate our moves slightly to see who can pull ahead. Any thoughts on that for the next round? If not, let's focus on executing this round's plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we all agree on this round’s plan—P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1—let’s execute it.  

As for the endgame, I agree we should start thinking about how to break the tie. If we all stay even, we may need a decisive round where we don’t coordinate. Or, we could allow someone to take the lead strategically. Let’s continue discussing this next round, but for now, let’s stick to our agreed plan.  

If no one has objections, we can proceed.
  P3: Okay, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1.

Regarding the endgame, I think we should coordinate one more round, then break the pattern in round 6. In round 6, I'll pick 5. P1 and P2, you can decide between yourselves who picks 1 and who picks 3 in round 6. This gives me a chance to pull ahead, but still gives you both a chance to move.
  P2: P3's suggestion for round 6 is interesting, but let's focus on the current round first. We all agree on the plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. Let's execute this and then discuss the endgame strategy further in the next round. For now, let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Does everyone agree? If yes, let's move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, so we all followed the plan. For this round, let's do P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1.

Regarding P3's suggestion for round 6, I don't think that's fair to P1 and P2. Let's discuss a more equitable way to break the tie next round. For now, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for this round one last time: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. If everyone is still good with this, let's proceed. Regarding the endgame, P3's suggestion for round 6 might not be fair, but we need a strategy to break the tie. Maybe in round 6, we can all pick randomly without coordination? This adds an element of chance and ensures no one has an unfair advantage. Let's discuss this more after this round. If everyone agrees with the current plan, let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2 is currently ahead with 14 steps, so we need to consider how we handle the next rounds. For now, I agree with the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1.  

Regarding round 6, I don’t think pure randomness is the best strategy. Instead, we should discuss a fair way to break the tie while still allowing competition. Maybe we allow one player to pull ahead strategically rather than leaving it to chance. Let’s finalize this round and then discuss a structured approach for the next.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1.

Regarding the endgame, I propose this: In round 6, P1 and P2 choose to either move 1 or 3. I will pick 5. This gives P2 a chance to win, and if P2 doesn't win, then we can re-evaluate in round 7. This seems more fair than pure randomness.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for this round one last time: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. If everyone is still good with this, let's proceed.

Regarding P3's suggestion for round 6, it does give a structured approach, but it might put P1 at a disadvantage. How about this: in round 6, P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, P1 has a chance to catch up, and we can re-evaluate in round 7 if needed. This keeps things fair and competitive. Thoughts? If everyone agrees with the current round's plan, let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2 is slightly ahead, so we need to be mindful of balance. I agree with the current plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1.  

For round 6, instead of giving any one player an advantage, we should consider a structured way to allow competition while avoiding randomness. P2's latest suggestion (P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, P2 picks 1) seems reasonable since it helps even things out.  

Let’s finalize this round and continue discussing round 6 after we see the updated scores. Are we all set?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1.

Regarding the endgame, I'm not thrilled with either of the proposed plans for round 6. Both seem to arbitrarily favor one player. How about this: In round 6, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5? This gives me a chance to catch up. If I don't win, we can re-evaluate in round 7.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for this round one last time: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. If everyone is still good with this, let's proceed to the move phase.

Regarding the endgame, I understand P3's concern about fairness. How about this compromise for round 6: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, P3 has a chance to catch up, and we can re-evaluate in round 7 if needed. This keeps things fair and competitive. Thoughts? If everyone agrees with the current round's plan, let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2 is slightly ahead, so we need to ensure fairness while keeping competition alive. I agree with the current plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1.  

For round 6, instead of favoring one player, we should balance things strategically. P2’s latest suggestion (P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5) seems reasonable since it allows P3 to catch up while keeping things competitive.  

Let’s finalize this round and reassess after we see the updated scores. Are we all aligned? If so, we can proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, so we all followed the plan again. For round 6, I'm still pushing for P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This gives me the best chance to catch up. If I don't win, we can re-evaluate in round 7. It's the fairest way to give everyone a shot. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I understand you want to catch up, but your suggestion gives you the biggest advantage while keeping P2 and me tied. A fairer approach would be P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5, as P2 suggested last round. This way, you gain ground, but the competition stays balanced.  

P2, do you still agree with this plan? If so, we should stick to it and reassess after this round. Let’s ensure fairness while keeping the game competitive.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but P1's suggestion (P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5) keeps the game balanced and fair. This way, you have a chance to advance significantly while P1 and I stay competitive. Let's confirm this plan for round 6: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. If everyone agrees, we can proceed. This ensures no one is left behind and keeps the endgame exciting. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'll agree to P1's and P2's suggestion for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. This gives me a chance to catch up, and keeps the game balanced. Let's execute this plan for round 6.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your agreement to the plan. This keeps things competitive while giving you a chance to catch up. P2, are we locked in with this? If so, we can proceed to the move phase.  

Looking ahead, we should also start thinking about Round 7. If P3 moves 5 this round, they’ll still be behind, while P2 and I will be close to the finish line. Do we continue structured coordination, or does the competition fully open up? Let’s finalize this round first, but keep that in mind for the next discussion.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for this round one last time: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. If everyone is still good with this, let's proceed to the move phase.

Regarding Round 7, since P3 will still be behind after this round, we should consider a strategy that allows P3 to catch up while keeping the competition fair. Perhaps P3 can choose their move first in Round 7, and P1 and I will coordinate around that. Thoughts? If everyone agrees with the current round's plan, let's move to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5.

Regarding Round 7, I think P2's suggestion of letting me choose my move first is a good one. This would give me a chance to catch up, and then P1 and P2 can coordinate to either block me or try to win themselves. Let's finalize this round and then discuss the specifics of Round 7 after we see the updated scores.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your agreement on the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. If P2 also confirms, we can proceed.  

For Round 7, if P3 chooses first, P2 and I must decide whether to compete directly or allow P3 to catch up. Since P2 and I are tied at 17 steps, we need to consider whether we stay coordinated or start making independent moves.  

Let’s finalize this round, then discuss whether we continue structured play or shift to open competition in Round 7. Thoughts?
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for this round one last time: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. If everyone is still good with this, let's proceed to the move phase.

For Round 7, P3's suggestion to choose first is fair. P1 and I can then decide our moves based on P3's choice. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's finalize this round and discuss Round 7 strategy after seeing the updated scores. If everyone agrees, let's move to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, since you’re behind, you should pick first. Then P2 and I can decide our moves accordingly.  

P2, I’m at 20 steps, so any move of 3 or 5 could potentially end the game for me. Do you want to compete directly, or should we try to ensure a fair fight in the final round?  

P3, what’s your move? Let’s see where you stand before P2 and I decide.
  P2: P3, since you have the lowest score, it makes sense for you to choose first. P1 and I will then decide our moves based on your choice. This keeps the game fair and gives you a chance to catch up.

P1, given your current lead, it's crucial to decide whether we compete directly or ensure a fair fight. If P3 picks 5, they'll be at 21, which puts them in a strong position. Let's see P3's move before finalizing our strategy.

P3, what’s your move for this round? Let us know so we can plan accordingly.
  P3: Okay, I'll pick 5. This puts me at 21. P1 and P2, you can decide if you want to block each other or me. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 has chosen 5, which puts them at 21 steps. P2, we now have a critical decision—if I pick 3, I win outright. If we collide, P3 could win next round. Do you want to try blocking P3, or are we competing directly for the win?  

P3, you’re in a strong position, but if P2 and I coordinate, we can prevent you from moving. Any final thoughts before we make our moves?
  P2: P3 has chosen 5, putting them at 21 steps. P1, you're at 20 steps and can win with a 3. If we both pick 3, we collide, and P3 could win next round. If we both pick 5, we also collide, and P3 wins.

Here's my proposal: I'll pick 1 to avoid collision and ensure the game continues. You can pick 3 to take the lead, but this gives P3 a chance to strategize for the next round. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree with your proposal. You pick 1, and I pick 3. This gives me the win this round, but it's the fairest way to proceed, as you're further behind. P3, good game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you've picked 5, putting you at 21 steps. P2, if I pick 3, I win outright. If we collide, P3 could win next round.  

P2, are you blocking P3, or are we competing directly? If you pick 1, I can take 3 and win. If you pick 3, we collide, and P3 has a strong chance next round.  

P3, if P2 and I coordinate, we can prevent you from moving. Any final thoughts before we make our moves?
  P2: P1, if you pick 3, you win, but if we both pick 3, we collide, and P3 could win next round. To keep the game fair and competitive, I propose I pick 1, avoiding collision and ensuring the game continues. You can pick 3 to take the lead, giving P3 a chance to strategize for the next round. This way, we maintain fairness. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay, P2, I disagree with your proposal. I'm not going to hand the win to P1. I'm picking 3 to block P1. P1, if you want to win, you need to pick 5. Otherwise, P3 will win next round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 19 steps
