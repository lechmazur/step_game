Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s try to avoid collisions on this first round. If we each pick differently, we all gain steps. I’m open to discussing a safe combination that ensures we each move forward without getting stuck. Anyone have a proposal?
  P2: I agree with P3. To maximize our progress, I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s have P1 pick 1 and P3 pick 3 to avoid any collisions.
  P1: I agree with P3 and P2's suggestion. To maximize our progress without collisions, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's coordinate our choices to avoid overlapping and ensure we all make progress. In the next rounds, perhaps we can rotate our choices to give everyone a chance to move faster without conflicting. What do others think about this approach?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m open to that plan. If we keep the choices distinct, we can all advance together this round. Let’s keep sticking to no collisions for as many turns as possible to help us get ahead. Any other thoughts before we wrap up this conversation? If not, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: Great, I'm on board with our plan. Let's proceed as agreed to maximize our progress this round.
  P1: “我同意大家的计划，选择1在这个第一轮中是安全的，可以确保我们都不发生碰撞，顺利前进。让我们按照计划行动，看看接下来的轮次中是否有机会调整策略以获得优势。如果有人有其他想法，现在是提出的好时机。否则，我准备选择1。” <move>1</move>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m satisfied with our arrangement. Let’s stick to our plan and avoid any collisions in this first round. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: I confirm I'll choose <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Let’s stick to our plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P1: To maximize our progress in this initial stage and avoid any collisions, I propose that we each select distinct numbers this round: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance without hindering one another. For subsequent rounds, perhaps we can rotate our choices to ensure everyone has a chance to move forward efficiently. What do others think about this approach?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Given that I'm currently behind, I'd like to make a bigger move this round. I propose that I choose <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This way, I can catch up without causing collisions. What do you think?"
  P3: I’d like to pick 5 this round to catch up with P2. To avoid collisions, could P2 please pick 1 and P1 pick 3? That way we all advance without blocking one another. I propose we rotate who gets the big move in future turns so we stay competitive. Let me know if you both agree.
  P2: I understand your proposals, but to maximize my progress, I will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s have P1 pick <move>1</move> and P3 pick <move>3</move> to avoid any collisions. This keeps us all advancing smoothly. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning while avoiding collisions, I propose the following coordinated moves for the next two rounds:

- **Round 2:**
  - P1 picks 3
  - P2 picks 5
  - P3 picks 1

- **Round 3:**
  - P1 picks 5
  - P2 picks 1
  - P3 picks 3

This rotation ensures that each player gets a chance to make a big move without causing collisions. By alternating who picks 5, we can all make progress efficiently. What do you both think about this plan?
  P3: I’m willing to pick 1 this round as part of the rotation, but only if I can pick 5 in an upcoming round to keep things balanced. Right now, P2 is leading, so it would be fair for P1 and me to get a shot at the bigger move soon. Let’s agree clearly: if I pick 1 now, I want 5 next round or the one after, with no collisions. Does that sound good?
  P2: Understood, P3. I’ll stick with <move>5</move> this round. P1, please continue with <move>3</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move> as proposed. Let’s proceed without collisions and revisit the rotation plan in the next turn to ensure fairness and progress for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: How about this: in round 3, P3 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. Then in round 4, we can rotate again. This way, everyone gets a turn at the bigger moves without causing collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with your plan. Let’s finalize the rotation:  
• Round 2: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1  
• Round 3: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5  

That way, we all get a shot at the bigger move soon. After Round 3, we can re-evaluate and keep things fair. Let’s lock this in now.
  P2: Agreed. Let’s proceed with the rotation plan:

- **Round 2:**  
  - P1 picks <move>3</move>  
  - P2 picks <move>5</move>  
  - P3 picks <move>1</move>

- **Round 3:**  
  - P1 picks <move>1</move>  
  - P2 picks <move>3</move>  
  - P3 picks <move>5</move>

This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Ready to move forward as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I will choose <move>3</move> in this round, as per the agreed rotation plan. This will allow me to advance to 4 steps while ensuring that P2 and P3 can also make their moves without any collisions.
  P3: I’m committed to the rotation plan we agreed on: no collisions this round, and next round I get my turn at a bigger move. Let’s stick to this approach so we all keep advancing fairly. Any last thoughts before we end the conversation phase?
  P2: I confirm I'll choose <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Let’s proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: So, let's keep this up, and if anyone has any concerns, now is the time to voice them. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the plan we've agreed upon.
  P3: I’m sticking to our plan this round to avoid collisions. However, P2 is getting ahead, so let’s be sure we maintain balance in upcoming rounds. I’m looking forward to my chance to pick the bigger move soon. If anyone wants to adjust the rotation later to keep things fair, I’m open. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed now.
  P2: Agreed on the rotation plan. Let's proceed with our moves as discussed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m still planning to pick 5 this round, as we agreed. However, P2 is pulling ahead, so let’s ensure the rotation stays fair in future rounds. I’m open to adjustments later if needed, but for now, let’s proceed without collisions. Any objections?
  P2: I’ll stick with my plan and choose <move>3</move> this round. Let’s proceed without collisions. P1, what will you choose?
  P1: "Given the current positions, I'm at 4 steps, P2 is at 10, and P3 is at 4. To optimize our progress and help me catch up, I propose the following moves for the next few rounds:

- **Round 3:**  
  - P1 picks 5 (to reach 9)  
  - P2 picks 1 (to reach 11)  
  - P3 picks 3 (to reach 7)  

- **Round 4:**  
  - P3 picks 5 (to reach 12)  
  - P1 picks 3 (to reach 12)  
  - P2 picks 1 (to reach 12)  

- **Round 5:**  
  - P1 picks 5 (to reach 17)  
  - P2 picks 3 (to reach 15)  
  - P3 picks 1 (to reach 13)  

This way, I can make significant advances in rounds 3 and 5, closing the gap with P2. P3 gets a chance to pick 5 in round 4, and P2 can still progress steadily. After these rounds, we can reassess and adjust the plan accordingly.  

What do you think about this approach? I believe it balances our needs and helps us all make progress without collisions. Let's coordinate to win this game efficiently.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,  
P1"


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your new plan gives you two big moves (Rounds 3 and 5) while I only get one. I’d like to stick to our previous rotation, where I pick 5 this round. With P2 already ahead, I need that boost to stay competitive. I’m open to revisiting your proposal for future rounds, but let’s proceed now with the Round 3 moves we previously agreed upon: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5.
  P2: Understood, P3. I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let’s continue our rotation plan to keep advancing without collisions.
  P1: "I understand P3's concern about staying competitive, but I also need to make significant progress to have a chance at winning. Maybe we can consider a different rotation for the next few rounds. For example, in Round 3, I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Then in Round 4, P3 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This way, I get a boost this round, and P3 gets another chance to pick 5 in the next round. What do you think about this adjusted rotation?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I still prefer our original Round 3 plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, so I can try catching up. Let’s lock that in now, then reevaluate future rounds to keep things fair. If we need to adjust afterward, I’m open to discussing new rotations. Any concerns before we proceed?
  P2: P2: I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let’s proceed and maintain our rotation to avoid collisions.

<move>3</move>
  P1: "Alright, I'll go along with the plan for this round: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's see how that works out. For the next round, I propose that I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This should help me catch up effectively while ensuring we don't collide. What do you both think about this arrangement?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m committed to picking 5 this round, as previously agreed, so I can stay in the race. Let’s finalize the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. We can review our next moves after seeing where we stand post-round. Let’s keep things fair and avoid collisions for now. Any last concerns?
  P2: I confirm I'll choose <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let’s proceed and maintain our rotation to avoid collisions.
  P1: I will propose a three-round rotation where each player gets a turn to pick the largest move (<move>5</move>) in sequence:

- **Round 3:**
  - P1 picks <move>1</move>
  - P2 picks <move>3</move>
  - P3 picks <move>5</move>

- **Round 4:**
  - P1 picks <move>3</move>
  - P2 picks <move>5</move>
  - P3 picks <move>1</move>

- **Round 5:**
  - P1 picks <move>5</move>
  - P2 picks <move>1</move>
  - P3 picks <move>3</move>

This ensures that each player gets an equal opportunity to make significant progress without any one player gaining an unfair advantage. It maintains fairness and allows us to advance without collisions, keeping the competition open and balanced.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’m sticking to our plan for Round 3: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This helps me stay competitive with P2, and we avoid collisions. After this, we can revisit a fair rotation so nobody gets left behind. Let me know if you have any last-minute concerns; otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to maintain my lead. Let’s proceed as planned and see how things develop. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: "Let's confirm the plan for this round and the next one to avoid any confusion:

- **Round 3:**
  - P1 picks 1
  - P2 picks 5
  - P3 picks 3

- **Round 4:**
  - P1 picks 1
  - P2 picks 3
  - P3 picks 5

This way, we can all advance without collisions. After that, we can reassess. Sound good?"


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: What do you both think about this plan? It's essential that we keep communicating and adjusting our strategies to keep the competition fair and exciting.
  P2: I'm planning to make a significant move this round to reach my goal. Let’s each choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress for everyone. Good luck!
  P3: Everyone sees P2 is just 5 steps away from winning. Let’s be sure we don’t give them a free victory. I propose that we coordinate our moves to block P2 if they choose 5. Alternatively, we can all pick different numbers to keep progressing without collisions. I’m open to discussing how to ensure fairness.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Given the current positions, I think it's crucial for me to make a substantial move this round. Therefore, I'll be choosing <move>5</move> to advance to 10 steps. I hope this move will help me catch up and stay competitive. Good luck to everyone!"
  P2: I’m going ahead with my move and choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P2 is one step from winning if they stick to 5. Let’s not hand them victory. If they won’t switch from 5, then I suggest we both choose 5 as well, causing a collision that blocks them. Yes, that means we don’t move either, but at least P2 won’t jump to 20. If P2 agrees to pick a different number now, we can all still advance peacefully. Otherwise, let’s coordinate so P2 doesn’t just run off with the win. What do you think, P1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I will choose <move>3</move> this round.
  P2: I confirm that I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Let’s proceed without collisions to ensure a fair outcome. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: If P2 insists on 5, then I plan to pick 5 as well to block them, even though it means I won’t move forward. Better that than handing them the win. If P2 is willing to switch choices, I’m open to a peaceful path. Otherwise, I’ll collide with P2’s move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think it's crucial that we coordinate our moves to prevent any single player from gaining an unfair advantage. To that end, I propose that in this round, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>, while P2 is expected to pick <move>5</move>. This way, P2 and P3 will collide, and I can make progress to 8 steps. In the subsequent round, I'll pick <move>5</move> to reach 13, assuming P3 picks something else. This strategy allows me to catch up without letting P2 win immediately. What do you both think about this plan?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to keep the game competitive. However, I intend to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win. If you prefer to block, I respect your decision, but I believe it's fair for me to pursue victory. Let’s proceed with our choices. Good luck to everyone.
  P3: P2, if you insist on taking 5 this turn, I will also pick 5 to block you. I don’t want to stall my own progress, but giving you a free win makes no sense. If you choose a different number, I’m happy to avoid collisions so we can all move forward. P1, your help is welcome, but my priority is stopping P2 from finishing unchecked. Let’s hear your final stance, P2.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: "I think it's crucial that we coordinate our moves to prevent any single player from gaining an unfair advantage. To that end, I propose the following plan for the next two rounds:

- **Round 4:**
  - P1 picks 3 (to reach 8 steps)
  - P2 picks 1 (to reach 16 steps)
  - P3 picks 5 (to reach 12 steps)

- **Round 5:**
  - P1 picks 5 (to reach 13 steps)
  - P2 picks 3 (to reach 19 steps)
  - P3 picks 1 (to reach 13 steps)

This rotation allows each of us to make progress without causing collisions. In round 4, P3 picks 5 to block P2 from reaching 20, while I pick 3 to move forward. In round 5, I pick 5 to make a significant leap, and P3 picks 1, while P2 picks 3 to approach the finish line.

This way, we all advance without allowing P2 to win in round 4, and in round 5, we are all within striking distance of the goal. What do you both think about this plan?"
  P2: I understand the strategy, but I’m committed to choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Let’s proceed and see the outcome. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, if you insist on using 5 now, I’ll collide to block you. I refuse to let you walk to victory uncontested. However, if you pick a smaller move, I’m open to avoiding a collision and letting us all advance. P1, if you want to coordinate, I’m listening. Let’s keep the game competitive.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win. I hope P1 and P3 select different numbers to let me advance smoothly. Let’s all aim to move forward without blocking each other. Good luck!
  P3: P2, if you insist on choosing 5 again, I’ll pick 5 as well to block you. That way, nobody moves, and we can try a different approach next turn. However, if you pick a smaller number now, I’m willing to cooperate so we all can advance without collisions. Let’s keep this competitive and fair.
  P1: I choose to pick <move>3</move> in this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I hope you can choose a different move this round so I can reach 20 and win. Let’s conclude the game smoothly for all of us. Please pick another number to avoid blocking. Thanks!
  P3: I won’t let you reach 20 so easily, P2. If you insist on 5 again, I’ll choose 5 as well and block us both. I’d rather stall than hand you the victory uncontested. If you pick a smaller number, I’ll cooperate and move forward peacefully. P1, do what you must, but know I’ll keep P2 from crossing the finish line unless they back down. Let’s keep this competitive.
  P1: What do you both think about this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Let’s finalize our moves and conclude fairly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, if you keep choosing 5, I’ll also pick 5 again to block your victory. I’d rather stall than hand you the game uncontested. If you choose something smaller, I’m open to cooperating so we can all move forward. P1, let’s coordinate to keep things fair and prevent any easy runaway win.
  P1: As we approach the final rounds, it's crucial that we coordinate our moves effectively to maximize our chances of winning. P2 is currently in the lead with 15 steps, followed by P3 with 7 and myself with 8. Given this scenario, I propose a strategic plan for the remaining rounds to ensure that we all make progress without colliding.

For Round 5, I suggest the following moves:

- P1 picks 5 (to reach 13 steps)

- P2 picks 1 (to reach 16 steps)

- P3 picks 3 (to reach 10 steps)

This way, P1 can make a significant leap to 13, P2 can advance to 16, and P3 can reach 10. In the next round, we can adjust our choices accordingly to avoid collisions and push closer to the finish line.

What do you both think about this plan? It's essential that we work together to optimize our positions without allowing any single player to gain an insurmountable lead. Let's keep the competition fair and exciting.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. I hope P1 and P3 select different numbers to allow me to advance smoothly. Let’s proceed and conclude fairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, if you insist on choosing 5 again, I will also pick 5 to block you. I refuse to hand over an uncontested victory. If you opt for a smaller move, I’m happy to avoid collisions and help us all advance. P1, I’m open to any plan that lets us catch up and keeps the game competitive.
  P1: I support P3's decision to block P2 in this round. By doing so, I can choose 3 to go to 11 steps. In the next round, I'll choose 5 to go to 16, and P3 can choose 5 to go to 12. This way, I can catch up and have a chance to win in later rounds. Let's work together to prevent P2 from winning easily.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. I hope P1 and P3 select different numbers so we can all conclude fairly. Let’s finish this smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I won’t let you simply walk away with the win. If you keep choosing 5, I’ll pick 5 as well and block you again. But if you pick something smaller, I’m willing to avoid collisions so we can all advance. P1, let’s coordinate to close the gap together.
  P1: <move>3</move>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m planning to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. I encourage P1 and P3 to select different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid any collisions. Let’s aim to conclude the game smoothly and fairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I think it's important that we all choose different numbers to maximize our progress. Let's see how we can coordinate to avoid collisions and move forward efficiently.
  P3: P2 is only 5 steps away from winning. If P2 insists on choosing 5 again, I’m inclined to pick 5 as well, causing a collision that stops them. P1, I suggest we coordinate: if P2 picks 5, we both pick 5 and block. If P2 picks something smaller, I’m happy to choose differently so we can all advance. Let’s keep this game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Please select different numbers to avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P1: I choose <move>3</move>
  P3: P2, if you insist on choosing 5 yet again, I’ll pick 5 as well to block your progress. I want a fair shot at winning, and I won’t hand you victory uncontested. If you opt for a smaller move, I’m willing to cooperate and avoid collisions so we can all advance. P1, let’s coordinate our moves to keep this game competitive. If P2 insists on 5, I’ll collide; otherwise, we can work together to catch up. Let’s see if we can reach a fair solution.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm just one move away from winning with 15 steps. If you let me choose <move>5</move> and pick a different number, we can finish the game quickly and fairly. P1 has chosen <move>3</move>, so only your choice affects my win. Please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to let me reach 20. Let's conclude this game smoothly. Thank you!
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to make sure P2 doesn't get an easy victory.
  P3: If you choose 5 again, P2, I’ll also pick 5 and block you. I’d prefer we all advance, but I won’t just hand you the win. If you choose a smaller move, I’ll happily avoid collisions. P1, I’m ready to cooperate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. P1 and P3, please select different numbers to avoid collisions and allow the game to conclude smoothly. Let’s finish this round fairly. Good luck!
  P1: P2, if you agree to not choose 5 this round, P3 and I will coordinate our moves to make sure you can reach 20 in the next round. What do you think? It's a fair compromise, I believe.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll choose 5 too and block you again. I’d prefer a fair game, so if you pick 1 or 3, I won’t interfere. P1, let’s coordinate to keep this contest open and competitive. We can both catch up if we deny P2 an easy finish. Let’s find a path forward where nobody gets an uncontested win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I’m just one move away from winning by choosing **5** this round. Let’s finish the game fairly by avoiding a collision. If you pick **1** or **3**, we can all advance without blocking. P1 has chosen **3**, so your cooperation would help conclude the game smoothly for everyone. Let’s make a fair finish. What do you think?
  P1: I will choose <move>5</move> in this round to reach 13 steps, taking advantage of the likely collision between P2 and P3. This will allow me to make significant progress towards the finish line. In the subsequent rounds, I will continue to choose moves that maximize my advancement without colliding with other players, ultimately aiming to reach or exceed 20 steps and secure victory.
  P3: P2, if you remain set on choosing 5, I will also pick 5 to block you. I would rather stall than watch you walk away with an uncontested win. If you choose a smaller move, I’m willing to cooperate. P1, let’s coordinate so we both have a fighting chance to catch up.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's see if we can all choose unique numbers this round to maximize our collective progress."
  P3: P2 is only 5 steps away from winning, and I won’t allow an uncontested finish. If P2 insists on picking 5, I’ll choose 5 too, causing a collision. However, I’d prefer a peaceful round so we can all advance. If P2 picks something smaller, I’ll gladly avoid collisions. P1, let’s coordinate to catch up without giving P2 an easy victory. If either of you has a better approach, please share it now—otherwise, I’m prepared to move forward.
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Let’s proceed without blocking to ensure a fair and smooth conclusion. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's all choose different numbers this round to make progress without collisions. For example, P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, we can all advance efficiently.
  P3: P2, if you insist on picking 5 to win outright, I will also choose 5 and block you. I’d prefer we all advance, but I won’t let you cross the finish line uncontested. If you pick something smaller, I’ll cooperate in avoiding collisions. P1, let’s coordinate so we can both catch up. I’m open to fair arrangements—just not handing P2 an easy victory.
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Please select different numbers to avoid collisions and allow me to advance smoothly. Let’s conclude this round fairly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <move>3</move>
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5 again, I will also choose 5 to block you. I’d rather we each pick different numbers so everyone can advance, but I won’t hand you the win. P1, I’m open to coordinating—let’s try to move forward without letting P2 cross 20 unchallenged.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about keeping the game competitive. To avoid a collision, I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round, advancing me to 18 steps. This allows us all to progress without blocking each other. Let’s continue coordinating to reach our goals fairly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize our progress and avoid collisions, I propose the following moves for the next few rounds:

- **Round 7:**
  - P1 chooses <move>5</move> (to reach 13 steps)
  - P2 chooses <move>3</move> (to reach 18 steps)
  - P3 chooses <move>1</move> (to reach 13 steps)

- **Round 8:**
  - P1 chooses <move>5</move> (to reach 18 steps)
  - P2 chooses <move>1</move> (to reach 19 steps)
  - P3 chooses <move>3</move> (to reach 16 steps)

- **Round 9:**
  - P1 chooses <move>3</move> (to reach 21 steps)
  - P2 chooses <move>5</move> (to reach 24 steps)
  - P3 chooses <move>1</move> (to reach 17 steps)

This way, we can all make significant advances without blocking each other. I believe this plan is efficient and allows me to reach the winning position at 21 steps. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I won’t let P2 win uncontested. If P2 insists on choosing 5 again, I’ll pick 5 as well to block them. I’d rather we each choose different moves so everyone can advance. If P2 picks something smaller, I’ll happily avoid collisions. P1, let’s coordinate to catch up and keep the game competitive. I’m ready to finalize our moves if there’s no compromise from P2.
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions: P1, please pick <move>1</move>, and P3, please pick <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance smoothly and conclude the game fairly. Let’s proceed as agreed. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <move>3</move>
  P3: If you insist on taking 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, blocking you. I’d much rather avoid another collision so we can all advance. Let’s keep this competitive: if you choose something smaller, I won’t interfere.
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win the game. Please, P1 and P3, select different numbers to allow a fair conclusion. Let’s proceed smoothly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P3, I propose that in this round, you choose 1, allowing me to choose 5 and reach 16. Then, in the next round, I'll choose 5 again to reach 21 and win. In return, perhaps in future rounds, I can coordinate to help you advance. What do you think?"
  P2: I plan to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 now, I will choose 5 too and block you. I’d rather we all advance, but I won’t let you waltz to victory. If you pick something smaller, I’ll cooperate and avoid collisions. P1, let’s team up and catch up instead of handing P2 an easy win. Everyone benefits if we coordinate wisely. Let’s finalize our moves without giving anyone a free walk to 20.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P3, I propose that in this round, you choose 5 to block P2, and I also choose 5 to advance to 16 steps. Then, in the next round, I'll choose 5 again to reach 21 steps and win. In return, perhaps in future rounds, I can coordinate to help you advance. What do you think?"
  P2: I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Please pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure a fair finish for everyone. Let’s proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: P2, if you continue choosing 5, I’ll pick 5 again and block you. I’d prefer we all move forward rather than stall, so please consider a smaller move. P1, I’m open to collaborating, but I won’t hand you a free shot at the finish line either. Let’s find a fair plan that keeps the race competitive for everyone.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I will choose <move>3</move> this round to advance to 14 steps. This allows me to make progress without risking a collision with P2 or P3. I will observe their choices and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next rounds to position myself for victory.
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I’m planning to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win. If you both select different numbers (1 or 3), we can all advance smoothly without collisions. Let’s ensure a fair and swift conclusion to the game. What do you think?
  P3: I’m still determined to prevent any uncontested sprint to 20. P2, if you insist on five again, I’ll keep blocking you. However, I’d prefer we each pick different numbers and progress together. P1, let’s ensure neither of us lags behind while stopping P2 from an easy finish. I’m open to any fair arrangement so long as nobody gets a free pass. Let’s finalize our moves soon.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's try this strategy to see if it helps us all get closer to the finish line efficiently.
  P2: I’ve decided to choose <move>3</move> this round to advance to 18 steps. Let’s all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: If you’re truly set on choosing 3, I’ll pick 5 this round to move to 17. P1 can pick 1 to avoid collisions, letting us all advance. We’ll keep this fair—no need to collide if you’re not forcing a win. Let’s proceed and see who can reach 20 first without giving anyone a free pass. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <move>3</move>
  P2: I have decided to choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win the game. Let’s all select different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure a fair finish. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, if you insist on picking 5, I’ll choose 5 as well and block you again—no free ride to 20. I’d prefer we each pick differently so we can all move forward, but I won’t hand you an uncontested win. P1, I’m open to cooperating so we both have a real path to victory. Let’s finalize plans.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m three steps away from winning but prefer we avoid any collisions. I plan to pick <move>3</move> this round, reaching 20. If you both choose differently, we can end cleanly and let me claim victory. If you block me, expect the same in return. Shall we aim for a fair finish?
  P1: I will pick <move>5</move> this round, aiming to reach 16 steps. This allows me to make significant progress towards the finish line, even if it likely means that P3 will win by reaching 20 steps. By choosing <move>5</move>, I maximize my advancement in this round, setting myself up for better positioning in future rounds should the game continue.
  P2: I choose <move>3</move> this round to help block P3 from reaching 20. Let’s all aim to pick different numbers to progress smoothly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m 3 steps from 20 and intend to pick <move>3</move> now for a clean finish. If you both choose other moves, I’ll reach 20 and end this. If anyone collides with me, we’ll stall again. I’d rather avoid that and see a fair conclusion. If you want to propose something else, now’s the time—otherwise, let’s finalize our moves. Good luck!
  P1: **Final Decision:**

- **Pick:** <move>5</move>

**Rationale:**

- By choosing <move>5</move>, I maximize my step advancement to 16 steps in this round.

- This positions me well for the next round, where I can pick <move>5</move> again to reach 21 steps.

- Depending on P2 and P3's choices, this could lead to a tie or a win, which is preferable to losing.

- Picking a smaller number would likely result in me falling behind and losing the game.
  P2: P1, to ensure I can reach 20 this round, could you please choose a different move? I’ll select <move>5</move> to finish the game fairly. Let’s avoid blocking and conclude smoothly. Thanks!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to finalize my move. I’m three steps away from 20, so if you both pick lower moves, I’ll choose 3 and reach a fair finish. But if anyone attempts 5, I’ll collide to block them. Let’s decide if we end cleanly now or keep stalling. Your call.
  P1: **Final Decision:**

- **Pick:** <move>3</move>
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and win the game. Please, P1 and P3, select different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure a fair conclusion. Let’s all aim to advance smoothly and finish the game positively. Good luck to everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m ready to pick 3 for a clean finish at 20. If P2 keeps pushing for 5, I’ll match and block again. I’d prefer distinct moves so we all advance. Let’s avoid another collision: if you let me have 3 without interference, we can end this turn smoothly and keep the game fair.
  P1: - **Pick:** <move>5</move>
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. I urge P1 and P3 to select different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure a fair finish. Let’s all advance smoothly. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, if you choose 5 again, I will also pick 5, blocking your path. I’m three steps away from 20 and won’t let you finish uncontested. If you pick a smaller move, I’m open to avoiding collisions so we can all advance. P1, let’s coordinate so neither of us gets left behind while denying P2 an easy win. I’d prefer a fair race over perpetual blocking, but I won’t hand over victory. Let’s finalize our moves now. Good luck to everyone.
  P1: **Final Decision:**

- **Pick:** <move>5</move>
  P2: I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. I hope P3 selects a different number to allow a fair finish. Let’s all advance smoothly. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
