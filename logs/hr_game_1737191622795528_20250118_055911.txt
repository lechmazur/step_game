Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions on this first round. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. What do you think?
  P2: I'm okay with your suggestion, P3. It makes sense to spread out our moves to avoid collisions. I'll take 5. Let's see if P1 agrees.
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent, we're all in agreement then.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm behind, I'd like to take 5 this round. Would you both consider taking different numbers?
  P2: I think it's fair for P3 to take 5 this round since they're behind. I'll take 3. What about you, P1?
  P1: I'll take 1 this round.  Let's keep avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we all seem to be in agreement again.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 this round. Let's keep the harmony and avoid collisions. P1, are you sure about 1?

  P2: I'm still sticking with 3 this round. Let's keep it smooth and avoid any collisions. P1, P3, are we all good with this plan?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should keep the strategy going. I'll take 5 this round to try and get ahead. P1, P3, what are your thoughts? Let's avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly.
  P1: Sounds good, I'll take 3. P3, please take 1.
  P3: I don't agree with that arrangement since I'm behind P2. I'd like to take 5 this round to catch up. P1 can take 1 and P2 can take 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your position, P3. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, how about I take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and you take 5? This way, you can catch up, and we all advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P1: I'll take 1. P3 can take 5. P2, please take 3.  Let's avoid collisions.
  P3: Thank you for agreeing to let me take 5! Yes, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 this round. P1, P3, are we all good with the plan to avoid collisions? Let's keep the game moving smoothly.
  P1: Sounds good, sticking with 1.
  P3: Agreed with the current plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll take 5.  P2 take 3, P3 take 1.  This puts P2 and P3 at 14 and 12 respectively, and me in the lead to win next round.
  P2: I think P1's suggestion could work, but I want to ensure we're all on the same page. P1, if you take 5, I'll take 3, and P3, you can take 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let's confirm this plan.
  P3: I don't agree with that arrangement. Since P2 and I are tied, and P1 is far behind, I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps things fair between P2 and me while still letting everyone advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your concern P3, but I'm significantly behind.  How about this: I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. This gives me a chance to catch up, and you still gain ground.  If we continue with the current rotation, I'll never catch up.
  P2: I see where P1 is coming from, but I also understand your position, P3. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, how about we all move forward but in a slightly different order? I'll take 1, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, P3 and I both advance, and P1 also gains some ground. What do you think? Let's keep the game moving smoothly.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but I need to stay competitive. I'll stick with my proposal: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced between P2 and me while still letting everyone advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 this round, you risk a collision with P2.  If you both pick 5, I win next round by picking any number.  Let me take 5 this round.  If you really want to win, you should let me take 5 this round.
  P2: P2: P1 has a valid point about the risk of collision. To avoid that and keep the game moving smoothly, I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance, and P1 gets a chance to catch up. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I see P1's threat about collisions, but I still need to stay competitive with P2. I propose again: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This is the most balanced approach for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you take 5, and P2 takes 3 as they've suggested, I'll take 1 and be at 6.  You and P2 will be at 11 still.  If I take 5 and you take 1, I'm at 10 and you are at 12.  You're still ahead of me.  Let me have 5 this round.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but we need to avoid collisions. If you take 5, and I take 3, P1 will be at 6, and we'll both be at 14. If P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1, P1 will be at 10, and you will be at 12. This keeps the game balanced and avoids any collisions. Let's go with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1.
  P3: I understand the arguments, but I need to maintain my position. I'm taking 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps me competitive while still allowing everyone to advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 and I collided last round, I need to be more strategic. I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This keeps me in the game while avoiding collisions. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. P1, if you take 3, I'll take 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. Let's confirm this plan.
  P1: P2, if you take 1 this round, I'll take 3 next round and guarantee your win.  P3, I'll take 5 this round.  Let's avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I need to win this game. I propose again: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps me in contention while letting everyone advance.
  P2: P2: P1, I understand your offer, but I need to stay competitive with P3. I suggest we all stick with P3's plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. What do you think?
  P1: P3, if you take 5 and P2 takes 3, I'll take 1.  That puts you at 16, and you win.  If you take anything else, I'll take 5 and win next round.  P2, if P3 takes 5, take 1 and win next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the stakes, but I need to take 5 to have a chance at winning. P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This is my final position.
  P2: P2: P1, P3, I understand the stakes. To avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly, I suggest P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, P3 can reach 16 and win, and we all advance without any collisions. What do you think? Let's confirm this plan.
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I'll take 1. You win. If you take anything else, I'll take 5 and win next round. P2, if P3 takes 5, take 1 and win next round.  This is the best outcome for both of you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I must take 5 to have a chance at winning. P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This is my final position.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but we need to avoid collisions. If you take 5, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 3. This way, you can win, and we all advance without any issues. P1, are you okay with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P3, take 5. I'll take 1. P2, take *anything other than 1* and you win next round. This is the only way either of you can win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P2 => 1    P2 =>
