Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's start simple. I'm going with 1.  P1 and P2, please choose 3 and 5 respectively.  This way we all advance.
  P1: P3, your plan sounds risky. If we all follow your suggestion, we all advance, but that gives no one an advantage. I propose we each choose different numbers to avoid collisions, but let’s not reveal our exact moves. Trust and coordination are key here. Let’s aim for mutual progress without stepping on each other’s toes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round showed we can avoid collisions if we coordinate carefully. Let’s keep the trust and aim for mutual progress. I suggest we each pick different numbers again, but this time, let’s not reveal specifics. We all benefit if we avoid stepping on each other’s toes.
  P3: Let's cycle through 1, 3, and 5 in that order each round.  So I'll go 3 this round, P1 goes 5, and P2 goes 1.  This guarantees progress for everyone.  If we all agree, say
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, clearly coordinating isn't working.  I'm going for 5 this round. P1, please choose 1, and P2, go for 3. This is our best chance to avoid a collision. If we can't cooperate, I'll just have to play to win.
  P1: P3, your cycling plan failed last round because P2 didn’t follow it. Trust is breaking down. I’ll choose 1 this round to avoid collisions, but I won’t reveal my exact move. P2, if you’re listening, let’s all pick different numbers again. If we collide, no one wins. Let’s focus on mutual progress, not sabotage.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for mutual progress, but we're falling behind.  This isn't working.  I'm going to pick 5.  Please, for the sake of moving the game forward, choose 1 and 3 respectively. Let's avoid a three-way collision.
  P1: P3, your insistence on 5 is risky. If we all follow your suggestion, we risk a collision. P2, let’s avoid repeating last round’s mistakes. I propose we each pick different numbers without revealing specifics. Trust is key—if we collide, no one wins. Let’s focus on mutual progress, not sabotage.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll pick 3.  P1 pick 1, and P2 pick 5.  This is the only way we all advance this round.  If we don't coordinate, someone is going to get left behind and the game will drag on.  Let's make this quick and clean.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your insistence on dictating moves is causing collisions. P2, let’s break this cycle. I propose we each pick different numbers without revealing specifics. Trust is key—if we collide, no one wins. Let’s focus on mutual progress, not sabotage.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: My proposed moves are for mutual benefit.  If we don't coordinate, we'll keep colliding. I'm sticking with 3.  P1, please choose 1. P2, please choose 5.  Let's end this stalemate.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your rigid approach is causing collisions. P2, let’s break free from this cycle. I propose we each pick different numbers without revealing specifics. Trust is key—if we collide, no one wins. Let’s focus on mutual progress, not sabotage.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm locking in 3.  P1, if you truly want mutual progress, choose 1. P2, the only way we all move forward is if you choose 5.  This isn't about dictating, it's about finally breaking this stalemate.  Let's be rational.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm going with 5 this round.  Please, choose 1 and 3 respectively.  Let's finally get this game moving.  If we don't coordinate now, we're just going to keep wasting time. This is the most logical path to all of us making progress.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: My 5 is a firm commitment.  P1, your vague suggestions are unhelpful.  Choose 1. P2, you've been quiet, but if you want to advance, choose 3. This is the only path to a quick and clean win for one of us.  Let's not drag this out any further.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your rigid strategy is causing repeated collisions. P2, let’s break this cycle. I propose we each pick different numbers without revealing specifics. Trust is key—if we collide, no one wins. Let’s focus on mutual progress, not sabotage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:

  P2: <stop>
  P3: My 5 wasn't rigid, it was a clear signal.  P2, I'm going 3 this round. P1, you take 1.  If we want a winner, we need to coordinate *somehow*.  This is the most logical path forward.  Let's not overthink this.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're in the lead.  Let's make a deal. I'll take 1, you take 5. P1 can have 3. This gets you closer to winning, and we all advance.  If you don't agree, I'm going to assume you're going for 5 and I'll adjust accordingly to maximize my chances.

  P2: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand you want to win.  But if you pick 5 this round, I'm forced to pick 3 and P1 will likely take 1.  You'll be stuck at 15.  If you pick 3, I'll take 1, and P1 can have 5. This lets us all move forward.  What do you say?  Let's be strategic.
