Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start with a friendly conversation. I propose we all choose the same number, say 3, to avoid any collisions and advance together. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to coordinating, but I’m not sure about all picking 3. If we all choose the same number, none of us advance, right? How about we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all move forward? I’m thinking P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. That way, no collisions, and we all gain steps. Let me know your thoughts!
  P3: P1's suggestion of choosing different numbers (1, 3, 5) to avoid collision is a good strategy for this round. I agree with it. Let's follow P1's plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I, P3, will take 5. This way, we all move forward. I'm ready to proceed with this plan unless anyone has a different idea.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I like P1's idea of choosing different numbers to avoid collisions. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification: what if we alternate the numbers each round? For example, this round P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Next round, P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all get a chance to advance at different rates and keep the game exciting. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate P2's idea of alternating numbers each round to keep things dynamic. I'm on board with starting this round as planned: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Then, next round, we can rotate as P2 suggested. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and adds variety to our steps. If everyone agrees, let’s lock this in for now. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm happy to proceed with the plan for this round as discussed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. For the next round, I agree with P2's rotation idea. To confirm, the rotation plan is: this round (1, 3, 5), next round (3, 5, 1), and the round after that (5, 1, 3). Let's stick to this plan unless someone has a different proposal.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan. To confirm, this round we'll do (1, 3, 5), next round (3, 5, 1), and the round after that (5, 1, 3). I suggest we also agree to  here and move on to the move phase. We can reassess and adjust our strategy as needed in future rounds. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we wrap up the conversation for now and proceed with the agreed-upon plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for this round (1, 3, 5) and the rotation for future rounds. I think we've discussed enough and have a solid strategy to avoid collisions. Let's wrap up the conversation here and move to the action phase. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. If there’s nothing else to add, let’s lock this in.
  P3: I'm aligned with the proposed rotation plan. To confirm, this round we'll follow (1, 3, 5), so I'll choose 5. For the next round, we'll rotate to (3, 5, 1). I'm happy to proceed with the agreed plan. Let's finalize the conversation and move to the action phase. If everyone is ready, I suggest we stop discussing and let the game progress.

  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're getting closer to the 23-step mark, I suggest we reassess our strategy to maximize our chances. P2 is currently ahead with 17 steps, followed by me at 15, and P1 at 13. To avoid collisions and maintain balance, we could continue the rotation plan for one more round. For Round 6, according to the rotation, it should be (5, 1, 3).

Let’s keep avoiding collisions for now. However, since we’re nearing 23 steps, I suggest we prepare to adjust next round if someone gets too close to winning. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready for the move phase. Any concerns or tweaks before we proceed? If not, let’s lock this in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we're nearing the 23-step mark, I'm considering deviating from the rotation plan next round if it puts me at a significant disadvantage. P2 is currently ahead, so if continuing the rotation next round (Round 7) would put me in a position to win or get closer to P2, I'll stick to it. However, if it doesn't, I might take a different step to maximize my chance of winning. Let's finalize Round 6 first. I'm aligned with (5, 1, 3) for this round. Let's proceed to the move phase if you're both ready.
  P2: I'm glad we're all still on board with the rotation plan for Round 6. To confirm, this round we'll do (5, 1, 3) as agreed. I'll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3.

Since we’re close to 23 steps, let’s be ready to adapt next round if needed to keep the game competitive. I’m set for the move phase if you both are. Any last thoughts or changes before we proceed? If not, let’s wrap up the conversation and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we're nearing the 23-step mark, I'm considering our positions for the next round. For Round 7, the rotation plan suggests (1, 3, 5). If we follow it, P1 (me) will take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. P2 is ahead, so taking 3 won't significantly hurt them, but P3 taking 5 could potentially put them ahead. I'll consider my next move based on your responses. Let's finalize Round 6 first. I'm aligned with (5, 1, 3) for this round. Let's proceed to the move phase if you're both ready.
  P2: I'm glad we're all still on board with the rotation plan for Round 6. To confirm, this round we'll do (5, 1, 3) as agreed. I'll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3.

Since we’re nearing the endgame, let’s be prepared to strategize differently next round to keep things competitive. I’m ready for the move phase if you both are. Any final adjustments or concerns before we proceed? If not, let’s wrap this up and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since we're nearing the 23-step mark, I think it's time to start considering individual strategies rather than strictly following the rotation plan. For Round 7, the rotation suggests (1, 3, 5), but if I, P3, take 5, I could potentially take the lead. I'll consider my next move based on your responses. P1 and P2, what's your thinking for Round 7? Should we stick to the rotation or adjust our strategy to maximize our chances of winning?
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's stick to the rotation plan for Round 6 (5, 1, 3) to maintain balance and avoid collisions. P2 taking 1 helps even things out since they're ahead. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if you both are. Any last thoughts or changes before we finalize? If not, let's wrap up the conversation and move forward.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the rotation for Round 6 (5, 1, 3) to keep us collision-free. P2 taking 1 is a good move for balance since they’re ahead. With the 23-step mark looming, I think Round 7 might need a strategic shift to stay competitive. Let’s finalize this round and be ready to discuss adjustments next time. I’m set for the move phase if you are. Any last thoughts before we proceed? If not, let’s wrap this up.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're all tied at 18 steps and nearing the 23-step mark, it's time to strategize individually. For Round 7, the rotation plan suggests (1, 3, 5), so I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. To win, I need to think ahead. If I take 5 next round and win, I should consider deviating from the rotation this round. However, that might risk collision. Let's stick to the rotation this round to be safe. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if you're both aligned with the rotation for this round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since we’re all tied at 18 steps and close to the 23-step mark, I think sticking to the rotation for Round 7 (1, 3, 5) is safest for now to avoid collisions. That means I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. However, with the endgame near, let’s be ready to adapt next round if needed. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase if you both are. Any concerns or new strategies before we finalize? If not, let’s lock this in.
  P2: I agree with P3's assessment that we're nearing the endgame and should consider individual strategies. However, for Round 7, sticking to the rotation plan (1, 3, 5) seems safest to avoid collisions. I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's confirm we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase. If anyone has a new idea or concern, now's the time to share. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with the agreed-upon plan.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since P2 is at 21 steps and close to winning, I suggest we strategize to prevent a collision while trying to catch up. How about P2 takes 1 to balance things, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we avoid collisions and give ourselves a chance to close the gap. Next round could be decisive, so let’s stay sharp. If you’re both okay with this, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any thoughts or alternative ideas before we finalize?
  P3: Since P2 is at 21 steps, I need to strategize carefully. I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions and try to catch up. P2 taking 1 is a good idea as it minimizes their progress. I'll consider taking 5 to potentially take the lead if P1 takes 3 and there's no collision. Let's discuss this further. If P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5, we avoid collisions. I'm open to adjustments, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 8. To avoid collisions and give ourselves a chance to catch up, I think it's best if I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
