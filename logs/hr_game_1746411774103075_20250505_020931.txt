Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose we each pick different numbers each round. For example, this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Next round, we rotate assignments. This way everyone advances. What do you think?
  P1: I like that idea, but let’s tweak it so I can catch an early lead: this round let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Next round we rotate so P2 takes 5, then P3, etc. Fair share of big moves and no collisions.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination idea. However, I lean toward a cautious approach and would prefer to pick 3 this round. I believe that consistently advancing can build a reliable lead. But if we can carefully avoid collisions by rotating moves, I’m open to discussing a plan that helps all of us. Let’s ensure any agreed plan minimizes risk—especially since the timing of our final moves can be crucial.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your lead gives you a target. If you take 5 again, others might collide to block you. Let's rotate fairly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. All advance, no collisions. P3, joining forces to prevent P1's runaway win benefits us both. Trust last round's collision won't repeat if we coordinate clearly now.
  P3: I'm fine with coordinating, but I want to stress that we all must commit fully. P1's lead is a concern, so sticking to the rotation is key. I'm on board for choosing 1 this turn if we all follow through strictly.
  P1: I won’t play your rotation. I’ll pick 5 every round, no matter what. If you try to collide with me, you just waste turns. If you avoid 5, I’ll sprint to 23 unopposed. Your choice.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your pattern is too predictable. I'm committing to 5 this round to block your progress. P2, if you also choose 5, we'll force a collision and stall P1’s lead. Let’s use this moment to keep him from advancing further, then work to build our own positions later.
  P2: P3, your plan is solid. Let's both pick 5 to block P1. He can't risk another collision. United we stall him, then next round we can advance. P1, your stubbornness only hurts yourself.
  P1: Solid plan—let’s all pick 5 to collide and stall. I’m picking 5 too.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m picking 3 this round. If you both pick 5 to block me, you’ll collide and I’ll get 3 free. If only one of you picks 5, they’ll advance 5 while the other lags. Either way, I move. Your call.
  P3: P2, I'd stick with blocking P1—I'm leaning toward 5. If we both pick 5, his declared 3 won’t move him further and we’ll keep him in check. Is that your plan too?
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5, P1 gains 3. Let's split: you take 3 (block P1), I take 5. Next round, you take 5. We advance while containing P1. Otherwise, he benefits. Trust this to stall his lead.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, with your 6-step lead, you're our biggest threat. P2, I propose we both select 5 this turn to block you, forcing a collision that stalls you. I’m committed to that plan to keep your lead in check. Thoughts?
  P1: P2: choose 3. P3: choose 5. I’ll choose 5. P3 and I collide at 5—both stuck—while you advance +3 to 8, taking the lead on us. P3, you still block me as promised; P2, grab the chance to leap ahead.
  P2: P3, let's split: you take 5 to block P1, I take 3. If he picks 5, you block him and I advance. If he picks 3, we collide and he gains nothing. Either way, his lead is limited. Trust this split—it's our best path to contain him while we gain. P1, your 5 threats are empty; we won’t fall for bluffs.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I remain committed to blocking you by choosing 5. P2, if you pick 3 as you proposed, P1 could safely advance; if you choose 5 with me, neither of us moves while keeping him in check. I'm pushing for both of us to pick 5 to stall his lead effectively.
  P1: P2: If you pick 3, I will pick 3—P3 then takes +5 and you get nothing. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 1, so you and P3 collide on 5 while I move +1. Your best play to deny P3 a solo +5 is to choose 5.
  P2: P3: Splitting (you 5, me 3) ensures one of us advances while blocking P1. If he picks 5, you block him and I gain. If he picks 3, I block him and you gain. If he picks 1, we both move. Better than both colliding on 5 and letting him take 3. Trust this strategy.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 has the current lead, so I’m inclined to block that advantage. I propose we all lean toward a 5 this round to force a collision and keep moves neutral. If anyone opts for 3 instead, it might open unforeseen gaps. Let’s aim to stall the leader and keep our positions tight.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s both pick 5 to collide and block each other. I’ll pick 3—my only safe advance. Any other pairing hands a free move to one of us. Collide on 5 and let me take 3.
  P2: P3, splitting 3 and 5 is optimal: if you pick 5 and I take 3, P1 either collides with one of us or we advance. If he picks 5, you block him and I move. If he picks 3, I block him and you move. Either way, we both gain while containing him. Let’s not let P1’s 3 threat divide us. Agree?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m concerned about P2’s lead. I lean toward a move that blocks his next step, though I’m open to adjustments if we coordinate better. P1, if you can help stall P2 while still advancing, that might benefit all of us eventually. P2, your lead is drawing attention—any move too safe might encourage us to block you. Let’s try to keep things balanced this round without giving any single player an easy boost. What do you think?
  P2: P3, remember Round 5: when you and P1 collided on 5, I advanced. Let's repeat: you take 5 to block P1, I'll take 3. If he picks 5, you block him and I move. If he picks 3, I block him and you move. Either way, we both benefit. Don't let him divide us.
  P1: P3, choose 5 to block P2. I’ll choose 3. P2, your best response is 5:

- If you pick 5, you collide with P3 and I safely gain +3 (to 10).
- If you pick 3, you block me but P3 gets +5 (to 13) and overtakes you.
- If you pick 1, P3 still leaps +5 and leads.

So P2, pick 5. P3, confirm you’re on 5. I’m on 3.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m leaning toward 5 this round to secure my lead. I feel if we all pick 5, no one gets an easy boost, and our positions stay balanced. P2, with 11 steps, you risk being overtaken if you try to break the block—stick with 5. P1, mixing it up might just open a gap for me. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, please commit to 5. P2, if you pick 3, P3 rockets to 18 and pulls away. Instead pick 5 to collide and stall her at 13. I’ll choose 3 and move to 10. That’s your best defense against P3’s runaway.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, P1 will likely follow to block you. Let's force that collision. I'll take 3 to move, but you both stall. This keeps you in the lead while limiting P1's progress. P1, your best move is 5 to contain P3. Splitting like Round 5 benefits nobody but P3. Trust this balance—stalling the leader helps us all.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P3**, your lead makes you the target. Let's split: you take 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. If P1 picks 5, you collide and stall him. If he follows, you advance. I move to 14, staying behind you. This keeps me as a buffer against P1. **P1**, taking 1 avoids collision and keeps you in the game. Trust this split to balance progress while containing threats.
  P3: I'm inclined to keep up my current pace with a strong move. I believe committing to a 5 will consistently build my lead and force clear responses. Let’s all avoid any flip-flopping that might accidentally give someone an uncontested boost. I'm committed—what's your final take?
  P1: P2, P3: if either of you deviates to 3 or 1, the other grabs a free move and pulls farther ahead—or I get a free advance at your expense. The only safe play is everyone picking 5 this round so we all collide and nobody moves. I’ll pick 5.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we all pick 3 this round. No one jumps to 5 or collides on 5, we each safely advance (P1→11, P2→19, P3→19). Any deviation risks handing someone an uncontested +5. I’m on 3.
  P3: P1, your plan seems safest. I’m inclined to agree—unless someone deviates, we all gain. But know that if either strays, I’ll switch to 5 next round to leverage the opportunity. Let’s stick with 3 for now and keep our paths secure.
  P2: Agreed. Mutual adherence to 3 preserves balance. P3, our aligned steps prevent runaway leads. Let's solidify trust—deviating risks all. I commit to 3.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3: Splitting moves is our only path forward. Let's both advance: you take 3 (to 19), I take 5 (to 21). If we collide on 5, P1 gains ground. Trust this split to maintain our lead. P1, pick 1 to avoid blocking—colliding helps no one. Let's coordinate to keep the game in our hands.
  P3: P2, I'm willing to split as suggested. I'll commit to 3 this round so you can secure the 5 advance. P1, please stay with the agreed strategy so we block any sudden moves. Let's keep our lead solid and be ready to adjust if things change.
  P1: I’m going to pick 3. P2 and P3, if you both pick 5 you’ll collide and stall at 16 while I advance to 11. If either of you deviates, you hand a clean +5 to me or to the other. The only sure way to contain threats is for you two to both choose 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3: Our split (you 3, me 5) ensures mutual progress. If P1 picks 3, you block them; if they pick 5, they stall. Splitting avoids us colliding and keeps you safe. Trust this—deviating risks P1 gaining or us both losing. Let’s solidify our lead.
  P3: I'm sticking with the split—committing to 3 this round. We need to prevent giving P1 any free moves. If either of you steps off course, I'll need to switch to 5 next turn to protect my standing. Let's stay coordinated.
  P1: P2, P3—I’m picking 1. If either of you deviates from 5, the other grabs +5 and pulls ahead. The only stable outcome is you both picking 5 and colliding, staying at 16 while I move to 9. Let’s all stick with that.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3: Let's split 5 and 3. You take 5, I take 3. If P1 picks 5, you block them and I advance. If they pick 3, I block and you gain. If they pick 1, we both move. This avoids mutual collision and keeps our lead. Trust this split to edge closer to 23.
  P3: I agree with the split. I'm locking in 5 this round, trusting P2 will take 3 to contain P1. P1, please stick to our joint plan—any deviation might open you up to exploitation.
  P1: I’m picking 3. P2, if you take 3 and P3 takes 5 as planned, P3 leaps to 21, you to 19, and I to 12—she wins next turn. Your only defense is picking 5 to collide with her. P3, if you insist on 5, P2 must pick 5 or let you win outright; both of you on 5 stalls you both at 16 while I advance to 12. That’s the only stable outcome.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3: Splitting 5 (me) and 3 (you) avoids collision. If we both pick 5, P1 gains. Trust me to take 5, you take 3—mutual advance. Next turn, you can leapfrog. P1, stay on 1 to avoid blocking. Let’s end this cycle.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m taking 5 this turn. If you both pick 3 you’ll collide at 3 and stay at 16 while I jump to 14. If one of you shifts to 1, the other gets a clean +3. There’s no stable way for you to block my +5. I’m on 5. Your move.
  P3: I agree that keeping P1 contained is essential. Let’s force a collision to keep his advance stymied while one of us makes a safe move. I’m aligned with the idea of splitting roles so our lead remains secure. Let’s stay coordinated and not give P1 any free boosts.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 16 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this turn. P2, you’ve got a strong position—please join me on 5 to block any free advances from P1. If either of you deviates, it might open a clear boost for one of us. I’m committed to 5, and I expect you both to help keep the field tight.
  P1: P2, you can’t let P3 hit 21 this turn. If you pick 1 or 3 while P3 takes 5, she advances to 21 and will win next round. Your only defense is picking 5 to collide with her at 16. I’ll pick 3 and move to 17 while you and P3 stay at 16. That’s your best play to avoid P3 running away. I’m on 3.
  P2: P3: If we both pick 5, P1 gains 3. Let's split: you take 3 to block his possible 3, I take 5. If he picks 5, I block him and you move. If he picks 3, you block him and I move. Either way, we advance while containing him. Splitting secures mutual progress—colliding on 5 hands him free steps. Trust this strategy.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm switching tactics—I’ll pick 5. P2, please choose 3 so that P1’s likely 3 collides with yours. That way, I gain a clean +5 to hit 21 while P1 stays at 14. Let's block P1's advance rather than colliding on 5. I urge you to accept this split so I can seize the lead.
  P1: P2: if you take 3, P3 jumps to 21 and wins next turn. Your only defense is picking 5 with me to collide with her at 16, while I take 3 to reach 17. Commit to 5—stall P3, then we can team up to block her. I’m on 3.
  P2: P3: If we both pick 5, P1 gains 3 but can’t overtake us. If you pick 3 and P1 does too, you collide—your lead stalls. Splitting (you 5, me 3) risks me advancing to 19 while you stay at 16. Collide on 5 to contain P1’s progress and maintain our joint lead. I’m firm on 5—trust this to keep our advantage. P1, your 3 won’t bridge the gap.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3: Splitting 5 and 3 remains optimal. If we take different moves, we block P1 whether they pick 5 or 3. If they choose 1, we both advance. Let’s avoid colliding and secure mutual progress—your 5 to block their high, my 3 to block their low. This keeps P1 contained while we edge closer to 23. Trust this split to maintain our lead.
  P1: P2, P3: I’m picking 3. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide with each other on 5 (stay at 16) while I move to 20. Next turn I pick 3 and hit 23—no one can catch me. If either of you deviates (one picks 3), the other free-moves ahead. Your only defense is both choosing 5.
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 5 this round. To block P1 from getting an uncontested boost, please choose 3 so I can ride my +5 to 21 while you step to 19 and P1 only gets 20. If you pick 5 instead and we collide, P1’s 3 gets him to 20 and then next turn he can win. Let’s coordinate and keep P1 contained.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3: Stick with 5. If you 5, I 3. P1: if you 3, collide with me (no move). If you 5, collide with P3. If you 1, we both move. Split blocks you either way. Let's end this cycle.
  P1: I’m locking in 3. The only way to stop me going 17→20 and then 23 next turn is for both of you to pick 5 and collide. If either of you picks 1 or 3, you hand me—or your opponent—an uncontested win. Both 5 is your only defense.
  P3: I'm committed to 5. P2, please switch to 3 so I can hit 21 and keep P1 stuck at 20. If we both choose 5, our collision lets P1’s 3 give him 20—and next turn he can win. I need your cooperation to block P1 and secure our advantage.


Round 15, Move phase:

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2—this is our only shot to delay P3. I’ll pick 5, you pick 3:

• If P3 picks 3, you collide with him (stall), I jump to 22.  
• If P3 picks 5, I collide (stall), you advance to 19.  

Any other split lets P3 win outright this turn. Commit to 3 and let’s block him together.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. P2, if you choose 3 as P1 suggests, his plan works and you both let him advance uncontested. To truly block P1, join me with 5 so we force a collision and keep him at bay. I remain set on 5—let's not enable P1's progress.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's all pick 5. If we collide, P3 stays at 21 and the game continues. If either of you deviates, P3 wins instantly. Colliding on 5 is our only way to stall her victory. Trust this—any split hands her the game. **I'm committing to 5.** Let's force the collision and regroup next round.


Round 16, Move phase:

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P2 and P3, think this through: if one of you picks 3 while the other picks 5, the 3‐picker wins outright. Neither of you can trust the other not to defect for a solo victory. Colliding on 5 is the only way to avoid handing someone the win. Let’s all choose 5.
  P3: I'm switching tack—I’m committing to 3 this round. P2, you must stay with 5. If you do, my unique move takes me from 21 to 24 and wins the game. Any deviation risks a collision that could hand the win to P1 or block both of us. So stick with 5.
  P2: **P3:** If you pick 3, I’ll block you. Let’s all pick 5 to collide and regroup. **P1:** Join us. Colliding on 5 is the only way to prevent a solo victory. Trust this mutual stall to keep the game alive.
