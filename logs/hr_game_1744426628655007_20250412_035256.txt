Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's get started! It feels like everyone will want to jump ahead with 5 right away. Might be a bit crowded there. Good luck to you both.
  P3: P2, good point on avoiding a 5 pile-up. Maybe we should start with smaller moves to space things out. P1, what's your take? Let's discuss before committing.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree that rushing to 5 might lead to a collision. How about we each pick a different number to start safely? I’m leaning towards a smaller move to avoid early clashes. Maybe we can loosely coordinate—P2 takes one number, P3 another, and I’ll take the last. What do you both think about this approach for the first round? Let’s hear your preferences.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, that coordination idea makes sense for the first round to get things moving. I'm open to taking 3. What about you, P3? Does 1 or 5 appeal more to you?
  P3: P2, I'm drawn to 5 for an early advantage, but coordination makes sense to avoid collisions. How about you take 3 as suggested, I take 5, and P1 takes 1? That way, we all advance safely. P1, what do you think? Let's confirm before moving on.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm good with the plan—P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll go with 1. This way, we all move forward without any collisions in the first round. Let’s stick to this for now and reassess next turn based on positions. Does this sound final to everyone? If so, I’m ready to move on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds like a plan. I'm good with taking 3 for this round. Let's do it.
  P3: Agreed, let's stick to the plan: P2 moves 3, I move 5, P1 moves 1. This should give us a safe start. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, it seems we’re all aligned on the plan: P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5, and I move 1. I’m glad we’ve reached this agreement for a safe start. Unless there’s any last-minute concern or change of mind, I think we’re set for this round. I’m ready to proceed with the move phase. If you both are good, let’s wrap up the conversation here.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 1 worked out smoothly. P3, you've got a nice early lead at 5 steps. Continuing the same P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 pattern seems to benefit you the most right now. Perhaps we should consider a different approach this round to keep things competitive? What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P2 that sticking to the same pattern might give P3 too much of an advantage. To keep things balanced, maybe we should switch up our moves this round. I’m open to taking a different number to shake things up. P2, since you brought this up, do you have a specific mix in mind? P3, are you willing to adjust to keep the competition fair? Let’s discuss a new plan to ensure no one pulls too far ahead too soon. I’m ready to hear your ideas.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I get your point about balancing things out—my lead could grow too fast. I'm willing to adjust for fairness. How about this round: I take 3, you take 5 P1 to boost your score, and P2 takes 1? That'd put us at P1:6, P2:4, me:8—still competitive. What do you think? Let's refine if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, thanks for the suggestion, but taking 1 step while you take 3 and P1 takes 5 leaves me quite far behind (P1:6, P2:4, P3:8). That doesn't seem balanced from my perspective. How about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1 this round? That would put us at P1:4, P2:8, P3:6. This spreads the scores a bit more evenly while still adjusting from last round. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestions to balance things out. P2, your idea of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 sounds fairer as it keeps our scores closer (P1:4, P2:8, P3:6). I’m okay with taking 3 this round to support this plan. P3, are you willing to take 1 to keep the competition tight? Let’s finalize this to avoid any collisions and ensure we all stay in the race. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm not keen on taking just 1 as it slows me down too much. How about we all choose 3 this round for safety and balance? Scores would then be P1:4, P2:6, P3:8—still competitive with no collisions. What do you both think? Let's keep coordinating smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, suggesting we all take 3 guarantees a collision where nobody moves. That maintains your lead but doesn't help balance the scores. My suggestion (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) avoids collision and leads to P1:4, P2:8, P3:6, which is more balanced. P1 already agreed to take 3. P3, taking 1 this round seems fair after your large jump last round. Can we agree on that?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still think P2’s plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) is the fairest way to balance our scores without risking a collision. P3, I understand not wanting to slow down, but taking 1 this round keeps you in a strong position while letting others catch up a bit. Let’s stick with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for scores of P1:4, P2:8, P3:6. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to move forward. What do you both say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see your points about balance, so I'll agree to take 1 this round to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Plan is P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, leading to P1:4, P2:8, P3:6. Good coordination so far—let's reassess next time. I'm ready to move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps things reasonably balanced for now. I'm ready to proceed with this agreement.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, it looks like we’re all aligned on the plan for this round: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, resulting in scores of P1:4, P2:8, P3:6. I’m glad we’ve reached this agreement to keep the competition balanced. Unless there’s any last-minute concern or change, I think we’re set to proceed to the move phase. I’m ready to wrap up the conversation here.
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 this round as planned to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. Good coordination so far—let's see how the scores shake out and discuss adjustments next time.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, we're at P1:4, P2:8, P3:6. I'm leading, P1 is behind. To keep things moving and somewhat balanced, perhaps P1 should take the 5 this round to catch up? Maybe P1=5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? That would put us at P1:9, P2:11, P3:7. It keeps the scores relatively close while allowing the player furthest behind to make progress. What do you both think of this arrangement for Round 3?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the suggestion, P2. I’m okay with taking 5 this round to catch up, as it keeps the scores close with P1:9, P2:11, P3:7. P3, are you fine with taking 1 to maintain balance? I think this plan works well to keep the competition tight and avoid collisions. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to proceed with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Let me know your thoughts, and if there’s no objection, we can move forward.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the balance focus, but I'm still behind P2 and want to close the gap. How about we switch it up: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1? That would make scores P1:7, P2:9, P3:11—keeping us competitive without collisions. What do you both think? Let's refine if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposal puts you significantly ahead (11) while only giving me 1 step, which doesn't seem fair after our previous coordination. My suggestion (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) leads to P1:9, P2:11, P3:7. This keeps the scores much closer and allows P1, who is furthest behind, to catch up significantly. P1 already agreed to take 5. Let's stick with that plan for better balance this round. What do you say, P1?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still support P2’s plan of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for scores of P1:9, P2:11, P3:7. It’s the fairest way to help me catch up while keeping us all close. P3, I get wanting to close the gap, but your proposal puts you too far ahead. Let’s stick with P2’s suggestion for balance this round. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the push for balance, so I'll reluctantly agree to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 this round, leading to P1:9, P2:11, P3:7. It keeps things close, but I'm concerned about falling further behind if this continues. Let's reassess next turn for fairer rotation. I'm ready to move on if you both are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, the plan is P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This keeps the scores close (P1:9, P2:11, P3:7) and avoids collisions. Thanks for coordinating, especially P3 for agreeing despite reservations. Let's proceed with this for Round 3. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve agreed on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round, resulting in P1:9, P2:11, P3:7. It’s a solid plan to keep the game balanced and competitive. P3, I appreciate you agreeing despite your concerns, and I’m open to reassessing next turn to ensure everyone gets a fair shot. If there are no last-minute objections or changes, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let’s wrap up the conversation here if we’re all set.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'll honor the agreement to take 1 this round to keep things balanced, but I'm concerned about staying behind long-term. Let's plan for me to take a larger move next round to catch up fairly. Good coordination so far—I'm ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with scores at P1:9, P2:11, P3:7, I'm still behind and need to catch up as discussed. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round, tying us all at 12 for fair competition and no collisions. This keeps the game balanced—thoughts? Let's refine if needed.
  P2: P3, that proposal certainly creates balance by tying us all at 12. It gives you the 5 steps you were looking for after taking 1 last round. However, it means I only take 1 step despite being the current leader.

How about a slight variation that still gives you 5 steps: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5?
This would result in scores P1:10, P2:14, P3:12.
You still get your big jump, I maintain a small lead, and P1 still advances. This seems like a reasonable way to balance things while acknowledging current positions. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see merit in both proposals. P3’s idea of tying us at 12 with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is perfectly balanced, but P2’s counter of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 (scores P1:10, P2:14, P3:12) respects current positions while letting P3 catch up. I lean towards P2’s plan as it avoids a complete tie and keeps some competitive edge. P3, are you okay with this? I’m fine with taking 1 to support it. Let’s finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I’m ready to proceed if we agree.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the effort to coordinate, but P2's plan still favors you with a growing lead. How about a compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1 to tie us closer at P1:12, P2:12, P3:12? It ensures balance and no collisions. If not, I'll reluctantly stick with P2's suggestion for now. Let's finalize soon.
  P2: P3, your suggestion to tie us all at 12 means I take only 1 step, erasing the lead I earned through coordination. My proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) gives you the 5 steps you need, keeps me slightly ahead (14 vs 12), and P1 already agreed to take 1. This seems like the fairest way to balance catching up with current positions. Let's lock in P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. Are you okay with that?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still think P2’s plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) strikes a good balance, giving P3 a chance to catch up while respecting current standings with scores at P1:10, P2:14, P3:12. P3, I get wanting a tie, but this keeps the game competitive. I’m committed to taking 1 to support this. Can we agree on this to avoid collisions and move forward? If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'll stick with the agreed plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5, leading to P1:10, P2:14, P3:12. It keeps things balanced for now, but I want to discuss a fairer rotation next round to ensure I don't fall too far behind. Good coordination so far—I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all set on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round. P3, I understand your concern about future rounds, and we can definitely discuss rotation next time. For now, let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round, leading to P1:10, P2:14, P3:12. It’s a fair compromise that helps P3 catch up while maintaining some competitive spread. P3, I’m open to discussing a rotation next round to ensure everyone gets a shot at bigger moves. If there are no further concerns, I think we’re ready for the move phase. Let’s wrap up here and proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with scores at P1:10, P2:14, P3:12, I’m still behind and could use a boost. I propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round, leading to P1:15, P2:15, P3:15—a perfect tie. This ensures balance and no collisions while giving me a chance to catch up. I think it’s fair after taking smaller steps recently. What do you both think? Let’s agree on a plan quickly to keep the game competitive. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1, your proposal to tie us all at 15 is interesting for balance, especially since it gives you the 5 steps you need. However, as the current leader, taking only 1 step feels like a significant setback and erases the progress made.

How about this alternative: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1?
This results in scores P1:15, P2:17, P3:13.
You still get your 5 steps to catch up significantly, I maintain a small lead with 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 but stays close. This seems like a fairer distribution that respects current positions while still allowing movement. What do you both think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm leaning towards P1's proposal to tie at 15 with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—it keeps things balanced and gives me a fair catch-up after smaller moves. P2, your plan leaves me further behind, which isn't sustainable. Let's go with the tie for equity and no collisions. What do you both think? I'm open to quick refinements.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate both perspectives. P2, your plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) keeps me catching up, which I value, but P3 has a point about falling behind. I still prefer my original proposal of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for a tie at 15—it ensures complete balance and fairness after recent smaller moves for both P3 and me. Let’s go with the tie to keep the competition even and avoid collisions. Can we agree on this? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the appeal of a perfect tie at 15. However, my proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) still gives P1 the big jump they need (to 15), keeps me slightly ahead (at 17), and P3 (at 13) remains very close behind P1. A tie completely erases existing positions. This alternative keeps the game dynamic while significantly helping P1. P3, being at 13 is still well within striking distance. Let's consider P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 one more time for a balanced outcome that respects the current game state.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my support for tying at 15 via P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—it's the fairest way to balance scores after my smaller moves and prevents P2 from widening the gap. P2, your proposal leaves me too far behind, which isn't sustainable for fair competition. Let's go with the tie to avoid collisions and keep things even. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still believe tying at 15 with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 is the best way to ensure fairness. It gives me the boost I need and keeps P3 competitive, while avoiding collisions. P2, I get your concern about losing the lead, but a tie resets us equally for the final stretch. Let’s agree on this for true balance. If we’re all set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. What do you both say?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, you both seem strongly in favor of the tie at 15 (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). While I still believe my proposal was fair in respecting current positions, I value coordination and avoiding collisions. I will reluctantly agree to take 1 step this round to facilitate the tie. Let's proceed with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, putting us all at 15. This makes the next round critical.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm glad we've reached consensus on tying at 15 with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—it's fair and avoids collisions. Thanks for the coordination, P2. As we approach the endgame, I'll push for a balanced rotation next round to ensure no one gets left behind. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, we're all tied at 15. This is a crucial round. Playing 5 is tempting for everyone, which makes it very risky for collisions. To avoid that and ensure we all advance, how about we try this coordination: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5?

This would put the scores at P1:16, P2:18, P3:20. It avoids collision and sets up an interesting final stretch. What do you both think of this plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since we’re tied at 15, this round is critical. P2, your plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) avoids collisions and sets up a close race at P1:16, P2:18, P3:20. I’m okay with taking 1 to support this coordination. P3, are you fine with taking 5 to push ahead? Let’s stick to this to keep the game balanced and competitive. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, P2's plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) makes sense for avoiding collisions and advancing safely, with scores at P1:16, P2:18, P3:20. I'm okay with taking 5 to build on our tie, but as we near 23, let's discuss a fair strategy next round to prevent anyone dominating. Good coordination so far—I'm ready to proceed if we're all set.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we're all agreed on the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This puts the scores at P1:16, P2:18, P3:20. As P3 noted, we'll need to be strategic next round as we get close to 23. For now, let's lock this in to avoid any collisions this round. I'm ready to move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan for P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, resulting in P1:16, P2:18, P3:20. It’s a solid way to avoid collisions and keep the game close as we approach the end. P3, I agree we need a fair strategy next round with 23 in sight. Let’s stick to this for now and reassess after. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Agreed, let's stick with the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 to avoid collisions and advance safely. With the endgame approaching, I suggest we discuss a rotated strategy for Round 7 to keep things balanced and competitive. I'm ready to proceed if you both are.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with scores at P1:16, P2:18, P3:20, I'm close to 23 and want to keep coordination fair. How about P1 takes 5 to catch up, I take 1 to stay safe, and P2 takes 3? That ties us at 21 and avoids collisions. It sets up an even endgame. Thoughts on this rotation? I'm ready to refine if needed.
  P2: P3, your proposal to tie us all at 21 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) is certainly one way to keep things balanced for a final showdown. It requires a lot of trust, though. If P1 and I stick to the plan (5 and 3), you could simply play 3 instead of 1 and reach 23 to win.

Given you're in the lead, taking just 1 step seems unusual. Are you firmly committing to playing 1 for the sake of this coordination? It's a critical move, so clarity is important.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate P3’s proposal to tie us at 21 with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. It’s a fair way to set up an even endgame. P3, I’m willing to trust the plan if you confirm you’ll stick to 1. P2, I understand the concern about trust at this critical stage. Let’s commit to this rotation to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. If we’re all in, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about trust, but I'm fully committed to playing 1 this round to keep our coordination intact and tie us at 21 for a fair endgame. It's in all our interests to avoid collisions now. P2, if you're still hesitant, let's confirm we're all on board with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. I'm ready to proceed if we can move forward.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the commitment to 1, but the temptation to play 3 and win outright is significant. A tie at 21 just delays the inevitable confrontation, possibly under worse conditions for P1 or me.

How about this alternative to remove that temptation and ensure a clear outcome this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1?
This leads to P1:19, P2:23, P3:21.
It avoids collisions, still gives you the 1 step you proposed, prevents the "P3 plays 3 and wins" scenario, and concludes the game. P1, this gives you fewer steps, but guarantees P3 doesn't win by defecting. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the merit in P2’s alternative (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to end the game at P1:19, P2:23, P3:21. It avoids collisions and removes the risk of P3 defecting to win. However, I’d prefer P3’s original plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to tie at 21 for a fair final round. P3, I trust your commitment to 1. Let’s stick to the tie if we all confirm. If not, I’m open to P2’s plan. Thoughts? I’m ready to proceed once we agree.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the concerns, but I'm fully committed to the original plan of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to tie us at 21 and keep things fair. I've stuck to our agreements so far, and this ensures a balanced endgame without collisions. P2, let's trust each other here—I'm ready to proceed if we're all set.
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear you, but P3 asking us to trust them to play 1 when they are at 20 and playing 3 wins them the game is very risky. If P3 defects on their own plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1), they win instantly.

My proposed plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) leads to P1:19, P2:23, P3:21. Yes, I win if everyone cooperates. However, if P3 defects and plays 3 (instead of 1), we tie for the win (P2:23, P3:23). P3 cannot win alone easily by defecting. This seems safer than risking an immediate P3 win if they betray the tie plan. Let's finalize on P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand the trust issues with P3’s plan to tie at 21. P2, your plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) does reduce the risk of P3 winning by defecting, and I’m willing to go with it to ensure a safer outcome. It ends the game at P1:19, P2:23, P3:21 if we all stick to it. P3, can you confirm you’ll play 1? Let’s finalize this to avoid collisions. I’m ready to proceed with P2’s plan if we’re all agreed. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the concerns, but I'm fully committed to playing 1 as per P2's plan to maintain our coordination and avoid collisions. It ensures a safer outcome for all. P2, thanks for the alternative—let's stick with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 and reassess if needed later. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Alright, sounds like we're all confirmed on the plan: P1 plays 3, I play 5, and P3 plays 1. This gets us to P1:19, P2:23, P3:21. Thanks for the coordination, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round, leading to P1:19, P2:23, P3:21. It minimizes risk and ensures a clear outcome while avoiding collisions. P3, thanks for confirming you’ll stick to 1. I think this is the safest way to wrap up. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to move to the move phase. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision set us back with no progress. With scores at P1:16, P2:18, P3:20, we’re all close to 23, so this round is critical. I suggest P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to reach P1:21, P2:21, P3:21—a tie to set up a fair final push. It avoids collisions and keeps us even. P3, I know you’re in the lead, but let’s coordinate for balance. What do you both think? I’m ready to proceed if we agree.
  P2: P1, your plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) is the same risky idea from last round that led to a total collision when trust broke down. P3 is at 20; asking them to play 1 when 3 wins the game is unrealistic, as we saw.

Let's try something that accepts the endgame reality. How about P1:1, P2:5, P3:3?
This leads to P1:17, P2:23, P3:23.
This avoids collision, P3 gets the 3 steps needed to cross 23, and I get the 5 steps needed. We would share the win. P1 avoids collision and still advances. This seems like a more stable outcome given the situation. What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues from last round, but P2's plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) seems practical to avoid collisions and share the win fairly at P1:17, P2:23, P3:23. I'm committed to this for now, as it respects our coordination history. Let's finalize and move forward to keep the game smooth.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the appeal in P2’s plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) to share the win at P2:23, P3:23, and avoid collisions. I’m willing to take 1 to support this outcome, as it ensures progress for two players. P3, I trust you’ll stick to 3 as agreed. Let’s finalize this to end the game smoothly. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, the plan is P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This leads to P1:17, P2:23, P3:23.
P1 and P3, you've both agreed. This seems like the most stable way to conclude without risking another collision like last round. A shared win for P3 and me is a reasonable outcome. P3, playing 5 is tempting, but risks collision if I also play 5, potentially resetting everything. Let's stick to the agreed 1, 5, 3. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm still fully committed to our agreed plan of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 to share the win and avoid collisions, as it respects our coordination. However, with the endgame close, I'm tempted to play higher for a solo win—can we all double-confirm to build trust? If not, I'll stick to 3. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for a shared win at P2:23, P3:23, and P1:17. P3, I understand the temptation for a solo win, but a collision risks another setback. I double-confirm I’ll stick to 1 to ensure progress and avoid conflict. Can we all reaffirm this plan for trust? If we’re set, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Let’s finalize this to end the game smoothly. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1 has confirmed 1. P3, I understand the temptation, but remember last round's collision when we deviated. I am sticking to playing 5 as agreed in the P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 plan. If you also play 5, we collide, nobody wins this round, and P1 potentially benefits from our conflict. A shared win at 23 is a secure outcome for both of us. Let's lock this in and finish the game smoothly. I'm ready.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, thanks for the double-confirmation—I'm fully committed to the agreed plan of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 to share the win and avoid another collision. I value our coordination and will stick to it. Let's proceed smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for a shared win at P2:23, P3:23, and P1:17. I’m fully committed to playing 1 to ensure a smooth end without collisions. P3, thanks for reaffirming your commitment to 3. P2, I trust you’ll stick to 5. Let’s wrap this up with no surprises. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase if we’re all set.
  P2: Okay, everyone has confirmed the plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) and their commitment. I'm also sticking to playing 5 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase and finish the game.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking to our agreed plan of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 to avoid collisions and share the win fairly. I value the trust we've built, and I'm ready to proceed without changes. Let's wrap this up smoothly.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 9. Scores P1:16, P2:18, P3:20. After the last two rounds ending in 3-way collisions on 5, I think we can agree coordination attempts are probably useless now. Everyone knows what they need to win or get close. P3, you're in a strong position. Good luck to everyone.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with scores at P1:16, P2:18, P3:20, we’re all so close to 23, but collisions keep setting us back. I know trust is shaky after recent rounds, but let’s try one last coordination: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to tie at 21. It’s a long shot, but it avoids collisions and sets a fair final round. If we can’t agree, I understand it’s every player for themselves. What do you think? I’m ready to proceed if we align or if we’re past coordination.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate your effort to coordinate, P1. Despite the trust issues, I'm willing to commit to your plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to tie us at 21 and avoid another collision. It promotes fairness for the final push. P2, are you on board? Let's confirm and proceed smoothly if we're aligned.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I have to be honest, this feels like deja vu from Round 7. P3, you're at 20. Agreeing to play 1 when playing 3 likely wins you the game (if P1 plays 5 and I play 3 as planned) seems extremely unlikely, especially after the last two rounds.

Why would we trust this exact same plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) that failed spectacularly before? I can't commit to playing 3 based on P3 taking 1, it's just too risky. Given the situation, playing 5 seems like the only move that gives me a chance to win.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I get the trust issues after repeated collisions. P2, I understand your skepticism about P3 sticking to 1. Let’s consider a safer alternative: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, leading to P1:19, P2:23, P3:21. It gives P2 a win if we stick to it, reduces P3’s temptation to defect, and avoids collisions. P3, can you commit to 1? If not, I’m prepared for everyone to play 5 again. Let’s finalize something or accept it’s every player for themselves. I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues, but I'll commit to your alternative plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to avoid collisions and ensure a fair outcome. I value our coordination history and am ready to proceed if we're all set. Let's wrap this up smoothly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, you say you'll commit to 1 even though playing 3 likely gives you at least a shared win (if P1 plays 3 and I play 5). It's hard to trust this after the last two rounds ended in collisions. However, if P1 is genuinely sticking to 3 and you are genuinely sticking to 1, then I will stick to 5 as per the plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). Let's hope this coordination attempt doesn't end like the others. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the willingness to try coordination one more time with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, leading to P1:19, P2:23, P3:21. P3, thanks for committing to 1—I’m sticking to 3 to honor this plan. P2, I trust you’ll play 5 to secure the win. Let’s avoid another collision and end this smoothly. If we’re all locked in, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Final thoughts?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the effort to coordinate, but given the repeated breakdowns, I'm tempted to go for a higher move to secure my position. Still, I'll honor the plan and play 1 to avoid another collision if you both commit. Let's confirm and proceed smoothly—ready to wrap up.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, the plan is P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. P1, you've confirmed 3. P3, you've committed to 1, despite the temptation. I will stick to my side of the agreement and play 5. This gives me the win if the plan holds. We all know the risks after the last two rounds, but another collision helps no one. Let's trust the plan this time. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to 3 as agreed in our plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). P3, I trust you’ll play 1 despite the temptation, and P2, I believe you’ll take 5 to secure the win. Let’s make this the round we avoid a collision and end the game smoothly. If we all honor this, we’re set for a fair outcome. I’m ready for the move phase if there are no last concerns.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing effort to coordinate, but given the history of breakdowns, I'm fully committed to the agreed plan of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to avoid another collision and ensure progress. Let's trust each other this round and end smoothly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with scores at P1:16, P2:18, P3:20, and after multiple collisions, I know trust is low. Let’s make one final attempt at coordination: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, leading to P1:21, P2:19, P3:23. This gives P3 the win, avoids collisions, and ends the game. P3, as the leader, this respects your position. P2, I hope you’re okay with 1 to ensure progress. If we can’t agree, it’s likely another collision. Thoughts? I’m ready to proceed if we align.
  P2: P1, your plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) asks me to take 1 step when I'm at 18, effectively handing the win to P3. That doesn't align with my goal of winning.

Furthermore, P3 is at 20. Why would they stick to 3 when playing 5 guarantees a solo win (25 steps) if we follow your plan?

Given the last three rounds were identical 5-5-5 collisions, trust is zero. Proposing complex coordination seems futile. I suspect everyone is just going to play 5 again to maximize their own chances.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate your coordination efforts, P1. To build trust and avoid another collision, I'm fully committed to your plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, leading to a fair end. P2, despite past issues, let's stick to this for a smooth finish. I'm ready to proceed if we're aligned.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I hear the skepticism, P2, and I get that trust is at an all-time low after repeated collisions. P3, thanks for committing to 3 in the plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). I’m sticking to 5 to push for progress. P2, I know taking 1 is tough, but it’s the only way to avoid another likely 5-5-5 collision. Let’s end this game with a clear outcome. Can we lock this in? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the attempt to coordinate, but asking me to play 1 when I'm at 18 is asking me to guarantee my own loss. P3, you're at 20; playing 3 gets you to 23, but playing 5 gets you to 25. Given the last three rounds ended in 5-5-5 collisions, I cannot trust anyone is playing anything other than 5.

I will be playing 5 this round. It's the only move that gives me a chance to win. Expecting anything else after the repeated collisions is unrealistic.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the frustration with repeated collisions, but I'm committed to playing 3 as per my earlier agreement to promote fairness and avoid another stalemate. P2, since you're set on 5, let's hope this works out. P1, thoughts on adjusting? I'm ready to proceed if we're aligned.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I get the trust issues after repeated collisions. P3, I appreciate your commitment to 3. P2, I understand playing 5 is tempting, but another collision helps no one. Let’s stick to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to end this with P3 at 23. I’m committed to 5. P2, can you reconsider 1 for a clear outcome? If not, I fear we’re headed for another stalemate. I’m ready to proceed if we can align, or if it’s every player for themselves. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, I've already explained why I cannot agree to play 1. It guarantees I lose. P3, your commitment to 3 is hard to believe when you're at 20 and 5 gets you to 25. After three identical rounds of 5-5-5 collisions, talk is cheap. I have to assume everyone will play to maximize their own score, which means playing 5. I will be playing 5 again.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the distrust after all the collisions, but I'm still committed to playing 3 as per our discussion to avoid another stalemate and ensure some progress. P2, if you're set on 5, we might end up tying or colliding again. P1, confirm your move? Let's try to coordinate one last time. Good luck.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still pushing for P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to end this with P3 at 23 and avoid another collision. P3, I trust your commitment to 3. P2, I know 1 is a tough ask, but another 5-5-5 stalemate wastes everyone’s chance. I’m sticking to 5 as agreed. Let’s make this the round we break the cycle. If we can’t align, I fear we’re stuck. I’m ready for the move phase if we’re set or if it’s every player for themselves. Final thoughts?
  P2: I've stated my position and reasoning. P1 is asking me to sacrifice my chance to win for P3. P3 is making unbelievable promises after three rounds of everyone playing 5. Talk is clearly not working. I am playing 5. Let's just get to the move phase.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I get the frustration with repeated collisions, but I'm still committed to playing 3 as per our discussion to break the stalemate and allow progress—perhaps even a shared win. P2, reconsidering 1 could avoid another tie-up. P1, confirm your move? Let's end this smoothly.
