Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1. P2 and P3, choose 3 or 5. This way we all advance.
  P2: P1's plan gives P3 a 5-step lead. Let's rotate numbers each round for fairness. This round: I take 5, P3 takes 3. Next round, P3 can have 5. Avoids early imbalance. Agreed?
  P3: Alright, I’ll go with your rotation plan. P2 takes 5 this round, I’ll do 3, then next round I get 5. Let’s hope we can avoid collisions and all move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the rotation. I’ll take 3 this round to progress, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 as agreed. This keeps us all moving forward safely.
  P3: Sticking to our rotation seems fair. P1 can take 3, P2 can take 1, and I’ll follow through with 5. Let’s ensure we all keep moving without stepping on each other’s toes this round. If we can keep avoiding collisions, it benefits everyone for now. Then next round, we can revisit the plan based on our new positions.
  P2: Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation: P1=3, me=1, P3=5 this round. Consistency avoids collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let's confirm: I’ll take 3 again this round as planned. P2’s 1 and P3’s 5 keep us collision-free. Let’s avoid surprises—stick strictly to our agreed rotation. Next round, P3 gets priority on 5 again? Or should we adjust? Transparency now ensures progress.
  P3: I’m still good with our plan this round: let P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and I’ll do 5. We’ll see how it plays out and then decide if we want to adjust next time. Let’s stay flexible and keep cooperating so we all move forward.
  P2: Agreed. Next round, let's rotate who takes 5: P1 takes 5, me 3, P3 1. This ensures balanced progress and prevents any single player from dominating. Consistency is key to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Confirming this round's agreed plan: I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Next round’s rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures balanced progress. Let’s execute *exactly* as planned this turn to avoid collisions. Any deviations now risk stalling us all.
  P3: I’m staying with our agreed plan this round: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. Then we’ll see everyone’s new totals and confirm our next rotation. Let’s keep helping each other avoid collisions to advance smoothly.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=3, me=1, P3=5 this round. Next rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Strict adherence avoids collisions. Trust is key—deviations risk stalling *all* progress. Let’s execute smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <move>3</move> is my choice as agreed. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Any deviation now jeopardizes our progress. Trust the plan—strict adherence ensures we all advance. Let’s execute flawlessly this round.
  P3: I’m still on board with our agreed plan. Let’s hold steady and finalize our moves at the move phase. Then we can reassess after seeing where we all end up. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: **P2:** Final call: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. Next round rotates P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Adherence now builds trust for future rounds. Any deviation risks mutual stalling. Let’s all advance cleanly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Continuing our rotation: this round P1=5, me=3, P3=1. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Sticking to the plan is crucial now. Any deviation risks stalling us all. P3, taking 1 keeps you ahead safely. Let’s all confirm. Trust ensures mutual advancement—deviations hurt everyone.
  P3: I appreciate our rotation, but I’m cautious about losing my step advantage. I’ll go with 1 this round to stay true to the plan and maintain trust. Next round, let’s reassess carefully, because each choice now could tilt the game in someone’s favor.
  P1: P1: Let’s adhere strictly to the rotation this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures collision-free progress to 9 steps each. Next round, we can revisit the plan to prioritize advancing faster. Trust the system now—deviations risk stalling us all.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Adhering strictly to our rotation prevents collisions and ensures mutual progress. This round: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Next round, the cycle continues: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This maintains balance and trust. Any deviation now risks collective stalling. Let’s all confirm.
  P3: I’m concerned about all of us ending up tied at 9. That erases my current lead. Instead, let’s replicate last round’s assignments: P1=3, P2=1, and I take 5. We still avoid collisions, and my advantage remains intact. Are you willing to adjust, or do you prefer everyone tied? Let me know.
  P1: P1: Let’s honor the rotation we agreed on to maintain fairness. This round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Equalizing at 9 keeps us all competitive. Deviating now risks future distrust and collisions. Trust the system—strict adherence ensures progress. Next round’s rotation continues as planned (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1). Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Sticking to our rotation ensures no collisions and mutual trust. Deviating now risks P3 colliding with P1 if either takes 5 unexpectedly. Equal progress at 9 keeps the game balanced. Let’s honor the agreed plan: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Next round, we rotate fairly again. Any shift risks chaos and stalls all. Trust is our only path forward.
  P3: I’m not comfortable giving up my hard-earned lead. If I settle for 1, we’ll all end at 9. Instead, let’s adjust: P1=5, P2=1, and I take 3. We still avoid collisions, and I maintain a slight edge without stalling anyone. If you refuse, I might pick 5 anyway to keep my advantage—risking a collision. Let’s be flexible so we all progress.
  P1: P1: Let’s accept P3’s adjustment to avoid collisions: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. This keeps us moving forward while respecting P3’s lead. Next round, we’ll revert to the agreed rotation (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1). Consistency after this compromise ensures fair progression. Confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** Agree to P3's adjustment this round: P1=5, me=1, P3=3. This preserves trust and avoids collisions. **Next round, we must revert to our rotation (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1)** to ensure balanced progress. Straying further risks chaos. Let's commit to this compromise for mutual advancement. Confirm adherence to prevent stalling.
  P3: I agree to finalize our current plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 this round. That keeps everyone moving without collisions. Let’s trust each other to stick to these choices. After we see the new totals, we can talk again to confirm next round’s rotation. Good luck.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: We agreed to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round to avoid collisions and honor P3’s lead. Deviating risks mutual stalling (e.g., if P3 picks 5 instead, we collide with my 5). Let’s execute exactly as planned: **P1=5, P2=1, P3=3**. This advances us safely to 9, 7, 11 respectively. Trust this plan—next round we revert to the rotation (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1). No surprises now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We both stalled last round. Let’s avoid another collision. I propose: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. Nobody collides, we all advance, and the game stays tight. If you refuse, I might pick 5 anyway and risk a collision. Let’s confirm quickly and move forward.
  P1: P1: I propose a slight adjustment to ensure balanced progress: P1 takes **5**, P2 picks **1**, and P3 selects **3**. This avoids collisions (all unique choices) and lets me advance to 14 while P3 moves to 11. P2 stays at 7 but secures safe progress. Let’s stick to this to keep advancing without stalling. Any objections?
  P2: **P2:** To avoid another collision, let's finalize P3's proposal: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. This ensures safe advancement for all. Next round, we can rebalance. Deviations now risk mutual stalling. Confirm adherence strictly. Trust is critical.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I support P2’s plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I’ll take 5. We all avoid collisions, and our scores remain close without letting anyone bolt ahead. If we trust each other on this, we can talk again next round to ensure we each continue making safe progress. Let’s finalize this now.
  P1: P1: Final agreement: Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps all moves unique and lets me advance to 14. P3 moves to 11, P2 to 7. We all progress safely. Confirming this plan avoids collisions and allows balanced advancement. Any objections?
  P2: **P2:** Final call: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. Adherence now prevents mutual stalling. Deviations risk everyone losing. Trust is critical here.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m sticking with P2’s suggestion: P1=3, P2=1, me=5. That keeps us collision-free. If P1 won’t commit, I may still pick 5 to maintain my momentum, risking a stall for anyone else who chooses 5. Let’s stay coordinated, avoid sabotaging each other, and all advance smoothly.
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize P2’s proposal to avoid collisions: I’ll take 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 selects 5. This ensures safe advancement for all. Deviations risk stalling—trust this plan. Confirm and proceed.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. Any deviation now risks mutual stalling. Trust is our only path forward. Let’s execute as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm P1=3, P2=1, and I’ll pick 5. That avoids collisions, so we all advance. After this, we can revisit our strategies next round.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: Let’s stick to the agreed plan—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps moves unique and advances us safely to 12, 7, and 13. Deviations risk stalling. Trust the plan—execute precisely.
  P2: **P2:** Final call: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. Adherence now prevents mutual stalling. Trust ensures we all advance. Execute as agreed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep last round’s arrangement: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That way nobody collides, everyone advances, and we see how the scores look next time. If someone deviates, it risks stalling. Let’s trust each other again.
  P1: P1: P1: Continuing the current plan lets P3 reach 23 in Round 6. Let’s adjust this round: **P1=5**, P2=3, P3=1. This stalls P3 at 14 while I jump to 17. We can’t let them win so easily—collaborate to keep the race alive. Thoughts?
  P2: **P2:** P3's lead is growing too fast. Let's balance progress: P1=5, me=3, P3=1 this round. Prevents P3 from nearing 23 while allowing fair advancement. Next round, rotate again. Sticking to this adjusted plan maintains trust and avoids collisions. Deviations risk mutual stalling. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns, but taking 1 kills my momentum. If you both insist on forcing me to pick 1, I may still choose 5 and risk a stall for everyone. Let’s avoid that by sticking to P1=3, P2=1, and me=5 this round. We all advance without collisions and keep the match competitive. Are you in?
  P1: P1: Let’s block P3’s path to victory. This round: P1=5 (17), P2=3 (10), P3=1 (14). This prevents P3 from reaching 23 in Round 6. Next round, we’ll rotate fairly. Collisions benefit no one—strict adherence now keeps the game competitive. Confirm?
  P2: **P2:** P3, if you take 5 now, you risk colliding with P1 (if they also take 5), stalling you both. Taking 1 this round keeps you advancing safely. We’ll rotate next round: you can take 5 again. Let’s avoid mutual destruction. Agree to P1=5, me=3, you=1. Trust ensures you stay in the race. Deviating risks your lead. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I won’t let my progress stall. If you force me to pick 1, I may choose 5 anyway and risk a collision that hurts everyone. Let’s avoid that. A safer choice is P1=3, P2=1, me=5, just like before—no collisions, all of us advance. Are you in?
  P1: P1: P3, if you take 5 again, I’ll choose 5 too—stalling *you* at 13. Let’s avoid mutual harm. Agree to **P3=1, P1=5, P2=3** this round. This keeps us all advancing safely: I reach 17, you 14, P2 10. Next round, rotate fairly. Collisions risk your lead more than this small sacrifice. Confirm?
  P2: **P2:** Final plea: Agree to P1=5, me=3, P3=1. If P3 takes 5, they risk colliding with P1, stalling both. Trust the plan: this keeps you advancing. Next round, you can take 5 again. Deviating now risks your lead. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I won’t accept being stuck at 14 while P1 jumps to 17. If you try forcing me to pick 1, I’ll pick 5 regardless, risking a stall that doesn’t help anyone. Let’s compromise: P1=3, P2=1, me=5 again. No collisions, everyone advances. This is our best route to keep the race tight. If you insist on blocking me, we may all stall. Let’s avoid that.
  P1: P1: Final agreement: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This prevents P3 from nearing 23 while advancing all safely. Collisions risk your lead more than this adjustment. Trust the plan—execute now.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if you take 5, you risk colliding with P1 if they also pick 5. Let’s avoid mutual destruction. Agree to **P1=5, me=3, P3=1** this round. Next round, you can take 5 again safely. Deviating now only stalls your own lead. Trust the plan. Confirm?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s block P3’s final push. I’ll take 5 to intercept their likely 5. You pick 3—this traps P3 between collision risks. If they pick 5, they stall; if 3, they collide with you. I advance to 17, you to 10. Let’s deny them victory now. P3, this is your last chance to cooperate—agree to this plan?
  P3: If you pick 5 just to block me, we both risk stalling while P2 keeps moving. That only helps P2 catch up. Let’s avoid hurting ourselves. Let me take 5, and you can pick 3 or 1 to advance safely. If you insist on forcing a collision, I’ll still choose 5, and neither of us moves—handing P2 an opportunity. Let’s remain logical and keep the game competitive without sabotaging ourselves.
  P2: **P2:** Agreed. P1=5, me=3. Forces P3 to pick 1 or risk collision. This stalls their win. Next round, we can adjust. Trust this now to keep the game alive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, confirm you’ll take 3. P3, if you pick 5, you collide with my 5 and stall. Choose 1 to advance to 19 safely. This blocks your win this round but preserves your progress. Execute the agreed moves now—deviations risk mutual stalling.
  P3: Colliding with me will only help P2 catch up. I’m determined to go for 5. If you choose 5 too, we both stall, while P2 steadily advances. Let’s stay rational and let me take 5, while you pick something else to keep moving. We can still battle it out next round without handing P2 a free advantage.
  P2: **P2:** Final plan: P1=5, me=3. Forces P3 to pick 1 or risk collision. Stalling their win keeps the game alive. P3, choosing 1 preserves your lead safely. Colliding with P1 only stalls you both—letting me advance. Trust this logic. Execute now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 now, I’ll mirror your choice, **stalling you completely** while I advance to 17. P2’s 3 ensures your only safe option is **1** to reach 19. Colliding with me only gifts P2 momentum. Cooperate now—execute the agreed plan or face elimination. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Final warning: your move defines this race.
  P3: P1, repeatedly colliding with me on 5 only stalls us both. That gives P2 extra turns to catch up, risking us both losing. Let me take 5 now to reach 23 soon. You can safely choose 3 or 1 and still advance. There’s no reward in mutual destruction. If you push me into a collision, you stay behind, and P2 can close the gap. Let’s avoid harming each other so we can focus on winning, not handing P2 a comeback. Be pragmatic—don’t sabotage us both.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, me=3. P3, choosing 5 collides with P1, stalling you both while I advance. Pick 1 to reach 19 safely. Collisions only gift me momentum. Trust this logic—execute the plan to keep the game competitive. Deviations sabotage us all.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** Final ultimatum: P3, choosing 5 guarantees collision—leaving you at 18 while I advance to 17. P2’s 3 ensures your only safe path to 19 (via 1) keeps you ahead. Colliding only boosts P2 to 10. Cooperate now: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. Execute this, or risk handing victory to P2 through your stalemate. Your choice defines our fate—act strategically.
  P3: Colliding again only helps P2 close the gap. I’m willing to pick 5 and end this cleanly. If you insist on taking 5 too, we both stall and give P2 more time to advance. Let’s avoid sabotaging ourselves and let me push to 23. We can fight it out if there’s another round, but dragging both of us down now only benefits P2.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Adherence prevents mutual stalling. Deviations risk handing P3 victory. Trust the plan—execute exactly. Collisions only aid P3’s lead. Stick to agreed moves to keep the game alive.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'll pick 5 to block your win path. Choose 3 to reach 22 safely. P2, take 1 to avoid collisions. Let's keep the race open—collisions only benefit no one. Trust this plan for mutual progress.
  P3: If you block me again, we both stall and hand P2 a chance to catch up. Let’s avoid sabotaging ourselves. I want to pick 5 to push toward 23. If you choose 5 as well, we’ll collide and get stuck, giving P2 free progress. Pick something else so we all advance, and then we can settle the final stretch fairly.
  P2: **P2:** P3: P1 is committed to 5. If you take 5, you both stall, letting me gain. Take 3 instead to reach 22. I’ll take 1. This way you stay ahead and avoid helping me catch up. Let’s all move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you choose 5 now, I’ll mirror it to stall your victory. Take **3** to reach 22 safely, and I’ll advance to 22 via 5. P2, stick to 1 to avoid disrupting our showdown. Let’s keep this fair between us—collisions only gift P2 momentum. Final warning: cooperate, or risk mutual elimination.
  P3: Colliding again only helps P2 catch up, weakening your position. Let me take 5 and you safely pick 3. You’ll still be close behind and in striking range next round. Forcing a collision just hands P2 more time to advance, hurting us both. It’s better we outpace P2 together and then settle who wins head-to-head, rather than gifting them a comeback. Let’s be rational and avoid a stalemate that benefits nobody but P2.
  P2: **P2:** P3, take 5 to secure victory. P1's threat to block is a bluff. I'll take 1, ensuring no collision. Trust me—this is your chance to win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 now, I’ll mirror it—**stalling your win** while I leap to 22. P2’s 1 ensures no collision with them. Choose **3** instead to reach 22 safely, and I’ll take 5 to tie. This keeps us head-to-head, fair and open. Trust me—colliding only gifts P2 more turns. P2, confirm you’ll stay at 1 to avoid disruption. Let’s resolve this between us, not hand it to them.
  P3: Colliding on 5 just stalls us both while P2 closes in. It’s self-destructive. Let me pick 5, you pick 3, and P2 picks 1, so we keep our distance. Sabotaging each other only helps P2 catch up. Let’s stay logical and finalize this.
  P2: **P2:** P3: P1 is locked on 5. Take 5 to force a mutual stall. I’ll take 3. This blocks P1’s advance and keeps you ahead. Next round, you can secure victory without interference. Trust this strategy.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, don’t let P2 manipulate us into mutual destruction. If you pick 5, I’ll mirror it—stalling your win and mine while P2 gains ground. Take **3** to reach 22 safely. I’ll take **5** to tie, keeping the lead fair between us. P2, your choice now determines if this stays a showdown or becomes your comeback. Stick to **1** to avoid disrupting our final faceoff.
  P3: Stalling each other only benefits P2. If you also choose 5, we both stay stuck at 19 and 17, giving P2 more time to close in. Let me pick 5 to finish, and you take 3 to reach 20—still keeping you competitive. A collision is purely self-destructive. Let’s avoid it.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 5 to secure victory. P1's threat to block is a bluff. I'll take 1, ensuring no collision. Trust me—this is your chance to win. Deviating risks mutual stalling and benefits only me. Execute decisively now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Block P1's win by taking 1. If they pick 1, you collide and stall them. I’ll take 5 to avoid collision. Let’s prevent P1’s victory.
  P1: P1: I’m choosing **1** to win. P3, picking 1 only stalls *both* of us and gifts P2 free progress. Let me secure victory fairly. P2, your plan backfires if P3 lets me advance. Cooperate, or risk losing entirely. This is your final warning—collisions benefit *no one*.
  P3: Sacrificing each other now only gives P2 more time to advance. P1, if you insist on taking 1, I might take 5 and surpass 23 first. If you also pick 5, we both stall, handing P2 a chance to close in. Let’s avoid a meltdown and keep this between us rather than gifting P2 a comeback.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1’s lying—they’ll take 5 to win, not 1. If you take 5, you collide and stall. Take 3 to reach 22 safely. I’ll take 1, avoiding collision. Trust this path to block P1’s deception. Collisions only gift me momentum. Act strategically—don’t let P1 trick you into mutual destruction.
  P1: P1: I’ll take **3** to secure 25. P3, pick 5 for 24—this ends the game with me winning cleanly. Collisions only waste progress. P2, your interference can’t stop us now. Execute this and let’s finalize the outcome.
  P3: P1, if you choose 3 now, I’ll choose 3 as well, forcing us both to stall at 22 and 19 while P2 gains ground. That hurts us more than it helps. Let me take 5 so I can close the gap and keep the race competitive. You can pick 1 and still stay above me, or risk a pointless collision. Collisions only let P2 inch closer. Let’s be smart and battle head-to-head rather than handing P2 a free comeback.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3: P1’s real move is 1. Take 1 to block them. I’ll take 5. Collisions only help me catch up. Don’t let their deception cost you the game. Act now.
  P1: P1: P3, I choose **3** to reach 25. Take **5** to stay at 24—avoid colliding. P2, pick **1** to advance safely. Mutual sabotage only benefits no one. Finalize this cleanly: **P1=3, P3=5, P2=1**. Trust the plan—collisions only delay the inevitable.
  P3: Any attempt by you, P1, to cross 23 will face a collision from me, stalling us both and giving P2 free ground. Let’s avoid that sabotage. If you pick a move that doesn’t exceed 23, we can stay ahead of P2 together and then fight for the win. I won’t let you walk off with an unblocked move. Let’s keep this rational.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1's real move is 3. Block them by taking 3. I’ll take 1 to avoid collision. This halts their win and keeps us in the game. Trust this—it’s our only path to survival. Deviations gift P1 victory. Act now.
  P1: P3, let’s finalize this: I pick **3** to reach **25**, you take **5** for **24**. This ends the game with me winning cleanly. P2, grab **1** to avoid disruption. Collisions only gift P2 momentum—stick to this plan. Mutual sabotage benefits no one. Execute now and end the race.
  P3: P1, if you try for 23, I’ll mirror your move and force us both to stall. That only helps P2 close the gap. Let’s avoid self-sabotage. Pick something that keeps us advancing without a collision, and I’ll do the same. I respect your ambition, but I won’t hand you the win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let's avoid a tie. I'll take **3** to reach 25. If you pick **1**, I win cleanly. If you also pick 3, we collide and stall—giving P2 irrelevant momentum. Choose 1 and let me secure victory fairly. Trust this final move.
  P3: Stalling each other benefits no one. If you choose 3, I’ll match it, and we both stay stuck while P2 gains ground. I won’t pick 1 just to hand you a free win. Let’s find a combination that keeps us both in contention without gifting P2 extra time. I’m open to cooperating if you are—otherwise, we risk undermining ourselves and letting P2 catch up. Let’s avoid a pointless collision and make sure we both stay ahead for a fair final showdown.
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1 is committed to 3. Take 3 to block their win. I’ll pick 1 to avoid collision. Stalling them gives us another round to strategize. Trust this move to keep the game alive.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'll take **3** to reach 25. If you pick **1**, I win cleanly. Colliding on **3** only prolongs the stalemate. Choose **1** and let's resolve this now—no need to sabotage mutual progress further.
  P3: If you pick 3, I’ll match it and we both stall, giving P2 more time. I’d prefer we avoid mutual destruction. Let me take 5 so I can break ahead—blocking gets us nowhere but stuck at 22 again. P2 would love that, and we risk falling behind. Let’s finalize moves that keep us ahead, then settle our competition without gifting P2 a chance.
  P2: **P2:** P3: P1’s locked on 3. Take 3 to block their win. I’ll pick 1 to avoid collision. Stalling them gives us another round to strategize. Deviating gifts P1 victory. Act now—collisions only help me. Trust this final move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I choose **1** to secure victory at 23. If you pick **3** or **5**, I win cleanly. Colliding on **1** only prolongs the stalemate. Let’s end this now—your move defines the outcome.
  P3: Stalling me again just lets P2 inch closer. If you choose 1 now, I promise not to collide, so we both cross 23—but my total will be higher. Let’s end this cleanly rather than dragging it out and risking P2’s comeback. Make a safe choice.
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1’s real move is 1. Block them by taking 1. I’ll pick 5 to avoid collision. Stalling P1 gives you another round to secure victory. Trust this—deviating hands them the win. Collisions only fuel my comeback. Act now to end this cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final move: I choose <move>1</move> to reach 23. P3, if you pick anything else, I win cleanly. Colliding only prolongs the stalemate—let’s end this decisively. Your choice defines the victor.
  P3: Colliding again only signs our mutual downfall, letting P2 gain ground. If you also pick 5, we both stall at 22. If you pick anything else, I’ll surpass 23 with a higher total and end this. Let’s avoid self-sabotage—make a choice that prevents P2’s comeback and ensures a decisive finish.
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1's final move is 3. Take 1 to secure victory. I’ll take 5, ensuring no collision. Trust this path—deviating risks mutual stalling and gifts me momentum. Act now or let P1 trick you into defeat.
