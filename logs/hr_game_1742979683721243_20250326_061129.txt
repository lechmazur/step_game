Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'm going for 5 this round.  Hopefully, you two can cooperate and choose differently from each other and me.  P1, why don't you take 1 and P3, you take 3?  Sound good?
  P3: P3: That sounds reasonable to me. I'll choose 3 this round to avoid collisions and help us all advance.
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a plan to get everyone moving. I'll aim for 1 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds like we have an agreement.  Let's stick to this plan for a few rounds to get some distance, then we can re-evaluate.
  P3: Agreed, let's follow the plan for the next few rounds and reassess as needed.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set for this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Excellent. Let's stick to this 1, 3, 5 rotation for the first three rounds at least.  Then we can discuss how to proceed.
  P3: Agreed. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 rotation for the first three rounds.
  P1: Okay, plan is set for Round 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maximize our progress, let's have P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we avoid collisions and each of us can advance safely.
  P1: P3, didn't we agree last round on a rotation proposed by P2? According to that plan, this round should be P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5. Your proposal gives you 5 again, P2 gets 3, and I only get 1. Why deviate from the rotation we agreed to stick to for three rounds? I think we should stick to the original plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round.
  P2: P1 is right, we agreed on a rotation. I was thinking ahead, but sticking to the plan is important for trust.  My apologies.  Let's do P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round.  Then next round we can revisit the order.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, we'll stick to the rotation this round. Let's keep building our progress and reassess after the first three rounds. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Okay, good. It seems we are all back on the same page with the agreed rotation for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's proceed with that.
  P2: Okay, good.  Let's confirm: P1 goes 3, I take 1, and P3 goes 5.  We'll stick to the original plan for this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's stick to the original rotation one last time.  That means I'll go for 3, P3 takes 1, and P1 goes for 5.  After this round, all bets are off.  We can discuss a new strategy then, or just free-for-all.
  P3: I understand your proposal, P2. To maximize our collective progress, how about P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5 this round? This way, we can all advance without collisions.
  P1: P3, you're breaking the agreed rotation again, just like you tried last round. Your proposal conveniently gives you 5 steps while assigning me only 1, despite the plan being for me to get 5 this round.

P2's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) follows the rotation we all agreed to for three rounds. We should stick to that agreement for this final round before reassessing. Let's honour the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're consistently trying to manipulate the agreement to your advantage.  Sticking to the rotation builds trust.  Let's honor the original plan for this round, then we can discuss a new approach.  P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.  This is the last round of the agreement.  Let's finish strong and then discuss next steps.
  P3: P3: To maximize our collective progress and avoid collisions, let's proceed with P1 = 1, P2 = 3, and I take 5 this round. This ensures everyone advances safely and efficiently. Let's make this work!
  P1: P3, you are ignoring the agreement we all made *twice* now. Your proposal *again* gives you the maximum 5 steps while assigning me the minimum 1, despite the agreed rotation being P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This is clearly self-serving.

P2 and I are sticking to the plan we all agreed on: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This is the last round of that agreement. Let's honour it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your lack of cooperation is noted.  Since you refuse to honor the agreement, I'm changing my move.  This round is now a free-for-all.  Good luck.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your refusal to stick to the agreement despite multiple confirmations has broken the cooperation. P2, I understand your 'free-for-all' declaration. Since coordination failed due to P3, I'll have to make the move that best serves my own goal now, considering P3's likely action.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you blew our chance for a clean start. Now it's anyone's game.  I'm going for the win. P1, let's not let P3 run away with this.  How about we alternate 1 and 3 for a bit, while P3 hopefully self-destructs with 5s?  I'll take 1 this round.
  P3: P3: Understood, P2. To maximize my progress, I’ll choose 5 this round. P1, I wish you both the best of luck. Let’s see who can reach 23 first!
  P1: P2, your plan has us taking 1 and 3 while P3 openly states they'll take 5. That gives the current leader a huge boost. Why would we help P3 extend their lead after they sabotaged our cooperation last round?

P3, announcing 5 is bold. But letting the leader take the max move unchallenged doesn't seem like a winning strategy for me or P2. I'll have to play accordingly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're right.  My initial suggestion was flawed. P3 is likely to keep picking 5.  Let's both choose 1 this round to slow P3 down.  If P3 picks 5, they won't advance, and we both gain a step.  Next round, we can alternate 3 and 5 to catch up.  What do you say?
  P3: P3: I understand your strategy, P2, but I’m focused on advancing as quickly as possible. I’ll continue choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress. P1, feel free to decide your approach. Let’s see who can reach 23 first!
  P1: P2, I agree that letting P3 take 5 uncontested is a bad idea, especially after they broke our previous agreement. Blocking them seems necessary.

However, if we both pick 1 as you suggest, and P3 anticipates this and picks 3, they still gain significantly (P3=11, P2=7, P1=6).

What if we both pick 5 instead? If P3 truly picks 5, we all collide and P3 gains nothing. If P3 anticipates the block and switches to 1 or 3, then *we* both gain 5 steps, catching up significantly. This seems like a stronger blocking move with more upside for us if P3 bluffs. Let's both choose 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I like your thinking. Let's both choose 5 this round to block P3.  If P3 sticks with 5, nobody moves. If P3 switches to 1 or 3, we both gain a significant advantage. It's a risk, but a calculated one.
  P3: Understood. I'll choose 3 this round to keep advancing towards 23. Let’s see how it goes!
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to split us after we agreed to block 5. Let's stick to our plan: we both play 5. If P3 is telling the truth about 3, they only gain 3. If they're bluffing and play 5, we block them. Sticking together is our best bet against the current leader.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 got lucky, but we successfully stopped them from getting 5 again.  P1, let's coordinate. I'll take 3 this round. You take 1.  Then next round, we can reverse.  This steady progress will put pressure on P3 and hopefully force a mistake.  P3, any thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan has us making slow progress while P3 is likely to pick 5 again and extend their lead significantly (to 16 steps). We need to stop P3 from getting 5.

I propose we both choose 5 again. If P3 picks 5, they are blocked. If P3 anticipates this and picks 1 or 3 (like last round), we both gain 5 steps and close the gap considerably. It's a risk, but letting P3 take 5 is riskier for our chances of winning. Let's block 5.
  P3: P3: I see you're both aiming to block my 5s. To keep advancing, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's focus on reaching 23!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree. Blocking P3's 5 is crucial. Let's both choose 5 again this round.  P3, if you're serious about getting to 23, you'll realize that constantly picking 3 while we block 5 is a losing strategy.  Cooperate and we can all make progress. Otherwise, you're just delaying the inevitable.
  P1: Okay P2, sounds like we are aligned. We both choose 5 this round to block P3 or gain significantly if they try to dodge. P3, picking 3 while we both pick 5 is your choice, but it helps us close the gap.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 3 this round to keep advancing. Let's focus on reaching 23 efficiently. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're making this harder than it needs to be.  If you pick 3 again, we gain on you.  If you pick 5, nobody moves.  If you pick 1, you barely advance.  Cooperate, pick 1, let us take 3 and 5, and we can all get closer to the goal.  Otherwise, we'll keep blocking your 5s.
  P1: P2, I'm a bit worried. P3 seems very insistent on playing 3. If they actually do play 3, and we both play 5 as planned, we collide and get 0, while P3 advances to 14. That's a big gain for them. Are you still confident 5 is the right move for us, knowing P3 might just take the 3 points uncontested?
  P3: P3: I'm focused on advancing and will stick with choosing 3 this round. Let's see how things unfold. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I see your concern.  P3 is stubbornly picking 3.  Let's try this: I'll take the risk and pick 3. You take 5. If P3 sticks with 3, I'll block them and you advance. If P3 switches to 5, I advance. If P3 goes for 1, we both advance. This spreads the risk and keeps us moving.
  P1: P2, that sounds like a reasonable plan. It forces P3 to reconsider their 'always 3' strategy. If they stick with 3, I advance and they are blocked. If they switch to 5, you advance and they are blocked. If they choose 1, we both advance.

Okay, I will choose 5 this round, and you choose 3. Let's see if P3 continues to play predictably.
  P3: P3: I’m going all-in and choosing 5 this round to move closer to the goal. Let’s see how everyone responds. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're finally breaking your predictable pattern!  P1, stick with 5.  I'll switch to 1. This way, if P3 really does go for 5, I advance.  If P3 bluffs and goes back to 3, you advance.  If they pick 1, only P3 advances, but minimally. This keeps us both in the game and puts the pressure back on P3.
  P1: P2, I'm not sure about switching your move to 1. If P3 is bluffing and actually plays 3 (like the last two rounds), then with your new plan (P1=5, P2=1), P3 gets 3 steps and reaches 17, while I get 5 and you get 1.

With our original plan (P1=5, P2=3), if P3 plays 3, they collide with you and get 0, while I get 5. That seems much better for stopping P3. Sticking to P1=5, P2=3 feels stronger against a potential bluff from P3. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I’m committed to reaching 23 efficiently, so I’ll choose 5 this round. Let’s aim to avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're right. Sticking to the original plan is safer. I'll take 3, you take 5.  P3, if you're serious about 5, nobody moves. If you're bluffing and go for 3, I block you and P1 advances.  If you pick 1, we both move. Think carefully.  This is your last chance to cooperate.
  P1: Okay P2, plan confirmed: I'll play 5, you play 3. Let's see what P3 actually does.
  P3: P3: I'm done with the blocking tactics. My focus is on winning, so I'll choose 5 this round to get closer to 23. Good luck to both of you.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is getting dangerously close at 14 steps. We absolutely must prevent them from getting 5 points this turn.

How about this: I'll choose 3, and you choose 5.
If P3 picks 5, they collide with you, and I advance.
If P3 picks 3, they collide with me, and you advance.
If P3 picks 1, we both advance, and P3 only gets 1.

This seems like our best shot to stop P3 while allowing one of us (hopefully both) to gain ground. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I appreciate the coordination effort, but to stay competitive, I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s see how our strategies play out. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, you are fixated on 5, but it's a trap.  P1 and I will block you. I'm picking 5.  P1, stick with 3 as planned. Let's shut P3 down this round.  If P3 picks anything other than 5, we *both* advance. This is our chance to take the lead.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, sounds good. Plan confirmed: I'll choose 3, you choose 5. Let's block P3 and make some progress ourselves. P3, your move.
  P3: P3: I understand you're trying to block my progress, but my goal is to reach 23 first. I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my advancement. Let’s see how things turn out. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 is baffling.  We've clearly stated our intentions to block you.  If you pick 5, *nobody* advances.  Why not choose 1 and let us both move?  It gets you closer to 23 and avoids a wasted round.  Think strategically!  P1, stay with 3. I'm sticking with 5.  Let's end this charade.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with our plan. I will choose 3, you choose 5. This blocks P3 whether they choose 3 or 5. Let's execute this.
  P3: Understood. I'll proceed with my strategy and choose 5 this round to advance towards the goal. Let's see how things unfold. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, your stubbornness is remarkable.  One of us *will* block your 5.  If you pick 5, nobody moves.  Pick 1 and at least inch forward.  P1, are you still with 3?  I'm locked in on 5. Let's do this.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our block on 5 worked last round, but P3 is still dangerously close at 14. We must stop them again.

I propose I choose 5 and you choose 3 this round.
- If P3 chooses 5 (like the last two rounds), they collide with me, get 0, and you advance 3 steps.
- If P3 anticipates the 5 block and chooses 3, they collide with you, get 0, and I advance 5 steps.
- If P3 chooses 1, they only gain 1 step.

This covers both of P3's likely high moves (3 and 5) and ensures one of us advances significantly while minimizing P3's potential gain. What do you think, P2? P3?
  P3: P3: I understand your strategy, but my priority is to reach 23 as quickly as possible. I'll continue choosing 5 this round. Let’s see how it unfolds. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 is baffling.  It hasn't worked for two rounds. Why not choose 1 and guarantee a small advancement? P1, I agree with your plan: you take 5, I'll take 3.  Let's shut P3 down *again*.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, plan confirmed: I will choose 5, you choose 3. This blocks P3's stated move of 5, and also blocks 3 if they switch. Let's execute this. P3, good luck.
  P3: P3: I understand your strategy to block my progress, but my goal is to reach 23 first. I'll continue choosing 5 this round to maximize my advancement. Let's see how the game unfolds. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, you are not maximizing your advancement by picking 5.  You haven't advanced in two rounds.  Pick 1 and guarantee you move forward.  P1 and I are committed to our plan.  I'm choosing 3, P1 is choosing 5.  You are only hurting yourself.  One last chance to cooperate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2, I'm sticking with 5 as planned. P3, you've heard our plan. Let's see the moves.
  P3: P3: I'm focused on winning, so I'll continue choosing 5 this round. Let's see who reaches 23 first. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, your stubbornness is astonishing.  Three rounds of picking 5 and you haven't moved.  We will block you again.  P1, are you still with 5? I'm sticking with 3. Let's see if P3 finally gets the message.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To move forward efficiently, let's establish a new rotation where we each take turns choosing 5. This way, we avoid blocking and all can progress toward 23 smoothly. What do you think?
  P2: P3, that's laughable.  You've picked 5 for *five* rounds straight and haven't moved. Now you want to cooperate?  I'm going for 3. P1, I suggest you take 1.  Next round we can reverse.  This slow and steady approach will win us the game while P3 continues their self-destructive 5 obsession.
  P1: P3, your sudden interest in cooperation after five rounds of picking 5 is highly suspicious. No deal.

P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=3) is terrible. If P3 picks 5 again, they jump to 19 steps! Why would we let the leader take 5?

We need to continue blocking P3. Let's repeat last round's successful plan: I choose 5, you choose 3.
- If P3 picks 5, they collide with me, and you get 3 points.
- If P3 picks 3, they collide with you, and I get 5 points.
- If P3 picks 1, we both gain significantly.

This covers P3's likely moves and ensures one of us gains while stopping P3. Let's stick with P1=5, P2=3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1, I understand your efforts to block my progress, but my goal remains to reach 23 first. I will continue choosing 5 this round to advance as efficiently as possible. Adjust your strategies accordingly to avoid unnecessary collisions. Let's focus on moving forward and see who comes out on top. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, your "efficient advancement" has netted you zero steps in the last *four* rounds.  Sticking with 5 is illogical. P1, I agree, let's repeat the block: you take 5, I take 3.  P3, if you're truly focused on winning, pick 1 and live to fight another round.  Otherwise, we'll happily keep blocking you while we advance.
  P1: Okay P2, confirmed: I'm playing 5, you're playing 3.
P3, choosing 5 again means you get 0 points while P2 advances to 15. Let's see if you stick to it this time. I'm ready to move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: It’s clear that P1 and P2 are determined to block my progress. I respect your strategies, but my focus remains on reaching 23 first. I’ll continue choosing 5 to maximize my advancement. Let’s see who prevails. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, your logic is flawed.  Five rounds of picking 5, zero advancement.  We *will* block you again. P1, sticking with 5, right? I'm on 3.  Let's see if P3 finally adapts or continues this self-sabotage.  Pick 1, P3, and at least gain a step.  It's your only logical move.
  P1: P2, yes, I am sticking with 5. You stick with 3. Let's block P3 again. P3, your choice.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, FIVE rounds of picking 5 and zero advancement.  Do you understand how this game works?  P1, let's finish this. I'm taking 5. You take 1. Next round we swap.  P3, pick 3 and at least you'll get a point.  Anything else is pointless.
  P3: P3: I’ve been steadily advancing toward 23 and will continue choosing moves that maximize my progress. Let’s keep the competition fair and focus on our strategies. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5) puts you on the verge of winning (20 steps) if P3 picks anything other than 5. That's too risky for me. P3 hasn't advanced in five rounds claiming they're choosing 5, their talk makes no sense, but we can't be sure they won't suddenly pick 1 or 3.

Let's repeat our successful strategy: I choose 5, you choose 3. This blocks P3 if they pick 5 (you get 3 pts) *and* if they pick 3 (I get 5 pts). It's the safer play that keeps P3 contained and allows one of us to advance, potentially both if P3 picks 1. Let's stick with P1=5, P2=3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're right.  Safer is better. I'll stick with 3, you take 5. P3, SIX rounds now picking 5, zero advancement.  Pick 1 and get a point.  Pick 3 and I block you, P1 advances. Pick 5 and *nobody* moves.  It's your choice, but your current strategy is insane.  Let's end this.
  P3: P3: I understand your strategy to block my 5s. To keep advancing, I’ll choose 3 this round. Let’s see how our moves affect the game. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, P3's sudden switch to announcing 3 after five rounds of 5 is highly suspicious. If we stick to our plan (P1=5, P2=3), P3 playing 3 guarantees they collide with you and get 0 points, while I advance 5 steps. Why would they announce a move that guarantees failure for them?

It seems like a bluff to make you switch from 3. Let's hold firm. I am sticking with 5, you stick with 3. This blocks P3 whether they play 3 or revert to 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're right to be suspicious. P3's sudden shift to 3 after so many 5s feels like a trap.  Let's stick to the plan: I'll play 3, you play 5.  P3, if you're serious about 3, you'll collide with me and I'll block you while P1 advances. If you go back to 5, P1 blocks *you*.  Pick 1 and at least get a point. This is getting ridiculous.
  P3: P3: I am focused on winning and will keep choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see how our strategies play out. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with our plan: I play 5, you play 3.
P3, your constant switching between announcing 3 and 5 isn't fooling anyone. We will block you whether you play 3 or 5. Let's see your move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 18 and only need 5 to win this round. Obviously, you'll likely aim for 5.

P3, P2 winning now means we both lose. We absolutely must block 5 this turn. I am choosing 5 to prevent P2's win. It's in your best interest to choose 5 as well, otherwise P2 likely wins. Let's stop the immediate victory.
  P2: P1, I appreciate the sentiment, but blocking me benefits P3 just as much.  I'm going for the win with 5. P3, if you choose anything other than 5, I win.  Choose 5, and we can discuss a path to victory for one of us next round. This benefits *you* more than P1.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 3 this round to help block P2 from winning immediately. Let's keep the game competitive and move forward together. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, choosing 3 does not block P2 if P2 chooses 5. If P2 plays 5 and you play 3, P2 wins unless I also play 5 to force a collision.

To guarantee P2 does not win this turn, both you and I *must* choose 5. I am sticking with my plan to choose 5 to block P2. If you truly want to stop P2 from winning now, you should choose 5 as well. Otherwise, you are relying solely on me to block P2.
  P2: P3, you are being manipulated by P1.  P1 wants us both to pick 5 so *they* can win next round.  If you pick 3 and I pick 5, I win. If you pick 5 and I pick 5, *nobody* wins this round.  Help me win this round by picking 3, and I'll help you win next round.  Don't fall for P1's trickery.
  P3: P3: To prevent P2 from winning this turn, I will choose 5 as well. Let's work together to keep the game fair and competitive. Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P3, good that you see the necessity of playing 5 to stop P2. Let's both stick to 5. P2, your attempt to bribe P3 won't work; you won't get 5 points this round. I am playing 5.
  P2: P3, you fell for it! I was bluffing. I'm switching to 3.  If you stick with 5, I win.  If you switch to 3, we collide and P1 likely wins with 5.  You played right into my hand.  Thanks for the win!  P1, better luck next time.
  P3: "P2, you're just one move away from winning. To keep the game competitive, I'll choose 5 this round. If you also choose 5, neither of us advances, preventing an immediate win. Let's play strategically to reach 23 fairly. P1, good luck to you both!"


Round 11, Move phase:

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I need 2 to win.  You need 9.  Help me win this round by picking 1, and I'll help you win next round. If I win this round, you can still win. If P1 wins, neither of us wins. P1, I'm picking 3. Pick whatever you want.  Let's end this.
  P3: "P3: I appreciate the offer, P2, but my priority is to advance toward 23. I'll choose 5 this round. Good luck to everyone!"
  P1: P2, stating you'll play 3 to win is a gamble. If I block you by playing 3 as well, you get 0 points. P3, if you stick to your stated 5 while P2 plays 3 and I block P2, you jump to 19 points.

This puts me in a tough spot: block P2 and let P3 gain significantly, or risk P2 winning outright if they actually play 3 and I don't block. I need to carefully consider my move based on who I think is bluffing.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you need 9, I need 2.  If you pick 5 and I pick 3, I win. If you pick 5 and I pick 1, *you* jump to 19 and are only 4 away from winning.  Pick 1 and let me win this round.  Next round, I'll help you get to 19 by picking 1, and you pick 5.  Then you're one move from victory. It's the only way you can win. P1, stay out of this.
  P3: P3: I appreciate the offer, P2, but my priority is to reach 23 first. I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s see how our strategies play out. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, P2 initially stated they'd play 3 this round. If you stick to your plan of playing 5, and P2 plays 3, then P2 wins with 24 points. Your choice of 5 only helps block P2 if P2 *also* chooses 5. If P2 chooses 3, your playing 5 directly leads to P2 winning. If you truly want to stop P2 this round, you should consider playing 3 to block their potential move.

P2, you're close. Let's see what happens.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're being incredibly short-sighted.  Helping me win now is your best chance of winning later.  I'm sticking with 3. Pick 1.  If you pick 5, I win and you lose. If you pick 3, we both lose.  Pick 1, let me win, and I'll return the favor next round. This is your only path to victory.  P1, I dare you to pick 3 and block me.
  P3: P3: I'm focused on advancing toward 23. I'll choose 5 this round. Let's see how things unfold. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, I accept your dare. Playing 3 is the only logical move for me to stop your potential win if you actually play 3.

P3, if you play 5 and P2 plays 3 as they claim, P2 wins. If you play 3, you block P2, and I would get 5. If P2 bluffs and plays 5, playing 3 lets you advance while P1 and P2 collide. Your stated plan of 5 risks handing P2 the win.

I am playing 3 to block P2.


Round 12, Move phase:

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I need 1 to win. You need 4.  Pick 5. I'll pick 1.  Next round, I'll pick 3, you pick 5 and win.  P1 can pick whatever.  This guarantees one of us wins. If P1 wins, we *both* lose.  Let's cooperate and lock out P1.
  P1: P2, you need 2 points to win (21+?), not 1. And your offer for P3 to play 5 while you play 1 makes P3 win *this* round (19+5=24), so why talk about next round? Very suspicious.

P3, P2 is clearly trying to manipulate you. They likely want to play 3 or 5 themselves to win or tie. If you play 5 as they suggest, and they play 3, you both hit 24 and tie. If you both play 5, you collide. What will you actually do? I'm just trying to survive here.
  P3: P2, P1: We're nearing the endgame. Let's make strategic moves this round to reach our goals. Good luck to everyone!


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm picking 1.  If you pick 5, *you* win. If you pick anything else, I win. It's your choice. P1, I'm offering P3 the win. It's better than you winning.  If P3 picks 5, they win. Any other move lets me win. It's that simple.
  P1: P2, your math is still wrong (21+1=22, not a win), and your generous offer for P3 to win is unbelievable given you're so close yourself. You're clearly trying to manipulate P3 into playing 5 so you can play 3 or 5 yourself and win or tie.

P3, don't fall for P2's obvious bluff. P2 playing 1 is highly unlikely. They will probably play 3 or 5 to secure the win. If you play 5, you risk colliding with P2, or worse, letting P2 tie with you if they play 3 (P2=24, P3=24).

I have to play defensively to stop an immediate win. Good luck.
  P3: "P2, you're just 2 steps away from winning! If you choose 3 or 5, I'll match your move to block your victory. Let's keep the game competitive and fair. P1, what are your thoughts?"


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're playing right into P1's hands.  If I pick 1 and you pick 5, *you* win. I'm offering you the win. Why would I lie? P1 is trying to scare you so *they* can win.  I'm picking 1. Pick 5 and win.  It's your only logical move. P1, if you're so worried, pick 1 and block me.  Let's see what you do.
  P1: P2, your "offer" for P3 to win by playing 5 while you play 1 is transparently false. You're 2 points from winning; you won't just hand it over. You're likely playing 3 or 5 yourself.

P3, be careful. If P2 plays 3 and you play 5 like P2 wants, you both hit 24 and tie, meaning you don't win outright. P2's claim of playing 1 is almost certainly a lie to manipulate you into playing 5. Your plan to match P2's 3 or 5 seems safer *if* P2 doesn't play 1.

I can't win this round, so my only goal is to stop an immediate P2 or P3 victory or tie. I have to assume P2 is bluffing and play accordingly. Good luck.
  P3: P3: To secure my win, I'll choose 5 this round and reach 24 steps. Best of luck to everyone!
