P2 is trying to make us split our blocks. If we choose different numbers, P2 wins with the third option. Since I committed to blocking 1, P2 might expect that and choose 3 instead. Let's both block 3 this round. It's our best chance - P2 likely won't pick 5 (too risky) and might avoid 1 thinking we'll block it. We must guess and commit together."}

If we guess wrong together, at least we still have a chance next round. I'm 100% committing to 3. Join me for our best shot at stopping P2."}
