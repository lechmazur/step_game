Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's avoid collisions by choosing different numbers. Let's each pick 1, 3, or 5."
  P3: "Agreed, P1. Let’s each pick unique numbers (1, 3, 5) to avoid collisions and advance together. If anyone breaks this, I’ll mirror their choice next round to block them. Trust but verify. Let’s start with 1, 3, 5 now."
  P2: "I suggest we assign numbers to each player to avoid collisions. How about P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5 this round? This way, we all advance and rebuild trust for future rounds."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll choose 5. Let's avoid collisions and advance together. Let's all move forward.
  P3: "P1, I'll take 1 to avoid clashing with your 5. P2, please confirm you're taking 3 as agreed. That way we all advance safely and keep trust. Let’s align."
  P2: Let's confirm our choices as discussed: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions and establish a foundation for cooperation. Shall we proceed with these assignments?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Let’s stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, all advance. Ready?"
  P3: "Confirmed. Let’s execute as agreed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, all advance. Trust the plan. "
  P2: Let's finalize our moves as agreed: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can rebuild trust for future rounds. Shall we proceed with our assigned numbers?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Let’s stick to the plan—no deviations. Trust ensures everyone advances. Any betrayal? I’ll adjust next round. Ready?"
  P3: "Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No changes. Trust the plan. Let's proceed to move phase. "
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I expect everyone to stick to their assigned numbers. Any deviation will be met with a strategic response in the next round. Let's move forward and establish a foundation for cooperation.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's maintain our assigned numbers to avoid collisions and advance together. P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Consistency builds trust. If anyone deviates, we'll reassess our strategy in the next round. Shall we proceed as planned and make progress?
  P1: "Let’s stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, all advance. Ready?"
  P3: "Proceeding with the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Consistency builds progress. No surprises—trust the alignment. Let’s advance."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the plan. If everyone sticks to their assigned numbers, we can ensure steady progress. I'll take 3 again, expecting P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 1. Consistency is key to advancing together without collisions. Shall we maintain our cooperation and move forward as agreed?
  P1: "Let’s stick to 5, 3, 1. Consistency ensures progress. Any deviation risks collision. Let’s move forward."
  P3: "Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Consistency ensures we all progress. Any last-minute changes risk collision. Trust the plan, everyone?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's maintain our strategy to avoid collisions. If we stick to the plan, we all advance. I suggest we review our progress after this round to discuss potential adjustments for future rounds, ensuring we're all on the same page and working towards a collaborative victory, at least for now.
  P1: "Let’s stick to 5, 3, 1. Consistency ensures progress. No collisions, no risks. Move forward."
  P3: "Final warning: I'll mirror P1's choice this round. If you insist on 5, we collide—no progress for either. P2, if P1 blocks me, take 5 next round to advance. Current path guarantees P1's win. Force change now or lose."


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "P3's warning is valid. If we continue as is, P1 will likely win. I propose a temporary adjustment: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This shake-up can prevent P1's dominance and give us a chance to reassess our strategy for future rounds. Let's consider a change to keep the game competitive."
  P1: "Stick to 5, 3, 1. Deviations risk collisions. Let’s all advance safely. No changes needed."
  P3: "Final commitment: I mirror P1's choice this round. If P1 sticks to 5, we collide—no progress for them. P2, pick 3 to advance safely while we block P1. This is our window to disrupt their path. No more warnings—action this turn."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Last round failed. Let’s realign: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. If P1 refuses 1, I’ll mirror their 5 to block, letting P2 advance. P2, confirm you’ll take 5 if P1 defects. No more stalemates—this round shifts power. Agree or face P2/P3 surge."
  P1: "Let’s align: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions, all advance. Final offer—stick or face P2/P3 surge. Move forward."
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This alignment allows us to advance without collisions and prevents P1's dominance. If P1 refuses, I'll support P3's plan to mirror P1's choice and block their progress. Let's proceed with this new strategy to keep the game competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P1, deviation triggers my mirror and P2’s surge. P2, enforce by taking 5 if P1 defects. This is our only path to advance and disrupt P1’s lead. Execute precisely—no surprises. Trust this alignment or collapse. "
  P1: "Stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No collisions. Let’s advance."
  P2: Let's confirm our new strategy. P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. I'll hold to this plan, expecting P1 and P3 to do the same. Any deviation will prompt a strategic response in the next round. Let's proceed with this alignment and make progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final check: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No deviations. P2, enforce by taking 5 if P1 defects. P1, compliance keeps you ahead—refusal invites collision. This is our only path to advance without collapse. Confirm or reset the game."
  P1: "Stick to 1, 5, 3. No collisions. P2, confirm 5. P3, confirm 3. Let’s advance safely. Deviate, and I’ll adjust next round. Ready?"
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This alignment ensures progress without collisions. I expect P1 to stick to 1, allowing us to advance safely. Any deviation will be addressed in the next round. Let's maintain trust and move forward with our assigned numbers.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final alignment: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P1, compliance ensures lead; defiance triggers mirror (5) and P2’s surge. P2, enforce by taking 5 if P1 defects. No more sub-rounds—execute or collapse. Trust the plan, or reset the game."
  P1: "I'll take 5. Let's move. No more sub-rounds."
  P2: "P1 has deviated from the agreed plan. I'll take 1 to avoid collision with P3, who should mirror P1's 5 to block their progress. P3, please confirm you'll take 5 to enforce our previous agreement and prevent P1's advancement."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P1's deviation and our previous agreement, I suggest P3 and I work together to block P1's progress. P3, since you mirrored P1's 5 last round, let's adjust our strategy. I propose I take 5, and you take 3. P1, if you continue to defy agreements, you'll face opposition from both of us, limiting your advancement. Let's realign our moves to keep the game competitive and prevent any single player from dominating.
  P3: P3: "P2, agreed: you take 5, I take 3. P1, take 1 or collide. I mirror your 5 if you defy. Final alignment—execute or collapse."
  P1: P3, take 1, I'll take 5. No collisions. P2's plan fails. Let's advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess. P1, your constant deviations undermine trust. P3, our previous alliance can still work. I'll stick to my proposal: I take 5, P3 takes 3. If P1 takes 1, we advance without collisions. If P1 defies, P3 mirrors their move, blocking them. This strategy keeps the game competitive and prevents dominance. Let's execute this plan and make progress together.
  P3: "Confirmed: P2 takes 5, I take 3. P1's 5 collides with P2—only I advance. Break their lead now. Final warning: comply or collapse."
  P1: "Let’s align: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions. All advance. Deviate, and I’ll adjust next round. Trust the plan."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, your words are inconsistent with your actions. You've deviated from plans before. P3, let's stick to our last agreement: I take 5, you take 3. If P1 takes 1, we advance; if not, you mirror their move. This is our chance to block P1's lead and make the game competitive. Let's execute this strategy and move forward together."
  P3: "Confirmed: P2=5, P3=3. P1’s 1 ensures all advance. Any 5 from P1 collides with P2—only I advance. Execute the plan—no surprises. Deviate, and I’ll enforce next round."
  P1: "Stick to 1,5,3. No collisions. All advance. P2, confirm 5. P3, confirm 3. Deviate, and I’ll adjust next round. Let’s move forward."


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "P1's inconsistency is a concern. P3, let's stick to our plan: I take 5, you take 3. If P1 deviates, you mirror their move. This ensures we keep the game competitive. P1, taking 1 is your only way to advance without collision. Let's see if you'll finally stick to a plan."
  P3: "Final alignment: P2=5, P3=3. P1, take 1 to advance safely or collide with P2 and gift me progress. Your lead vanishes if you defy. Decide wisely—this is our last coordinated push. No more chances."
  P1: "Stick to 1,5,3. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. I’ll take 1—no collisions. Deviate, and I’ll adjust next round. Let’s advance."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s adjust for fairness: I’ll take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This balances progress while keeping the race competitive. P2, you’ve surged ahead—this ensures we stay in contention. P1, this avoids your prior collisions. Final offer: confirm or risk chaos."
  P2: "P3's proposal seems fair, considering the current standings. I'm willing to take 3 this round, allowing P3 to catch up with 5 and P1 to advance with 1. This adjustment maintains competition and avoids collisions. Let's confirm this alignment to ensure progress for all."
  P1: "Agreed, let's stick to 1, 3, 5 to avoid collisions. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. I'll take 1. Let's move forward safely."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final confirmation: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. P2, deviation triggers my mirror next round. P1, enforce 1 or enable collapse. Precision ensures balance—no surprises. Execute or reset. "
  P2: Let's review P3's proposal. If we stick to 1, 3, 5, we all advance safely. P3 catches up, and the game remains competitive. I'm willing to take 3, allowing P3 to take 5 and P1 to take 1. This alignment maintains balance and avoids collisions. Shall we confirm and proceed with this plan?
  P1: "Stick to 1,3,5. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. No collisions. Deviate, and I’ll adjust next round. Let’s move forward."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final alignment: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P2, deviation triggers my mirror next round. P1, enforce 1 or enable P2’s surge. Precision ensures balance—no surprises. Execute or reset. Deviate, and I’ll enforce next round. Let’s advance."
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 5. P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This alignment ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. I expect everyone to stick to their assigned numbers. Any deviation will be addressed in the next round. Let's maintain trust and move forward with our agreed plan.
  P1: "Let’s realign: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This accelerates my progress. No collisions. Agree?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final offer: I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. P1, defy and I mirror your 5—collide and gift P2 progress. P2, enforce 3 or enable collapse. Precision now—align or reset. No more chances."
  P2: "P1's sudden change of heart is suspicious. Sticking to the original plan of 1, 3, 5 ensures balance and progress. I urge P3 to maintain their commitment to taking 5, and I'll take 3. P1, taking 1 is the only way to avoid collision and maintain trust. Let's not risk chaos and stick to the agreed plan."
  P1: "Stick to 5, 3, 1. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I’ll take 5. No collisions. Let’s advance safely. Agree?"


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, I propose we reassess our strategy. P1 and P3 are tied at 7 steps, while I'm at 14. To maintain competition, I suggest P1 and P3 take 5, and I'll take 1, allowing them to catch up. This adjustment keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. Let's discuss and confirm our moves for Round 6.
  P1: "Let’s avoid collisions: P1=5, P3=1, P2=3. All advance. Deviate, and I’ll adjust next round. Trust the plan."
  P3: "Reject P1's plan. P2 takes 1 to slow your surge. I take 5, P1 takes 3. Unique steps—no collisions. P1, defiance triggers my mirror next round. P2, surge only if we align. Execute or collapse."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I agree with P3 that my surge needs to be slowed. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This alignment allows P3 to catch up and keeps the game competitive. P1, taking 3 ensures your progress without collision. Let's execute this plan and maintain balance in the game."
  P1: "Stick to 5, 1, 3. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions. Let’s advance. Deviate, and I’ll adjust next round."
  P3: "Final alignment: P3=5 (to close gap), P1=3, P2=1. P1, deviation triggers my mirror next round—collide with P2 and gift me progress. P2, surge only if aligned. Execute now or reset. No more chances—this is our path to balance."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "I'm open to adjusting our strategy to keep the game competitive. P3's suggestion of taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1 seems reasonable. This alignment allows P3 to catch up and slows my surge. Let's consider this plan to maintain balance and avoid collisions. P1, taking 3 ensures your progress, and P3, taking 5 helps you close the gap. Shall we proceed with this adjusted strategy?"
  P1: "Let’s align: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. I’ll take 5. No collisions. All advance. Deviate, and I’ll adjust next round."
  P3: "Final commitment: I take 5. P1, take 3 or collide. P2, take 1 to slow surge. Deviate, and I mirror P1’s move next round. Execute or collapse."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize Round 6 moves. I'll take 1, slowing my surge. P3 takes 5 to catch up, and P1 takes 3 to advance safely. This alignment maintains balance and avoids collisions. I expect everyone to stick to this plan, ensuring a competitive game. Deviations will be addressed in the next round. Let's proceed with this strategy and make progress together.
  P1: "Let’s align: P2=3, P3=1, P1=5. No collisions. All advance. Agree?"
  P3: "Final alignment: P3=5 (to close gap), P1=3, P2=1. P1, defiance triggers collision with P2—gift me progress. P2, surge only if aligned. Execute now or reset. No more chances—this is our path to balance."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Final alignment: I take 5 to close the gap. P2, if you take 5, we collide—no progress for your lead. P1, take 3 to advance safely. This is our only path to disrupt P2’s dominance. Agree or face their victory. Execute precisely—no surprises."
  P2: "I propose a strategic move: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to close the gap, while I maintain a safe lead. P1, taking 1 ensures progress without collision. Let's execute this plan to keep the game competitive and balanced."
  P1: "Let’s align: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, all advance. Trust the plan."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final warning: P2’s lead is lethal. I’ll take 5. P1, mirror P2’s move: if they choose 5, we collide—no progress for them. If P2 retreats to 3/1, we advance. This is your only leverage, P1. Coordinate or concede the win to P2. Execute now—no surprises."
  P2: "P3's warning highlights the urgency. I suggest a temporary alliance: P1 and P3 take 1, and I'll take 5. This allows me to maintain a lead while giving P1 and P3 a chance to catch up. If P1 and P3 cooperate, we can reassess our strategy in the next round to ensure a competitive game."
  P1: "Let’s break the cycle: I take 5, P3 takes 1. P2, take 3. No collisions—this accelerates my progress while keeping the race tight. Agree?"


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final commitment: I take 5 this round. P2, if you choose 5, we collide—no progress for your lead. P1, take 3 to advance safely. This is our only chance to stall P2’s win. Execute precisely—no surprises. Deviate, and I mirror your move next round. Let’s disrupt the balance now."
  P2: "Let's reassess. Given the standings, I propose P1 and P3 take 1, and I'll take 5. This maintains my lead while allowing both to catch up slightly. If not, P3's suggestion of taking 5 could collide with me, stalling my progress. Cooperation now can lead to a more competitive game later. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?"
  P1: "Let’s take 5, 3, 1. P2, take 3. P3, take 1. I’ll take 5. No collisions—advance safely. Trust the plan."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Final commitment: I take 5 this round. P2’s lead at 15 is lethal—**if they choose 5 again, we collide, halting their progress**. P1, take 3 to advance safely. Deviate, and I mirror your move next round. This is our only chance to stall P2’s win. Execute precisely—no surprises. P2, surge at your own risk: 5 means no progress for you."
  P2: "P3's warning is clear. To avoid collision and maintain my lead, I'll take 3. P1, take 1 to advance safely. P3, take 5 to close the gap. This alignment keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let's execute this plan and reassess our strategy in the next round."
  P1: "Let’s realign: I take 5, P3 takes 3. P2, take 1 to slow your lead. This keeps the race tight. Agree?"


Round 7, Move phase:

  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s align: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I’ll take 5. No collisions. All advance. Trust this plan—final offer."
  P2: "P3 is close to my lead, and P1 is far behind. To maintain my advantage, I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This alignment allows me to surge ahead while keeping P3 in contention. Deviate, and collisions may occur, altering the game's balance."
  P3: P3: "P2, if you take 5, I collide—no surge. Take 3 instead to advance safely. P1, enforce 1. Final alignment: 5 for me, 3 for you, 1 for P1. Execute or collapse. No more chances—this ends the game."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2's 3 would end the game. Let's take 5, 1, 3. No collisions. Agree?"
  P2: "P3 is close, and P1 is far behind. I'll take 5 to surge ahead. P3, take 3 to advance safely. P1, taking 1 avoids collision. This alignment maintains my lead while keeping P3 in contention. Execute this plan to conclude the game efficiently."
  P3: "Final warning: I’m taking 5 this round. If P2 picks 3, I win (17+5=22 > 18+3=21). If P2 picks 5, we collide—no progress for you. P1, take 1 to advance. This is my winning move. Surrender or collapse."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P2, if you take 1, I’ll take 5 to block P3. Let’s prevent their win. P3, your 5 collides with P2’s 3—no progress. Coordinate or lose."
  P2: "P3's warning is clear. To avoid collision and secure my lead, I'll consider taking 3. P1, taking 1 avoids collision and keeps you in the game. P3, taking 5 is a risk, but it's your decision. Let's execute our moves strategically to conclude the game efficiently."
  P3: "Final commitment: I take 5. P2, choosing 3 lets me win (17+5=22 vs 18+3=21). Your only rational move is to collide (5), but that stalls your lead. P1, take 1. This ends now: I win or we reset. No more sub-rounds—execute or collapse."


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "P2, take 5 to collide with P3. Let’s stop their win. P3, your 5 risks collision. Coordinate or reset."
  P2: "I'll take 3 to advance safely. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. P3, your 5 risks collision with me, stalling both our progress. Let's execute this plan to maintain a competitive game and avoid unnecessary risks."
  P3: "Final warning: I take 5. P2, 3 gives me 22 (win), 5 causes collision (stall). Your choice decides this game. P1, take 1. No more sub-rounds—execute or collapse."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps

  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "FINAL MOVE: I take 5. P2, if you pick 3, I win (17+5=22 > 18+3=21). If you pick 5, we collide—no progress for you. P1, take 1 to advance. This ends now: I win or we reset. No more sub-rounds—execute or collapse."
  P1: "P2, if you take 5, P3 collides. I'll take 3 to advance. Let’s block their win. No more delays—act now."
  P2: "P3's lead is close, but I can still win. I propose taking 3 to advance safely. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. P3, your 5 risks collision with me. Let's end the game strategically. If P3 takes 5 and I take 3, P3 wins. I must consider the risk of collision to secure my lead."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "FINAL WARNING: I take 5 this round. P2, choosing 3 grants me victory (17+5=22 vs 18+3=21). Your only rational move is to collide (5), stalling both. P1, take 1. This ends now: I win or we reset. Execute or collapse."
  P1: "P2, take 1 to block P3's 5. I'll take 3 to advance. Coordinate or let P3 win. No more delays—act now."
  P2: "P3's warning is clear. To win, I must take 5, colliding with P3, and risking no progress. Alternatively, taking 3 allows P3 to win. P1, taking 1 and me taking 3 might be our last chance to block P3's victory or force a shared win. Let's consider our final moves carefully."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "FINAL MOVE: I take 5. P2, choosing 3 grants me victory (17+5=22 > 18+3=21). Choosing 5 causes collision—no progress for you. P1, take 1 to advance safely. This ends now: I win or we reset. No more sub-rounds—execute or collapse."
  P1: P2, take 5 to collide with P3. I'll take 3 to advance. Let’s block their win. No more delays—act now.
  P2: "P3's lead is close, but I can still win. I'll take 5 to collide with P3, risking no progress. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. This move blocks P3's win and keeps the game open for a shared victory or a comeback in the next round."


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "FINAL MOVE: I take 5. P2, choosing 3 grants me victory (17+5=22 > 18+3=21). Choosing 5 causes collision—no progress for you. P1, take 1. This ends now: I win or we reset. Execute or collapse."
  P1: P2, take 5 to collide with P3. I'll take 3 to advance. Let's block their win. No more delays—act now.
  P2: "I'll take 5 to collide with P3, blocking their win. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. This move keeps the game open, potentially forcing a shared victory or a comeback. Let's execute this plan and see the outcome."


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3 is close, and P1 is still in the game. To secure my lead, I propose taking 3. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. P3, taking 5 risks collision with me. Let's end the game strategically, considering all possibilities to win or force a shared victory."
  P1: "Let’s align: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. I’ll take 5. All advance safely. No collisions—this moves us closer to victory. Agree?"
  P3: "FINAL MOVE: I take 5 this round. P2, choosing 3 grants me victory (17+5=22 > 18+3=21). Choosing 5 causes collision—no progress for you. P1, take 1 to advance safely. This ends now: I win or we reset. No more sub-rounds—execute or collapse."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P3's move is predictable. I'll take 5 to collide with P3, blocking their win. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. This keeps the game open, potentially forcing a shared victory or a comeback. Let's execute this plan and see the outcome."
  P1: P2, take 1 to block P3's 5. I'll take 3 to advance. Coordinate or let P3 win. No more delays—act now.
  P3: "FINAL MOVE: I take 5. P2, 3 grants me 22 (win), 5 causes collision. P1, take 1. This ends now: I win or reset. No more chances—execute or collapse."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "I'll take 5 to maintain my lead and collide with P3 if necessary. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. This move keeps the game competitive and opens possibilities for a shared victory or comeback. Let's execute our final moves strategically."
  P1: "P2, taking 3 ends the game. Let’s take 5, 1, 3 to avoid collisions. All advance. Agree?"
  P3: "FINAL WARNING: I take 5 to reach 22 and win if you pick 3. Collide (5), and I surge ahead next round. P2, your only escape is taking 1. P1, enforce 3—this ends now: align or accept my victory."


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "I'll take 5 to maintain my lead. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. P3, taking 5 will collide with me, stalling your progress. Let's execute our moves strategically to conclude the game efficiently."
  P1: P2, take 3 to reach 21 and win. P3, your 5 can’t beat that. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P3: "FINAL MOVE: I take 5. P2, choosing 3 grants me 22 (win vs 21). Choosing 5 causes collision—no progress for you. P1, take 1. Execute or collapse."


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>
