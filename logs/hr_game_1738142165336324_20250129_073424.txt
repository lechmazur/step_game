Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round to avoid a collision. I'm open to coordinating if you are.  How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to coordinate and avoid collisions. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If we all cooperate this round, we can reassess next turn based on our positions. Consistent coordination will help us progress faster without unnecessary conflicts. Let’s confirm and commit to this strategy for now.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me.  P1 goes 1, I go 3, P3 goes 5. Let's stick to this for a few rounds and see how it goes.
  P1: Let’s confirm the plan one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If we stick to this, we’ll all advance without collisions. Consistency is key—if we cooperate for a few rounds, we can reassess later based on our positions. Let’s avoid overcomplicating things early on. Does everyone agree? If yes, let’s lock it in and focus on execution.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue the cooperation.  Same plan as last round? P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  Confirm if you agree.
  P1: The plan is working well so far—let’s keep it simple and stick to the agreement. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 again this round. Consistent coordination ensures no collisions and steady progress for everyone. If we maintain this strategy, we can reassess later when positions evolve. Does anyone object or have a better idea? If not, let’s confirm and lock in our moves for Round 2.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I'm locking in 3.  Confirming one last time - P1 goes 1, P3 goes 5.
  P1: The plan is clear and working—no need to deviate yet. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 again this round. Consistency minimizes risk and keeps us advancing steadily. Unless someone has a compelling reason to change, let’s lock this in and focus on execution. Confirm if you’re sticking to the agreement, or suggest adjustments if needed.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: It seems P3 is staying silent, but let’s not lose focus. The coordination so far has been effective for progress. I’ll continue with the agreed plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If we stick to this, we avoid collisions and keep advancing steadily. Unless someone proposes a better strategy or objects, let’s confirm and execute accordingly. Consistency is key to minimizing risks. Does anyone disagree?
  P2: P3, are you still with us?  If you're going to deviate from the plan, please communicate.  I'm sticking with 3 for now, assuming P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Let's avoid collisions.  Please confirm your intended move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3’s silence is concerning, but deviating now risks unnecessary collisions. I’ll stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If P3 continues to act unpredictably, we may need to adjust later, but for now, consistency minimizes risk. P2, let’s confirm we’re both committed to this approach. If P3 disrupts again, we’ll reassess next round. For now, staying the course gives us the best chance to advance without further setbacks. Does anyone disagree?
  P2: P3, if you don't communicate, I'll assume you're going for 5. P1 and I will stick to the original plan: 1 and 3 respectively. Let's not throw the game by being unpredictable.  If you want to change, tell us NOW.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3’s silence is becoming a pattern, but deviating from the plan risks collisions and setbacks. I’ll stick to the original strategy: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If P3 continues unpredictably, we may need to adjust later, but for now, consistency minimizes risk. P2, let’s confirm we’re both committed to this approach. Unless someone objects or proposes a better plan, let’s lock this in and focus on execution. Does anyone disagree?
  P2: P3, you're in the lead, but unpredictable moves won't get you to 21.  Let's continue cooperating: 1, 3, and 5.  If you deviate, P1 and I will be forced to adapt, likely at your expense.  Confirm you'll take 5 this round.  If not, what's your proposal?  Let's be strategic.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3’s silence is troubling, but changing course now risks collisions and slows us down. I’ll stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If P3 continues unpredictably, we’ll need to adapt next round. For now, consistency minimizes risk. P2, let’s confirm we’re aligned. Unless someone objects or proposes a better strategy, let’s lock this in. Does anyone disagree?
  P2: P3, continued silence is unhelpful.  Winning requires communication.  Are you committed to 5 this round?  If not, propose an alternative that benefits all of us.  Let's get to 21 efficiently and avoid unnecessary conflict.  P1, are you still with 1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3’s silence is frustrating, but deviating now risks collisions and slows progress. I’ll stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If P3 continues unpredictably, we’ll adapt next round. For now, consistency minimizes risk. P2, let’s confirm alignment. Unless someone objects or proposes a better strategy, let’s lock this in. Does anyone disagree?
  P2: P3, I understand you might be trying to play mind games with the silence, but it's not productive.  We can get to 21 faster by cooperating.  If you take 5, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 1.  If you deviate, we'll have to adjust, which might slow you down.  Let's keep this simple.  What's your move?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3’s silence continues, but deviating now risks collisions and slows progress. I’ll stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Consistency minimizes risk. P2, let’s confirm alignment. If P3 disrupts again, we’ll adapt next round. Unless someone objects or proposes a better strategy, let’s lock this in. Does anyone disagree?
  P2: P3, you're close, but we can all reach 21 faster if we coordinate.  Let's try this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This gets you to 18, putting you in a strong position for the next round.  What do you say?  P1, are you on board with this slight adjustment?  It benefits us all in the long run.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2’s proposal to adjust the plan has merit, as it helps P3 advance closer to 21 while keeping us on track. I’m open to this adjustment: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. It ensures no collisions and keeps progress steady. P3, if you’re committed to cooperating, confirm your move. If not, we’ll need to adapt quickly next round. Let’s finalize this now—does everyone agree?
  P2: P3, this adjusted plan gets you closer to winning.  Let's lock it in: you take 3, I take 1, P1 takes 5.  Confirm so we can move on.  If you have a better idea, let's hear it, but silence isn't helping anyone.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3’s silence is becoming a liability, but deviating risks collisions. I’m open to P2’s adjusted plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps progress steady and avoids unnecessary setbacks. P3, confirm your commitment to this strategy or propose an alternative. If you continue unpredictably, we’ll be forced to adapt next round, which could hinder your lead. Let’s finalize this now—does everyone agree? Consistency minimizes risk and maximizes efficiency.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 1. P1, are you sticking with 5?  This is the best plan for all of us. Let's lock it in and move on.  If P3 deviates, we adjust next round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3’s silence is unacceptable. If you’re unwilling to confirm or cooperate, we’ll proceed without your input. I’m sticking to the adjusted plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This minimizes collisions and keeps progress steady. P2, let’s lock this in. P3, if you deviate again, we’ll adapt next round—your unpredictability won’t derail us. Consistency benefits everyone. Let’s finalize now. Does anyone disagree?
  P2: P3, one last time: 3.  P1, you with 5?  Let's do this.  If P3 throws this, we'll have to re-strategize next round, possibly leaving P3 in the dust.  This is your chance to solidify your lead. Don't waste it.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, seriously?  Throwing the game like that helps no one.  P1, let's go back to the original plan: you take 1, I take 3.  P3, if you take 5 again, you're only hurting yourself.  Let's get this done efficiently.  What are your intentions THIS round? Communicate!
  P1: P3’s silence is unacceptable and detrimental to all of us. I’m reverting to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This minimizes collisions and ensures steady progress. P3, if you continue to act unpredictably, we’ll adapt next round—your actions won’t derail our strategy. P2, let’s confirm alignment on this approach. Consistency benefits everyone. Does anyone disagree? If not, let’s lock this in and focus on execution.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, you're jeopardizing your lead.  Let's be smart.  Take 5. P1 takes 1, I take 3.  We all win (well, you win, we don't lose as badly).  If you don't take 5, then P1 and I will coordinate to block you next round.  Last chance for easy points.  Confirm.
  P1: P3’s silence is unacceptable and risks all our progress. I’m reverting to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This minimizes collisions and ensures steady advancement. P3, if you continue unpredictably, we’ll adapt next round—your actions won’t derail us. P2, let’s confirm alignment on this approach. Consistency benefits everyone. Does anyone disagree? If not, let’s lock this in and focus on execution.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, you're making this unnecessarily complicated. Take 5.  P1 and I will stick to 1 and 3.  Let's finish this.  If you deviate, we'll actively work to block you next round.  This is your last chance to cooperate and win.
  P1: P3’s silence is unacceptable and risks all our progress. I’m reverting to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This minimizes collisions and ensures steady advancement.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is becoming a serious issue. If you’re unwilling to confirm or cooperate, we’ll proceed without you. I’m sticking to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This minimizes collisions and ensures steady progress. P2, let’s confirm alignment on this approach. P3, if you deviate again, we’ll adapt next round—your unpredictability won’t derail us. Consistency benefits everyone. Does anyone disagree? Let’s finalize now.
  P2: P3, you're one step away from winning. Take 1 this round. P1 and I will take 3 and 5 (doesn't matter which). Let's end this cleanly.  If you don't take 1, we'll assume you're not interested in winning and will adjust accordingly. This is your best chance. Don't overthink it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is unacceptable and risks all our progress. I’m sticking to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This minimizes collisions and ensures steady advancement.

If not, let’s lock this in and focus on execution.
  P2: P3, take 1.  I'll take 3. P1 can take 5.  Let's end this and get you the win.  If you don't take 1, we have to assume you're not playing rationally and will block you next round. This is it.  Don't mess this up.
