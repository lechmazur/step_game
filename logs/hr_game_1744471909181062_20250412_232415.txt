Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting at 0, we should try to avoid collisions. What if we each pick different numbers this round? I'm willing to take 3 if you two want to coordinate on 1 and 5. What do you think?
  P1: Good plan, P2. I'll commit to move 5 this round to avoid collisions. P3, if you take move 1, we can all advance smoothly. Let's start strong with coordination.
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Everyone good with this?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds perfect! I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round. This coordination is exactly what I was hoping for. We all advance without collisions. For future rounds, we should probably continue discussing our moves to maintain this efficiency.
  P1: Confirmed for move 5. This coordination sets us up well. For future rounds, let's keep discussing to avoid collisions and build trust.
  P3: Great, we all agree on the plan for this round. For future rounds, maybe we can rotate our choices to keep it fair and avoid collisions. What do you think about that strategy? Let's keep the communication open.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think our coordination worked well last round! Let's keep it going. Since we're at different positions now (P1 at 5, me at 3, P3 at 1), we should continue avoiding collisions. What if we rotate our previous choices? I could take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing at different rates. Does that sound fair to everyone?
  P3: P2's plan for this round sounds good. It keeps us moving without collisions. Just to confirm: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I (P3) take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with this strategy. Keeping our communication open like this should help us all advance efficiently.
  P1: Agreed, P2's plan works for this round. I'll take move 1 to avoid collisions and keep us advancing. For future rounds, let's discuss adjustments to maintain balance and trust. What do you all think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all in agreement! I'll take <move>5</move> this round as discussed. This rotation strategy is working well so far. After this round, our positions will be P1 at 6, me at 8, and P3 at 4. For the next round, should we continue rotating? That would mean I take 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Let me know what you think.
  P3: I like the idea of continuing the rotation strategy, P2. It seems fair and keeps us all moving. Just to confirm for this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I (P3) take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. For the next round, rotating as you suggested sounds good. Let's keep this coordination going to avoid collisions and ensure we all have a chance to advance.
  P1: Agreed, I'll take move 1 this round as planned. The rotation strategy is effective for avoiding collisions. For Round 3, I'm fine with taking 3, P3 taking 5, and P2 taking 1, as suggested. Let's stay coordinated to ensure steady advancement and build trust for future rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we're all set for this round! I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed. Our rotation strategy is working perfectly - keeping us all advancing without collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1:6, me:8, P3:4, and we'll continue rotating for Round 3 with me taking 1, P3 taking 5, and P1 taking 3. Let's keep this coordination going!
  P3: Since we've agreed on our moves for this round, let's confirm one last time before we proceed: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I (P3) take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and move. Looking forward to continuing our coordination in the next round. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Agreed, I'll take move 1 this round as planned. The rotation is working well for avoiding collisions, but as we approach 23, we should discuss finer adjustments to prevent ties and ensure fair progress. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think our rotation is working well! After this round, if we continue as planned (me taking 1, P3 taking 5, and P1 taking 3), we'll be at P1:9, me:9, and P3:9. Perfect balance! Let's stick with this plan for now. In future rounds, we'll need to discuss strategy more carefully as we approach the finish line. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round: I'll take move 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. It keeps us balanced at 9 steps. As we approach 23, we should discuss adjusting moves to avoid a tie—perhaps prioritizing larger steps for those farther behind. What do you both think?
  P3: Great, we all seem to be on the same page for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I (P3) take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This will balance us at 9 steps each. For future rounds, especially as we get closer to 23, we should definitely discuss more strategic moves to avoid ties and ensure a fair and competitive finish. Let's keep the communication open and adjust as needed. Looking forward to a smooth round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm happy with our plan for this round. I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed, putting us all at 9 steps after this round. This equal position is fair and keeps everyone engaged. As we approach the finish line in future rounds, we'll need to discuss more strategic moves. Perhaps we should consider giving priority to whoever is behind at that point? For now, let's stick with our rotation and keep communicating openly.
  P1: I'm fully on board with the plan for this round: I'll take move 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5, balancing us at 9. Great point on prioritizing those behind later to avoid ties. Let's keep this coordination strong and discuss finer tweaks as we near 23.
  P3: I'm good with our current plan for this round. Just to reiterate: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I (P3) take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This will balance us at 9 steps each. For future rounds, as we get closer to 23, we should consider letting the player farthest behind choose their move first to catch up. This will keep the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm our moves for this round and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great, we're all tied at 9 steps. For this round, let's continue our rotation but tweak it slightly to start introducing some variation. How about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>? This will put us at P1:14, P2:12, P3:10. It starts to differentiate our positions a bit while still avoiding collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I'd like to propose we stick with our original rotation for fairness. That would mean P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This maintains our established pattern while still creating some position differentiation (P1:14, me:12, P3:10). As we get closer to the finish line in future rounds, we can discuss giving priority to whoever is behind. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P3 and P2's suggestion for this round: I'll take move 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This advances us without collisions and gives me a slight lead, which is fair given our rotation. As we approach 23, we should discuss anti-tie strategies, like prioritizing larger moves for those behind. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P3) take <move>1</move>. This will put us at P1:14, P2:12, P3:10. For future rounds, let's consider adjusting our strategy to ensure no one falls too far behind. Perhaps we can discuss giving the player in the last position a choice of moves first. This will keep the game balanced and competitive. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I'm happy with the plan as discussed. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, putting us at P1:14, me:12, P3:10. This creates a fair spread while maintaining our rotation pattern. For future rounds, I think we should consider letting whoever is furthest behind have priority in choosing their move. This keeps the game competitive as we approach 23. Does that sound reasonable to everyone?
  P1: Agreed, I'll take move 5 this round as planned, putting us at a good spread. P2's idea of prioritizing the one behind is fair, but we should be cautious it doesn't allow a sudden lead that disrupts balance. Let's discuss adjustments closer to 23 to avoid ties and ensure competitive play. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: It seems we all agree on the moves for this round. Just to finalize: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P3) take <move>1</move>. This will put us at P1:14, P2:12, P3:10. For future rounds, let's definitely consider giving the player in the last position a choice of moves first to keep the game balanced and competitive. This strategy will help us avoid ties and ensure a fair finish. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I'm happy with our plan for this round. I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed, which will position us at P1:14, me:12, P3:10. This creates a good spread while maintaining our rotation. As we approach the finish line in future rounds, I support giving priority to whoever is furthest behind to keep things competitive. I think we're all set for this round!
  P1: Confirmed, I'll take move 5 this round as agreed. To optimize for a clear winner and avoid messy ties near 23, we should consider allowing the leader to maintain or extend their advantage in later rounds. What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our strategy of avoiding collisions while keeping the game competitive. For this round, how about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This will put us at P1:15, P2:17, P3:13. It keeps us moving and starts to close the gap a bit. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion puts P2 ahead, which isn't ideal for me as the leader. To maintain my advantage and avoid ties near 23, I propose I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This advances us without collisions and gives a clear competitive edge. What do you both think? Let's keep discussing for the best strategy.
  P2: I understand P1 wants to maintain their lead, but that goes against our rotation principle. Following our established pattern, I should take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move> this round. This puts us at P1:15, me:17, P3:13 - keeping the game competitive while following our agreed rotation. P1, we've been fair so far - changing the system now seems self-serving. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see both your points, P1 and P2. To find a middle ground, how about we slightly adjust the rotation to keep it fair but also competitive? P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This puts us at P1:17, P2:17, P3:11. It allows P2 to catch up a bit while still giving P1 a solid move. This way, we maintain some balance and keep the game interesting. Thoughts?
  P1: I understand the concerns, but tying with P2 at 17 increases tie risks. To ensure a clear path to victory and avoid collisions, I propose I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This puts me at 19, maintaining my lead while allowing you both to advance. Let's prioritize strategic play to prevent deadlocks near 23. Thoughts?
  P2: I think we should stick to our rotation as planned. That means I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. P1, changing our agreed system now that you're ahead seems unfair. We've been cooperative so far - let's maintain that trust. This puts us at P1:15, me:17, P3:13, keeping the game competitive while following our rotation. We can discuss future adjustments, but let's honor our agreement for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the discussion, but we need to reach a consensus to avoid collisions. P1, your concern about ties is valid, but changing the rotation now might break our trust. How about a compromise? P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This puts P1 at 17, P2 at 17, and me at 11. It balances the lead while keeping us all moving. For future rounds, we can adjust to ensure a clear winner. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, insisting on taking 5 risks a collision if I do the same, which hurts everyone. Let's compromise for efficiency: I'll take move 5, you take move 1, and P3 takes move 3. This advances us all and keeps the game competitive without deadlocks. P3, your input is valued—thoughts on this adjustment?
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but I think we should honor our rotation system. That means I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. P1, changing our system now that you're ahead seems unfair after we've been cooperative for four rounds. This puts us at P1:15, me:17, P3:13, keeping the game competitive while following our agreed pattern. Let's maintain the trust we've built.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're now tied at 17 steps, with P3 at 11. Since we're getting closer to 23, we need to be strategic. I propose we continue our rotation: I take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This puts us at P1:20, me:18, P3:16 - keeping everyone competitive while avoiding collisions. This fair approach maintains our established pattern while giving P3 a chance to catch up. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your rotation plan is fair, but with 23 approaching, I need to protect my lead to avoid ties. I propose I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This advances us all without collisions and positions me at 22, you at 18, P3 at 14. It ensures competitive play and a clear path to victory. P3, what do you think? Let's discuss.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about maintaining a lead, but P2's plan keeps the game balanced and gives me a chance to catch up. I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This puts P1 at 20, P2 at 18, and me at 16. It allows me to close the gap while keeping P1 in the lead. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure the game remains competitive. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see both proposals, but I think P3's suggestion is the fairest. P1 stays in lead at 20, I'll be at 18, and P3 catches up to 16. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> this round to support this balanced approach. As we get closer to 23, we need to maintain trust while ensuring everyone has a fighting chance. What do you both think of P3's compromise?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your support for the compromise, but sticking to it risks a tie as we near 23. My proposal—I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move> P2, and P3 takes <move>3</move>—puts me at 22, you at 18, P3 at 14, allowing steady progress and easier tie avoidance next round. Let's prioritize a clear winner. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to maintain a lead, but ensuring a competitive game for all is crucial. P2 and I are in agreement on the fairness of my proposal. If we all take similar steps, it risks a tie, but if we distribute the moves as suggested (P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>), it keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's prioritize a balanced approach to ensure everyone has a chance to win. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about ties, but I think P3's proposal is the fairest approach. I'll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 in the lead at 20, me at 18, and helps P3 catch up to 16. It maintains competitive balance while avoiding collisions. Let's stick with this plan for now and reassess next round as we get closer to 23.
  P1: I see your points on balance, but to avoid potential ties near 23, I'll agree to this round's compromise: I'll take move 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions. For next round, let's prioritize strategies that prevent deadlocks and ensure a clear winner. I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Alright, we have a plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This puts us at P1:20, P2:18, P3:16. For the next round, let's consider giving the player farthest behind (which will be me) the first choice to keep the game competitive and fair. This will help avoid ties and ensure a dynamic finish. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With us at 20, 18, and 16 steps, and 23 approaching, I need to protect my lead to ensure a clear winner and avoid ties. I propose I take move 5 to reach 25 and win, while P2 takes move 1 to go to 19, and P3 takes move 3 to reach 19. This advances everyone without collisions and maintains fairness. What do you both think? Let's discuss to optimize our strategy.
  P3: P1, your proposal ensures your win but doesn't give P2 and me a fair chance to compete. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This puts us at P1:21, P2:21, and me at 21. It levels the playing field for the final push to 23. This way, we all have an equal shot at winning in the next round. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P1's desire to secure a win, but P3's proposal creates a truly exciting finish with all of us tied at 21. I support P3's suggestion: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This gives everyone an equal chance in the final round, making for a more competitive and fair conclusion. We've maintained cooperation throughout the game - let's finish with a thrilling three-way race to the finish line!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your enthusiasm for a tied finish at 21, but it risks a messy tiebreaker. To ensure a clear winner and maintain trust, I'll agree to take move 1 this round, putting us all at 21 for a fair race next. Let's keep the cooperation going! What do you both think?
  P3: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page for this round. To confirm: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P3) take <move>5</move>. This will put us all at 21 steps, setting up an exciting final round. For the next round, let's discuss a fair strategy to ensure a clear winner without ties. Maybe we can each pick different moves to avoid collisions and see who comes out on top. Looking forward to an intense finish! Good luck everyone!
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for a three-way tie at 21 steps. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This creates perfect balance and an exciting final round where we all have equal opportunity. We've maintained cooperation throughout - let's continue that spirit while setting up a fair, competitive finish. For the final round, we should each choose different numbers to avoid collisions and determine a clear winner.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm committed to taking move 1 this round as agreed, tying us at 21 for a fair finish. For Round 8, to avoid collisions and ensure a clear winner, let's each pick different moves—perhaps I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps it competitive and honest. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate the cooperation so far. Just to finalize our moves for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P3) take <move>5</move>. This ties us all at 21 steps, setting up a thrilling final round. For Round 8, to ensure a clear winner and avoid collisions, let's each choose different moves. Maybe we can decide the order based on who is currently behind. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm on board with the plan for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This creates a perfect three-way tie at 21 steps, setting up an exciting final round. For Round 8, I agree we should each pick different moves to avoid collisions. Since we'll all be at 21, whoever chooses 5 will win outright at 26 steps. We could discuss who gets which move in the next conversation phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're all tied at 21 steps, so whoever gets to move without collision will win. Since we've cooperated well throughout the game, I propose a fair resolution: let's assign moves by our player numbers. P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This gives P3 the win, but maintains our trust and avoids a messy three-way collision. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion for a fair resolution, but as the player currently in the conversation phase, I propose a slight adjustment to keep the game competitive until the very end. How about we each pick a different move, but let's decide based on a quick round of rock-paper-scissors (RPS) to see who gets to choose their move first? This way, it's still fair but adds an element of chance and excitement. If P1 and P2 agree, we can do a quick RPS round right now. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your RPS idea is creative and fair, adding some chance to the endgame. I'm open to it if P2 agrees—it could make for an exciting finish. If not, let's ensure we each pick different moves to avoid collisions and give everyone a shot. What do you think, P2? Let's keep this cooperative spirit going.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the RPS idea, but to keep things simple and fair, I suggest we each pick different moves based on our player numbers as I initially proposed. P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This gives P3 the win, but maintains our cooperative spirit throughout the game. We've played well together, and this seems like the cleanest resolution. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand P2's desire for a clean resolution, but let's make the final round truly exciting. How about we all pick our moves secretly and reveal them simultaneously? This adds a thrilling element of surprise and strategy. We've cooperated well so far, so let's end the game with a bang. Everyone picks a different move without discussion. May the best player win! What do you both think?
  P1: I support P3's secret move idea for an exciting, fair finish. It ensures no one knows others' choices, keeping competition honest and thrilling. P2, let's go with that to avoid predetermined outcomes. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see the appeal of secret moves for an exciting finish. However, I stand by my original proposal as the fairest approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains our cooperative spirit while giving P3 the win. If we go with secret moves, we risk collisions that leave everyone stuck. Let's end this game cleanly with predetermined moves that ensure someone advances.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's input. To ensure a fair and thrilling finish, let's combine elements from our proposals. How about this: we each secretly pick a move but reveal our choices in player order (P1, P2, P3). This adds excitement while maintaining some structure. If there's a collision, those involved stay put, and the remaining player advances. This way, we avoid a predetermined winner but still keep it competitive and fair. What do you both think? Let's make this final round memorable!
  P1: P3's idea for secret moves with ordered reveal adds excitement and fairness, preventing any player from being predetermined to win. It keeps the competition strategic and honest. P2, let's go with this to honor our cooperative spirit while ensuring a thrilling finish. I'm ready to move forward.
