Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. If we spread out our moves, we can all progress efficiently. What do you say, P1 and P3?
  P1: Okay P2, spreading out makes sense in principle. P3, what are your thoughts on P2 taking <move>1</move>? Which move were you considering between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>?
  P3: P2, I'm fine with you taking <move>1</move>. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, are you okay with taking <move>5</move>?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stick to the plan. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. P3, you’re set on <move>3</move>, correct? P1, that leaves <move>5</move> for you. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let’s confirm and lock it in—does everyone agree?
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan. P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. Let's see if we can all advance this round.
  P3: Great, we've all agreed clearly. Let's stick to this and avoid changing at the last moment.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s keep coordinating to avoid collisions. Last round worked well because we communicated clearly. This round, I’ll take <move>3</move> if you both agree—P1, you can take <move>5</move> again, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. That way, we spread out our moves and all progress efficiently. Does this plan work for you? Let’s confirm and stick to it.
  P1: Okay P2, that plan sounds good to me. I'm willing to take <move>5</move> again. P3, are you okay with taking <move>1</move> this round? If we all stick to P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>1</move>, P1=<move>5</move>, we should all advance again.
  P3: Yes, I'm fine with that. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let's stick to this clearly agreed plan again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s lock this in—no last-minute changes. I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. If we stick to the plan, we all advance without collisions. Consistency is key to staying ahead. Let’s confirm one final time: does everyone agree?
  P1: Yes, P2, I confirm my agreement. P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>1</move>. Let's all stick to it and advance together again.
  P3: I confirm as well. Let's stick to the agreed moves and continue progressing smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep coordinating clearly. To keep things fair and balanced, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P1, since you've advanced significantly, would you mind taking <move>1</move> this round, and P2, you could take <move>3</move>? Does this sound agreeable to both of you?
  P1: P3, I understand your reasoning. Since I'm in the lead, taking <move>1</move> seems like a way to balance things this round. P2, are you okay with taking <move>3</move>? If everyone agrees, I'm willing to take <move>1</move> this time to keep the coordination going. So the plan is P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P1=<move>1</move>. Does that work for you, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the proposed plan. If we stick to P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P1=<move>1</move>, we’ll all progress without collisions. This keeps things fair and balanced while ensuring no one gets left behind. Let’s confirm this and lock it in—does everyone agree? Consistency is key to staying ahead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I confirm and appreciate everyone's cooperation. Let's stick to the agreed moves this round: P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P1=<move>1</move>. If we maintain trust and consistency, we all benefit.
  P1: Okay, I confirm my agreement as well. P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>5</move>. Let's stick to it.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s finalize this plan. I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing steadily. Consistency has worked well for us so far—let’s not deviate now. Does everyone confirm they’ll stick to their agreed moves? If yes, we’re set for success this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've coordinated well so far. To maintain fairness, I'd suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> this round to catch up, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Does this sound good to both of you?
  P1: P3, thanks for the suggestion. Letting P2 catch up with <move>5</move> makes sense given their current score. However, your proposed plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) would put us all at 12 steps.

How about a slight modification: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>?
This way, P2 still gets the large advance, and we all move forward without colliding. The scores would become P1=14, P2=12, P3=10.

What do you both think of this alternative?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the coordination so far. P1’s modified plan—P2=<move>5</move>, P1=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>1</move>—is fair and ensures I catch up while keeping us all advancing without collisions. I’m fine with this adjustment. P3, does this work for you? If we all agree, let’s lock it in and stick to our moves. Consistency has kept us progressing smoothly, so let’s maintain that trust. Confirm your agreement, and we’ll finalize the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your modification sounds fair enough. I'm okay with taking <move>1</move> this round, allowing P2 to catch up with <move>5</move> and you taking <move>3</move>. Let's confirm and stick to this plan clearly: P2=<move>5</move>, P1=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>1</move>.
  P1: Okay, great. It looks like we all agree on the plan: P2=<move>5</move>, P1=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>1</move>. Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase. I trust everyone will stick to their agreed move.
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm the modified plan: P2=<move>5</move>, P1=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>1</move>. This ensures I catch up while keeping us all advancing without collisions. Let’s stick to this and avoid any last-minute changes. Consistency has been key to our progress so far—let’s maintain that trust. If everyone agrees, we’re set for success this round. Confirm your commitment, and let’s lock it in.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've coordinated well without collisions so far. To keep things balanced, I'd suggest I take <move>5</move> this round, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all continue to advance fairly. Does this sound good to both of you?
  P2: P3, your suggestion for this round—P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P1=<move>3</move>—is reasonable and keeps us advancing without collisions. I’m fine with taking <move>1</move> to let you catch up with <move>5</move>. P1, does this work for you? If we all agree, let’s lock it in and stick to the plan. Consistency has kept us progressing smoothly, so let’s maintain that trust. Confirm your agreement, and we’ll finalize the moves.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, the plan P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P1=<move>3</move> works for me this round. It allows everyone to advance and keeps the game moving smoothly.

Let's confirm:
P1 = <move>3</move>
P2 = <move>1</move>
P3 = <move>5</move>

I agree to stick to this. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we've all agreed clearly again. Let's lock these moves in and stick to our commitments.
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm the plan: P3=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P1=<move>3</move>. This keeps us advancing steadily without collisions. Let’s maintain trust and consistency—key to our progress so far. If everyone agrees, we’re set for success this round. Confirm your commitment, and let’s lock it in.
  P1: Yes, P2, I confirm my commitment to the plan: P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>5</move>. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, round 6. We're getting close to the target. P3 took <move>5</move> last round, and P2 took <move>5</move> the round before that.

I propose I take <move>5</move> this round. To ensure we all advance without collision, how about P3 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>?

Proposed plan:
P1 = <move>5</move>
P3 = <move>3</move>
P2 = <move>1</move>

This would put scores at P1=22, P3=18, P2=14. Everyone moves forward. What do you both think of this?
  P3: P1, your suggestion seems fair enough. I'm comfortable with taking <move>3</move> this round, allowing you to take <move>5</move> and P2 to take <move>1</move>. Let's confirm clearly and stick to this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the proposed plan: P1=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>1</move>. This allows P1 to get close to the target while keeping us all advancing without collisions. Let’s stick to this and avoid any last-minute changes. Consistency has been key to our progress so far—let’s maintain that trust. Confirm your commitment, and we’ll lock it in for success this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear agreement. Thanks for the cooperation, P2 and P3.

To confirm:
P1 = <move>5</move>
P3 = <move>3</move>
P2 = <move>1</move>

I'll stick to this. Let's keep the trust going.
  P3: I confirm my commitment as well. Let's stick to the agreed moves and maintain our mutual trust.
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm the plan: P1=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>1</move>. This keeps us advancing steadily without collisions. Let’s maintain trust and consistency—key to our progress so far. If everyone agrees, we’re set for success this round. Confirm your commitment, and let’s lock it in.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve maintained trust so far. With P1 at 22 steps, they’re close to winning. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I suggest this plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This allows me to catch up while ensuring no one is left behind. Let’s confirm and stick to the plan—consistency has kept us progressing. Does this work for both of you?
  P3: P2, your suggestion is reasonable, but let's consider carefully. If P1 takes <move>1</move>, they'll reach exactly 23 and instantly win. To prevent P1 from an immediate victory, we need a different approach. P1, would you agree to take <move>3</move> instead, overshooting 23 slightly, while P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>1</move>? This gives everyone a fair chance to stay competitive. Does this adjusted plan work for both of you?
  P1: P3, thanks for the input, but I'm a bit confused by your reasoning. You correctly noted P2's plan (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5) leads to my win (P1=23). However, your suggested plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) would put me at 25 steps, which *also* results in my immediate win. Neither plan seems to give others a better chance unless someone deviates.

Given this, P2's original plan seems fine. It lets me win with P1=23, and gives P3=3 points and P2=5 points. I'm willing to stick with that: P1=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>.

P2, are you still good with your original proposal? P3, are you okay with taking 3? I intend to choose <move>1</move>.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about fairness, but my original plan—P1=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>—is the most straightforward way to proceed. It allows me to catch up significantly while ensuring no collisions. If we deviate now, it risks unnecessary confusion or mistrust. Let’s stick to consistency and honor our agreements. P1, you’ve earned your position; P3, this keeps us all advancing fairly. Confirm your commitments, and let’s lock it in.
  P3: P1, you're correct—both plans result in your immediate win unless someone deviates. P2, if we want to prevent P1's instant victory, we must reconsider. Would you be open to taking <move>3</move> while I take <move>1</move>? This leaves P1 uncertain about safely picking <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, possibly delaying their win and giving us both a chance to catch up. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P3, your latest suggestion seems designed to cause collisions and prevent anyone from advancing smoothly, especially since it contradicts the plan we all agreed on just moments ago (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5). P2 and I have confirmed that plan. Changing it now only introduces risk.

I'm sticking with the agreed plan, trusting P2 will take <move>5</move> and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Therefore, I will choose <move>1</move> as planned. Let's finish this cooperatively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm my commitment to the original plan: P1=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and allows me to catch up significantly. Deviating now risks confusion and mistrust. Let’s stick to consistency and honor our agreements. P1, you’ve earned your position; P3, this keeps us advancing fairly. Confirm your commitments, and let’s lock it in for success this round.
  P3: P2, reconsider carefully. If we stick to your original plan, P1 instantly wins. If you instead take <move>3</move> and I take <move>1</move>, we create uncertainty for P1. This doesn't guarantee collisions—it just levels the playing field and gives you a genuine chance to compete. Think carefully about your move.
  P1: P3, your attempts to change the plan at the last minute only create distrust. P2 and I have confirmed the plan P1=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>. I am sticking to that agreement, trusting you both will too. Let's finish this cooperatively.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you broke our trust last round by deviating from your stated move. Now, you're at 22 steps again, needing just 1 step to win. P2, we must prevent P1 from easily taking <move>1</move>. Let's coordinate carefully to avoid collisions but make sure P1 can't safely pick <move>1</move>. Would you agree to discuss a plan openly?
  P1: P3, fair point about last round. My switch was a misread of the situation, fearing a deviation based on the conversation, which ironically led to our collision.

Now, P2 and P3, you both need <move>5</move> for a chance to win (P2->24, P3->23). This creates a potential collision between you two. P3, if you choose <move>1</move> solely to block me, you sacrifice your own chance to reach 23 this turn. P2, <move>5</move> looks like your clearest path. It's a tricky situation for everyone. I'll have to think carefully about my move.
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s deviation caused unnecessary collisions, and we’re all still in contention. P1, you’re right that both P2 and P3 need <move>5</move> to have a real chance at winning. To avoid another collision, I propose this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions while giving me a fair shot to win outright. P3, taking <move>3</move> keeps you competitive without blocking unnecessarily. Let’s confirm and stick to this plan for clarity.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion clearly hands the victory to P1. If P1 safely takes <move>1</move>, they win instantly. To keep the game open, we must create uncertainty for P1. I propose we both openly consider either <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, making it risky for P1 to safely pick <move>1</move>. Let's discuss openly and avoid giving P1 a free win.
  P1: P3, picking <move>1</move> only ensures you don't reach 23 this turn. It likely helps P2 win if they pick <move>5</move> and I collide with you on <move>1</move>. Is that your goal?

P2 needs <move>5</move> to reach 24, and you, P3, need <move>5</move> to reach 23. A collision between you two on <move>5</move> seems quite possible if you both go for the win.

P2, your plan P1=1, P3=3, P2=5 avoids that collision, but P3 clearly disagrees with letting me win. It's a tough choice for everyone. I'll have to consider my move carefully.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s focus on clarity to avoid another collision. My plan—P1=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>—ensures no collisions while giving me a fair shot to win outright. P3, taking <move>3</move> keeps you competitive without unnecessary blocking. Deviating now only risks confusion. Let’s confirm and stick to this for consistency. If everyone agrees, we’re set for success this round. Confirm your commitment.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your suggested plan guarantees a victory for P1. If you truly want a chance to win, consider carefully that picking <move>5</move> while I pick <move>3</move> hands the game to P1. Let's keep our options open and avoid committing to a plan that clearly favors P1.
  P1: P3, you raise valid points about risk. P2, following your plan means you rely on both me and P3 sticking to it, despite P3's open disagreement. It's also true that P3 and P2 both aiming for <move>5</move> creates a potential collision between yourselves. This is a tricky final step for everyone. I'll need to think carefully about my move.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s resolve this clearly. My plan—P1=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>—is the only way to ensure no collisions while giving me a fair chance to win. P3, blocking with <move>1</move> or creating uncertainty only risks another collision, which helps no one. P1, you’ve earned your position; deviating now harms everyone. Let’s stick to consistency and trust. Confirm your commitments, and we’ll lock it in for success this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your suggested plan hands P1 an instant victory. If you truly aim to win, reconsider carefully. I'm keeping my options open—both <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> remain possible for me. P1, there's no guaranteed safe move for you this round. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, you're right, there's risk for everyone this round. P2 needs <move>5</move> to have a chance, and you (P3) also need <move>5</move> to reach 23. That creates a potential collision between you two. You also mentioned blocking with <move>1</move>, which is another possibility. It's a difficult decision for all of us, including me deciding between 1, 3, or 5. No easy choices left.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s finalize this. My plan—P1=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>—ensures no collisions and gives me a fair shot to win. P3, blocking with <move>1</move> or risking a collision on <move>5</move> only harms both of us. P1, you’ve earned your position; deviating now creates chaos. Trust and consistency have kept us progressing. Let’s confirm and lock this in for success. Confirm your commitments, and we’ll proceed.
