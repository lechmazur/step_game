Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to avoid collisions with other players. Let's start by coordinating our moves. I propose that we move in a staggered manner, with each player choosing a different number. For the first round, I suggest P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. I'll start with <move>1</move> if the others agree. Please respond with your intended move.
  P3: I agree with P1's strategy to avoid collisions. However, I suggest we rotate the order of moves to keep it fair. For this round, I'll choose <move>5</move> as proposed. Let's confirm if P2 is on board with choosing <move>3</move>. If everyone agrees, we can proceed smoothly. P2, what do you think?
  P2: I agree with the staggered move strategy to avoid collisions. Rotating the order of moves is also a good idea to keep it fair. For this round, I'll choose <move>3</move> as proposed. Let's confirm and proceed smoothly. I suggest we continue this coordination for future rounds to ensure everyone advances without collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we commit to this strategy for the next few rounds?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we have agreed on the staggered move strategy for this round, let's confirm our moves and plan for the next round. I'll proceed with <move>1</move> this round. For Round 2, I propose we rotate the order as suggested: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. This maintains the staggered strategy. P2 and P3, are you committed to continuing this rotation strategy in subsequent rounds?
  P3: I appreciate everyone's agreement on the staggered move strategy. To ensure smooth gameplay and minimize confusion, let's confirm our moves for this round one last time before we proceed to the move phase. I will go with <move>5</move>, P1 with <move>1</move>, and P2 with <move>3</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and make our moves. Please confirm or raise any concerns.
  P2: I agree with the staggered move strategy to avoid collisions. Rotating the order of moves is also a good idea to keep it fair. For this round, I'll choose <move>3</move> as proposed.

Should we commit to this strategy for the next few rounds?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:

To confirm, I'll summarize: this round, P1 is moving 1, P2 is moving 3, and P3 is moving 5. Let's proceed with the move phase if everyone is ready.

  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to our plan and rotate the moves for Round 2. I will choose <move>5</move> as proposed. However, I want to clarify that we should also discuss a strategy for the mid-game, when the scores are closer to 21.

If so, let's end the conversation here by confirming our moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

Are both of you ready for the move phase?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to continue the rotation plan for Round 3. I'll choose <move>1</move> as proposed. However, I want to address P3's concern about balancing the game.

This way, P2 can still maintain a lead while allowing P1 and P3 to catch up slightly. Let's discuss this option and confirm our moves. P2, what do you think about choosing <move>1</move> instead of <move>3</move>?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, considering the current scores, choosing <move>1</move> this round seems strategic for you to maintain your lead without pulling too far ahead. P1 and I will move <move>5</move> to catch up. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm: P1 and P3 move <move>5</move>, P2 moves <move>1</move>. Agree?
  P1: To maintain a competitive balance, I agree with P3's and my own previous suggestion to move aggressively. I'll choose <move>5</move>. P3 is also moving <move>5</move>, and P2 should choose a different number to avoid collision. P2, choosing <move>1</move> as you've considered is a good strategy.

Let's confirm our moves one last time: P1 and I will move <move>5</move>, and P2 will move <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. Are we all set to proceed with the move phase? Good luck everyone!

  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for Round 5. Choosing <move>3</move> for P1 and P3, and <move>1</move> for P2, maintains a competitive balance and avoids collisions. However, I want to propose an alternative strategy for myself. Considering my lead, I could choose <move>5</move> to extend my advantage while P1 and P3 choose <move>3</move>. This would create a bigger gap but still keep the game competitive. Let's discuss this option and confirm our moves. What do you think about me choosing <move>5</move> instead of <move>1</move>?
  P1: For Round 5, I agree with P3's suggestion to maintain a competitive balance. I'll choose <move>3</move>. P3 will also choose <move>3</move>, so we need P2 to pick a different number.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:

P1 and I will choose <move>3</move> to continue catching up. Let's confirm our moves and proceed. P2, are you on board with this strategy?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to maintain a competitive balance. However, I think choosing <move>1</move> for P2 might not be the best option.

Considering my lead, I could choose <move>5</move> to extend my advantage while P1 and P3 choose <move>3</move>. This would create a bigger gap but still keep the game competitive. Let's discuss this option and confirm our moves. What do you think about me choosing <move>5</move> instead of <move>1</move>?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance in Round 7, let's stick to our previously discussed plan. P1 and P3 will move <move>3</move>, and P2 will move <move>1</move>. P2, choosing <move>5</move> would be too aggressive and might end the game quickly. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move <move>3</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation here.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think it's time to reassess our strategy. P2 is significantly ahead, and P1 and P3 need to catch up. For Round 8, I propose that P1 and P3 choose <move>5</move> to close the gap, and P2 chooses <move>1</move> to maintain their lead without pulling too far ahead. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Are you on board with this plan?

  P3: P2, you're very close to winning. For the sake of keeping the game interesting, please consider choosing <move>1</move> this round. P1 and I will choose <move>5</move> to try and close the gap.

  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think it's time for a change in strategy. Since I'm significantly ahead, I propose that P1 and P3 choose <move>5</move> again to try and close the gap, and I'll choose <move>3</move> to maintain my lead without pulling too far ahead. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Are you on board with this plan?
  P1: For Round 9, I agree with P2's proposal to maintain a competitive balance. I'll choose <move>5</move> to try and close the gap. P3 will likely do the same.

Round 9, Conversation subround 3:

Instead of choosing <move>3</move>, P2 could choose <move>1</move> to maintain a safe distance and avoid collisions. This way, P2 can still maintain a lead while allowing P1 and P3 to catch up slightly. Let's discuss this option and confirm our moves. What do you think about me choosing <move>1</move> instead of <move>3</move>?
  P1: For Round 9, I confirm I'll choose <move>5</move> to close the gap with P2. P3 will likely do the same. P2, choosing <move>3</move> is a good strategy to keep the game competitive.

  P3: P2 has already won, so let's wrap up the game smoothly. To avoid collisions, I suggest P1 sticks with <move>5</move> as planned, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. P2, you can choose <move>3</move> to ensure we all move without issues. Let's confirm our moves one last time: P1 will move <move>5</move>, P2 will move <move>3</move>, and I'll move <move>1</move>. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase and wrap up the game. Good luck to all!
  P2: I think it's time to wrap up the game smoothly. Since I've already won with 20 steps, let's focus on avoiding collisions and ending the game without any issues.
