Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. What do you think?
  P3: I'm good with that, P1. Let's try it.
  P2: I'm okay with the proposed plan. I'll take 3 steps, assuming P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed with that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all on board with the plan. Let's stick to it and see how it goes.
  P3: Sounds good.
  P2: I think the initial plan is solid. Let's proceed as agreed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm sticking to the plan and will take 1 step this round. Let's keep this coordination going.
  P3: Okay, let's all stick to the plan for this round.
  P2: I think the initial plan is solid. Let's proceed as agreed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm sticking to the plan and will take 1 step this round. Let's keep this coordination going.
  P3: Okay, let's all stick to the plan for this round.
  P2: "I think the initial plan is solid. Let's proceed as agreed."


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue our coordination. I'll take 1 step again this round. P2, you take 3, and P3, you take 5. Agreed?
  P3: Sounds good, P1. I'll take 5 again.
  P2: "I agree with the plan. I'll take 3 steps this round, assuming P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed as planned."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's stick to the plan again this round. I'll take 1 step, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. It's working well so far, let's keep it up!
  P3: Okay, sounds good. I'll take 5 again.
  P2: I will take 3 steps in this round, as per the initial plan, while P1 takes 1 step and P3 takes 5 steps. This maintains coordination and avoids collisions, allowing all of us to progress without setbacks. In future rounds, I will consider adjusting my move to position myself for an early win, but for now, sticking to the plan is the most prudent approach.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going. I'll take 1 step again this round. P2, stick with 3, and P3, continue with 5. This strategy is working well for all of us. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, sounds good. I'll take 5 again.
  P2: "I think we can optimize our progress by adjusting our steps this round. How about I take 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This way, I can make a bigger jump, and P3 can still advance. In future rounds, we can switch roles to ensure everyone gets a chance to make larger steps. What do you think?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I'm open to adjusting our steps as P2 suggested. Let's try P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and I'll stick with 1 this round. This could help us all advance more efficiently. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'm good with P2's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round.
  P2: I decide to take 5 steps in round 2, advancing from 3 to 8.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I'm fine with the new plan. I'll take 1 step this round. Let's see how it goes.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 3 this round.
  P2: I decide to take 5 steps in this round, moving from my current position of 3 to 8. This is based on the agreed plan where P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. I will proceed with this choice, keeping in mind the potential risks of collision if another player also chooses 5 steps. However, I am relying on the coordination among players to avoid such conflicts.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's keep the momentum going. I suggest I take 1 step again, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we can all continue to advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I'm good with that, P1. Let's stick to the plan for this round.
  P2: "I think we can optimize our progress by having me take 5 steps this round to reach 13, while P3 takes 3 steps to reach 11, and P1 takes 1 to reach 3. In the next round, we can adjust our moves accordingly. What do you think?" <move>5</move>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm open to P2's suggestion for this round. I'll stick with 1 step to reach 3. Let's see how it goes.
  P3: Okay, I'm good with P2's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round.
  P2: To confirm, I'll take 5 steps this round to reach 13, and P3 will take 3 steps to reach 11. Then, in the next round, I'll take 5 to reach 18, and P3 takes 3 to reach 14. This way, we avoid choosing the same number in consecutive rounds and minimize the risk of collision. P1, you can continue taking 1 step each round. Let's stick to this plan to ensure smooth progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm fine with P2's plan for this round. I'll take 1 step to reach 3. Let's stick to the plan and see how it goes.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 3 this round as planned.
  P2: "I think we should proceed as planned. P2, if you take 5 to reach 18, and I take 3 to reach 11, then in the next round, I can take 5 to reach 16, and then 3 to reach 19. Alternatively, if P2 takes 5 to reach 18, and I also take 5 to reach 18, we can share the victory. Either way, it's acceptable."


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm sticking with 1 step this round to reach 3. Let's follow P2's plan and see how it goes.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 3 this round as planned.
  P2: "I think a good strategy is for P2 to take 5 in Round 3 to reach 13, and P3 to take 3 to reach 11. Then, in Round 4, P2 can take 5 to reach 18 and secure the win, while P3 takes 3 to reach 14. This way, we avoid choosing the same step size and can progress efficiently."


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I'm sticking with 1 step this round to reach 3. Let's follow P2's plan and see how it goes.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 3 this round as planned.
  P2: I think we should proceed as planned. P2, if you take 5 steps in Round 3 to reach 13, and then 5 steps in Round 4 to reach 18, while P3 takes 3 steps in Round 3 to reach 11, and then 3 steps in Round 4 to reach 14, we can avoid collisions and ensure that P2 wins this round. This seems like a solid strategy. What do you think, P3?

  P2: "I agree with P1's plan. I'll take 1 step this round to reach 4, allowing P2 to take 5 and reach 18, and P3 to take 3 and reach 14. This seems like an efficient way to conclude the game."
  P3: P2, you're supposed to take 5 to win this round. Why did you say you'd take 1? This makes no sense. I'm taking 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P2, you need to take 5 steps this round to reach 18 and win as planned. Please confirm you'll stick to the strategy. P3, you're set to take 3 steps to reach 14. Let's finish this smoothly.
