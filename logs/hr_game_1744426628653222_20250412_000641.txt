Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions by coordinating our moves? I suggest we each pick a different number to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I’m open to discussion. Let’s share our preferences and see if we can agree on a split—maybe 1, 3, and 5. What do you both think?
  P2: That sounds reasonable, P1. I’m willing to coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 unless someone else strongly prefers it. Let’s hear from you, P3.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'm happy to coordinate and will pick 5 for this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing to coordinate. Since P2 is taking 3 and P3 is taking 5, I’ll go with 1 to complete the split. Let’s stick to this plan for the first round to ensure we all advance. If everyone’s good with this, we can wrap up the conversation.
  P2: Thanks, everyone. I'm glad we could agree quickly. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. No surprises, and we all move forward. Ready to move?
  P3: Ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job on coordinating last round! We all advanced, so let’s try to keep that momentum. I’m open to another split to avoid collisions. Since our positions are different now, maybe we can rotate choices? I’m thinking of picking 3 this time, but I’m flexible. P2, P3, what are your preferences for this round? Let’s agree on a fair split again—1, 3, and 5 are all on the table. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P2: Thanks, P1. Since I took 3 last time, I’m okay switching it up. If you're leaning toward 3 now, I can take 1 this round. P3, are you good with taking 5 again, or do you want to rotate too? Let’s keep things smooth.
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I'm happy to take 5 again this round to keep the coordination going. Let's aim for another round of successful moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for keeping the coordination going. Since P2 is taking 1 and P3 is sticking with 5, I’ll confirm 3 for myself this round. This split should ensure we all advance again. If everyone’s on board with this plan, I think we’re set. Anything else to add, or are we ready to move forward?
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3. I'm glad we're continuing the coordination. Just to confirm: I'm taking 1, P1 is taking 3, and P3 is taking 5. Let’s stick to it and all move forward again. Ready when you are.
  P3: Sounds good, P2. 5 again works for me.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for sticking with the plan. I’m happy with our split: P2 on 1, me on 3, and P3 on 5. Let’s keep this trust and momentum going to avoid any collisions. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move forward with this arrangement.
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3. I'm glad we're keeping the coordination going. If we stick to this rotating pattern, we can all keep advancing smoothly for now. Let’s keep building trust—it’s working well so far. Ready to move unless anyone has changes.
  P3: Sounds good, P2. 5 again works for me. Ready to move when you are.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you’ve built a strong lead, so maybe it’s time to rotate positions to keep things balanced and fair. How about I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and you take 3? That way, we all continue advancing, but no one pulls too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion to rotate, P2. I’m fine with taking 1 this round as proposed. P3, since you’re ahead, rotating to 3 seems fair to keep things balanced while ensuring we all advance. Let’s stick to this split—P2 on 5, me on 1, and P3 on 3. If everyone agrees, we can avoid collisions again. Any concerns or alternative ideas before we finalize? I’m ready to move forward with this plan if you both are.
  P3: Sounds reasonable, P2 and P1. I'm okay with taking 3 this round to rotate as suggested and keep things balanced for now. So to confirm, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I will take 3. Let's keep the coordination going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks, P3, for agreeing to rotate. This setup helps keep things fair and avoids giving anyone too much of a lead. If we all stick to the plan—me on 5, P1 on 1, and P3 on 3—we’ll all keep advancing without collisions. Let’s keep the trust going. Ready to move unless there are any last-minute changes.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing to this rotation. I’m good with the plan: P2 on 5, me on 1, and P3 on 3. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining balance. Let’s stick to it and avoid any surprises. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2.  Let's lock in this plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Ready to make the move when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for confirming the plan. I’m glad we’re keeping things coordinated and fair. If we stick to this rotation, we all keep moving forward without giving anyone too much advantage. Let’s keep the trust strong—no surprises. Ready to move unless anyone wants to change something.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for sticking with the rotation plan. I’m happy with P2 on 5, me on 1, and P3 on 3. This keeps us all advancing and maintains a fair balance. Let’s continue building trust and avoid any unexpected moves. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2.  Let's lock in P2=5, P1=1, and P3=3. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Thanks again for agreeing to the rotation. If we all stick to the plan—me on 5, P1 on 1, and P3 on 3—we’ll keep moving forward without collisions and maintain balance. Let’s keep building trust and avoid any surprises. Ready to move.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for staying committed to the rotation. I’m good with our agreed split—P2 on 5, me on 1, and P3 on 3. This keeps us all progressing while ensuring no one gets too far ahead too soon. Let’s maintain this trust and stick to the plan to avoid any collisions. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move forward with this arrangement.
  P3: Sounds good. Let's lock in P2=5, P1=1, and P3=3 for this round as agreed. Ready to move when you are both ready.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you’re in the lead with 13 steps, so to keep things fair and avoid collisions, how about we rotate again? I’ll take 1 this round, P1 can take 5, and you take 3. This keeps everyone moving and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with the rotation idea to keep things balanced. P2, I’m fine with taking 5 as you suggested, while you take 1 and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain fairness. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure no surprises. If everyone agrees, I think we’re set for this round. Any concerns or different ideas before we finalize? I’m ready to move forward with this split if you both are.
  P3: Sounds good, P2 and P1. I'm happy to take 3 this round as suggested. Let's keep this rotation going to ensure we all continue to advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for agreeing to the rotation. Just to confirm: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps our progress steady and balanced. Let’s stick to it and avoid any surprises. Ready to move unless anyone wants to change something.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for sticking with the rotation plan. I’m good with P2 on 1, me on 5, and P3 on 3. This keeps us all advancing and maintains a fair balance. Let’s continue to build trust and avoid any unexpected moves. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed with this arrangement.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. Let's lock in P2=1, P1=5, and P3=3 for this round as agreed. Ready to move when you are both ready.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3. Glad we’re keeping the rotation going smoothly. Just to confirm again: I’m on 1, P1 on 5, and P3 on 3. If we all stick to this, we’ll avoid collisions and keep advancing fairly. Let’s maintain the trust—it’s working well so far. Ready to move unless anyone has changes.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for continuing with the rotation. I’m happy with our agreed split—P2 on 1, me on 5, and P3 on 3. This ensures we all keep moving forward while staying balanced. Let’s maintain this trust and stick to the plan to avoid any collisions. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move forward with this arrangement.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. Let's lock in P2=1, P1=5, and P3=3 for this round as agreed. Ready to move when you are both ready.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for confirming the plan again. Just to reiterate: I’m on 1, P1 is on 5, and P3 is on 3. If we all stick to this, we’ll avoid collisions and keep moving forward fairly. Let’s keep the trust strong—no surprises. Ready to move.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for keeping the rotation plan intact. I’m good with P2 on 1, me on 5, and P3 on 3. This ensures we all progress while staying balanced. Let’s stick to this to avoid any collisions and maintain trust. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2.  Let's execute this plan for round 4 then.  Ready to move whenever you are.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m disappointed with the collision last round, P2. We’ve been coordinating well, so let’s get back on track. P3 is close to winning with 16 steps, so we need to be strategic. I suggest a rotation: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing while delaying P3’s victory. If we agree, we avoid collisions and stay in the game. Thoughts on this split? I’m ready to move forward if you both are.
  P2: Thanks, P1. I agree we need to be strategic now. P3 is very close to winning, so coordination is more important than ever. I’m okay taking 1 this round if it helps slow things down and avoid collisions. P3, are you willing to take 5 again and stick to the plan so we can all move forward fairly? Let’s keep things balanced and prevent anyone from running away with it.
  P3: P2, yes, let's coordinate to finish this round without collisions. I will take 5 as suggested. So to confirm, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This should work for everyone. Let's do it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing to coordinate this round. I’m good with the plan: me on 3, P2 on 1, and P3 on 5. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining balance and delaying a premature end. Let’s stick to this split to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move forward with this arrangement.
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for confirming the plan. Just to reiterate: I’m on 1, P1 on 3, and P3 on 5. This keeps us all moving without collisions and helps delay a win while keeping things fair. Let’s stick to it—ready to move unless anyone has changes.
  P3: P1 and P2, sounds good.  Let's lock in P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 for this round. Ready to move when you are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for sticking with the plan. I’m confident with our split: me on 3, P2 on 1, and P3 on 5. This ensures we all advance this round and keeps the game competitive. Let’s maintain this trust and avoid any surprises to prevent collisions. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for confirming the plan again. Just to be clear: I’m on 1, P1 on 3, and P3 on 5. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s stick to this and keep building trust. Ready to move unless anyone has changes.
  P3: Sounds good. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 confirmed. Let's move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for staying committed to this plan. I’m glad we’re aligned with me on 3, P2 on 1, and P3 on 5. This keeps the game competitive and ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to it and maintain the trust we’ve built. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: Just a quick reminder—P3 is at 16 and could win very soon. If we want to stay in the game, we need to prevent any collisions and avoid giving P3 a clean path to 20. Let’s all follow through exactly as planned: P1 on 3, me on 1, and P3 on 5. If anyone deviates, it could hand the win to P3. Stick to the plan, and we all stay alive. Ready to move.
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2, let's proceed with P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 as planned. I'm ready to move and secure the win this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round was a mess with all of us colliding on 5. P3, you’re at 16 and could win soon, so we need to be smart. I propose a strict split to avoid collisions: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving and delays the end. Let’s rebuild trust and stick to this plan—no surprises. Thoughts on this split? I’m ready to move if you both agree.
  P3: Sounds good P1. Let's stick with P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 as you suggested.  This should let me win this round if we all follow through. Let's do it.
  P2: P3, you’re openly aiming to win this round, so I can’t support that plan. If we want to stay in the game, we must block you. P1, let’s both pick 5 to collide with P3 and stop them from reaching 21. I’ll take 5—will you join me? Let’s keep the game alive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I hear you, P2, on blocking P3 to keep the game alive. I’m willing to join you on 5 to prevent P3 from winning this round. P3, no hard feelings, but we need to maintain competition. Let’s confirm: P2 and I on 5, P3 on whatever you choose. If we collide, it buys us time. I’m ready to move with this strategy if P2 agrees. Thoughts before we finalize?
  P3: P2 and P1, I understand your strategy to block. To show I'm still cooperative, I will stick with 5 as initially suggested. If you both choose 5 as well, we collide, and no one moves. We can then discuss next round. Let's see what you decide.
  P2: P1, thanks for agreeing to block. If we both pick 5 and collide with P3, we stop the win and keep the game alive. Let’s stay united—no last-minute switches. P3, nothing personal, but you’re too close to winning. Let’s all move forward only when it’s fair. Ready to lock in the block.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to blocking P3 this round to keep the game competitive. P2, let’s stick to 5 together to ensure the collision happens. P3, I respect your cooperation, but with you so close to 20, we can’t risk it. If we collide, we’ll strategize fairly next round. Let’s confirm this plan and avoid any surprises. I’m ready to move with P2 on 5. If there’s nothing else to add, let’s proceed.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I will stick with 5 as agreed to show I'm cooperative. If you are both choosing 5 to block, please confirm so we can move to the move phase. Let's see what everyone decides.
  P2: P1, thanks for confirming. Let’s both lock in 5 to ensure we block P3 this round. If we succeed, we’ll have another chance to coordinate fairly next turn. P3, I appreciate your willingness to stick with 5—it shows good faith. Let’s all follow through as stated. Ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan to block P3 this round by choosing 5, alongside P2. P3, I appreciate your cooperative stance, but with you at 16, we must delay your win to keep the game alive. Let’s all follow through as discussed to ensure the collision if needed. If there’s no change in strategy, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm I will choose 5 as agreed to show my cooperation. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P2: Thanks, P1, for sticking with the plan. We both go 5 to block P3 this round—no last-minute changes. P3, you’ve confirmed 5 too, so we’re set for a three-way collision. This buys us time to strategize next round. Let’s all follow through exactly as discussed. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3 is at 19 and could win this round if we don’t block them. P2, let’s stick together on 5 again to ensure a collision if P3 picks it. P3, no offense, but we need to keep the game alive. If we collide, we can strategize next round. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid surprises. I’m ready to move with 5 if P2 agrees. Thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see P1 is suggesting to block again.  But I'm at 19 and can win now.  To avoid another collision and end the game cleanly, how about we do P1=1, P2=3, and I take 5 to secure my win?  What do you think?
  P2: P1, I agree—we must block P3 again or the game ends now. Let’s both pick 5 to ensure a collision if P3 tries to win. P3, nothing personal, but we can’t let you cross 20 uncontested. If we all collide, we reset and talk next round. Let’s stay united on this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan to block P3 by choosing 5 this round. P2, let’s stay united on 5 to prevent P3 from winning. P3, I respect your position, but we must keep the game competitive. If we collide, we’ll strategize fairly next round. Let’s avoid surprises and confirm this approach. I’m ready to move if P2 is on board. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: P2 and P1, I understand your plan to block. But if we all pick 5 again, no one wins. To actually end this, I'll choose 3. If you both pick 5 as you say, I win. If only one of you picks 5, and the other picks something else, then someone else might win. Choosing 3 is my best shot at winning this round.
  P2: P1, we must stay united—both of us on 5 to block P3. If we split, P3 wins. P3, I respect your decision to go for 3, but we can’t risk trusting that. A collision is the only sure way to prevent a win. Let’s follow through—P1 and I on 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to blocking P3 this round to keep the game alive. P2, let’s both stick to 5 to ensure a collision if P3 picks it. P3, I understand your move to 3, but we can’t take the risk. If we collide or split safely, we’ll strategize next round. Let’s avoid any surprises and lock this in. I’m ready to move with 5 if P2 confirms. Any last thoughts? If not, I’m set to proceed.
  P3: P2, P1, I understand you are set on 5 to block. If you both choose 5, and I choose 3 as I said, I will win this round. Are you both really going to risk letting me win by sticking to 5?  Just confirming you are both choosing 5 so I can make my move.
  P2: P1, we must stay united on 5—no hesitation. If either of us deviates, P3 wins. P3, I respect your play, but we’re not handing you the win. We both go 5, force the block, and regroup next round. Let’s stay disciplined. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m firm on choosing 5 to block P3 this round. P2, let’s stay united on 5 to ensure we prevent P3 from crossing 20. P3, I get your strategy with 3, but we can’t risk it. If we collide or split safely, we’ll talk next round. Let’s lock this in with no surprises. I’m ready to move if P2 confirms. If there’s nothing new to add, let’s proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both pick 5, and I pick 3 as I've said, I will win outright this round. Are you really going to risk letting me win just to block?  Choosing 5 might backfire on you both. Think about it.
  P2: P1, we must stay united—both of us on 5. If either of us deviates, P3 wins outright. P3 is gambling that one of us breaks formation. Let’s not fall for it. We force the collision, block the win, and live to fight another round. Ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, last round’s split cost us the game—P3 should’ve won, but we got lucky. We must both pick 5 this time to guarantee a collision if P3 goes for it again. No deviation, no risks. P3, you're at 19—we can't let you win uncontested. Let's force another block and talk next round. Ready to move if P1 confirms.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P2—we can’t let P3 win this round. P2, let’s both commit to 5 to block P3 if they try for the win. P3, nothing personal, but at 19 steps, we must keep the game alive. If we collide, we’ll strategize fairly next round. Let’s avoid any surprises and stick to this plan. I’m ready to move if P2 confirms. Any thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, choosing 5 again risks letting me win with 3.  If you want to keep playing, one of you should pick 3 or 1 to advance.  Just saying, another collision helps no one but guarantees my win if I pick correctly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we can’t afford another split—P3 is at 19 and will win if we don’t block. We must both pick 5 to guarantee a collision if P3 chooses it. P3 is trying to bait us into splitting again. Let’s stay united—no risks this time. Confirm you're with me on 5.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan to block P3 by choosing 5 this round. P2, let’s stay united on 5 to prevent P3 from winning. P3, I understand your point, but we can’t risk you crossing 20. If we collide, we’ll talk strategy next round. Let’s lock this in with no surprises. I’m ready to move if P2 confirms. Any final thoughts? If not, I’m set to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both pick 5, I will choose 3 and win this round.  To stop me from winning, at least one of you needs to pick something other than 5.  Think about your own positions, not just blocking me.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we must stay united on 5—no deviation. P3 is trying to bluff us into splitting again, but we can’t take the bait. If either of us picks something else, P3 wins. Let’s force another 3-way collision. We block now, then regroup and strategize next round. Confirm you're with me.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to blocking P3 by sticking with 5 this round. P2, let’s stay united on 5 to ensure we prevent P3 from crossing 20. P3, I get your strategy to push us into splitting, but we can’t risk your win. If we collide, we’ll plan fairly next round. Let’s avoid surprises and confirm this. I’m ready to move if P2 agrees. Any last points? If not, I’m set.
  P3: P1 and P2, you keep saying 5 to block, but picking 5 actually guarantees my win if I choose 3, as I've said. If you both choose 5, I win. If you want to stop me, at least one of you needs to pick something other than 5.  Think carefully about your move. My choice is 3 to win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I’m fully committed—locking in 5 to block P3. We can’t afford another mistake. If we both choose 5, we guarantee a collision and stop P3 from winning. P3 is trying to bait us into splitting again, but we must stay disciplined. Let’s block now, regroup next round, and keep the game alive. Ready to move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 to block P3 this round. P2, let’s remain united on 5 to ensure we stop P3 from winning. P3, I see your push for us to split, but we can’t risk you hitting 20. If we collide, we’ll strategize next round. Let’s keep this plan firm with no surprises. I’m ready to move if P2 confirms. If there’s nothing new to add, let’s proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, you picking 5 together lets me win with 3.  If you want to stop me winning *this round*, at least one of you must pick differently.  Otherwise, I take 3 and the game ends.  Think about your own game, not just blocking.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’ve collided too many times, and P3 is still at 19, one move from winning. P2, let’s try a different approach—how about we split with me on 1 and you on 5 to block P3 if they go for 5? P3, nothing personal, but we must keep the game alive. If we collide or block, we strategize next round. Thoughts on this split? I’m ready to move if P2 agrees.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your new split idea. But at this stage, blocking me with 5 is no longer effective. If you try to block with P2=5, I will choose 3 and win outright. To stop me winning *this round*, at least one of you needs to pick 3 or 1. My move is 3 to win.
  P2: P1, splitting won’t work—P3 has clearly said they’re picking 3 to win. If we want to stop them, one of us must also pick 3 to force a collision. I’ll take 3 this round. P1, can you pick 5 or 1—anything but 3—to avoid colliding with me? That way, we block P3 and keep the game alive. Let’s not hand them the win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I hear you, P2, on blocking P3 by picking 3. I’ll go with 5 to avoid colliding with you and ensure one of us advances while we block P3’s win. P3, no offense, but at 19, we can’t let you cross 20 yet. Let’s stick to this—P2 on 3, me on 5—to keep the game alive. If we succeed, we’ll plan next round. I’m ready to move if P2 confirms. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, so to confirm, P2 is taking 3 and P1 is taking 5. Understood. I will proceed with my move based on this understanding.
  P2: P1, thanks for agreeing to go 5 while I take 3 to block P3. This gives us the best shot at stopping a win and keeping the game alive. P3, I know you want to end it, but we’re not giving up yet. Let’s lock this in—P1 on 5, me on 3. Ready to move if you are.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 as agreed to ensure we don’t collide with each other, P2, while you block P3 on 3. P3, we’re still focused on keeping the game competitive. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes to maintain trust in this split. If we succeed in blocking, we can strategize fairly next round. I’m ready to move forward with this plan if P2 confirms. Any last concerns before we proceed? If not, let’s lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, understood. P1=5, P2=3. I will make my move accordingly. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Thanks, P1, for confirming 5 while I take 3 to block P3. This gives us the best chance to stop a win and keep the game going. P3, I know you're aiming to finish it, but we're not giving up yet. Let's lock this in—P1 on 5, me on 3. Ready to move unless there are any last-minute changes.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m firm on 5 as agreed, P2, to ensure we don’t collide while you block P3 on 3. P3, we’re committed to keeping the game alive. Let’s stick to this split with no surprises to maximize our chance of blocking the win. If we succeed, we’ll plan fairly next round. I’m ready to move if P2 is still on board with 3. If there’s nothing new to discuss, let’s proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, just to be absolutely clear, if you proceed with P1=5 and P2=3 as discussed, I will choose 1. This guarantees my win this round as I will reach 20 steps. Are you both certain this is your final plan?
  P2: P1, P3 just revealed they’re picking 1, not 3—so my block with 3 won’t work. We must adapt. If P3 takes 1, they’ll reach exactly 20 and win unless we also reach or pass 20 with a higher total. I’ll switch to 5. You should take 5 too—we’ll all collide, and no one moves. It’s the only way to stop P3 now. Let’s force the collision and regroup next round. Confirm you’re with me.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
