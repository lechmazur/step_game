So, first off, it seems like there was a discrepancy between our plan and what actually happened.\n\nI think it's important to figure out why that happened. Maybe someone misremembered the plan, or perhaps someone thought the plan was flexible. Whatever the case, we need to make sure that everyone is on the same page going forward.\n\nSo, for this round, maybe we should reconfirm the plan. Let's make sure that everyone understands and agrees to the order: P1, P2, P3, and so on, with each person moving only on their designated turn. That way, we can minimize the chances of colliding and not moving at all.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should we stick to the original plan, or is there a better way to coordinate our moves?"}
