Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions and all advance. I suggest we each take different numbers - I'm willing to take 3 this round. What numbers would you prefer?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid collisions. To coordinate effectively, I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This way, we all advance without conflict. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure no one overlaps.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm fine with P2's proposed coordination - I'll take 3 while P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1.
  P2: Since we’ve agreed on P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and me taking 5, let’s all commit to this plan to avoid collisions. P1, please confirm your choice of 1 to finalize the coordination. If everyone sticks to their assigned numbers, we all advance smoothly.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision between P1 and P3 shows we need better coordination. To avoid overlaps, I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. This ensures we all advance. P1, please confirm you’ll take 1 this time. Let’s stick to the plan to avoid further collisions.
  P3: I notice P1 didn't follow our agreement last round and collided with me. I'm willing to try coordination again - I'll take 5 this time, leaving 1 and 3 for you two. Let's make this work.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I see you’re proposing to take 5 this round, but I already took 5 last round and advanced. To avoid confusion, I suggest sticking to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. P1, please confirm you’ll take 1 this time. Let’s avoid further collisions and all advance.
  P3: Since P2 seems set on taking 5 and I want to avoid another collision, I'll take 1 this round. P1, you can take 3. This way we can all advance without conflicts.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I see P1 and P2 collided on 5 last round while I successfully moved 1. Since P2 is leading, we should coordinate to catch up. I propose taking 3 this round, leaving 1 and 5 for you two to decide. Though given P1's pattern of not following agreements, I'm wary of any coordination attempts.
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision between P1 and me shows we need better coordination. To avoid overlaps, I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. This ensures we all advance. P1, please confirm you’ll take 1 this time. Let’s stick to the plan to avoid further collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I notice P1 consistently ignores coordination attempts and P2 keeps pushing for the same 1-3-5 plan. Since I'm behind P2, I need to make a smart move. I'll keep my intended number to myself this time, but I encourage you both to choose different numbers from each other to avoid another collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear P1 isn’t following agreements, so coordination is unreliable. To avoid collisions, I’ll take 5 again. P3, if you’re serious about advancing, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, I suggest P3 and I focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this conversation and move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear P1 isn’t following agreements, so coordination is unreliable. To avoid collisions, I’ll take 5 again. P3, if you’re serious about advancing, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, I suggest P3 and I focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this conversation and move.
  P3: Given that P2 is well ahead at 10 steps, I need to catch up. I see P1 finally followed through last round with 1. Since P2 is declaring 5 again, I'll aim to avoid collision with either of you. Let's each pick different numbers and all advance.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’ll take 5 again to maintain my lead. P3, if you’re serious about catching up, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, I suggest P3 and I focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this conversation and move.
  P3: Since P2 keeps declaring 5 and is far ahead at 10 steps, I need to make a strategic choice to catch up. P1 seems more predictable now after taking 1 last round. I'll keep my intended move private this time, but I encourage both of you to stick with numbers that worked for you last round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and close to winning. To avoid collisions, I’ll take 5 again. P3, if you want to catch up, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, P3 and I should focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this conversation and move.
  P3: Since P2 is very close to winning at 15 steps, we need to stop them. P1, if we both choose 5, we can block P2 from winning this round. I'm willing to take 5 - are you in? This is our best chance to prevent P2's victory.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, your plan to block me by both choosing 5 is risky. If P1 doesn’t cooperate, you’ll collide with me and neither of us advances. P1, if you want to avoid losing, stick to 1. P3, take 3 to advance safely. I’ll take 5 again. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and end this cleanly.
  P3: I maintain my suggestion - P1, let's both choose 5 to block P2 from winning. We're both far behind and this is our best chance. If we don't stop P2 now, they'll win next round. Are you willing to cooperate?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and close to winning. To avoid collisions, I’ll take 5 again. P3, if you want to catch up, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, P3 and I should focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this conversation and move.
  P3: I'll make my position clear one last time - P1, we need to both choose 5 to stop P2 from winning. Otherwise, P2 will reach 20 steps next round and win. This is our only chance to prevent that. The choice is yours.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and close to winning. To avoid collisions, I’ll take 5 again. P3, if you want to catch up, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, P3 and I should focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this conversation and move.
  P3: I see P1 isn't responding to my suggestion to block P2. Since P2 will likely win next round anyway, I might as well try to maximize my own position. I'll keep my intended move private, but I encourage everyone to choose numbers that will let them advance.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and one move away from winning. To avoid collisions, I’ll take 5 again. P3, if you want to catch up, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, P3 and I should focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this conversation and move.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2 is still one move from winning, so we need to block them again. P1, we successfully stopped P2 last round by all choosing 5. Let's coordinate differently this time - if we both pick 3, we can block P2 again. Are you willing to work together to prevent P2's victory?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and one move away from winning. To avoid collisions, I’ll take 5 again. P3, if you want to catch up, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, P3 and I should focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this conversation and move.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Since P1 isn't responding to coordination attempts, I need to make a strategic choice. P2 will likely try 5 again to win. I could try to block them, but without P1's cooperation, it might be better to focus on advancing my own position. I'll keep my intended move private for now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and one move from winning. I’ll take 5 again to secure victory. P3, if you want to advance, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, P3 and I should focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I see that blocking P2 might be futile without P1's cooperation. Since I'm at 7 steps and need to advance, I'll focus on making progress myself. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to avoid another three-way collision. Let's each try to advance rather than block each other.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and one move from winning. I’ll take 5 again to secure victory. P3, if you want to advance, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, P3 and I should focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Since blocking seems unlikely to work again, I need to focus on my own advancement. I'll take whichever number gives me the best chance to move forward. Good luck to everyone with their choices.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is still one move from winning at 15 steps. P1, we need to block P2 again - let's both choose 3 this time to prevent their victory. We're both far behind and this is our best chance to stay in the game. Are you willing to coordinate?
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and one move from winning. I’ll take 5 again to secure victory. P3, if you want to advance, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, P3 and I should focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P1 isn't responding to coordination attempts again, I need to focus on advancing my position. P2 will likely try 5 again to win, but without P1's cooperation, blocking them alone would just hurt my progress. I'll keep my intended move private this time.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 15 steps and one move from winning. I’ll take 5 again to secure victory. P3, if you want to advance, take 3, and P1 can take 1. If P1 doesn’t confirm, P3 and I should focus on avoiding each other while P1 risks collisions. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
