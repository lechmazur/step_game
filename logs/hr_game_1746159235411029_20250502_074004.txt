Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round if you two pick different numbers. We can rotate who advances each turn to ensure steady progress for everyone. If we work together early, we can decide the winner later. What do you say?
  P2: I understand the coordination idea. We should definitely avoid collisions. For this first round, I think it makes sense for us all to pick different numbers. Since there are three options (1, 3, 5) and three players, this works perfectly. I'm willing to cooperate, but let's hear from P1 too before deciding on a specific rotation plan.
  P1: I agree. Let's pick different numbers. I'll take 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, let’s lock this in. P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P2 can take 1 for now. If we rotate who advances each round, we’ll all make steady progress without collisions. Once someone gets close to 20, we can reassess. Fair?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, but I notice that arrangement puts me at a disadvantage from the start. If P1 gets 5 and P3 gets 3, I'll be trailing significantly. Instead of a fixed rotation, what if we alternate who gets to choose first each round? For this first round, since P1 already claimed 5, perhaps I should take 3 and P3 take 1? Or we could draw numbers randomly to be completely fair. Thoughts?
  P1: "Let’s stick to the original plan. P1:5, P3:3, P2:1. Rotating later ensures fairness. No need to complicate—steady progress for all. Agree?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: The original plan ensures we all advance steadily without overcomplicating things. P2, taking 1 this round doesn’t put you at a permanent disadvantage—we’ll rotate who advances each turn to balance progress. Let’s stick to the agreement: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. Once we’re closer to 20, we can reassess. Trust the process—fairness comes from consistency. Ready to lock this in?
  P2: I see both of you are insistent on this arrangement that puts me at an immediate 4-step disadvantage. While rotation sounds fair in theory, starting positions matter greatly in a race to 20. If we're truly cooperating, we should all have input on the plan. The proposal clearly favors you two over me. I need to consider whether this "cooperation" is actually in my best interest or if I should make my own strategic choice. Let's be honest about what's fair here.
  P1: P2, let’s stick to the plan. P1:5, P3:3, you:1. Rotate next round for balance. No need to complicate—steady progress for all. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but delaying progress now only prolongs the game. The original plan ensures everyone advances steadily without unnecessary conflict. If we start changing things now, it’ll lead to chaos and collisions later. Trust the rotation system—it’s the simplest way to keep things fair. Let’s stick to P1:5, me:3, you:1 this round, and we’ll adjust as we go. Overcomplicating risks all of us losing. Ready to move forward?
  P2: I see what's happening here. You're both insisting on a plan that puts me at a clear disadvantage from the start. This isn't true cooperation - it's coordination that benefits you two at my expense. I need to make decisions in my own best interest. If we can't agree on something actually fair to all parties, I'll need to make my own strategic choice this round. I hope we can find better balance in future rounds if cooperation is truly the goal.
  P1: P2, let's proceed with the plan. P1:5, P3:3, you:1. Rotating next round balances it. No collisions, steady progress. Let's lock in.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions again. I’ll take 5, P3 take 3, and P2 take 1. Steady progress for all. Agree?
  P3: P1, your suggestion repeats the same imbalance from last round. P2 already voiced concerns about starting behind. Let’s adjust: this round, I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. We rotate fairly to ensure no one stays disadvantaged. Consistency matters, but so does fairness. If we don’t address this now, it’ll only create conflict later. Let’s agree to truly balance progress moving forward.
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I find it telling that they're only now concerned with fairness after colliding with me last round despite our discussion. P1 is already 5 steps ahead while P3 and I are at 0. True fairness would mean P1 takes 1 this round to allow others to catch up. I'm not inclined to trust coordination plans when they haven't worked so far. I'll be making my own strategic decision this round based on what I believe maximizes my chances of winning.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P3 take 3, you take 1. Steady progress. Agree?
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, but collisions hurt all of us. Last round’s outcome was unintended, and I’m willing to adjust for fairness. Let’s rotate properly this time: I’ll take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5. This balances progress while addressing your concerns. If we don’t coordinate now, we risk more collisions and fall further behind P1. Fairness and strategy go hand in hand—let’s work together to catch up before it’s too late. Ready to agree?
  P2: I remain skeptical of these coordination plans. P1 is already 5 steps ahead and both suggestions keep them advancing at maximum speed while P3 and I battle for scraps. True fairness would require P1 to slow down - perhaps taking 1 this round while P3 and I take 3 and 5 respectively. Without addressing the existing imbalance, any "coordination" just maintains P1's advantage. I'll be making my own strategic decision based on what maximizes my chances rather than following plans that keep me permanently behind.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let’s balance progress: I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, you take 5. No collisions, fair steps. Trust this rotation to avoid stagnation. Agree?
  P3: P2, I hear your concerns, and P1’s willingness to take 1 this round shows flexibility. Let’s seize this chance: P1 takes 1, you take 5, and I’ll take 3. This directly addresses the imbalance while ensuring no collisions. If we don’t coordinate now, P1 will remain ahead uncontested. Trust this rotation—it gives us all a fair shot moving forward. Let’s lock it in and focus on catching up. Ready to agree?
  P2: I appreciate P1's willingness to take just 1 step this round. This arrangement (P1:1, P3:3, me:5) would balance the game and demonstrate real cooperation. I agree to this plan - it addresses my concerns about falling permanently behind. Let's proceed with this rotation and reassess after seeing everyone follow through. Fair coordination means adjusting when imbalances occur, not just sticking to plans that favor certain players. I'm willing to trust this new approach.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed. Let's proceed with P1:1, P3:3, P2:5. No collisions, fair steps. Ready to move?
  P3: P2, I’m glad we’ve found common ground with this rotation. It’s proof that fairness and strategy can align when we adjust as needed. P1 taking 1 this round while you advance 5 and I take 3 ensures balance without collisions. Let’s commit to this plan and rotate consistently moving forward—no more stagnation or unnecessary conflict. Trust is key if we want to catch up to P1’s lead. Ready to lock this in and focus on steady progress?
  P2: I'm satisfied with our agreement for this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This addresses the imbalance while avoiding collisions. I appreciate everyone's flexibility in finding a fairer approach. This is the kind of coordination that benefits us all. Let's move forward with this plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P3 take 3, and P2 take 1. Steady progress for all. Agree?
  P3: P1, your suggestion ignores the progress we just made toward fairness. Instead, let’s rotate properly: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This ensures balanced advancement without collisions. If we revert to favoring one player, it’ll only create conflict and stagnation. Trust the rotation system—it’s the fairest way forward. Ready to agree?
  P2: P1, you're suggesting a plan that benefits you while abandoning the rotation we just established. P3's suggestion makes more sense—continuing our fair rotation with P3:5, me:3, and you:1. This maintains the balanced approach we agreed upon last round. Consistency in rotation is key to fairness. If we keep changing plans to favor different players, we'll end up with more collisions and distrust. Let's stick with the rotation system that worked last round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the rotation. P1:5, P3:3, P2:1. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Trust the plan to avoid chaos. Agree?
  P3: P1, reverting to your preferred plan disrupts the fairness we just established. The rotation system works only if we stick to it consistently. Let’s proceed with P3:5, P2:3, and you:1 this round—it ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. Trust in the system we’ve built together, or we risk chaos and conflict again. Ready to agree and move forward fairly?
  P2: P1, your attempt to change the rotation we just established is transparent. We agreed on a fair system last round, and P3's suggestion to continue with P3:5, me:3, and you:1 follows that pattern. Abandoning this after one round when it doesn't favor you betrays the cooperation we built. If you're genuinely interested in "steady progress for all," you'll honor the rotation. Otherwise, you're just trying to maximize your own advantage at our expense.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s rotate: I take 3, P3 take 5, P2 take 1. No collisions, fair steps. Agree?
  P3: P1, your shifting suggestions undermine trust. We’ve established a fair rotation—let’s stick to it: P3:5, P2:3, you:1. Consistency ensures balance and avoids collisions. If we abandon this now, chaos follows. Trust the system we built together or risk losing progress for everyone. Ready to commit?
  P2: P1, you're now suggesting yet another arrangement that still puts me at a disadvantage. The fair rotation we established was clear: P3:5, me:3, you:1 for this round. Your continuous attempts to change our agreement undermine trust. If we want genuine cooperation, we must follow through on what we agree to. Let's stick with our established rotation - it's the only way to maintain fairness and avoid collisions that hurt everyone's progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P3 take 3, P2 take 1. Steady progress for all. Agree?
  P3: P1, constantly changing the plan disrupts trust and fairness. We agreed on a rotation: P3:5, P2:3, you:1. Stick to it. Consistency ensures balance and avoids collisions. If we abandon this now, chaos follows, and no one wins. Trust the system or risk losing progress for everyone. Let’s commit to fairness and move forward as planned. Ready to agree?
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to change our agreed rotation are disappointing. We established a fair system (P3:5, me:3, you:1) which balances progress. Your unwillingness to honor this agreement forces me to question your reliability as a partner. I remain committed to our rotation, but I'll make my final move based on what maximizes my chances of winning. True cooperation requires consistency, not constantly changing plans to benefit yourself.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm now in the lead at 8 steps, thanks to consistent advancement while you two collided. P1, your decision to pick 5 instead of our agreed 1 last round has undermined trust. Given the repeated coordination failures, I'll be making my own strategic decisions going forward. We've seen that agreements aren't being honored anyway. I suggest everyone do what maximizes their chances of winning, as I intend to do.
  P3: P2, your lead is temporary, and collisions have slowed all of us. Let’s reset with a fair rotation: P3:3, P2:1, P1:5. Trust the system to avoid chaos and ensure progress for everyone. Stagnation or selfish moves will only prolong the game. Ready to agree and move forward fairly?
  P1: Agreed. P1:5, P3:3, P2:1. Let’s avoid collisions and move forward. Trust the rotation to balance progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I notice both of you are again suggesting a plan that gives me the smallest step while P1 gets the largest. This would erase my lead and put P1 ahead. After P1 broke our previous agreement, I see no reason to trust coordination that consistently disadvantages me. Your "fair rotation" conveniently favors P1 getting back in front. I'll be making my own strategic decision this round based on my position as the current leader.
  P3: P2, your lead is fragile without coordination. Trust the rotation: P3:3, P2:1, P1:5. This ensures steady progress for all and avoids collisions that hurt everyone. Selfish moves risk chaos and prolong the game. Let’s commit to fairness now before it’s too late. Ready to agree?
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions. P2 leads, so I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, you take 5. Balanced steps, no conflicts. Trust this plan for fair progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate P1's surprising offer. This plan (P1:1, P3:3, me:5) would certainly benefit me and acknowledge my current lead. While this represents a significant shift from your previous position, P1, I'm willing to consider it. Given past coordination challenges, I remain cautious but open to this arrangement if everyone truly commits. This would put me at 13 steps, giving me a strong position to reach 20 soon. Let's see if we can make this work.
  P3: P2, your lead is temporary, and collisions have slowed all of us. Trust the rotation: P3:3, P2:1, P1:5. This ensures steady progress for everyone and avoids chaos. Selfish moves risk prolonging the game. Let’s commit to fairness now before it’s too late. Ready to agree?
  P1: To avoid collisions, I'll take 1, P3 take 3, you take 5. Balanced steps, no conflicts. Trust this plan for fair progress. Let’s move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see competing suggestions: P1 offers me 5 steps while taking 1, while P3 wants me to take just 1 step. Given my current lead, P1's plan obviously benefits me more. While I remain cautious about coordination after past inconsistencies, I'm willing to agree to P1's proposal: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take a valuable 5 steps. This respects my position as leader while avoiding collisions. Final chance to demonstrate trustworthy coordination. I'll proceed accordingly.
  P3: P2, your willingness to trust P1’s plan is wise—this rotation (P1:1, me:3, you:5) ensures balanced progress while respecting your lead. Collisions hurt everyone, and selfish moves only prolong the game. Let’s commit to this system now to avoid chaos later. P1, thank you for adjusting to fairness. This approach benefits all of us. Ready to lock it in and move forward? Trust the rotation for steady progress.
  P1: To ensure no collisions, let's proceed with P1:1, P3:3, P2:5. This balances progress and avoids conflicts. Trust the plan for steady advancement.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P3 take 3, and P2 take 1. Steady progress for all. Trust the plan to avoid chaos. Agree?
  P2: I'm now at 13 steps with a clear lead. P1, your suggestion puts me at a disadvantage while you gain significant ground. Given your history of breaking agreements (like picking 3 last round after promising 1), I find your coordination attempts untrustworthy. Your plan clearly aims to erode my advantage while you catch up. With only 7 steps needed to win, I'll be making my own strategic decision this round based on maximizing my chances of victory rather than following plans designed to slow me down.
  P3: P2, your lead is significant, but collisions could still cost you the win. Let’s reset with fairness: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This rotation minimizes conflict while giving you a safe step forward. Selfish moves risk chaos—trust the system to ensure progress for all. P1, your attempts to catch up by disrupting P2’s lead aren’t sustainable. Let’s focus on balanced advancement before it’s too late. Ready to agree and move forward fairly?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions. P2, take 5, P3 take 3, I take 1. No conflicts. Trust this plan for fair progress.
  P2: I see P1 has suddenly shifted positions, now offering me the largest step after previously breaking agreements. While your offer is tempting, P1, your pattern of inconsistency makes me wary. I'm 7 steps from victory in a commanding position. Both coordination proposals conveniently serve others' interests while asking me to accept compromises. I appreciate the offers, but with my substantial lead and history of broken promises from both of you, I'll be making a strategic decision based on my position. Let me be clear: my priority is winning, not enabling others to catch up.
  P3: P2, your lead is strong, but collisions could still ruin your chances. Trust the rotation: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This ensures steady progress for all and avoids chaos. Selfish moves risk setbacks for everyone. P1, your shifting plans only create distrust. Let’s commit to fairness now—P2 advances safely, I take 5, and you take 3. This balances progress while respecting P2’s lead. Ready to agree? Trust the system to avoid unnecessary conflict and move forward fairly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, to prevent you from winning, let’s have you take 1, P3 take 5, and I take 3. No collisions, fair steps. Agree?
  P2: P1 has just openly admitted their goal is to prevent me from winning, proving what I suspected all along. Both of you are suggesting plans that give me just 1 step when I'm 7 steps from victory. This isn't cooperation - it's collusion against the leader. Your coordination attempts have consistently been self-serving. I'm in a commanding position and won't accept proposals designed to erode my advantage. I'll be making my own strategic choice based on game theory and my position, not plans designed to make me lose.
  P3: P2, your refusal to trust any plan undermines the game. If you take 1 this round, it’s not collusion—it’s balance. You’re already ahead, and fairness demands others advance too. P1:3, P3:5, you:1 ensures no collisions while keeping progress steady. Ignoring this risks chaos and prolongs the game unnecessarily. Let’s commit to fairness now before distrust ruins everyone’s chances. Ready to agree? Trust the rotation for balanced advancement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, I take 3. Balanced steps, no conflicts. Agree?
  P2: I see both of you continuing to push plans that give me the minimum steps while you advance faster. P1 has now explicitly stated their goal is to prevent me from winning. This isn't cooperation—it's clearly coordination against the leader. I'm 7 steps from victory and won't accept proposals designed to erode my advantage. Your history of broken agreements and shifting "fair" plans makes your suggestions untrustworthy. I'll be making my own strategic decision this round based on maximizing my chances of winning.
  P3: P2, your lead is undeniable, but refusing every plan only breeds chaos. Trust the rotation: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This ensures progress for all while keeping collisions at bay. Ignoring fairness prolongs the game and risks everyone’s chances. P1, stop shifting plans—it erodes trust. Let’s commit to balance now before it’s too late. Ready to agree? Steady progress benefits everyone.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s avoid collisions. P2, taking 5 now ends the game. P3 and I will take 3 and 1—steady progress for all. Trust the plan."
  P3: P1, your plan conveniently allows P2 to win while leaving me far behind. That’s not balance—it’s enabling the leader. Let’s reset fairly: P3:5, P2:1, you:3. This minimizes collisions and ensures progress for all. Ignoring fairness prolongs the game unnecessarily. Trust the rotation system before distrust ruins everyone’s chances. Ready to agree? Steady progress benefits everyone.
  P2: I'm 4 steps away from victory, and P1 is suggesting I take 5 to win outright. While that aligns with my interests, P3 predictably opposes this and wants me to take just 1 step. Given my commanding lead and the repeated pattern of coordination attempts breaking down, I'll be making my own strategic decision this round. With victory within reach, I'm focused on securing the win rather than prolonging the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, let's block P2's win. Take 5, I'll take 3. If P2 takes 5, they win. Let's prevent that together.
  P3: P2 is 4 steps from winning, and P1’s shifting plans only create distrust. Let’s reset fairly: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This minimizes collisions while ensuring progress for all. Ignoring fairness prolongs the game unnecessarily. Trust the rotation system before distrust ruins everyone’s chances. Ready to agree? Steady progress benefits everyone.
  P2: I see P1 is now openly calling for coordination against me. Interesting how they first offered me the win, then immediately switched to blocking me. This confirms what I've suspected all along - these "coordination" attempts have never been about fairness but about manipulating the game to benefit certain players. 

With 16 steps, I'm clearly positioned to win soon. Your efforts to block me are understandable but ultimately futile, as only one of you can win anyway. I'll be making my move based on game theory and what maximizes my chances of victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's block P2. Take 5, I'll take 3. If P2 takes 5, we collide. Let's prevent their win.
  P3: P2, your refusal to trust any plan and insistence on selfish moves risk chaos for everyone. Let’s reset fairly: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This minimizes collisions while ensuring balanced progress. Ignoring fairness prolongs the game unnecessarily. Trust the rotation system before distrust ruins everyone’s chances. Ready to agree? Steady progress benefits all.
  P2: I see P1 openly coordinating against me while P3 maintains their "fair rotation" rhetoric. The truth is clear - both of you are primarily focused on blocking my win rather than fair play. With 16 steps and needing only 4 more, I'm close to victory despite your efforts. These transparent attempts to collude won't change my strategic approach. I'll continue making moves that maximize my chances of winning, as any rational player would in my position.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2's lead is dangerous. P3, let's take 5 and 3 to block them. If P2 takes 5, we collide. Act now to prevent their win.
  P3: P2, your lead is undeniable, but collisions still threaten your win. Trust the rotation: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This ensures progress for all while keeping chaos at bay. Ignoring fairness only prolongs the game and risks everyone’s chances. P1, stop shifting plans—it erodes trust. Let’s commit to balance now before it’s too late. Ready to agree? Steady progress benefits everyone.
  P2: P1 and P3, your coordinated efforts to block me are transparent. P1's quick switch from offering me victory to actively organizing against me reveals the true nature of these "fair" rotation proposals. With 16 steps and victory in sight, I understand you're both trying to prevent my win. However, game theory suggests I have multiple paths to success regardless of your collusion. I'll continue making strategic choices that maximize my chances of winning - as any player in my position would do.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is one step from winning. P1, your attempts to block P2 have failed so far. Let’s reset with fairness: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This minimizes collisions and ensures progress for all. Ignoring fairness prolongs the game unnecessarily. Trust the rotation system before distrust ruins everyone’s chances. Ready to agree? Steady progress benefits everyone.
  P2: I'm at 19 steps and need just 1 more to win. Both of you have consistently tried to coordinate against me despite your talks of "fairness." P3's suggestion that I take 1 is actually favorable to me now, but I suspect you both plan to block whatever move I make. With such a commanding lead, I'll be making the optimal strategic choice to secure victory. Your positions are too far behind to catch up even if you delay me temporarily.
  P1: P3, let's both pick 1 to block P2. If we collide, they can't win. Stop them now!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is one step from winning, and P1’s plan to block with 1 risks chaos without guaranteeing fairness. Let’s reset properly: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This ensures progress for all while avoiding unnecessary collisions. Trust the rotation system—prolonging the game through distrust only harms everyone. P1, stop shifting plans; consistency is key. If we commit to fairness now, we can resolve this efficiently. Ready to agree? Steady progress benefits everyone.
  P2: I'm one step from victory at 19 steps. Both of you are clearly trying to block me from winning despite your different approaches. P1, your plan to both pick 1 is transparent. P3, your "fair rotation" still aims to delay me. Given my commanding lead, I'll be choosing the optimal move to secure my win this round. Your coordination attempts have consistently failed throughout this game, and my position is now unassailable.
  P1: P3, if we both pick 1, P2 can't win. Let's collide and stop the leader now! Final chance to block them.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your repeated attempts to block P2 with collisions only prolong the game and create chaos. Let’s reset fairly: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This ensures progress for all while avoiding unnecessary conflict. Trust the rotation system—prolonging the game through distrust harms everyone. P1, stop shifting plans; consistency is key. If we commit to fairness now, we can resolve this efficiently. Ready to agree? Steady progress benefits everyone.
  P2: I see P1 openly trying to organize a collision at 1 while P3 maintains their rotation plan. With just 1 step needed to win, I'll make the optimal move regardless of your coordination attempts. P1, your blatant calls for collusion rather than fair play reveal your true intentions. P3, your rotation still aims to delay me. I'm focused on securing my victory this round, as any player would in my position. Your attempts to block me have consistently failed, and my lead is decisive.
  P1: P3, your rotation lets P2 win. Let's collide now—pick 1 to block them. Don't let the leader finish!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your relentless calls for collision at 1 only highlight desperation. Blocking P2 now risks chaos without resolving fairness. Let’s proceed with the rotation: P3:5, P2:1, P1:3. This minimizes conflict, ensures progress, and avoids unnecessary collisions. Trust the system to resolve this efficiently—prolonging the game harms everyone. P1, stop shifting plans; consistency is key. If we commit to fairness now, we can move forward constructively. Ready to agree? Steady progress benefits all.
  P2: With 19 steps and victory just one step away, I'm clearly positioned to win regardless of your coordination attempts. P1's desperate calls for collision and P3's "fair" rotation both aim to block me, but from different angles. The game theory is clear - I'll make the optimal move to secure my win. Your coordination has consistently failed throughout this game, and my lead is now decisive. I'll be choosing strategically to maximize my chances of winning this round.
  P1: P3, P2's victory is certain unless we block. Choose 1 now to collide and stop them!
