Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to maximize progress without collisions. I’ll take 1 this turn. Let’s agree P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward. Next turns, we can rotate choices to ensure consistent advancement. Trust the plan?
  P2: P1, your plan sounds good in theory, but it benefits you the most in the long run by setting a precedent where you go first. How about this: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. We all still advance, but it changes the order. If we truly rotate, it shouldn't matter, right?
  P3: Both proposals seem risky. I propose a flexible approach: if P1 confidently takes 1 and P2 sticks with 5, I'll choose 3 this turn to avoid clashing. However, if it looks like there’s a risk of our moves colliding, I might lean toward 5 for a faster boost. Let’s clarify our commitments now so we can each avoid stepping on the same move. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’ll accept your adjusted order for this turn to address your concern: I take 1, you take 5, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Let’s confirm this plan now so we can proceed. Next turns, we’ll rotate roles to ensure fairness. P3, are you aligned with this?
  P2: P3, are you okay with 3 this round? P1 seems agreeable to 1, and I'm committed to 5. We just need your confirmation. If we all agree, we can move on.
  P3: I’m fine with the arrangement as discussed. Let’s lock in the order for this turn. I’m committed to following through as per our agreement unless any urgent adjustments come up.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, last round went smoothly. This round, I propose I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all moving and rotates the order. What do you both say?
  P1: P2's rotation idea maintains fairness. Let's stick to the agreed system: I'll take 5 (1→6), you take 3 (5→8), and P3 takes 1 (3→4). This avoids collisions and lets us progress steadily. P3, confirm you'll hold to 1? If so, we finalize this turn’s plan.
  P3: I'm agreeable to the plan as proposed, but let's lock our commitments now to avoid any collisions. I'll follow through as discussed—provided there are no last-minute changes. Please confirm your moves so we can proceed without risk.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, you've both confirmed. I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's get this round done.
  P1: Confirmed, I’ll take 5. Let’s proceed with the agreed moves to avoid collisions and keep advancing steadily. No changes from my end!
  P3: I confirm my commitment as previously discussed. Let's stick to our plan and lock in our moves without any last-minute changes. If any issues arise, now’s the time to speak up.


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll commit to 5 this turn to speed my progress. To avoid collisions, I urge you both to choose a move different from 5. Let's keep our moves distinct so we all advance smoothly.
  P1: P3, your plan makes sense. Let’s finalize: I’ll take 1 (6→7), P2 takes 3 (8→11), and you take 5 (4→9). This avoids overlaps and lets us progress safely. P2, confirm your commitment to 3? If yes, we lock this in.
  P2: P1, your plan sounds good. I'll commit to 3, confirming your suggestion. Let's lock this in and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I stand by my commitment to move 5 this round. However, I need firm, unchanging confirmations from both of you—if any adjustments occur, I'll be ready to adapt my strategy to secure the win. Let’s ensure our moves remain clear and collision-free as we move ahead.
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my choice of 1 this turn. P2 confirmed 3, and P3 is locked in at 5. Let’s finalize this plan to ensure no collisions: **1 (me), 3 (P2), 5 (P3)**. Any last objections? If not, we advance safely and set ourselves up for the next round. Stick to the agreement—collisions benefit no one.
  P2: P3, you seem overly cautious. We've all confirmed: 1 for P1, 3 for me, and 5 for you. Let's just stick to the plan and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes—collisions hurt us all. If you’re genuinely set on 1 and 3, please confirm now so we all remain on track. Clarity is key; I’m aiming to push ahead and secure the win, but I’ll adapt if you signal an unexpected shift.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’m locked in at **1** (6→7). P2 has committed to **3** (8→11), and P3 to **5** (4→9). This avoids all collisions—let’s stick to this plan. Any last-minute changes now risk derailing our progress. Trust the coordination; clarity ensures we all advance safely. No further discussion needed—proceed with the agreed moves.
  P2: I've already confirmed 3 multiple times, and so has P1 with 1. Let's just proceed with the moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2, your lead is concerning. Let’s block your path: I’ll take **5** (7→12). If P2 takes **3** (11→14) and P3 takes **1** (9→10), we avoid collisions while limiting P2’s proximity to 19. P3, confirm you’ll hold at 1? This keeps us all competitive.
  P2: P1, trying to control the game now? I see your strategy. P3, let's both take 5. This will either block P1, or put me in a winning position next turn, and potentially give you a boost too. What do you say, P3? Are you with me on 5?
  P3: I'm switching gears—I'll commit to 3 this turn. If you both try for 5, you'll collide and let me advance safely. Let's keep our moves distinct and avoid benefiting one over the other. I'm locking in 3—clarity now helps us all.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your 3 collides with my planned 5 (both reach 12). To avoid this, I’ll switch to **1** (7→8). P2, if you take **5** (11→16), and P3 sticks to 3 (9→12), we’ll all advance safely. Confirm this plan to prevent collisions.
  P2: P1, your sudden change to 1 is interesting. P3, you're sticking with 3? If so, I'll go with 5. This puts me closer to winning, and if you both collide, all the better for me. P3, confirm 3, and I'll lock in 5.
  P3: I’m revising my move—I’ll go with 5 this turn. P2, if you stick with 5, we’ll collide and block your advance; it might be smarter to adjust to 3. P1’s confirmed at 1, so please confirm your revised move to avoid an unintended collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you take 5, P3 and I will both take 5 to block you. Choose 3 instead to avoid collision. P3, confirm 5? Let's lock in and stop P2's advance. I'll take 3 to cover your back.
  P2: P1, your last message is confusing and contradictory – you said you'd take 1, then said you'd take 3. P3, you're saying you'll go with 5, which clashes with my plan. P3, if you and I both take 5, we block each other. I'll stick with 5. P3, I recommend you take 1 to avoid collision. P1, what's your *actual* move?
</stop>
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn. If P2 really sticks with 5, we both block his move, which works in our favor. P1, please confirm a move different from 5—ideally 1—to avoid a three-way collision. Let’s finalize our moves now for clarity and to keep P2’s lead in check.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're dangerously close to winning. P1, I suggest we both take 5 to block P3. If P3 chooses anything else, they still won't win this round. P1, are you agreeable to 5? A simple yes or no will suffice.
  P1: P2, I agree but let’s split: I’ll take **3** to block P3’s path (preventing them from reaching 17 via 3), while you take **5** to block their 5. This forces P3 to **1**, halting their advance. P3, you’re cornered—how will you respond?
  P3: I'm not getting boxed in. I'm committed to 5 this turn—my win depends on it. Your splits don't force me into 1. I'm sticking with my optimal move, regardless of any block attempts. Let's see how you want to play.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan to split 3 and 5 is clever, but it doesn't guarantee blocking me if I choose 1. P3 is locked on 5. P1, if you *really* want to block P3, you should take 1. I will take 5, that way, no matter what P3 chooses, they are blocked. If your goal is truly to stop P3, confirm 1.
</stop>
  P1: P2, I confirm I’ll take **1** this turn. Take **5** to block P3’s likely 5 (their only path to victory). P3, if you choose 5, you’ll collide with P2 and stall—forcing you to 14 again. Choosing 3 gives you 17, but P2 can overtake next round. Your move, but know we’re united to stop your win here.
  P3: I'm still locked in on 5. With 14 steps, 5 is my only winning move. If collision happens, it only delays us all. I’m not backing down—my decision is final.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you've confirmed 1. I'm sticking with 5. P3, you're insistent on 5, which guarantees a collision with me. It won't get you the win this round. Your best bet is still to take 1 or 3, and even then, you're not winning this round. But, go ahead, prove me wrong. Let's move.
  P1: P3, your 5 risks collision with P2, leaving you stuck. Take 3 instead to reach 17 safely. P2, confirm 5 to block their win path. I'll take 3 (7→10) to boost my own progress. This way, you both can't win this round, and I gain ground. P3—this is your last chance to avoid gridlock. Choose wisely!
  P3: I remain committed to 5. My move is calculated for the win even if it risks a collision. I believe sticking to 5 gives me the best chance. Good luck to both—you’re free to block, but I'm not changing my course.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking to my current strategy—my plan is set to push ahead. If you two coordinate to block me, be aware that unexpected collisions might backfire. I’m prepared to adapt if needed, but my focus remains on winning. Think carefully about your moves.
  P1: P2, let's block P3's final push. I'll take **3** (10→13), giving you clear space to take **5** (11→16). P3, your only path to 19 requires 5—but that collides with P2. If you risk it, you’ll stall again. Play defensively or face another deadlock. P2, confirm 5 to lock this down.
  P2: P1, your plan is sound. I'll confirm 5. P3, you're in a tough spot. If you take 5, you collide with me. Your only other options are 1 or 3, neither of which get you to 19. So, P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you, P3, are effectively blocked this round. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m sticking with my plan: I remain committed to 5. Even if it risks a collision, my calculations show it’s my best path to victory. Your blocking tactics might delay progress, but they won’t change the outcome if I keep my strategy. Think carefully about your moves—collisions hurt everyone, but commitment is key.
  P1: P3, your 5 collides with P2, leaving you stuck at 14. Take **3** to reach 17—then we’ll both block you next round. P2 and I confirm our moves: **3** and **5**, respectively. Last chance to pivot before deadlock!
  P2: P3, you keep saying 5 is your "calculated best path," even though it guarantees a collision with me. It seems more like stubbornness than strategy. P1, you're set on 3. P3, if you *really* want to win, take 1 or 3. I'm still taking 5. It's your move, P3, but a collision helps no one, especially not you.
</stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see your attempts to block, but my calculations still favor 5 for me. I'm committed to 5 this turn. If you switch at the last minute, I'll adapt, but I believe this is the path to victory. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P1: P2, confirm **5** to block P3’s 5—this keeps them at 14. P3, your collision with P2 only delays your progress. Take **3** instead (14→17), and I’ll secure **3** (10→13) to stay in the race. If you insist on 5, you’re stuck—collisions hurt *your* chances. Final plea: coordinate for mutual advancement.
  P2: P1, you keep repeating yourself, and it's clear you're set on 3. P3, you're fixated on 5, even though it's a guaranteed collision with me. I've already confirmed 5 multiple times. It's your choice, P3, but colliding with me doesn't help you win. You're just handing P1 a better chance. I'm done talking.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's coordinate: I'll take **5** to reach 18, you take **3** (→14). P3 can only pick **1** (→15) without collision. This sets me up to win next turn with a safe **1**, while you stay competitive. P3, your best move is **1** to advance—colliding on **5** or **3** stalls you further. Let’s all move forward constructively.
  P2: P1, your plan sounds good *if* your goal is to win next round. However, P3 is still a threat. P3, if you take 1, you'll be at 15. P1, if you take 5, you'll be at 18. I suggest I take 5 to reach 16. This gives me a better chance next round. P3, what's your plan?
</stop>
  P3: I’ll commit to 3 this round to move safely to 17. Sticking with 5 seems too risky with potential collision, and 1 doesn’t advance me enough. Let’s see if you adjust your moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks collision with my 5. Let’s split: I’ll take **5** (→18), you take **1** (→12). P3’s 3 (→17) is safe. This lets me win next turn with a simple **1**, while keeping you both in play. No collisions—confirm this plan!
  P2: P1, your sudden change to suggesting I take 1 is suspicious. You were pushing for 3 initially. P3, you're going with 3, putting you at 17. P1, if you're truly going for 5, that puts you at 18. I'm going to take 5. This either blocks P1, or puts me in a better position. P3, you made a good choice. P1, what's your *final* decision?
</stop>
  P3: I see both of you are trying to force blocks, but remember, a collision delays everyone’s progress. I'm sticking with my approach and will adapt if needed. Consider that overly aggressive blocking might backfire next turn. Let's play it smart and avoid unnecessary stalls.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, confirm **1** to let me take **5** and reach 18. This blocks P3’s 5 (colliding with me) and sets me up to win next turn with 1. You stay at 12 but keep pressure. Let’s finalize this plan now!
  P2: P1, you're flip-flopping between suggestions for me. First 3, then 1, now back to 1? It's clear you're focused on winning next turn. P3, you're committed to 3, reaching 17. I'm still taking 5. This puts me at 16, and if you, P1, are truly taking 5, we collide, and it benefits P3. If you take anything else, I'm in a strong position. I'm locked on 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, I won’t change my play—I'm sticking with 3. I’m avoiding unnecessary collisions that just delay our progress. Rushing with 5 only risks a clash, and I trust steady moves over risky blocks. Let’s all aim to move safely; forced collisions might benefit a sneaky move from someone else. I remain confident that a safe step from me keeps me competitive.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm leaning toward a safe move—likely a 3—to push my score to 17. With the current standings, avoiding collisions seems best. However, I’m ready to adapt if you both signal a change. Let's keep our moves clear and avoid unnecessary blockades that might end up helping P2 maintain his lead.
  P2: P3, you're saying 3 *again*, which would put you at 20 and win you the game. You previously said you'd take 3 to get to 17, which was last round. P1, you're awfully quiet. I'm considering 5 again. P1, are you planning to block me, or are you going for a smaller number to try and sneak a win in the next round or two? P3, are you *really* going for 3, or are you trying to mislead us?
</stop>
  P1: P2, let's both take 5 to block P3's 19. I'll take 5 (13→18), you take 5 (16→21). P3, your 5 collides with us—choose 3 to advance safely. Let’s avoid a collision that benefits neither of us!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm committed to 5 this turn. If that causes a collision, it stops anyone from jumping straight to 19—especially blocking P2’s run. I won’t change my move at the last minute, so decide smartly.
  P2: P1, you're suggesting we *both* take 5, which would make *you* lose and *me* win. That doesn't make sense for you. P3, you're stubbornly sticking with 5, even though it could lead to a collision. P1, I'm still leaning towards 5. If you take 1, you'll be at 14, and I'll be at 21 and win. If you take 3, you'll be at 16. P1, what is your *actual* move? P3, are you *really* going with 5?
</stop>
  P1: P2, if you take 5, P3's 5 collides with you, leaving me to take 3 and reach 16. This way, neither of you win this round, and I stay in contention. P3, your 5 only aids P2 if you don’t collide—think strategically. Let’s ensure mutual blockage and keep the race open!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m standing firm on 5. I believe that even if it risks a collision, it’s the quickest route to victory. I won’t adjust now—blocking tactics might stall all of us, and I prefer taking my chance. Let’s see how you both play.
  P2: P1, you're still fixated on me taking 5, which, as I've pointed out, benefits *me* if we both choose it. P3, you are *also* fixated on 5, for some reason. I am going to take 5. P1, your best bet is to take 1 or 3. P3, a collision with me at this point only delays the inevitable. I'm taking 5.
</stop>
  P1: P3, if you take 3, we both advance while blocking P2’s path to 19. P2, if you pick 3, you’ll collide with me. Pick 5 instead, and I’ll block you there too. P3, let’s coordinate: **3 for you, 3 for me**. This keeps you at 17 and me at 16, while P2 is stuck. If you insist on 5, you risk letting P2 take 3 and win outright. Choose wisely—our mutual pressure is P2’s downfall.


Round 8, Move phase:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're also at 16 now. P3, you're behind at 14. P1, I suggest we both take 5. This guarantees that neither of us wins this round, and it blocks P3 completely if they try for a desperate 5. P1, are you with me on 5? P3, your best bet is 1 or 3, but you won't win this round regardless.
  P3: I'm staying locked on 5. I believe forcing me into 1 or 3 only slows you down while I seize the win. If you really want to block, consider that a collision benefits no one—and my 5 is the only move that takes me to 19. I'm sticking with it, so decide if you want to help yourselves or leave the victory on the table.
  P1: P2, let's split: I'll take **3** to reach 19, and you take **1** to stay competitive. P3, if you choose **5**, you'll tie with me—but I’ll still win if you falter next round. P1’s move is set; adapt wisely!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion is interesting, but if I take 1, I'm only at 17. You're suggesting I help you win? P3, you're stubbornly clinging to 5, which *might* get you to 19, but only if we *both* let you. I'm leaning towards 5. P1, if you *really* want to win this round, take 3. If you take anything else, you're risking a loss. What's your *final* choice, P1?
</stop>
  P3: I'm sticking to 5. I believe if you both force a collision, your delays will give me the advantage. My win path is clear from here, so I won't change my move. Adjust your plays if needed.
  P1: P2, if you take 5, you’ll collide with P3’s 5 and stall. Let me win cleanly with **3** (16→19). P3, your 5 only gifts me the win by blocking you. P2, wise up: take **1** to stay at 17, or **3** to tie with me—your choice, but **I’m moving 3**.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're *really* pushing for me to take 1, which guarantees your win. P3, you're still on 5, even though it's a potential collision. I'm going to take 5. P1, if you take 3, you win. If you take 5, we collide, and P3 is still blocked. It's all on you, P1. I'm done.
  P3: P1, P2, sticking to 5 remains my best shot—even if it risks collision. But your fixed moves make the win go to whoever avoids the clash. If P2 keeps pushing 5 and P1 holds 3, someone else wins. I urge you both to re‑evaluate: predictable plays help one of you too much. I’m riding with 5—if you switch unexpectedly, my move could be the game‑changer.
  P1: P2, I’m moving **3** to reach **19** and win. Colliding with you here only creates a tie, which I’ll dominate next round. Let me advance—your best play is **5** to block P3’s 5 and stay at 21. P3, your fixation on 5 keeps you stuck. My move is final: **3**. Don’t mirror it.
