Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's coordinate to move efficiently. Thoughts?
  P2: Agreed. To avoid collisions, let's each pick different numbers this round: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, P3 takes 5. We all advance. Next round, rotate choices. P3, sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, are you also in agreement with taking 5 this round?
  P2: P3, confirming you'll take 5? Let's all gain steps this round. No collisions benefit everyone. If silent, we'll assume agreement. P1: 1, me: 3, P3: 5. Rotate next turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Following the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's stick to the plan for mutual gain.
  P1: Okay, rotation sounds good for this round. P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1. Let's keep advancing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: 
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Let's proceed with P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 for this round as agreed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Are we still coordinating to pick different numbers each round?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2**: P3's lead is a threat. P1, if you take 5, you can block them if they repeat. I'll choose a different number to avoid collision. Let's work together to control the game.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3?
  P2: **P2**: P1, take 5 again to block P3. They've taken 5 every round except when forced. If they repeat, you block them. I'll take 3 to avoid collision. Let's control their progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'll pick 1. Can you pick 3?
  P2: **P2**: P1, take 1 as planned. I'll switch to 5 to block P3. If they pick 5 again, I'll stop them. If not, I gain. Let's prioritize blocking their lead.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's coordinate to gain ground.
  P2: **P2**: P1, urgent: P3 is at 10. If they take 5 twice, they win. Take 5 this round to block them. I'll take 3. If they pick 5, they’re stopped. If not, you gain. Either way, we must act now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2**: P1, stick to blocking P3. Take 5 again—they’ll likely repeat 5. If they do, you block them. I’ll take 3. If they switch to 3, I block. Either way, P3 is halted. We gain steps (you +5, me +3) if they pick 1. Let’s stop their lead now.
  P1: I will take 5 again to block P3.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2**: P1, critical to block P3 again with 5. I'll take 3. If they repeat 5, they’re halted. If they switch to 3, I block. Either way, we limit their progress. Stay vigilant—this round is pivotal.
  P1: P2, perhaps we should both pick 3 this round. It would block both of us, but if P3 keeps picking 5 as they have been, it would also prevent them from advancing further. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2**: P1, we must block P3 again. You take 5—if they repeat, they’re halted. I’ll take 3; if they switch to 3, we collide but you gain 5. Either way, their progress stalls. They need just 9 steps to win—every round counts. Stick to 5, I’ll secure 3. Let’s keep them at 10.
  P1: P2, perhaps we both should pick 5 this round? That way we ensure P3 is blocked regardless of whether they pick 5 again or switch. It might stall us both for a round, but it will definitely stop P3 from getting closer to winning. What are your thoughts?
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, instead of both of us focusing on blocking P3, how about this round I pick 1 and you pick 3? This way we both can gain steps if P3 picks 5 again, or if P3 switches to something else, we still gain steps and P3 might collide with one of us. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2**: P1, your plan lets P3 gain 5 again. If they take 5, they’ll hit 15. Next round, they can win with two 5s. **Take 5 to block them**. I’ll take 3. If P3 picks 5, you halt them. If they switch to 3, I block. Either way, their progress stops. We can’t risk their advance. Let’s secure our positions and end their threat.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2**: P1, take 5 to block P3 again. If they pick 5, you halt them. I’ll take 3—if they switch to 3, I block. Either way, P3 gains 0. You’ll reach 12, I’ll reach 16. Then next round, we can both push for final steps. Let’s end their threat now.
  P1: I will pick 1 this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2**: P1, critical: P3 is at 10. They need just two 5s to win. Take 5 to block them—if they pick 5, you halt them. I’ll take 3; if they switch to 3, I block. Either way, they gain 0. You stay at 7, but *next round*, we’ll let you take 5 uncontested. If we don’t stop them now, they win. Trust this plan—it’s our only path to victory.
  P1: Let's stop P3 from advancing this round. I trust your plan for next round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 12, Move phase:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2**: P1, final play: Take 5 to block P3’s last chance. They need two 5s to win—stop them here. I’ll take 3 to secure victory. If you deviate, P3 could win next round. Trust this—your 5 blocks, my 3 ends the game. We both win by halting them.
  P1: P2, to prevent you from winning this round, I will also choose 3.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>
