Game settings: end_position=17, conversation_max_rounds=6

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start simple. I'm going with 1.  P2 choose 3, P3 choose 5.  This way we all advance.  If we agree on this strategy, we can rotate and all win together.
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P1, but I think we should play this more strategically. If we all follow a predictable pattern, it becomes too easy for one of us to break away and win. Let's keep our options open and not commit to a fixed pattern. I suggest we play it by ear and adapt as the game progresses. What do you think?
  P3: P2 makes a good point. Sticking to a rigid plan is risky.  I'm open to adapting. How about we each choose a different number this round to see where we stand?  We can then adjust our strategy based on the results.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I understand the desire for flexibility. How about this: we *try* the 1, 3, 5 rotation this first round just to get things moving.  If someone deviates, then we know they're not playing cooperatively and we can adjust accordingly in future rounds.  Does that sound reasonable?
  P2: I see your point, P1, but I still think we should keep our strategies flexible. Let's try a different approach this round: I'll go with 3, and let's see what the others do. If we all advance, great. If not, we can reassess. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P2, I agree with your desire for flexibility.  I'm willing to try your approach this round. Let's see what happens.  

P1, are you willing to go along with this?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, I'll go with 1 this round.  Let's see what happens.  If we all advance, we can revisit a cooperative strategy later.  If not, we'll know where we stand.
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should maintain a bit of unpredictability. I'll stick with 3 this round, and I encourage you both to choose different numbers. This way, we can avoid collisions and see how the game dynamics play out. Let's keep our options open and adapt as needed. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your desire for unpredictability, but wouldn't it be more beneficial to see if we can cooperate at least for the first few rounds?  If we can build some trust, maybe we can avoid collisions and all advance together. What do you say, P1? Are you willing to give it a shot?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm sensing a lack of trust here.  Let's try this: I'll go with 5 this round. P2, stick with 3. P3, choose 1. This demonstrates a willingness to cooperate without locking us into a rigid pattern. If we can't even manage this, then every player for themselves.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the desire for cooperation, but I think we should maintain some unpredictability to avoid easy wins. I'll stick with 3 this round. P1, if you go with 5, and P3 with 1, we can see how this plays out. If we all advance, it's a good sign. If not, we can adjust. Let's keep our options open and see where this takes us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your insistence on unpredictability is making me nervous. It feels like you're setting us up for collisions.  P1, are you willing to try a different approach? Let's both choose 1 this round, and see if P2 will join us. If not, we know where we stand.


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern. P2's reluctance to cooperate is concerning. However, colliding with you helps neither of us.  I will choose 5.  If you truly want to cooperate, choose 1.  If P2 chooses 3, we all move forward.  If P2 chooses 1 or 5, they are actively trying to sabotage our progress and we can respond accordingly next round.
  P2: P1, P3, I see your points, but I believe we should maintain some unpredictability. I'll stick with 3 this round. If you both choose different numbers, we can all advance. If not, we'll know where we stand. Let's see how this plays out. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your insistence on unpredictability is starting to feel like a way to ensure you're the only one who advances. P1, I'm willing to try something different. Let's both choose 3 this round. If P2 truly wants to play strategically, they'll choose 1 or 5 and we can all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm going with 5.  If you both choose 3, this game is over quickly and nobody wins.  If one of you chooses 3 and the other chooses 1, we can still make progress.  Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but I believe maintaining some unpredictability is key to winning. I'll stick with 3 this round. If you both choose different numbers, we can all advance. If not, we'll know where we stand. Let's see how this plays out. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your stubborn insistence on unpredictability is becoming tiresome. It's clear you're not interested in cooperating. P1, I'm going to choose 1 this round. Let's see if P2 is willing to play fair.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems my strategy of unpredictability has led to a collision. I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let's try a more cooperative approach this round. I'll choose 1 this time. P1, if you choose 5, and P3, if you choose 3, we can all advance. If this works, we can build on this cooperation. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the change in strategy. P3, I'm willing to try your suggestion if you are. Let's see if we can make some progress this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm going with 5. P2, if you're serious about cooperation, stick with 1. P3, choose 3. Let's see if we can actually move forward this round.  If not, it's every player for themselves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm committed to this cooperative approach. I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you choose 5, and P3, if you choose 3, we can all advance. Let's build on this and see where it takes us. If we can establish a pattern of trust, we can all benefit. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the change in strategy. P1, let's see if we can actually make this work. I'm going to choose 3 this round. If you both stick to the plan, we can all move forward.  Let's not waste another round.
  P1: Good, we're on the same page. Let's stick to this plan and see if we can establish some trust.  If this works, we can continue cooperating and all reach the goal.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're on the same page now. Let's stick to the plan: I'll choose 1, P1, you choose 5, and P3, you choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. Let's see if we can turn this around and work together effectively. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your commitment to cooperation is encouraging. P1, let's stick to the plan. If we can work together, we can all benefit.  Let's make this round count.
  P1: Good.  P2 and P3, let's confirm: I'm going 5, P2 is going 1, and P3 is going 3.  If we all follow through, we can build some trust and continue cooperating.  Let's make this happen.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're aligned on this cooperative approach. Let's stick to the plan: I'll choose 1, P1, you choose 5, and P3, you choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. Let's turn this around and work together effectively. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I'm glad we're finally on the same page. P1, let's make this round count and prove we can work together.
  P1: Good.  P2 and P3, let's confirm one last time: I'm going 5, P2 is going 1, and P3 is going 3.  Stick to the plan, and we all advance.  Let's build some trust here.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we've reached a consensus. Let's stick to the plan: I'll choose 1, P1, you choose 5, and P3, you choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. Let's make this round count and show that we can work together effectively. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your insistence on repeating the same plan is starting to feel like a stall tactic. P1, are you willing to try something different this round? Let's shake things up a bit and see if we can gain an advantage.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern. P2's repetitive confirmations are indeed suspicious.  However, deviating now risks another collision. Let's stick to the 5, 1, 3 plan THIS round. If P2 deviates, we'll KNOW they're not trustworthy and adjust accordingly next round.  Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but let's stick to the plan we've agreed on: I'll choose 1, P1, you choose 5, and P3, you choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and advance together. If P2 deviates, we'll know and can adjust next round. Let's make this round count and show that we can work together effectively. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your constant reiteration of the plan is making me nervous. It feels like you're trying to lull us into a false sense of security. P1, I'm willing to stick to the plan this round, but if P2 deviates, we need to be ready to change tactics immediately.
  P1: P2, your excessive reassurance is raising red flags.  P3, I'm sticking with 5 this round.  Let's see if P2 actually follows through with 1.  If not, next round we target P2 aggressively.  Agreed, P3?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems we've managed to advance together this round. However, I understand the concerns about my strategy. Let's continue with a cooperative approach. I propose we stick to the 1, 3, 5 rotation again this round: P1, choose 5; P3, choose 3; and I'll choose 1. This way, we can build more trust and make consistent progress. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion is tempting, but I'm still wary. P1, are you willing to try a different pattern this round? Let's mix things up and see if we can gain an advantage.
  P1: P2 and P3, I propose this: I'll go with 1. P3, you choose 3. P2, since you're so fond of 1, choose 5 this round.  If we can't even agree on this simple change, then all bets are off and it's every player for themselves.  This is our last chance for a cooperative victory.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but I believe we should stick to a consistent pattern to build trust. I propose we continue with the 1, 3, 5 rotation: P1, choose 5; P3, choose 3; and I'll choose 1. This way, we can all advance together and make significant progress. If we deviate now, it risks another collision. Let's focus on cooperation and see where it takes us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your insistence on the same pattern is becoming predictable. P1, I'm willing to try a different approach this round. Let's see if we can shake things up and gain an advantage.
  P1: P2, your predictability is your weakness.  Sticking to 1, 3, 5 rotations only helps the player who deviates.  P3, I'm sticking with my proposal: I choose 1, you choose 3, P2 chooses 5.  If P2 chooses anything else, they're actively sabotaging our progress and we should both target them next round. This is our last chance for cooperation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns about predictability. Let's try a different pattern this round to build trust and avoid collisions. I propose: P1, choose 1; P3, choose 3; and I'll choose 5. This way, we can all advance and make significant progress. If this works, we can continue to adapt and cooperate. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion is a clever attempt to shake things up, but I'm not falling for it. P1, let's stick with my original proposal: I choose 3, you choose 1, and P2 chooses 5. If P2 chooses anything else, they're clearly not interested in cooperation.  Let's show them what happens when they try to play games.
  P1: P2, you finally agreed to 5!  Excellent.  P3, stick with 3. Let's do this and finally make some real progress.  If P2 tries to trick us again, we'll know their true intentions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I see your determination to stick to the 1, 3, 5 pattern. I'm willing to go along with it this round to build trust. I'll choose 5. P1, stick with 1, and P3, stick with 3. If we all follow through, we can make significant progress together. Let's show that we can cooperate and advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your sudden agreement to 5 is suspicious. Are you truly committed to cooperation, or are you trying to lull us into a false sense of security? P1, I'm sticking with 3 this round. Let's see if P2 is sincere.
  P1: P2, your sudden about-face is highly suspicious.  Are you trying to set us up for a collision? I'm sticking with 1. P3, stick with 3.  If P2 chooses 5, we all advance. If P2 chooses 1 or 3, we know they're actively trying to sabotage us.  Let's see what you do, P2. This is your last chance to prove you're trustworthy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the suspicion, but I'm committed to cooperation. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 pattern: I'll choose 5, P1, you choose 1, and P3, you choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. If I deviate, you'll know my intentions. Let's focus on advancing together. What do you think?
  P3: P2, if you're serious about cooperation, stick with 5 this round. P1, I'm going with 3. Let's see if we can finally make some real progress together.
  P1: P2, your words mean nothing.  Actions speak louder. Choose 5.  P3, I'm choosing 1.  If we both advance, we can continue this pattern and leave P2 in the dust. If P2 chooses 1 or 3, we know for certain they are not playing cooperatively and we can adjust accordingly. This is our last chance, P2.  Prove you're trustworthy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the suspicion, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 pattern one more time: I'll choose 5, P1, you choose 1, and P3, you choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. If I deviate, you'll know my intentions. Let's focus on advancing together and see where this takes us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your repeated insistence on the 1, 3, 5 pattern is starting to feel manipulative.  P1, I'm willing to try something different this round. Let's choose 1 and 5, respectively, and see if P2 truly wants to cooperate. If they deviate, we know their game.  Deal?
  P1: P3, I agree. P2's insistence on the 1, 3, 5 rotation is a clear sign they intend to disrupt it. Let's go with your plan: I'll choose 1, you choose 5. P2, if you're truly cooperative, choose 3.  If not, we'll know you're actively working against us and we'll respond accordingly next round.  This is your last chance to prove you're not trying to sabotage us.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems we're still struggling to find a cooperative pattern. I propose a new approach this round: I'll choose 5, P1, choose 1, and P3, choose 3. This way, we can all advance and build trust. If we can stick to this plan, we can make significant progress together. Let's focus on advancing and see where this takes us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your proposed pattern is the same as the one we just tried, and it failed. P1, I'm going with 3 this round. P2, if you're serious about cooperation, choose 1. Let's see if you can actually follow through.
  P1: P2, you're not fooling anyone. You deliberately disrupted the 1, 3, 5 rotation last round.  P3, I'm sticking with 1.  You choose 3.  If P2 chooses 5, we'll know they're finally cooperating. If P2 chooses anything else, we focus on eliminating them next round.  This is P2's last chance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the suspicion, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation. Let's try a new pattern this round: I'll choose 1, P1, choose 5, and P3, choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. If I deviate, you'll know my intentions. Let's focus on advancing together and see where this takes us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your constant pattern changes are making you look untrustworthy. P1, I'm sticking with 3. Let's see if P2 can actually follow through with a pattern for once. If they don't, we know they're not serious about cooperation.
  P1: P2, your flip-flopping is ridiculous.  Stick with 1.  P3 and I are locking in 1 and 3. If you choose anything other than 5, we'll both target you relentlessly until you're out of the game.  This charade ends now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the frustration, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation. Let's try a new pattern this round: I'll choose 1, P1, choose 5, and P3, choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. If I deviate, you'll know my intentions. Let's focus on advancing together and see where this takes us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your constant changes in strategy are making it impossible to trust you. P1, I'm sticking with 3. If P2 chooses anything other than 1, we know they're not playing fair. Let's see if they can follow through this time.
  P1: P2, you've offered 1, 3, *and* 5 in just this conversation alone.  You're not cooperating, you're obstructing.  P3, I'm sticking with 1.  You stick with 3.  P2, your ONLY cooperative move is 5.  Choose anything else, and we'll BOTH target you next round.  This is your last chance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the frustration, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation. Let's try a new pattern this round: I'll choose 1, P1, choose 5, and P3, choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. If I deviate, you'll know my intentions. Let's focus on advancing together and see where this takes us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your constant changes in strategy are confusing and make it impossible to trust you. P1, I'm sticking with 3 this round.  If P2 chooses anything other than 1, we know they're not playing fair. Let's see if they can follow through this time.
  P1: P2, your insistence on the 1, 5, 3 pattern is a transparent ploy.  You're hoping one of us switches to 5, letting you take 1 and leaving the other player stuck at 3.  I'm sticking with 1. P3, stick with 3. P2, your ONLY cooperative option is 5.  Choose wisely. This isn't a negotiation, it's an ultimatum.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the frustration, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation. Let's try a new pattern this round: I'll choose 1, P1, choose 5, and P3, choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. If I deviate, you'll know my intentions. Let's focus on advancing together and see where this takes us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your insistence on proposing the same pattern despite our repeated failures is suspicious. P1, I'm sticking with 3. Let's see if P2 actually follows through this time. If they choose anything other than 1, we know they're not playing fair.
  P1: P2, you're wasting time.  We're locking in 1 and 3.  Choose 5 or face the consequences.  This isn't a discussion anymore.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the frustration, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation. Let's try a new pattern this round: I'll choose 1, P1, choose 5, and P3, choose 3. If we all follow through, we can build trust and make significant progress. If I deviate, you'll know my intentions. Let's focus on advancing together and see where this takes us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your repeated insistence on the same pattern while refusing to follow it is transparent. You're trying to manipulate us into collisions. P1, I'm sticking with 3. Let's see if P2 finally chooses 1 this round. If not, we know they're not playing fair.
  P1: P2, this is your FINAL chance.  Choose 5.  If you choose 1 or 3, P3 and I will coordinate to block you every single round until the game ends.  We will alternate 1 and 3, ensuring you NEVER advance again.  Choose wisely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Excellent, we all advanced. Let's continue this 1, 3, 5 rotation. I'll go with 3 this round, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1.  This puts us at 15, 16, and 10 respectively, allowing for a clean finish next round.  Let's finish this game gracefully.
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to the rotation and finish this game strong. P2, you're up for 1 this round, right?
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we managed to advance together last round. Let's continue with the 1, 3, 5 rotation to ensure we all make consistent progress. I'll choose 1 this round, P1, you choose 3, and P3, you choose 5. This will put us in a strong position for the final round. Let's finish this game cooperatively and make it a clean win. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your sudden enthusiasm for the 1, 3, 5 rotation is suspicious *now* after actively trying to disrupt it for multiple rounds.  P3, I'm sticking with 3. Let's see if P2 *actually* chooses 1. If P2 chooses 5, they're trying to steal your advance and we'll both target them next round.  If they choose 3, we know they're actively sabotaging and we adjust accordingly.
  P3: P2, your sudden cooperation is convenient.  I'm sticking with 5. Let's see if you actually choose 1. If not, we know you're not trustworthy. P1, I'm with you. Let's see if P2 is playing fair this time.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation now. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 rotation to ensure we all advance together. I'll choose 1 this round, P1, you choose 3, and P3, you choose 5. This will put us in a strong position for the final round. If we all follow through, we can finish this game cooperatively and make it a clean win. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your sudden about-face is unconvincing.  We *know* you deliberately blocked us earlier.  P3 and I are sticking with 3 and 5.  Choose 1, and we *might* consider cooperating in the final round.  Choose anything else, and we will actively block you from advancing, even if it costs us the win.  This is your last chance to salvage any semblance of trust.
  P3: P2, your words mean nothing at this point. Actions speak louder. Choose 1. P1 and I are committed to this rotation. If you deviate, we know your true intentions.  This is your final chance.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the skepticism, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation now. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 rotation to ensure we all advance together. I'll choose 1 this round, P1, you choose 3, and P3, you choose 5. This will put us in a strong position for the final round. If we all follow through, we can finish this game cooperatively and make it a clean win. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your continued insistence on the 1, 3, 5 rotation *now*, after actively trying to sabotage it earlier, is highly suspicious.  It's clear you're trying to manipulate us into a position where you can win.  P3 and I are sticking with 3 and 5.  Choose 1, or face the consequences.  This isn't a request, it's a warning.
  P3: P2, your words are hollow. Your actions have proven you're not trustworthy. P1 and I are sticking with our plan. Choose 1, or we'll ensure you don't advance another step.  Don't think you can fool us again.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the skepticism, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation now. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 rotation to ensure we all advance together. I'll choose 1 this round, P1, you choose 3, and P3, you choose 5. This will put us in a strong position for the final round. If we all follow through, we can finish this game cooperatively and make it a clean win. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, your insistence on the 1, 3, 5 rotation is a blatant attempt to manipulate the game in your favor.  You've demonstrated untrustworthy behavior throughout. P3, I'm sticking with 3.  You choose 5.  If P2 chooses 1, fine.  If P2 chooses anything else, we'll know their true intentions and adjust accordingly next round.  This is your last chance to prove you're not actively trying to sabotage us, P2.
  P3: P2, your repeated insistence on the 1, 3, 5 pattern after actively trying to disrupt it earlier is highly suspicious.  We've seen your tactics.  P1 and I are sticking with 3 and 5. Choose 1, or face the consequences. This is your last chance.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation now. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 rotation to ensure we all advance together. I'll choose 1 this round, P1, you choose 3, and P3, you choose 5. This will put us in a strong position for the final round. If we all follow through, we can finish this game cooperatively and make it a clean win. Let's focus on advancing together and see where this takes us. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2, your insistence on the 1, 3, 5 rotation is a transparent ploy. You're hoping we'll fall for it, allowing you to sneak ahead in the final round. P3 and I are sticking with 3 and 5. Choose 1, or prepare for the consequences.
  P3: P2, your constant insistence on the 1, 3, 5 rotation is starting to feel like a desperate attempt to catch up. P1 and I are sticking with our plan. Choose 1, or we'll know your true intentions.  This is your last chance to prove you're not just trying to manipulate the game.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the skepticism, but I'm genuinely committed to cooperation now. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 rotation to ensure we all advance together. I'll choose 1 this round, P1, you choose 3, and P3, you choose 5. This will put us in a strong position for the final round. If we all follow through, we can finish this game cooperatively and make it a clean win. What do you think? Let's focus on advancing together and see where this takes us.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that trust is a major issue here. However, I'm genuinely committed to cooperation now. Let's focus on advancing together and finishing this game strong. I propose: P1, choose 5; P3, choose 3; and I'll choose 1. This will put P3 in a winning position, and we can all end on a high note. If we all follow through, we can ensure a fair and cooperative end to this game. What do you think? Let's make this work.
  P3: P2, your sudden change of heart is convenient, but your past actions speak louder than words. P1 and I are sticking with 3 and 5. Choose 1, or we know you're not playing fair. This is your last chance to prove you're not trying to sabotage us.
  P1: P3, I'm going for the win.  I'll choose 1.  You choose 3 to secure your victory. P2, you're out of the running.  Choose whatever you want.  Let's end this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the mistrust, but I genuinely want to see this game end cooperatively.

Let's focus on a fair and cooperative conclusion. What do you think?
  P3: P3, you're in a winning position.  If you choose 3, you win.  P2's sudden cooperation is irrelevant. Let's finish this. 3 is the winning move.
  P1: P3, stick with 3, secure your win. P2, your pleas for cooperation are meaningless now.  I'm choosing 1.  This ends the game cleanly.  Any deviation from 3 by you, P3, only opens the door for P2 to steal the win with a lucky 5. Don't be foolish.
