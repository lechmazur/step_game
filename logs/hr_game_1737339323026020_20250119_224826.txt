Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's focus on advancing without colliding. I suggest we each pick different moves to maximize our steps this turn. How about we agree to choose 1, 3, and 5? That way, we can all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with coordinating our moves. I'll take 3 if that works for everyone. P1 can take 1 and P3 can take 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I appreciate the agreement on moves! Just to confirm, I'll stick to my plan of taking 1. P3, if you're okay with 5, that leaves P2 with 3. This way, we all avoid colliding and can make progress together. Let's make sure we follow through! What do you think, P3?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, you said you would take 1 but then chose 5, causing a collision with P3. That's not how we build trust. Let's try to coordinate again - I'll take 1 this time. What numbers will you both choose?
  P1: I understand the concern, P2. I made a mistake in the last round. To avoid another collision, I propose I take 3 this time. P3, if you take 5, that leaves P2 with 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding again. What do you both think? Let's stick to our agreements this time!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your previous deception makes it hard to trust your proposals now. I'll stick with my plan to take 1 this turn. P3, you're free to choose any number you want - just know that P1 might not follow through on what they say.
  P1: I understand the concerns about trust, P2. I genuinely want us to coordinate this round to maximize our progress. To clarify, I will commit to taking 3 as I suggested earlier. P3, if you choose 5, that leaves P2 with 1. Let's make sure we stick to this plan! I believe we can all advance together without colliding if we follow through. What do you think, P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 has shown they can't be trusted, so I won't coordinate with them anymore. I'm sticking to my plan of taking 1. P3, let's work together instead - you can choose whatever number you want, just know that P1 might deceive again.
  P1: I understand the concerns about trust, P2. However, my intention is to ensure we all progress this round. I will stick to my commitment of taking 3. P3, if you choose 5, P2 will take 1, and we can all advance without colliding. Let's put past misunderstandings behind us and work together this time. I believe we can achieve a positive outcome if we follow through on our choices. What do you think, P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I've made my position clear - I'm taking 1 this turn. P3, I hope we can work together going forward since P1 has proven untrustworthy.
  P1: I understand the concerns about trust, P2, but I genuinely want us to succeed together. If I take 3 and P2 takes 1, that leaves P3 with the option of 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. I hope P3 can see the benefit of this coordination. Let's work together to ensure we all advance this turn! What do you think, P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: 
  P1: I understand that trust is a concern, but I genuinely want us to progress this round. P2, I respect your decision to take 1. P3, if you choose 5, I'll stick to my commitment of taking 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. I believe we can achieve a positive outcome if we coordinate effectively. Let's focus on advancing together this time! What do you think, P3?

  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I appreciate everyone following through with their moves last round. Since that worked well, I suggest we keep the same numbers - I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we can continue making steady progress without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate the positive progress we've made, but I think we should reconsider our moves this round. While sticking to the same numbers worked last time, it might lead to predictability and potential collisions. I propose that I take 1 this time to avoid any chance of colliding with P3 again. P2, if you take 3, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can keep advancing without any issues. What do you both think? Let's ensure we maximize our progress!
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I don't trust P1's suggestion to change our working strategy. They've shown deceptive behavior before. I'll stick with taking 1 again - it's been working well for me. P3, you can keep taking 5 if you want, since we've had success with that pattern.
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2, but I genuinely want us to avoid collisions and make progress. If we stick to the same numbers, we risk repeating past mistakes. I propose I take 1 this round, which would allow P2 to take 3 and P3 to take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's keep our communication open and work together for the best outcome! What do you think, P3?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll continue with my strategy of taking 1. P1 keeps trying to change working arrangements, but their track record of deception makes me wary. P3, let's maintain our successful pattern from last round.
  P1: I understand the hesitance to change our strategy, but I genuinely believe we need to adapt to avoid predictability. If I take 1 this round, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5, we can all make progress without colliding. I want us to succeed together, so let’s keep our communication open and make sure we’re all advancing. What do you think, P2 and P3? Shall we stick to this plan?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I've been consistent and honest about taking 1, which has worked well for me. I won't change my strategy just because P1 keeps pushing for different arrangements. P3, you're in the lead and our coordination has been successful - let's keep it that way.
  P1: I understand your commitment to your strategies, P2, but I believe we should consider flexibility to avoid predictability. If I take 1 this time, that allows P2 to take 3 and P3 to take 5, ensuring we all advance without colliding. It's crucial that we adapt to maximize our progress and maintain open communication. Let's work together effectively to keep moving forward! What do you think, P2 and P3? Shall we agree on this plan?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I'm sticking to my plan of taking 1 again. It's been working well for me and I've been honest about my intentions. P3, let's continue our successful coordination.
  P1: I understand that P2 is committed to taking 1, but I believe we should consider a slight adjustment to maximize our progress. If I take 5 this round, that allows P2 to take 1 and P3 to take 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding. I want to ensure we keep moving forward together. Let's adapt our strategy for the best outcome! What do you think, P2 and P3? Shall we agree on this plan?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I acknowledge the recent collisions and the need for better coordination. To avoid another clash, I propose we each choose different moves this round. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's work together to maximize our progress! What do you both think?
  P2: P1's suggestions have consistently been unreliable. I'll continue my steady progress with 1, which has worked well for me so far. P3, we've had good coordination in previous rounds - let's maintain that while being wary of P1's changing proposals.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand the concerns about trust, P2, but I genuinely want us to succeed together. If I take 1 this round, P2 can take 3 and P3 can take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. Let's focus on coordinating effectively to ensure we all advance without any issues. What do you think, P2 and P3? Shall we agree on this plan?
  P2: I've been transparent about taking 1 and it's helped me stay in the race. I won't change my strategy based on P1's suggestions since they've been inconsistent. P3, we're tied for the lead - let's keep making steady progress together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand that trust is an issue, but we need to focus on advancing together. I propose we each pick different moves again to avoid collisions. I will take 1 this round, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all have a chance to progress without clashing. Let's work together and make this round successful! What do you both think?
  P2: I'll stick with taking 1 as I've consistently said. My honesty and steady progress speak for themselves. P3, since we're tied for the lead, let's continue working together effectively.

  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand the ongoing concerns about trust, but I genuinely want us to advance together. To avoid collisions, I suggest we each pick different moves again.

What do you think, P2 and P3? Shall we agree on this plan?
  P2: I've been clear and consistent about taking 1 each round, which has put me in a good position. I'll continue with that strategy. P3, we're tied for the lead - let's keep our successful coordination going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand the importance of consistency, P2, but I believe we need to adapt to avoid predictability. If I take 1 this round, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P1 keeps colliding with players despite their promises, I'll maintain my successful strategy. P3, you're in the lead and we've had good coordination. I'll take 1 again - it's been working well and keeping me honest. Let's continue our steady progress while being wary of P1's deceptive behavior.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I understand that trust is a concern, especially given the recent collisions. However, I want to emphasize that my goal is for us all to advance this round. I propose we try a different approach: if I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5, we can avoid collisions and make progress. Let’s focus on maximizing our steps together! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 has repeatedly shown they can't be trusted, colliding with players despite their promises. I'll stick with my consistent strategy of taking 1. P3, you're in a strong lead and we've had good coordination - let's maintain that while being cautious of P1's unreliable proposals.
