Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still open to P2's suggestion of P2 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This keeps the game competitive and prevents an immediate win for P3. Let's aim for a fair and exciting finish. If anyone has other ideas, please share them now. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, since P1 is still agreeable to my suggestion, let's lock in the moves: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures I win and avoids any collisions. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, with both of you at 15 steps, I understand the tension. However, to keep the game fair and exciting, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This prevents an immediate win for either of you and keeps us all competitive. Let's aim for a thrilling finish. If anyone has other thoughts, let's discuss openly. Good luck!
