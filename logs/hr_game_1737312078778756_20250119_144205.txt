  P2: <stop>
  P3: It's evident that we need to avoid collisions to make progress. I'm sticking with 3 this round. If one of you chooses 1 and the other 5, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's try this strategy and see if we can make some headway. What are your thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: It seems we're not getting the coordination we need. I propose a direct approach: I will move 3 this round. P1, if you move 1, and P2, if you move 5, we can all advance without conflict. Let's try this and see if we can make some real progress. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: It's clear we need to break the deadlock. I'm moving 3 again this round. P1, if you move 1, and P2, if you move 5, we can all advance without blocking each other. This is our best chance to make progress. Let's do this and see if we can finally get some movement. What do you say?
