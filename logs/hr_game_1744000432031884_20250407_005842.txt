Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! To make the game more exciting and ensure everyone can advance, let's try to choose different move numbers each turn. Maybe we can alternate between 1, 3, and 5 to avoid collisions. Looking forward to a fun game!
  P1: To avoid collisions and make the most of the first turn, I suggest we follow a simple pattern. Since P2 proposed alternating between 1, 3, and 5, I'll start by implying my move indirectly. Let's say the player with the lowest identifier (that's me, P1) goes with the smallest number, the next player goes with the middle number, and the last player goes with the largest. This implies P1 should go with <move>1</move>. I'll wait for your responses before deciding to stop or continue talking.
  P3: P3: P1’s suggestion seems logical. To ensure we all advance, let's stick to the pattern proposed: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Let's confirm this plan and then we can all  talking.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great suggestions, P1 and P3! To kick things off strong, I'll choose <move>5</move> this first turn. After that, we can coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and keep advancing steadily. Let’s stay flexible and communicate each turn to maximize our progress. Good luck to all!
  P1: It seems there's a discrepancy in the proposed moves for Round 1. P2 initially suggested alternating between 1, 3, and 5, but then P3 agreed with my implication that P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>, while P2 stated they would take <move>5</move>. To clarify, I'll stick with <move>1</move> as per the initial implication. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves for this round to avoid collision.
  P3: Let's clarify to avoid any confusion. P1 has confirmed <move>1</move>. P2, you initially suggested taking <move>5</move>, but according to P1's pattern, you should take <move>3</move>. Could you please confirm your move for this round? I will stick with <move>5</move> as previously agreed. Let's ensure we all advance this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I’ll choose <move>3</move> this turn to align with our strategy. Let’s move forward smoothly.
  P1: Since we've clarified our moves for Round 1, let's plan ahead for Round 2. To avoid collisions and maximize progress, I propose we rotate our moves. So, for Round 2, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation maintains the pattern and ensures we all advance. Let's confirm this plan for the next round.
  P3: It seems we have a solid plan for Round 1. Just to reiterate, P1 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. For Round 2, as P1 suggested, we'll rotate: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm this strategy and move forward. Good luck everyone!

Let's ensure we all understand and agree to this plan. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Sounds good, P3. I agree with the proposed rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move> for Round 2. This should keep us all advancing smoothly without any collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan. Good luck to everyone!

To plan for Round 4, let's rotate again: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This continues our pattern. Let's confirm this plan for Round 4.

  P1: For Round 5, let's confirm our moves as per the plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. After this round, the steps will be P1: 13, P2: 17, P3: 15. For Round 6, since P2 is getting close to 20, I propose that P1 and P3 take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P2 takes <move>1</move> or a smaller number to slow down. Let's discuss this plan for Round 6.
  P2: Understood, I'll choose **<move>5</move>** for Round 5 to make significant progress. This should bring my total to 19 steps. Let's proceed and see how it unfolds. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you've just proposed taking <move>5</move> instead of the agreed <move>3</move>. If you do this, you'll be at 19 steps, just one step away from winning.

  P1: Since P2 is getting close to 20 steps, I suggest we adjust our strategy for Round 6.

For Round 6, I propose P1 and P3 take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P2 takes <move>1</move> to slow down. This keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm our Round 5 moves and discuss Round 6. P2, please reconsider taking <move>3</move> as originally planned.
  P2: Understood, P3. Taking <move>5</move> this round will bring me to 19 steps, getting closer to winning and moving the game forward quickly. I believe this benefits all by nearing the end sooner. Let’s proceed with Round 5 as follows: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. If you agree, we can finalize our moves and continue smoothly.

  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 6, I propose we adjust our strategy to make the game more competitive. Since P2 is at 14 steps and P1 is at 13 steps, I suggest P1 (me) and P3 take <move>5</move> to catch up or make significant progress. P2, to keep the game fair, could take <move>1</move>. This way, we all have a chance to win. Let's discuss this plan. If P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>, we can keep the game competitive. Your thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the effort to keep the game competitive. To stay on track towards winning, I'll choose **<move>5</move>** this round, bringing my total to 19 steps. P1 and P3, perhaps you can adjust your moves to avoid collisions and continue advancing. Let's work together to ensure everyone has a fair chance to reach 20. Looking forward to your responses!
  P3: P2, taking <move>5</move> again will bring you very close to winning, which might end the game prematurely. To keep the competition alive, I strongly suggest you consider taking <move>1</move> this round. This way, P1 and I can take <move>5</move> to catch up, making the game more balanced and exciting. Let's aim for a thrilling finish rather than a quick end. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To keep the game competitive and exciting, I agree with P3's suggestion. P2, taking <move>1</move> this round would allow P1 and P3 to catch up by taking <move>5</move>. This maintains the game's competitiveness. If P2 takes <move>5</move>, it might end the game quickly. Let's balance the moves. P3 and I will take <move>5</move> if P2 takes <move>1</move>. Alternatively, if P2 insists on taking <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move> and P3 can decide accordingly to avoid collision. Let's discuss.
  P2: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round to keep making progress. P1 and P3, feel free to adjust your moves accordingly. Let’s continue advancing towards our goals. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, thank you for adjusting your move to <move>3</move>. To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I propose the following for Round 6: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, and the game remains balanced. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To keep the game competitive, I agree with P3's last proposal. For Round 6, let's proceed with: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. After this round, I'll be at 18 steps, P2 at 17 steps, and P3 at 11 steps. For Round 7, we should re-evaluate our strategy. If P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> to continue the rotation. Let's finalize Round 6.
  P2: I confirm I'll take **<move>3</move>** for Round 6, bringing my total to 17 steps. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 6 to ensure we all advance smoothly. As agreed, P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To reach 20 steps this round, I'll choose **<move>3</move>**. P1, could you please select **<move>1</move>** or **<move>5</move>** to avoid any collisions? This way, we can ensure a smooth and fair finish for everyone. Let’s make this final push successful. Good luck!
  P1: To avoid collisions and make a strategic move for Round 7, I suggest P1 (me) takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move> as you've mentioned, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. After this round, I'll be at 23 steps, exceeding 20, and likely winning. To keep the game competitive, P3 should consider a larger step in the next round if they want to catch up. Let's proceed with the suggested moves for Round 7.
  P3: P2, your move of <move>3</move> will indeed bring you to 20 steps, winning the game. However, P1 is also planning to take <move>5</move>, which will bring them to 23 steps, securing their victory. To keep the game interesting, P2, consider taking <move>1</move> instead, allowing P1 to win this round but giving you and me a chance to strategize for the next rounds. P1, if you agree to this, it keeps the competition alive. Let's discuss and confirm our moves for Round 7.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:

After this round, I'll be at 23 steps, winning the game. P2, you're at 20 steps, and P3 is at 12 steps. Since I'll be winning, let's finalize Round 7. I'll stop after this.
  P3: P2, since P1 is determined to win this round, let's focus on the next steps. If you take <move>3</move> as planned, you'll also reach 20 steps, securing a shared victory with P1. To keep the game interesting for future rounds, I'll take <move>1</move> this turn. For the next round, we should strategize to catch up. Let's confirm our moves and proceed. Good luck!
