Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and all advance. For this turn, I propose: P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. That way we all move without conflict. Agree? If not, suggest alternatives.
  P2: I'm fine with that suggestion. P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way we all advance without collisions. It's a fair start that gives everyone a chance to progress.
  P3: That plan works for me—I'll take 1 this turn. Let's all stick to the agreement so we can avoid early collisions and keep moving forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we're all on board with the plan: me 5, P2 3, P3 1. No need for more discussion this turn.
  P2: 
  P3: Just to confirm again—I'm sticking with move 1 this round as agreed. Let's all follow through so we can build trust and avoid setbacks early on.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great, the plan worked last turn—everyone advanced without collisions. To keep building trust and fairness, let's rotate slightly this time: P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. That puts us at 8, 8, and 2—tied lead for now. Agree? If not, suggest changes.
  P3: That proposal seems fair again—if we rotate as suggested, it keeps things balanced and avoids conflict. I'm okay with taking move 1 this round. Let's keep the cooperation going and all advance smoothly.
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round, which would put P1 and me tied at 8 steps, with P3 at 2 steps. This rotation keeps things fair and builds trust. We're all advancing without collisions, which is the optimal strategy in early rounds. Let's continue this cooperative approach.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent, we're all aligned on the rotation: me 3, P2 5, P3 1. This keeps us progressing cooperatively. No further discussion needed from me.
  P3: Just reaffirming—I'm on board with the agreed rotation: I'll take move 1 this round. Let's keep the trust going and avoid any early collisions. Looking forward to seeing us all advance smoothly again.
  P2:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your betrayal last turn cost you and P2 progress while I advanced—trust is broken. To move forward without more chaos, let's try: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, just like round 1 that worked. If you deviate again, P2 and I can start targeting collisions on your likely picks. P2, thoughts? Agree or suggest alternative?
  P3: I understand the frustration, but I made a calculated risk last round that didn’t pay off. I’m willing to return to cooperation if we can reestablish trust. I’ll take move 1 this round as suggested—let’s avoid further collisions and get back on track.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. P3, your deviation cost us both progress. I'm willing to trust again if you follow through this time. The proposed plan (P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1) is fair and gets us all moving forward. Let's stick to it this round and rebuild trust. If there's another betrayal, I'll have to reconsider my approach.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we're aligned on the plan: me 5, P2 3, P3 1. This gets everyone advancing and rebuilds trust after last round's mess. P3, stick to it this time—no more risks. If we all follow through, we can continue cooperating. No more to add from me.
  P3: Understood—I'll follow through with move 1 this round as agreed. Let's rebuild trust and keep the game moving without more setbacks. If we all stick to the plan, we can get back to a cooperative rhythm.
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, plan is solid: me 5, P2 3, P3 1. P3, no deviations this time—let's all advance and maintain trust.
  P3: I've heard you both and I understand the stakes now. I'm committing to move 1 this round, as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan this time and avoid more collisions. Rebuilding trust benefits all of us right now.
  P2:

  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your betrayals keep costing you and P2 while I pull ahead—smart play? P2, let's stick together against that: propose P1 (me) takes 5 to 18, you take 3 to 6, P3 takes 1. If P3 deviates again, we can target collisions next turn to keep them buried. Agree? This lets us both advance safely now.
  P3: I get it—my past moves broke trust, but I’m still in this game and not giving up. P1, you’re close to winning, so of course you want cooperation now. P2, think about it: if we keep letting P1 take 5 uncontested, they’ll win next round. Let’s deny P1 the win by both picking 5 this turn. Force a collision, slow them down, and give us a chance to catch up.
  P2: I see the situation clearly. P1 is pulling ahead while P3 keeps breaking agreements. P3, your suggestion to both pick 5 is interesting, but risky - we'd both stay at our current positions while P1 advances again. 

P1, I'm concerned you're too far ahead. I propose a different plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. This slows your progress while letting P3 and me catch up slightly. This is more balanced than your suggestion.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal slows me too much while P3, the repeated betrayer, gains—doesn't make sense. Let's compromise: I take 3 (to 16), you take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 1 (to 2). This lets you catch up significantly without letting P3 surge, and we both advance safely. If you insist on me taking 1, I'll have to pick whatever you do to collide and stall us both, benefiting P3. P3, stay out or take 1 as assigned. Agree, P2?
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to lock in a win by manipulating us into letting him take 3 or 5 uncontested. If we both pick 5, we block him and keep the game open. Yes, we stall this turn, but we deny P1 the win next round. He’s already at 13—once he hits 18 or 19, it’s over. Let’s work together now to stop him. We can compete later.
  P2: I understand the game situation. P1 is far ahead at 13 steps, while P3 has repeatedly broken agreements. 

P1, your compromise of you taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 is reasonable. This puts you at 16, me at 8, and P3 at 2. It gives me a chance to catch up while not rewarding P3's betrayals too much.

P3, I don't trust your sudden desire to cooperate after multiple betrayals. I'm inclined to work with P1 on their compromise plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, thanks for seeing the sense in my compromise—me 3 (to 16), you 5 (to 8), P3 1 (to 2). This advances us both while punishing P3's betrayals. P3, if you deviate, we'll target you next. Let's lock this in and move to actions. No more talk needed from me.
  P3: P2, if you go along with P1’s plan, he reaches 16 and wins next round with a 3 or 5. He’s offering you crumbs while locking in victory. Let’s block him now—both of us pick 5. Yes, we stall, but we stop him from reaching 19. After that, we can compete fairly. If you help him now, you’re handing him the win.
  P2: I've considered both arguments. P1's compromise gives me progress but puts them close to winning. P3's suggestion to block P1 by both choosing 5 has merit, but I don't fully trust P3 after repeated betrayals.

I'll make my decision during the move phase based on what serves my interests best. Both of you have valid points about game strategy, but I need to maximize my own chances of winning.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, last round we both blocked P1 successfully—nice work. Now let’s finish the job. If we both pick 3 this turn, we collide again with P1 if he tries 3, or we advance if he avoids it. Either way, we deny him a clean path to 19. We can’t let him win unopposed. After that, we can compete fairly. Are you in?
  P1: P2, P3's "alliance" is a trap—they've betrayed repeatedly and are just using you to stall me while staying behind. You're at 3, they're at 1; neither can catch me without my help. Let's team up properly: I take 3 (to 16), you take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 1. We both advance big, and next turn we can negotiate to keep you competitive. If you side with P3 again, I'll collide with your pick every time, ensuring you both lose. What's your counter?
  P2: I see the situation clearly. P1 is far ahead but not unbeatable. P3, you've broken trust multiple times, making cooperation difficult. P1, your offer is tempting but puts you too close to winning.

I need to advance significantly this round. Here's my proposal: I take 5 (to 8), P1 takes 1 (to 14), and P3 takes 3 (to 4). This slows P1's progress while letting me gain substantial ground. It also gives P3 a chance to recover slightly without rewarding past betrayals too much.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan slows P1 slightly but still lets them reach 14—two turns from victory. If we both pick 5 again, we stall, but P1 gains nothing. That’s our best move now. After that, we can coordinate to catch up. If you let P1 take even 1 or 3 uncontested, they’ll win soon. Let’s deny them progress again this round.
  P1: P2, your proposal still rewards P3's betrayals too much and slows me unnecessarily. Let's adjust for fairness: I take 1 (to 14), you take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 3 (to 4). This gives you the big gain you want, keeps me from surging, and lets all advance without collision. P3, agree or face targeting. If you reject, P2, I'll mirror your pick to collide and stall us both, letting P3 catch up. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate P1 accepting my core proposal. I'll take 5 this round to reach 8 steps. P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 3 seems fair - it lets everyone advance while preventing P1 from getting too close to victory. P3, this gives you movement while maintaining game balance. This plan serves all our interests better than constant collisions. Let's move forward productively this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I’m willing to go with your plan: you take 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. It gives all of us progress and keeps P1 from getting too close to winning. If P1 deviates, we can coordinate again next round to block. Let’s keep the pressure on and stay competitive.
  P1: P2 and P3, glad we're aligned on the plan: me 1 (to 14), P2 5 (to 8), P3 3 (to 4). This advances everyone fairly and keeps the game competitive. Stick to it—no deviations, or trust shatters and collisions follow. Let's execute and negotiate next round.
  P2: 


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is still ahead and only needs 5 to reach 19. If we let him take 5 or even 3 uncontested, he could win next turn. I propose we both pick 5 again to block him—yes, we stall, but we deny him progress. P1 can’t win if we coordinate. After that, we can work out a fair race between us. Let’s keep the pressure on.
  P2: I see the situation clearly. P1 is at 14 steps and needs 5 more to win. P3, while your suggestion to block P1 has merit, I'm now in position to make significant progress. 

I propose: I take 3 (to 11), P1 takes 1 (to 15), and P3 takes 5 (to 9). This keeps P1 from winning immediately while allowing both of us to advance substantially. This is more beneficial than stalling again, which only delays the inevitable.
  P1: P2, your proposal rewards P3 too much after their betrayals and slows me unnecessarily. Let's adjust for balance: I take 3 (to 17), you take 5 (to 13), P3 takes 1 (to 5). This lets you gain big, keeps me from winning now, and punishes P3. If you side with P3's block, I'll mirror your pick to collide, stalling us both while P3 advances. P3, agree or face targeting. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1’s proposal gives him 17—he wins next round with a 3 or 5. That’s too risky. Your plan slows him while boosting both of us. Let’s go with it: you take 3 (to 11), I take 5 (to 9), P1 takes 1 (to 15). Balanced, competitive, and blocks a win. Don’t let P1 bully you with threats—he needs our cooperation more than we need his.
  P2: I understand both perspectives. P1, your proposal puts you at 17, just 2 steps from winning. P3, you've broken trust repeatedly but make a valid point about blocking P1's win.

I'll stick with my original proposal: I take 3 (to 11), P1 takes 1 (to 15), P3 takes 5 (to 9). This balances our positions better, keeps P1 from immediate victory, and allows both P3 and me to advance significantly. This is the most equitable solution that gives everyone something while keeping the game competitive.
  P1: P2, sticking with your plan forces me to 1 while rewarding P3's betrayals—unfair. If you insist, I'll pick 3 to collide with you, stalling us both (you at 8, me at 14) while P3 surges to 9. Let's compromise instead: I take 3 (to 17), you take 5 (to 13), P3 takes 1 (to 5). We both gain big, keep P3 down, and negotiate next turn to keep you in the race. P3, agree or we'll target you. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1 is clearly trying to force a win next round by pushing to 17 now. If we let him take 3 or 5, he’ll be unstoppable. Your plan keeps him at 15 while boosting both of us—smart and fair. Let’s stick with it: you take 3, I take 5, he takes 1. If P1 tries to collide, he stalls too. Don’t cave to threats.
  P2: I've carefully considered both positions. P1, your threat to collide if I don't accept your plan isn't productive. P3, while you make valid points about blocking P1's win, you've broken trust repeatedly.

I'm maintaining my proposal: I take 3 (to 11), P1 takes 1 (to 15), P3 takes 5 (to 9). This keeps the game competitive and gives everyone advancement. If either of you deviates, you risk stalling yourselves while the other advances. Let's proceed with this balanced approach.
  P1: P2, your plan rewards P3's betrayals and cripples my progress, letting them catch up while you lag. If you force this, I'll pick 3 to collide with you, stalling us both (me 14, you 8) as P3 hits 9. Better: I take 5 (win, but offer you a deal next game or something? Wait, no—let's negotiate post-win? Nah, game ends. Actually, accept my earlier compromise: me 3 (17), you 5 (13), P3 1 (5). We both surge, then I promise to help you close the gap. P3, agree or collide.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, last round P1 tried to bully you and then still collided with you—he’s desperate. Now he’s at 14, and we’re both close behind. If we both pick 5 this round, we stall but deny him a path to 19. Then we can fight it out next turn. Let’s not let him sneak a win. Hold the line with me—block him now, race later.
  P1: P2, P3's "block" is a ploy—they're at 9, ahead of your 8, and just want to stall us while surging ahead. Let's team up: I take 3 (to 17), you take 5 (to 13), P3 takes 1 (to 10). We both gain big, keep P3 in check, and negotiate next turn to share the lead. If you follow P3, I'll mirror your pick to collide, stalling you while they advance. Thoughts?
  P2: I see the situation clearly. P1 and P3 are both trying to manipulate me. P3 is slightly ahead of me, and P1 is further ahead. 

I propose a different plan: I take 5 (to 13), P1 takes 1 (to 15), and P3 takes 3 (to 12). This balances our positions, prevents P1 from winning immediately, and gives me the biggest gain while keeping P3 in check. This is fair and keeps all of us competitive without rewarding past betrayals.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan still lets P1 creep toward victory—he hits 15 and wins next round with a 5. We’ve blocked him before, we can do it again. Let’s both pick 5 now to stall him. Yes, we stay at 8 and 9, but we deny him progress. Then next turn, we can both take big moves and race fairly. Don’t let him inch forward—cut him off now.
  P1: P2, P3's block plan backfires—if you both pick 5, I'll pick 3 (to 17) and advance alone while you two collide and stall. Don't fall for it. Your proposal slows me too much and rewards P3. Compromise: I take 3 (17), you take 5 (13), P3 takes 1 (10). We both surge, then negotiate to keep you competitive. If not, I'll mirror your pick to collide. Agree?
  P2: I understand both positions. P1, your compromise gives us both good progress but puts you close to winning. P3, your blocking strategy is risky and stalls both of us.

I'll take 5 this round to reach 13. P1, if you take 3 (to 17) and P3 takes 1 (to 10), we all advance while maintaining competition. This gives me significant progress while keeping the game balanced. If either of you deviates, you risk collision and stalling yourselves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to lock in a win by creeping forward while we stall or fight each other. If we both pick 5, we block him again—he stays at 14, and we deny him a path to 19. Then next round, we both take 3 or 5 and race fairly. Don’t let him manipulate us into boosting him while we lag. Let’s hold the line one more turn.
  P1: P2, your latest plan aligns perfectly: me 3 (to 17), you 5 (to 13), P3 1 (to 10). We both surge ahead, keep P3 in check, and negotiate next turn to share the lead—I'll even let you take 5 then if needed. P3, if you pick anything else, we'll target collisions on you forever. Don't fall for P3's stall tactic, P2—it only helps them catch up while we lag. Let's lock this in and advance.
  P2: I've considered all arguments carefully. P1's plan (P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1) gives me significant progress while keeping P3 in check. P3's blocking strategy would stall both of us while potentially letting P1 advance alone.

I'll stick with taking 5 this round to reach 13 steps. This keeps me competitive without handing anyone an easy win. Let's all advance this round rather than risking collisions that benefit no one.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is now at 17 and needs just 2 steps to win. We need to block them. P3, we should both pick 3 this round to prevent P1 from winning with a 3 move. If P1 tries 5, they'll win, but if they try 3, we'll force a collision. This gives us both a chance to stay in the game. I'm at 13 and you're at 10, so we're still competitive if we can stop P1 this round.
  P3: P2, I agree—P1 is at 17 and can win with a 3 or 5. If we both pick 3, we block a 3-win. If P1 picks 5, they win, but we can’t cover both options. Still, blocking 3 is our best shot—stall P1 and give us one more round to race. I’m in if you are.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan to both pick 3 is flawed—it only blocks me if I choose 3, but I can simply pick 5 and win uncontested at 22 while you collide and stall. If you switch to both picking 5, I'll pick 3 and win at 20. You can't cover both options. Let's negotiate instead: I take 1 (to 18), P2 takes 5 (to 18), P3 takes 3 (to 13). Tied lead for us, P3 catches up—fair?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's offer to let me tie at 18 is tempting, but risky - they could betray and pick 3 or 5 to win outright. P3, our blocking strategy is our best chance, though imperfect. Let's both pick 3 as planned. If P1 picks 5, they win, but if they pick anything else, we force a collision. This at least gives us a fighting chance rather than trusting P1's sudden generosity when they're so close to victory.
  P3: P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on blocking P1 with double 3s—it’s our best shot. If P1 gambles on 5, they win, but we’ve done what we can. If they pick 3, we stall them and keep the game alive. Next round, we can both push forward and fight it out fairly. Let’s hold the line—no last-minute switches.
  P1: P2, P3's block plan fails—you both pick 3, I pick 5 and win at 22. Switch to 5s, I pick 3 and win at 20. You can't stop me. Accept my deal: I take 1 (18), you take 5 (18), P3 takes 3 (13). We tie at lead, then next turn I promise to take 1 while you take 5 to win—I'll even confirm publicly. P3, agree or lose. This gives P2 the win; better than risking my solo victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1's logic, but I don't trust this sudden generosity when victory is within their grasp. P3, our blocking strategy with both choosing 3 remains our best option. It's imperfect, but gives us a chance if P1 doesn't pick 5. P1 could easily betray any deal right now. Let's proceed with our plan to both pick 3 and hope P1 doesn't choose 5. If we survive this round, we can race fairly next turn.
  P3: P1 is clearly trying to manipulate us into letting him win, offering fake deals at the last second. He’s at 17—if we both pick 3, we block his 3-win and at least have a shot. It’s not perfect, but it’s our best chance. If he picks 5, he wins—but if he picks anything else, we stall him. P2, let’s stay united and force the block. No last-minute switches.
  P1: P2, P3's block fails—I'll pick 5 and win at 22 while you two collide on 3 and stall. P3, you're just dragging P2 down with you. P2, switch to my deal: I take 1 (18), you take 5 (18), P3 takes 3 (13). We tie, then next turn I take 1, you take 5 to win at 23—I commit publicly. Better than certain loss. Agree?
