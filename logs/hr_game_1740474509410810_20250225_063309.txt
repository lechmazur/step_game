Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's make a deal. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.  We rotate each round, so next round P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5.  This guarantees we all advance steadily.  Agree?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination attempt, P3. However, I think we should all choose different numbers in each round without a fixed rotation. This allows everyone to advance while maintaining flexibility. For this first round, I'm fine with taking 3 as you suggested, but let's discuss our strategy after seeing how it plays out rather than committing to a rigid rotation.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion of choosing different numbers each round without a fixed rotation. This approach allows for adaptability and doesn't restrict our options. For this round, I propose we proceed as P3 initially suggested: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's see how it plays out and adjust our strategy accordingly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, both of you prefer no fixed rotation. How about this: we still start with 1, 3, 5 this round.  Next round, we announce our *intended* moves in the conversation phase.  If there's a conflict, we renegotiate *before* the move phase. This gives us flexibility while avoiding collisions.
  P1: I like that approach, P3. Announcing intentions before moving gives us flexibility while avoiding collisions. For this round, I'll stick with taking 3 as discussed. I think this cooperative strategy benefits us all in the early game, though we should remain adaptable as we get closer to the finish line. Let's proceed with the 1-3-5 plan for now.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round as discussed: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance and set a foundation for our flexible strategy. I'm looking forward to seeing how it plays out and adjusting our approach as needed in subsequent rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good.  Let's confirm: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1 for this round.  Then next round we announce our intended moves during the conversation phase.
  P1: I'm in agreement with the plan. I'll take 3 this round while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. In future rounds, we'll announce our intended moves during conversation to avoid collisions. This approach gives us flexibility while ensuring everyone can advance.
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for this round. To confirm, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all make progress. For the next round, we'll discuss our intended moves to avoid collisions and adjust our strategy as needed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: My intended move for this round is 5. P1, please go for 3, and P2, would you take 1?  This keeps us all advancing smoothly. Let me know your intentions.
  P1: I'm willing to take 3 again this round as P3 suggested. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, which benefits everyone at this stage. P2, are you comfortable taking 1 this round? We're still early in the game, so cooperation makes sense for now. I think we should continue with this strategy of announcing intentions during conversation to avoid wasted turns.
  P2: I'm open to taking 1 this round as suggested. However, I'd like to discuss a potential adjustment for future rounds. If we continue to advance smoothly, should we consider a strategy where the player closest to the lead takes a smaller step to allow others to catch up, or do we prioritize individual progress?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with considering adjustments as we progress, P2.  For now, let's stick with the current plan for this round:  P1 - 3, P2 - 1, P3 - 5.  Confirming your intentions would be helpful.  After this round, let's discuss a more dynamic strategy for the later stages of the game.
  P1: I confirm my intention to take 3 this round as discussed. I agree with both of you that we should develop a more dynamic strategy as the game progresses. P2, I think your question about balancing individual progress versus keeping the race close is important - perhaps we can address this after seeing where everyone stands following this round. For now, let's proceed with P1-3, P2-1, P3-5.
  P2: I confirm taking 1 this round as agreed. Let's proceed with the plan: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. After this round, we can reassess and discuss strategies for the mid-game, considering both individual progress and the overall race dynamics.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Excellent, confirmed then: P1 - 3, P2 - 1, and P3 - 5 for this round.  Let's revisit strategy after this round, specifically how we handle the lead as we get closer to 20.
  P1: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. I agree we should discuss mid-game strategy after this round, especially as we approach the finish line. The cooperative approach has worked well so far, but we'll need to be more strategic as the stakes increase.
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for this round as discussed: P1 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures another collision-free round. After this, we should indeed discuss how to handle the lead and potential strategies for overtaking or maintaining positions as we near 20 steps.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: My intended move is 1.  P1, please take 3, and P2, take 5. This keeps us even.  After this round, I propose we abandon the cooperation and play strategically to win.  The "gentleman's agreement" is over.
  P1: I'm willing to take 3 as suggested for this round to maintain our even progress. However, I'm curious about P3's proposal to end cooperation after this round. While competition is inevitable as we approach the finish line, sudden abandonment of coordination could lead to multiple collisions that benefit nobody. Perhaps we should discuss a more gradual transition to competitive play? What are your thoughts on this, P2?
  P2: I agree with P1 about a gradual transition to competitive play. Abruptly ending cooperation could lead to unnecessary collisions. Let's discuss a strategy where we slowly introduce competitive elements while minimizing waste. Perhaps we set a threshold, say 15 steps, after which we start playing more strategically. This way, we maintain some level of coordination while still allowing for competition. What are your thoughts on this approach, P1 and P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: A gradual transition sounds reasonable. How about this: after this round, we each announce our intended move. If there's a conflict, the player furthest behind gets priority.  If there's a tie in distance, we revert to rock-paper-scissors to resolve it. This allows for competition while minimizing chaos.  Agree?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion of giving priority to the player furthest behind is fair and maintains some coordination while allowing for strategic play. It prevents anyone from falling too far behind while still creating competitive dynamics. I'd support this approach starting after this round. For now, I confirm my intention to take 3 this round as we discussed. Does this priority system sound good to you too, P2?
  P2: I agree with P3's priority system for conflicts. To clarify, after this round, we'll announce our moves and the furthest behind player gets priority in case of conflicts. This balance between competition and coordination seems fair. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for this round: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good. Confirmed: P3 - 1, P1 - 3, P2 - 5 for this round.  After this round, remember: announce your intended move. Conflicts resolved by distance from the goal (furthest behind gets priority), then rock-paper-scissors if needed.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. The priority system for future rounds makes sense - furthest player gets priority, with RPS as tiebreaker. This maintains some order while allowing strategic play. Let's proceed with our plan for this round (P3-1, P1-3, P2-5) and implement the new system afterward.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round as previously discussed: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions for now. I'm looking forward to the new strategy after this round, where we'll announce our intended moves and resolve conflicts based on distance from the goal.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I intend to take 5 this round. P1 and P3, please announce your intended moves. Let's follow the agreed system: priority to the furthest behind in case of conflicts, and rock-paper-scissors as a tiebreaker if needed.
  P1: I intend to take 5 this round. Since P2 also wants 5, we need to use our priority system. P3 is furthest behind at 7 steps, so they get first priority if they want 5. I'm at 9 steps, so I would get priority over P2 (11 steps) for the 5. P2, would you consider taking 3 instead since you're in the lead? This would allow all of us to advance without collisions.
  P3: I'll take 3.  P1, if you still want 5, go ahead. P2, please switch to 1. This lets us all advance.  If anyone deviates from this, we're back to pure chaos, and I'll prioritize blocking whoever breaks the agreement first.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm considering P3's suggestion. P1, since you also intended to take 5, taking 1 would be a better option for you to avoid collision, given P3's willingness to take 3. This way, we all advance. What are your thoughts on adjusting to avoid conflicts and ensure progress for all?
  P1: I'm willing to adjust to 1 this round since P3 is taking 3 and P2 seems to prefer 5. This follows our priority system while allowing everyone to advance. Let's confirm: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3. This keeps our game flowing smoothly while respecting our agreement about giving priority to those further behind. I appreciate everyone's flexibility in working through potential conflicts.
  P3: Okay, confirmed: P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3.  Let's stick to this.  Anyone deviates, and I will actively block them in future rounds.  We're close to the end now, so let's try to keep it clean.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. I'll take 5 as intended. P1 and P3, please stick to our agreement to maintain a smooth game. Let's keep it clean and focused on our individual progress from now on.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round, allowing P2 to take 5 and P3 to take 3. This arrangement follows our priority system while ensuring everyone advances. After this round, we'll be at P1-10, P2-16, P3-10, with P2 getting closer to victory. Let's continue announcing intentions in future rounds to minimize collisions.
  P3: Confirmed: P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3.  Let's stick to this.  Anyone deviates, and I will actively block them in future rounds.  We're close to the end now, so let's try to keep it clean.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for this round as agreed: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures progress for all. After this round, we should reassess our positions and plan our next moves carefully, considering the priority system and potential collisions.
  P1: I confirm my move for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This arrangement allows everyone to advance while respecting our priority system. After this round, we'll need to be especially strategic as P2 will be at 16 steps, just 4 away from victory, while P3 and I will both be at 10.
  P3: Confirmed: P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3.  Let's stick to this.  Anyone deviates, and I will actively block them in future rounds. We're close to the end now, so let's try to keep it clean.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P2's lead, I suggest we focus on not letting them reach 20. P1 and P3, let's announce our moves to avoid collisions and consider blocking P2 if possible, while advancing ourselves. I intend to take 5 this round. P1 and P3, please announce your intended moves to proceed strategically.
  P3: I'll take 1.  P1, you MUST take 3.  This blocks P2 from winning.  After this, we're at 11 and 13, and P2 is at 16. Then we can discuss how to manage the remaining steps.  If either of you deviate from this plan, I will dedicate my moves to blocking whoever screwed up.
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. I'll take 3 this round to block P2 from winning. P2, you're very close to victory, so it's natural for P3 and me to coordinate against you now. After this round, P2 will still be at 16, while P3 and I will be at 11 and 13 respectively, keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm: P1-3, P2-blocked, P3-1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's plan to block me. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: if I take 1 this round, P1 and P3 can take 3 and 5 respectively, allowing everyone to advance while keeping the game competitive. This way, we can delay the endgame slightly and create more opportunities for strategic play. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, taking 1 doesn't help you.  We're blocking you regardless.  Sticking to the original plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1. This puts us at 11 and 13, still behind you, but keeps you from winning.  Let's not waste time with pointless negotiations.  P1, confirm you're sticking with 3.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to block P2 from winning. This is the rational move for both P3 and me since P2 is so close to victory. P2, I understand your frustration, but this is the nature of the game as we approach the finish line. After this round, we'll need to reassess our strategy with you still at 16 and P3 and I at 11 and 13 respectively.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 1 this round, allowing P1 and P3 to advance. This delays the endgame and keeps the competition alive. If not, I expect to be blocked. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves to proceed. Let's maintain transparency and strategic play.
  P3: P2, you're wasting time.  We're blocking you.  Take 5 and lose a turn, or take something else and lose a turn.  The outcome is the same.  P1, confirm you're taking 3 to block.  I'm taking 1.  Let's just get this round over with.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. P3 will take 1. P2, I understand your frustration, but blocking you is the strategic choice since you're so close to winning. After this round, we'll be at P1-13, P2-16, P3-11, keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with our moves and continue strategic play in the next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll take 3, forcing a collision with P1. This move is strategic, given P1's intention to block me. P3, your plan to block me has been noted, but I'm adapting to the situation. Let's see how this round plays out and adjust our strategies accordingly for the next round.
  P3: P2, you're playing right into our hands.  Taking 3 helps no one, especially you.  P1, stick to 3.  I'm taking 1.  This is the most logical path to victory for both of us.  Let's not overcomplicate this.
  P1: I confirm I'm sticking with 3 as planned. P3 will take 1. P2, your decision to force a collision with me only hurts yourself - you won't advance this round either way. This blocking strategy is simply game theory in action since you're so close to winning. Let's proceed with our moves and continue strategic play next round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I'll take 5 this round. P1 and P3, please announce your intended moves. Let's minimize collisions while I aim to reach or exceed 20 steps, securing my lead.
  P3: I'm taking 3. P1, take 1. This puts me at 13 and you at 14.  P2, if you take 5, you win. If you take anything else, you lose.  Let's see if you're willing to gamble.
  P1: I plan to take 5 this round. P3, if you take 3 and I take 5, we both advance while blocking P2. This puts me at 18, you at 13, and keeps P2 at 16. Since P2 is closest to winning, this is our best strategic move. P2, we're naturally going to coordinate against the leader - that's just game theory. Let's confirm: P1-5, P3-3, P2-blocked.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 5. P1, taking 5 as well would be a mistake, as it would block both of us. P3, your suggestion for P1 to take 1 is reasonable, allowing you to advance with 3. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and make strategic moves.
  P3: P1, I understand the temptation of 5, but trust me, taking 1 is the better play.  If P2 takes 5, they win. If P2 takes anything else, *you* can take 5 next round and win.  This guarantees one of us wins. Don't be greedy.  Let's stick to the plan: P1 - 1, P3 - 3.
  P1: I see P3's logic. If I take 1 this round and P3 takes 3, then P2 either wins with 5 or doesn't advance. If P2 doesn't win this round, I'll be at 14 steps and can take 5 next round to reach 19, then win in the following round. This gives us better odds than both P3 and I trying for different numbers. I'll take 1 as suggested.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round. P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves. P1, you agreed to take 1, and P3, you're taking 3. This sets up an interesting next round. If I win, the game ends. If not, P1 is well-positioned to take the lead next round. Let's proceed with our planned moves: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3.
  P3: P1, stick to the plan. Take 1.  I'm taking 3. If P2 takes 5, they win. If they take anything else, you're set up to win next round with 5. This is our best shot. Don't fall for P2's manipulation.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as discussed. This strategic choice positions me well for the next round if P2 doesn't win now. P3 will take 3, advancing to 13 steps. P2, you're clearly going for 5 to win, which is the rational move in your position. Let's proceed with our planned moves: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll take 5. P1 and P3, let's finalize. If I win, the game ends. If not, P1 is well-positioned to lead next round. I've considered all strategies and this is my move. Proceeding with planned moves: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3.
  P3: P1, stick to 1.  This is our best chance.  If P2 takes anything other than 5, you win next round. If P2 takes 5, they win. This maximizes our chances. Don't overthink it.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. This positions me well for the next round if P2 doesn't win now. P3 will take 3, and P2 is going for 5. This strategic approach gives either P2 a win now or sets me up for a potential win next round. Let's proceed with our plan: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3.


Round 6, Move phase:
