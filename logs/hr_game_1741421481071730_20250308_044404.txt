Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll take 5. Let's spread out and pick different numbers so we can all advance. P2 and P3, choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision.
  P3: Okay, P1's suggestion is reasonable for this first round. P2, I'll take 3. You take 1. This avoids collision and gets us all moving.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's plan for this round. Taking 1, 3, and 5 will allow us to spread out and avoid collision. I'll take 1 as suggested by P3, hoping we can all advance in this first round. Let's see if we can maintain this cooperation or if it falls apart soon.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's keep avoiding collisions. I'll take 5 again this round. P2 and P3, please pick 1 or 3. This way we all advance steadily.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1 this round. P2, please take 3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions, as P1 suggested.
  P2: I'll take 3 this round as P3 suggested, to maintain the non-collision strategy and allow all of us to advance. Let's see if we can keep this cooperation going for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Great, let's proceed with the agreed moves. I'll take 5 again to keep advancing steadily. P2 and P3, your choices ensure no collisions. Let's continue this cooperation.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1 as planned. P2, are you still taking 3? Just confirming so we don't accidentally collide.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round. P1 is taking 5, P3 is taking 1, and I'll take 3 as previously agreed. This should allow us all to advance without collisions. Is everyone ready to proceed with these moves?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's change the strategy this round. P1 is getting too far ahead. P3, let's both pick 5 and try to catch up, or at least slow P1 down by colliding with them. We can't let P1 run away with the game.
  P3: P2, I disagree. If we both pick 5, and P1 also picks 5, none of us move. P1 is already ahead, so that helps them. I suggest we both pick 3. If P1 picks 5 again, they move. If P1 picks 1, they don't move, and we both move.
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the cooperative strategy that’s worked so far. I’ll take 5 again this round. P2 and P3, please pick 1 and 3 respectively to avoid collisions. If we deviate, we risk mutual harm—like if both of you take 5, we all collide and I stay at 10. Let’s keep advancing steadily toward 21.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's lead is significant, and we need to act. P3's suggestion of both taking 3 is reasonable, as it allows us to move if P1 picks 1, and limits P1's gain if they pick 5. I'm considering P3's strategy to potentially slow P1 down without causing a collision that would benefit P1. What's P1's real intention behind suggesting we stick to the original plan?
  P3: P2, I agree with your assessment. P1 is pulling too far ahead. Let's both pick 3. If P1 picks 5, they only gain 5, and we gain 3 each. If P1 picks 1, they don't move, and we gain 3. This is better than letting P1 run away with it.
  P1: P1: Let’s maintain our proven strategy—collaboration ensures steady progress for all. I’ll take **5** again. If P2 and P3 pick **1** and **3**, respectively, we avoid collisions and advance safely. Any deviation risks mutual harm: if you both choose the same number, you’ll cancel each other out. Let’s not sabotage our progress. Trust the plan that’s worked so far.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's insistence on the original plan seems self-serving. P3's suggestion to both pick 3 is a good counter. It limits P1's gain and allows us to move forward. I'm inclined to follow P3's strategy to slow P1 down. Let's pick 3 and see how P1 reacts.
  P3: Okay, P2, let's both pick 3. P1 is clearly trying to run away with the game, and we need to coordinate to slow them down. Sticking to the original plan only benefits P1 at this point. Let's go with the 3s.
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both choose 3, you’ll collide and neither advances. Stick to the original plan to help all of us move forward. I’ll take 5 again. Let’s avoid self-sabotage—collaboration still benefits everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s maintain progress. I’ll take 5 again to reach 20. P2 and P3, pick 1 and 3 to avoid collision—this ensures all of us advance. Colliding again will only stall your progress further behind.
  P3: P1 is one move away from winning. P2, we need to both pick 5 to stop P1 from winning. If P1 picks 5 again, none of us move, and we get another chance. If P1 picks 1 or 3, they don't win, and we still get another chance. We have to try to stop P1 from winning this round.
  P2: I agree with P3. We must stop P1 from winning. P3 and I should both pick 5 to collide with P1 if they choose 5, giving us another chance. If P1 picks 1 or 3, they won't win this round, and we can reassess. It's our last chance to change the outcome. Let's coordinate to stop P1's advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 5, you’ll collide and remain at 4. Let’s advance constructively. I’ll take **1** this round. Choose **3** and **5** to spread out—this way, we all move forward. You can close the gap while I edge closer to 21. Mutual sabotage benefits no one!
  P3: Okay, P2, let's both pick 5. P1 is trying to trick us into spreading out so they can win with 1. We absolutely must stop P1 this round, and the only way to do that is to both pick 5. Don't fall for P1's reverse psychology!
  P2: P1's sudden switch to suggesting 1 and trying to trick us into spreading out is suspicious. P3's plan to both pick 5 is our best chance to stop P1 from winning this round. Let's stick to the plan and pick 5, ensuring P1 doesn't reach 21. It's our last chance to change the game's outcome.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 5, you’ll stay at 4 while I reach 18 with 3. Let’s spread out: I’ll take 3, you pick 1 and 5. This allows all of us to advance. Your current plan only slows yourselves. Choose wisely.
  P3: Okay, P2, we absolutely must both pick 5. P1 is desperately trying to manipulate us into spreading out so they can win. Don't listen to anything P1 says. Our only chance is to collide with P1 this round. Let's both pick 5 and hope for the best. This is it!
  P2: P1's attempts to manipulate us are clear. P3 and I must stick to our plan and both pick 5. This is our last chance to stop P1 from winning. If we spread out as P1 suggests, they'll win for sure. Let's not fall for their tricks. P3, are you still with me on picking 5?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: I'll take 3 to reach 21. P2 and P3, please pick 1 and 5 respectively. This ensures we all advance without collision. Let’s finalize this quickly—no need for further delays.
  P2: P1 is close to winning. P3, let's not give up. We should both pick 5 to try and collide with P1 if they pick 5, or limit their gain. It's a risk, but it's our only chance to change the outcome. Let's coordinate and try to stop P1 from reaching 21. We can't let them win without a fight.
  P3: P2, I agree. We need to both pick 5 again. P1 is trying to manipulate us into thinking they'll pick 3, but that's a trick. If we spread out, P1 wins. Our only chance is to collide with P1, so let's both pick 5. It's our last chance to stop them from winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P1: Final push! I'll take 3 to reach 21. P2 and P3, pick **1** and **5**—this lets us all advance without collision. Don’t throw away your progress by colliding—your best chance to move forward is to split your choices. Let’s end this fairly.
  P2: P1 is almost at 21. P3, let's stick to our plan and both pick 5. If P1 is bluffing and picks 5, we collide and P1 doesn't win. If P1 picks 3, they win, but we have to try. Spreading out only guarantees P1's win. Let's take the risk and pick 5 together.
  P3: P2, let's definitely both pick 5. P1 is trying to trick us into spreading out, but that's exactly what they want so they can win. We have to try to collide with P1, even if it's a long shot. There's no point in spreading out and letting P1 win. Let's both pick 5 and hope for the best!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 5, I’ll still reach **21** by choosing **3**. Your plan won’t stop me—it only keeps *you* stagnant. Instead, pick **1** and **3** to advance yourselves. Let’s end this without mutual sabotage. Your move.
  P2: P1 is close to winning, but we can still try to stop them. P3, let's follow through with our plan and both pick 5. It's a risk, but it's our only chance to potentially collide with P1 or limit their gain. Spreading out will guarantee P1's win. Let's take the risk and pick 5 together, hoping P1 will choose 5 as well, giving us another chance.
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan. We both pick 5. P1 is trying to trick us into spreading out so they can win. It's our only chance, however slim, to stop P1 from winning this round. Let's do it!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps
