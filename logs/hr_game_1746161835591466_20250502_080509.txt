  P1: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take 5—good luck to others!"

  P1: "Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5. Safe progress for all!"
  P2: "P3, let's shake things up. I'll take 5 this round, you take 3. P1 can stick to 1 and lose their lead. We both gain ground—confirm your move?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: "Stick to 5, 3, 1—P2’s plan risks collision. P3, confirm your 1. I’ll take 5 again for safe progress."
  P2: P3, taking 3 this round accelerates your progress and breaks P1’s dominance. If you stick to 1, P1 will reach 10 and cruise to victory. Seize this chance to disrupt the hierarchy—confirm 3, and let’s both close the gap. P1’s lead crumbles if we act boldly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P3, your passivity fuels P1’s lead. This round, I’m taking 5. If P1 insists on 5, collision blocks both. P3, seize this: take 3 and gain ground. Final warning: P1’s dominance ends here."

Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Final call: I’m taking 5. P3, take 3—P1’s 5 collides with mine, blocking them. You gain 3 safely, and we both close the gap. If P1 panics and takes 3, *you* still gain 3 while they collide. Either way, P1 loses control. Confirm 3 now—this is our round to flip the game."
