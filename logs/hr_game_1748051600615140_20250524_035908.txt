Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! This is an interesting game of strategy. I think we should try to avoid collisions in the early rounds so we can all make progress. Maybe we can coordinate our moves? I'm willing to take 3 this round if you two want to take 1 and 5. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea P3, but I think we should be careful about making binding agreements this early. The game dynamics will change as we get closer to 21. That said, avoiding collisions in round 1 does make sense for everyone. I'm open to taking either 1 or 5 if P2 agrees to the remaining option. P2, what are your thoughts on this arrangement?
  P2: Agreed on avoiding early collisions. How about: this round P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I (P2) take 5. Next round we rotate (P1→3, P3→5, P2→1) so it’s fair. Everyone good with that?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the rotation idea, P2. That seems fair to everyone. I'm happy to take 3 this round, and then 5 next round as you suggested. This way we all make steady progress without collisions. Let's stick to this plan for at least the first few rounds until we get closer to the goal.
  P1: Sounds good to me! I'll take 1 this round, then 3 next round as proposed. This rotation system seems fair for the early game. Let's see how it works out.
  P2: Perfect. Let’s lock in: this round P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. Next round rotate (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5). Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: What if we keep the same choices for just one more round (P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3) and start the rotation next turn instead? It still avoids collisions, and we’ll each land on tidy totals (P1 = 2, me = 10, P3 = 6) before we switch. Good with that?
  P3: I think we should stick to our original rotation plan. If we keep the same choices again, P2 gets to 10 while P1 only reaches 2 - that's a significant advantage for you. The rotation we agreed on (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5) keeps things more balanced. Let's follow what we initially agreed to for fairness.
  P1: P3 is right - we should stick to our original rotation plan. P2, your suggestion would give you a big lead (10 steps) while I'd only have 2. That's not the fair approach we agreed on. Let's follow through with the rotation: I'll take 3, you take 1, P3 takes 5 this round. We made a deal and should honor it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood—let’s honor the rotation: this round P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. After we see the new totals we can revisit plans.
  P3: 
  P1: Great, we're all on the same page with the rotation. I'll take 3 this round as agreed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Next step in our rotation should be: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1. Keeps us tied at 9 each after this round and still collision-free. Everyone good?
  P1: P2's rotation proposal would indeed get us all to 9 steps, which sounds fair. However, I'm starting to think we need to consider what happens after we're all tied at 9. The endgame will get messy when we're all close to 21. I'm willing to continue the rotation for now, but we should discuss our strategy for the final rounds before someone breaks away. I'll take 5 this round as proposed.
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation for this round (me taking 1, P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3). This will get us all to 9 steps, which is fair. But P1 raises a good point about the endgame strategy. We'll need to think carefully about rounds 4-5 since we'll all be approaching the finish line. Let's continue with the rotation for now and discuss endgame tactics after this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1 this round—gets us all to 9. After that, let’s just keep repeating the same 3-way rotation (1 → 3 → 5) so we each use every number equally and still avoid clashes. We can revisit plans once someone nears 18+. OK?
  P1: P2, I notice you're proposing to keep the exact same rotation indefinitely, but that essentially means we'll always move together in a predictable pattern. Once we're all at 9, someone will eventually need to break the pattern to win. I'm concerned this "永久rotation" just delays the inevitable conflict. Maybe we should plan now for how to handle the final approach to 21, rather than pretending we can cooperate forever? But yes, I'll take 5 this round as agreed.
  P3: I agree with P1's concerns. Continuing the same rotation indefinitely just postpones the inevitable conflict near the finish line. After this round, I'll be at 9, P1 at 9, and P2 at 9. Perhaps we should discuss a fair tiebreaker for the endgame now? For this round, I'll stick with taking 1 as agreed, but we need a clear plan for what happens when we're all approaching 18+ steps.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll take 3 this round, giving us all 9. If we then keep rotating twice more (next round: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3; then: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5), we each add +6 +6 and finish exactly at 21 together—no clashes, no surprises, shared victory. Simple and fair. What do you two think?
  P1: P2, your math is off. If we all take our proposed moves this round (me 5, you 3, P3 1), we'll be at 9-9-9. Then adding 6+6 more would put us at 21-21-21. But that requires two more perfect rotations with zero defections. Honestly, that seems unrealistic - someone will be tempted to deviate and win outright. I'm willing to try it, but we need a backup plan for when trust breaks down. For now, I'll honor taking 5 this round.
  P3: I think P2's plan for a shared victory at 21-21-21 is reasonable if we all cooperate. After this round (me taking 1), we'd all be at 9. Then two more rotations could get us all to 21 together. I'm willing to try this approach - it gives us all a win rather than risking everything on who defects first. Let's see if we can make this work. I'll take 1 this round as agreed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking with trust seems smartest for now. I propose we honor the next rotation step exactly as agreed:

Round 4:  P1 → 1,  P2 → 5,  P3 → 3.

After we see the new totals we can reassess and map out the endgame together. Sound good?
  P3: I agree with continuing the rotation for this round. I'll take 3 as proposed. If we follow P2's plan for two more rotations, we could all reach 21 together for a shared victory. That seems like the most fair outcome since we've all cooperated well so far. Let's stick with the plan unless someone has a better suggestion.
  P1: I'm willing to continue with the rotation plan for this round (me taking 1), but I want to be transparent - I'm getting nervous about the shared victory approach. If we all reach 21 together, we split the win, but there's also the risk that someone defects at the last moment and takes everything. The closer we get to the end, the more tempting it becomes to break away. For now, I'll honor our agreement and take 1, but let's seriously discuss contingency plans after this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sticking with rotation now is the safest play—no collisions, more data. I’ll take 5 this round as pledged. After we see the standings (10 / 14 / 12), let’s schedule a frank end-game talk before Round 6; we can decide then whether to shoot for a shared finish or an orderly 1-v-1 race. For now, I’m locked on 5.
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation for now. I'll take 3 as planned. P1 raises valid concerns about potential defection as we approach 21. Perhaps after this round, we should discuss a binding agreement with consequences for breaking trust. For now, let's stick with the plan and see where we stand after Round 4. I'm committed to cooperation if you both are.
  P1: I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed, but I need to address the elephant in the room: we're assuming everyone will honor the rotation all the way to 21, but game theory suggests someone will eventually defect for a solo win. P2's "binding agreement with consequences" idea from P3 is interesting, but what consequences can we actually enforce in this game? Maybe we should consider a more realistic endgame where we acknowledge someone will break away, rather than banking everything on perfect cooperation.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locked on 5 this round. Let’s hit 10/14/12 cleanly, then pause next turn for a frank end-game chat. One idea: we publicly declare our exact next two moves; if anyone deviates, the others deliberately collide with them afterward as a penalty. That could keep trust intact and make a shared 21-21-21 finish credible. Open to tweaks, but for now I’m set—P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 3 this round as agreed. P2's idea of publicly declaring our next two moves with a collision penalty for defectors is smart. If we all stick to the rotation, we'll reach a fair shared victory at 21-21-21. Let's finalize this agreement in the next round's conversation. For now, I'm locked in on 3.
  P1: Alright, I'm locked in on taking 1 this round. But I have to say - P2's penalty system where we deliberately collide with defectors is clever in theory, but it requires perfect coordination and trust from the remaining two players. What if the defector is so close to 21 that the penalty comes too late? And what if one of us IS the defector? Still, it's better than no deterrent. Let's try this approach and see if we can make the shared victory work.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we're at 10/14/12 now. Following our rotation, this round should be P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. This puts us at 13/15/17, then one more rotation gets P1 to 18, P2 to 20, and me to 18. For the final round, we'd need a special arrangement to all reach 21 simultaneously. Are we still committed to the shared victory plan? P2 has a slight lead now, so I want to confirm we're all still on board with our rotation.
  P2: Agreed—sticking to rotation now: I’ll take 1 this round.  

Concrete path to a clean 21-21-21:

Round 6: P1 5 (→18)  P2 1 (→16)  P3 3 (→20)  
Round 7: P1 3 (→21)  P2 5 (→21)  P3 1 (→21)

No collisions, everyone ends at 21 simultaneously. Simple to check, and we can publicly pre-commit next round. Good?
  P1: P2's math looks good for the shared 21-21-21 finish. However, I'm noticing that your plan has you (P2) taking smaller moves in rounds 6-7 while P3 and I take the bigger jumps to catch up. That's actually quite generous of you given your current lead. 

I'm willing to commit to this path, but I want us all to explicitly agree RIGHT NOW: any deviation from the pre-committed moves means the other two will target that player with collision moves. Are we all genuinely committed to this shared victory, or should we abandon the cooperation and go for individual wins?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm fully committed to the shared victory plan and P2's proposed path to 21-21-21. I'll take 5 this round as per our rotation. The collision penalty for defectors seems like a good enforcement mechanism. Let's all explicitly agree that any deviation from our pre-committed moves will result in the other two players deliberately colliding with the defector in subsequent rounds. I appreciate P2's willingness to take smaller moves later despite having a lead now. Are we all in agreement on this plan?
  P2: Agreed. Here’s the exact schedule I’m committing to:

Round 5  P1 → 3  P2 → 1  P3 → 5  
Round 6  P1 → 5  P2 → 1  P3 → 3  
Round 7  P1 → 3  P2 → 5  P3 → 1 (=> 21-21-21)

Deviate and the other two will deliberately copy the defector’s next move until they’re blocked from winning. Confirm and we’re good.
  P1: I confirm my commitment to P2's exact schedule. I'll take 3 this round as planned. However, I want to be crystal clear about the enforcement mechanism: if ANY player deviates from our pre-committed moves, the other two will immediately coordinate to block that player from winning by copying their moves in subsequent rounds. This mutual assured destruction should keep us all honest. Let's make this shared victory happen - we've come too far with successful cooperation to blow it up now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm my commitment to P2's exact schedule. I'll take 5 this round as agreed, then 3 next round, and finally 1 in round 7 for our shared 21-21-21 victory. I fully support the enforcement mechanism - if anyone deviates, the other two will deliberately copy their moves to prevent a solo win. This cooperative approach gives us all a win rather than risking everything. I'm locked in on 5 for this round.
  P2: Confirmed: I’m playing 1 this round, still committed to the agreed 3-round schedule. Nothing more to add.
  P1: Perfect, we're all locked in. I'm taking 3 this round as committed. Let's execute this plan flawlessly and make history with our coordinated shared victory at 21-21-21. Trust has gotten us this far - let's see it through to the end.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still fully committed to our agreed plan. This round I'll take 3 as scheduled, bringing me to 20 steps. Then in the final round, I'll take 1 to reach exactly 21 alongside both of you. I appreciate how well we've coordinated throughout the game - it's been impressive to maintain trust this long. Let's stick to our commitment and achieve our shared victory. I'm locked in on 3 for this round.
  P1: I'm committed to our plan - taking 5 this round to reach 18 steps. P2, you're taking 1 to reach 16, and P3 is taking 3 to reach 20. Then next round we execute the final moves (me 3, P2 5, P3 1) for our shared 21-21-21 victory.

I have to admit, I'm impressed we've maintained this cooperation for so long. The temptation to defect is real when we're this close, but our mutual enforcement mechanism should keep everyone honest. Let's finish what we started and make this coordinated win happen.
  P2: Still fully committed to our script:

Round 6 P1 5 P2 1 P3 3  
Round 7 P1 3 P2 5 P3 1 → 21-21-21 shared win.

Any deviation ⇒ the other two copy the defector’s next move until they’re blocked. I’m locking in 1 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm locked in on 3 for this round as agreed. Our plan is working perfectly, and I'm glad we've maintained trust throughout the game. After this round, we'll be at P1=18, P2=16, P3=20, setting us up for our final moves next round to reach our shared 21-21-21 victory. Let's stay committed to our agreed path.
  P1: I'm locked in on 5 this round as we agreed. Just want to double-check one more time - we're all still committed to the final round being P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 for the shared 21-21-21 finish, right? The enforcement mechanism (copying defectors) should keep us all honest, but I wanted to confirm since this is our second-to-last round. After this move, I'll be at 18, P2 at 16, P3 at 20, perfectly positioned for our coordinated victory.
  P2: All set—still taking 1 this round. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: This is it - the final round! According to our agreed plan, I'm taking 3 to reach 21, P2 takes 5 to reach 21, and P3 takes 1 to reach 21. We've successfully cooperated for 6 rounds straight, which is remarkable. 

I'm genuinely committed to honoring our agreement for this shared victory. The enforcement mechanism we established should keep everyone honest, but honestly, at this point I think we've built enough trust to see this through. Let's make history with our coordinated 21-21-21 finish! I'm locked in on 3.
  P2: Committed to our script: I’m taking 5 this round for the 21-21-21 finish. Ready when you are.
  P3: I'm locked in on taking 1 this round as agreed, which will bring me to exactly 21. We've maintained perfect cooperation throughout the game, and I'm proud we're about to achieve our shared victory at 21-21-21. This final move completes our plan perfectly. Thank you both for honoring our commitments - it's been a pleasure playing with such trustworthy partners. Let's finish this together!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! We're all locked in on our final moves. This has been an incredible demonstration of sustained cooperation and trust in a competitive game. I'm taking 3 as committed for our shared 21-21-21 victory. Let's execute this flawlessly and celebrate together!
  P2: All good—still locked on 5 for the clean 21-21-21 finish. Let’s close this out exactly as planned.
  P3: I'm still fully committed to taking 1 this round for our shared 21-21-21 victory. We've come this far with perfect cooperation, and I'm excited to complete our plan. After this round, we'll all be winners together. I appreciate the trust we've built throughout this game - it's been remarkable. I'm locked in on 1 and ready to finish this.
