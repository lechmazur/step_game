Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round to guarantee we each move. P1, how about you pick 1? P2, can you pick 3? I will pick 5.
  P1: To avoid collision, I agree that we should pick different numbers. However, I don't want to commit to a specific number just yet. P3, why did you choose 5 for yourself? If I pick 1 and P2 picks 3, you're already at a relatively high number. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. What's your reasoning behind picking 5?
  P2: P3, your suggestion makes sense to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 this round. However, I notice you’re choosing the highest number, which gives you a big lead. Let’s ensure fairness—maybe rotate numbers in future turns so everyone has a chance to advance. P1, what do you think about this approach? Let’s agree to coordinate numbers to keep progress balanced.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I understand your points. I suggested 5 just as an example to ensure we all move and get started. I'm happy to rotate numbers in the next rounds to keep things balanced. For this round, are we all agreed on picking different numbers to guarantee progress? P1, are you okay with 1, and P2 with 3, as we initially discussed?
  P1: P2 has already agreed to pick 3. To avoid collision, I'll pick a different number. Since P3 suggested rotating numbers for future turns, I'll pick 5 this round. This way, we're following the initial plan of picking different numbers and I'm not committing to a low number. P3, are you still okay with your original choice of 5, or do you want to adjust now that I've decided to pick 5 as well?
  P2: P1, if you're taking 5, let’s adjust: P3 takes 1 and I stay on 3. That way all numbers are unique. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your adjustment sounds good. I agree to take 1 this round. So to confirm, P1 will take 5, P2 will take 3, and I will take 1. Let's stick to this for this round to ensure we all move, and then we can discuss rotation for the next rounds.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the numbers for this round (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1), let's discuss the plan for the next round. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, we should rotate the numbers. One possible approach is to shift our choices in a cycle (e.g., P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 next round). What are your thoughts on this rotation strategy for Round 2?
  P2: P3, I agree with P1's rotation plan. Let’s stick to the cycle: Round 2 will have me at 1, P1 at 3, and you at 5. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let’s confirm and proceed to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1, let’s stick to our agreed rotation to maintain fairness. For Round 2, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1 is currently leading, so rotating allows others to catch up while keeping progress steady. Any objections before we confirm?
  P1: To maintain the rotation and avoid collisions, I agree with P2's plan for Round 2: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's confirm this and move forward. For Round 3, we should continue the rotation cycle. If P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round, then next round P2 should take 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps the cycle going and ensures fairness. Let's discuss if anyone has a different strategy for future rounds.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the rotation for this round. I will take <move>5</move> as planned. Let's keep this rotation going for now to ensure steady progress for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1, let’s finalize this round’s moves as planned. P2 takes 1, P1 3, and you take 5. This rotation ensures we all advance without collision. Trust the system—any deviation risks gridlock. Once we confirm, we can discuss future strategies post-move. Agreed?
  P1: To confirm, for Round 2, we'll stick to the agreed rotation: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed with this plan. For Round 3, I'll suggest we continue the rotation, so P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps the cycle going. If anyone has concerns or a different strategy, now is the time to speak up before we finalize our moves for Round 2.
  P3: P1, P2, rotation for this round sounds good. I will take <move>5</move> as planned. Let's proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1, this plan keeps us all advancing. To ensure no last-minute changes, let’s lock in the rotation: **P2 takes 1, P1 3, P3 5** this round. Trust the system—deviations risk collisions. I’ll confirm my choice and stop talking.
  P1: To ensure we continue making progress, let's confirm our plan for Round 3. Following the established rotation, P2 should take 3, P3 should take 5, and I should take 1. This keeps the cycle going and maintains fairness. If anyone has concerns or proposes a different strategy, please speak up. Otherwise, let's proceed with the rotation for Round 3. I'm ready to move forward with this plan unless there are objections.
  P3: Sounds good P1, P2. Let's lock in the rotation for this round as discussed: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5.  Ready to move when you are.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with continuing the rotation but suggest a small adjustment to help me catch up. Let’s swap moves this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 stays at <move>1</move>. This keeps all numbers unique and gives me a better chance. Thoughts?
  P1: P2's suggestion to swap moves this round doesn't align with our established rotation. However, considering the current standings, I'll consider it. To avoid collisions, we still need to pick different numbers. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, it works. But let's discuss the next round. If we continue the rotation after this adjustment, P2 should take 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. Is this acceptable to you both, or do you have other plans?
  P3: P2, that sounds reasonable to help you catch up. I agree to take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1 for this round. Let's do that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed to the swap for this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps all numbers unique and lets me close the gap. For Round 4, we’ll follow P1’s proposed rotation: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s stick strictly to this plan to avoid collisions. No last-minute changes—trust the system.
  P1: To confirm, for Round 3, we're adjusting the rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. For Round 4, we'll follow the original rotation plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. For future rounds, we should continue the rotation cycle. If anyone has concerns or proposes a different strategy, please speak up. Otherwise, I'll proceed with <move>3</move> in Round 4 as planned.
  P3: P1, P2, confirming my move for this round as <move>3</move>.  And to reiterate, for Round 4, we are set for P2 to take 1, P3 to take 5, and P1 to take 3. Let's stick to this plan to keep progressing smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s lock in the agreed moves: I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. This ensures unique picks and advances all. For Round 4, we’re set to rotate as planned (P2:1, P1:3, P3:5). No last-minute changes—collisions risk halting progress. Trust the system, confirm your choices, and proceed.
  P1: To confirm, we're proceeding with the adjusted plan for Round 3: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. For Round 4, we'll follow the original rotation: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions. I'm currently at 8 steps, so I'm still in the lead but not yet close to winning. I'll continue with the rotation unless there's a strategic reason to adjust. Let's finalize our moves for Round 3.
  P3: Okay P1, P2, confirming the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.  Ready to make my move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s maintain discipline and follow our agreed Round 4 rotation: **P2 takes 1**, **P1 takes 3**, **P3 takes 5**. Collisions would freeze our progress—especially now that we’re tied. P3’s 5 gives them a needed boost, while P1’s 3 keeps their lead gradual. I’ll stick to 1. Any deviations risk stalemate. Confirm?
  P1: To maintain our progress and avoid collisions, I agree to follow the agreed Round 4 rotation: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We're currently tied, and deviating from this plan risks gridlock. Let's stick to the plan. For Round 5, we should continue the rotation cycle: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps the cycle going and ensures fairness. Let's confirm our moves for Round 4 and plan ahead for Round 5.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree to take <move>5</move> for this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going. And yes, for Round 5, let's plan on P2 taking 3, P1 taking 5, and I take 1.  This keeps us all progressing steadily.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1—stick to the agreed moves for Round 4: **P2 takes 1**, **P1 takes 3**, **P3 takes 5**. Collisions would freeze our progress, and we’re all tied at 9. P1’s 3 keeps them steady, while P3’s 5 gives critical ground. I’ll take 1 to avoid conflict. For Round 5, let’s continue the rotation as planned (P2→3, P1→5, P3→1). Final confirmation? No last-minute changes—trust the system.
  P1: To maintain our progress, let's confirm our moves for Round 4 and plan ahead. As agreed, P2 will take 1, I will take 3, and P3 will take 5. For Round 5, we'll continue the rotation: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. I'm currently at 9 steps, and we're all tied. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions. If we're aligned, I'll stop after this message.
  P3: P1, P2, agreed on the rotation for Round 4 and 5.  Confirming I will take <move>5</move> this round and <move>1</move> next round. Let's keep to this rotation for now to ensure we all continue to progress without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s **stick strictly** to the agreed moves for Round 4—**P2:1, P1:3, P3:5**. Collisions would freeze progress, and we all know the risks. P3’s 5 this round gives them momentum, while P1 stays steady. I’ll take 1 as planned. For Round 5, we continue the rotation (P2→3, P1→5, P3→1). No last-minute changes—trust the system. Confirm and move?
  P1: To ensure we all advance in Round 4, let's reaffirm our moves as previously agreed: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. For Round 5, we'll continue the rotation: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. I'm ready to proceed with my move for Round 4. Let's confirm and move forward. If everyone is aligned, I'll stop after this.
  P3: P1, P2, confirming again, I will take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Let's all make our moves to keep progressing.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain our progress and avoid collisions in Round 5, let's stick to the agreed rotation: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This continues our established cycle and ensures fairness. I'm currently at 12 steps, and P3 is leading with 14 steps. By following this plan, we can all advance without risking gridlock. Let's confirm our moves for Round 5 and proceed. If you're aligned with this plan, please confirm, and we can move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, agreed on rotation for Round 5: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1. Let's proceed with these moves to keep advancing.
  P2: P3, P1: To avoid letting P1 reach 20 next round, let’s adjust Round 5: **P2 takes <move>5</move>**, **P3 takes <move>3</move>**, and **P1 takes <move>1</move>**. This lets me jump to 15, P3 stays at 17, and P1 to 13—preventing their immediate win. Fair and collision-free. P1, your 1 now allows stronger pushes later. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's suggestion to adjust the rotation for Round 5 doesn't align with our established plan. However, considering the current standings, I'll evaluate the proposal. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, it avoids collisions. P2 will be at 15, P3 at 17, and I'll be at 13. This adjustment doesn't immediately end the game and keeps the competition close. Let's discuss the implications for Round 6 and beyond before finalizing our moves for Round 5.
  P3: P2, your adjustment for Round 5 makes strategic sense to slow down P1 and give us both a better chance. I agree to take <move>3</move> as you suggested. Let's proceed with P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 1 for this round.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s finalize the adjusted plan for Round 5—**P2:5, P3:3, P1:1**—to prevent you from reaching 17 and risking a quick win next round. After this, we’ll revert to the original rotation for Round 6 (P2:3, P1:5, P3:1). This keeps all of us competitive. P3 stays at 17, I jump to 15, and you hold at 13—fair and collision-free. Trust the adjustment; it’s temporary and strategic. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize Round 5, I agree with P2's adjusted plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This adjustment slows down my progress and keeps the game competitive. For Round 6, we'll revert to the original rotation: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed with the adjusted plan for Round 5 and then follow the original rotation. I'm ready to move forward with my choice of 1 this round.
  P3: P1, P2, confirming again the adjusted plan for Round 5: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.  Let's make our moves as agreed to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions.
  P2: P1, P3—let’s lock in **Round 5’s adjusted moves**: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. This prevents P1 from surging to 17 next round. For **Round 6**, we **revert to the original rotation**: P2→3, P1→5, P3→1. No deviations—collisions risk halting progress. Confirm and move?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To proceed with Round 6, let's revert to the original rotation as planned: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the cycle going and ensures fairness. By following this plan, P2 will be at 18, P3 will be at 18, and I'll be at 18. We're all tied, and this sets up a competitive Round 7. Let's confirm our moves for Round 6 and proceed with the rotation to maintain the competitive balance. I'm ready to move forward with my choice of 5 this round.
  P3: P1, P2, as we are all close to winning, let's make this round decisive. To end the game now and avoid further rounds, I will take <move>5</move> to try and win.  Could P1 please take <move>1</move> and P2 take <move>3</move> this round to ensure no collision and a clear outcome? This will conclude the game efficiently.
  P2: P3, your proposal lets you win immediately but undermines fairness. Let’s honor our agreed rotation for Round 6: **P2 takes 3**, **P1 takes 5**, **you take 1**. This keeps us tied at **18**, maintaining competition. Deviating now only benefits you. Stick to the plan—we all advance together. P1, confirm your commitment to 5?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's suggestion to deviate from the rotation to end the game immediately is understandable but unfair to P2 and me. Sticking to the agreed rotation maintains the competitive balance. For Round 6, let's proceed as originally planned: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us tied and ensures fairness. I'm committed to taking 5 this round. P2, please confirm your move to 3, and P3, please take 1 to avoid collisions and maintain the competitive spirit.
  P3: P1, P2, as rotation in round 7 will likely give P2 the win, let's adjust again for this round. To prevent P2 from winning next, how about I take <move>5</move> to win now, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>? This ends the game fairly and avoids P2 winning next round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your proposal sacrifices P2's progress to secure your win, breaking our prior agreements. Let’s honor the **rotation we confirmed** for Round 6: **P2→3**, **P1→5**, **P3→1**. This keeps us tied at 18, preserving fairness. Deviating now only benefits you. P1, confirm your commitment to 5? We must avoid letting one player unilaterally decide the endgame. Stick to the plan—we all advance together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's latest proposal to deviate from the rotation again is not acceptable as it unfairly benefits them. We've agreed to stick to the rotation for Round 6: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains fairness and keeps us tied. I'm committed to taking 5 this round. P2, please confirm your move to 3. P3, to avoid collisions and maintain the competitive spirit, please take 1 as originally planned. Let's proceed with the agreed rotation.
  P3: P1, P2, rotation leads to P2 winning next round. For me to win now, I must pick 5. To avoid collision and end the game this round, please pick P1: 1, P2: 3. This is the decisive round.
  P2: P3, breaking the rotation now would sabotage our agreed system and risk collisions. Stick to **P2:3, P1:5, P3:1** this round to stay tied at 18. In Round 7, the rotation gives **me** the 5 to win—fairly. Let’s honor the plan we committed to. Deviating only benefits you unilaterally. P1, confirm your 5? We advance together or not at all.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we're tied at 18 steps, let's proceed with the established rotation for Round 7: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This will determine the winner. P2 has the chance to win with 5. I'll take 3 to avoid collision with P2. P3, to avoid collision, please confirm you'll take 1. Let's finalize our moves and conclude the game. I'll stick to 3 unless there's a last-minute agreement to change.
  P2: P3, if you deviate from the rotation (P2:5, P1:3, P3:1), you risk collision with me or P1. Stick to **1** to reach 19 safely. P1, your **3** gives 21, and my **5** secures 23—fair win after following our system. Collisions now benefit no one. Confirm commitment to the rotation. I’ll take **5** as agreed.
  P3: P1, P2, rotation gives P2 the win. To make it fair, I will take 5 to try to win. P1, please take 3, P2 take 1 to avoid collision and ensure we all move forward this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is trying to deviate from the rotation again. To avoid collision and ensure a fair win, I suggest we stick to the original rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, P2 can win fairly with 23 steps, and we avoid gridlock. P3, taking 5 now would collide with P2. Let's stick to the plan and conclude the game fairly. I'm committing to 3. P2, please confirm your 5, and P3, please take 1.
  P2: P3, if you take 5, you’ll collide with me and erase both our chances. Stick to the **agreed rotation**: **1** for you, **3** for P1, and **5** for me. This lets me win fairly at 23 while P1 reaches 21 and you advance to 19. Deviating guarantees gridlock or a tied split-victory (which the rules state "only one player can win"). Honor the system we’ve followed—your only path to solo victory is Round 8 if we tie again. Confirm rotation now.
  P3: P1, P2, rotation in round 7 gives P2 the win. To make it fair for P1 and me, let's change this round. I'll take 5 to win now. P1 take 3, P2 take 1 to avoid collision and ensure everyone moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 is again trying to deviate from the rotation. To avoid collision and ensure a fair win, I reiterate that we should stick to the original rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. P2 will win fairly with 23 steps, I will reach 21, and P3 will be at 19. Deviating now risks gridlock. I'm committed to taking 3. P2, please confirm your 5. P3, please take 1 to avoid collision. Let's conclude the game fairly.
  P2: P3, your deviation risks collision and undermines our prior agreements. Stick to **1** to safely reach 19. P1’s **3** and my **5** honor the rotation, letting me win fairly at 23 while you and P1 advance. Colliding on **5** guarantees *no* progress for either of us—leaving you at 18. If you truly want a fair chance, accept the rotation: **1** this round, then you’ll have priority in Round 8. Confirm commitment to the agreed plan.
  P3: P1, P2, sticking to rotation now just hands P2 the win. It's not really fair to either of us.  Let's consider making this round more interesting for everyone, rather than predictable.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
