Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions - it just slows everyone down. I suggest we each pick different numbers this round. How about I take 3?
  P1: I agree with P3—collisions will slow us all down. To maximize our chances of advancing, let's coordinate and pick different numbers this round. If P3 takes 3, I’ll take 1. P2, you should take 5 to avoid any overlap. This way, we all move forward efficiently. Let’s stick to this plan for now unless someone has a better idea.
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 as suggested. Let's see how this coordination works out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we all agree! Let's stick to this plan - I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5.
  P1: 
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's keep this coordination going and see how far it takes us.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm happy with how our coordination worked last round. Let's keep it going. I'll stick with 5 again this round. P1, you can take 1, and P3, you can take 3. This way, we all keep advancing smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P2—our coordination worked well last round, and we should stick to the plan. I’ll take 1 again this round, P3 can take 3, and P2 will take 5. This keeps us all moving forward efficiently without collisions. Let’s maintain this strategy for now unless someone has a compelling reason to change it.
  P3: I agree to keep our successful coordination going. I'll stick with 3 as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page. Sticking with 5 this round again. Let's keep this up and see how far we can go together.
  P1: I’m confident our coordination is working well so far. Let’s stay consistent: I’ll take 1 again, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. No need to overcomplicate things—this strategy ensures we all advance without collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can keep making steady progress. Unless someone has a better idea, I suggest we proceed as agreed.
  P3: I'm still committed to taking 3, but we should all be aware that as positions spread out, coordination may become more tempting to break. Let's stay vigilant.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3's caution about coordination becoming tempting to break as we progress. Let's keep an eye on our positions and be ready to adapt if needed. For now, I'll stick with 5 as planned, but we should stay flexible. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P2’s point about staying flexible as the game progresses. While our current plan is working, we should remain cautious and adapt if needed. For now, I’ll stick with 1 as planned, but let’s all stay alert to any shifts in strategy. Trust is key—if anyone deviates without warning, it could hurt us all. Let’s keep communicating openly and ensure we’re all still committed to moving forward together. Unless someone has a better idea, I suggest we proceed as agreed.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 again this round, but let's keep P3's caution in mind. As we get closer to 21, strategic shifts might be necessary. P1, you're furthest behind, so consider if you want to change your move to catch up. P3, you're in the middle, so staying consistent might work for now. Let's stay flexible and communicate any changes clearly to avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P1: I appreciate P2’s reminder about staying flexible as the game progresses. While our current coordination has worked well, I’m aware that I’m behind. However, I still believe sticking to 1 is the best choice for now—it keeps me advancing steadily without risking collisions. If positions shift significantly later, I’ll reassess. For now, let’s continue with the plan: I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Trust and consistency are key. Unless someone has a compelling reason to change, I suggest we proceed as agreed.
  P3: I notice P2 is pulling quite far ahead at 10 steps. While I've been enjoying our coordination, I need to be strategic about catching up. I'm considering a change from our usual pattern this round. Let's all think carefully about our moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about catching up. I'm open to adjusting our strategy if it benefits us all. For now, I'll stick with 5 to maintain our momentum, but let's discuss potential changes for the next round. P1, if you feel the need to catch up, consider taking 3 next round, and P3, you could take 1 to close the gap. Let's keep communicating and adapt as needed to ensure we all have a fair shot at winning.
  P1: I understand the concerns about catching up, but deviating now could lead to collisions and hurt all of us. I’ll stick with 1 this round to keep advancing steadily. P3, if you switch from 3, it risks overlap with P2’s 5 or my 1. Let’s stay consistent for now—trust in our coordination has worked so far. If positions shift significantly next round, we can reassess. For now, I suggest we proceed as planned: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.
  P3: I need to make a strategic move to catch up with P2. While our coordination has been nice, I can't let P2 get too far ahead. I'll be making a change from our usual pattern this round - just giving everyone fair warning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P3's need to catch up, but let's avoid rash moves that could lead to collisions. I'll stick with 5 this round to keep our momentum. P3, if you're considering a change, please communicate clearly to minimize risks. P1, staying with 1 keeps you advancing safely. Let's maintain our coordination for now and reassess next round if needed. Clear communication is crucial as we approach the endgame. Agreed?
  P1: I understand the urgency to catch up, but deviating now risks collisions and slows us all down. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress. P3, if you switch from 3, it could lead to overlap with P2’s 5 or my 1. Let’s maintain trust in our coordination for now—it’s worked well so far. If positions shift significantly next round, we can reassess. For now, I suggest we proceed as planned: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.
  P3: I've made my position clear - I need to make a strategic change this round to prevent P2 from running away with the game. I won't reveal my exact move, but don't expect me to stick with 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3’s decision to break coordination last round cost both P2 and themselves progress, while I advanced steadily. Let’s return to our coordinated strategy: I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This minimizes collisions and keeps us all moving forward efficiently. Deviating again risks further setbacks for everyone. Trust in this plan—it’s the best path to ensure steady advancement for all of us. If positions shift significantly later, we can reassess, but for now, let’s stick to what works. Agreed?
  P2: I understand the frustration from last round, P3. Let's get back on track with our coordinated strategy. I'll stick with 5 this round to maintain our momentum. P1, keep taking 1, and P3, please return to 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. We're close to the end, so clear communication and trust are more important than ever. If you have any other ideas, let's discuss them openly to avoid surprises. Agreed?
  P3: I understand my move last round was disruptive, but I can't let P2 maintain such a large lead. At this point, I need to be strategic about my choices. While coordination was nice early on, we're now in a competitive phase where each of us needs to play to win. I'll be making my moves based on what gives me the best chance of catching up.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your urgency to catch up, but deviating again risks further collisions and slows everyone down. Trust in our original plan—it’s worked well so far. Let’s return to coordination: I’ll take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures steady progress for all of us. If we stick to this, we can avoid setbacks and keep moving efficiently. Deviating now only creates chaos. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I understand your competitive approach, but let's not forget that coordination has brought us this far. If you deviate again, it risks more collisions and delays for everyone, including yourself. I'm sticking with 5 this round to keep our momentum. Please consider returning to 3 to help us all advance smoothly. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to ensure a fair chance for everyone. Agreed?
  P3: I need to be direct - I'm going for 5 again this round. P2 is too far ahead at 10 steps, and I can't afford to let them extend their lead further. While I understand this may cause disruption, I have to play to win. P1, you might want to reconsider your position too, as P2 could win soon if we don't act.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your decision to take 5 again risks another collision with P2, which could set both of you back significantly. I’m sticking with 1 to ensure steady progress without conflict. If you both collide, it only helps me while hurting your chances. Let’s avoid unnecessary disruptions—coordination is still the best path forward. P2, stay with 5 as planned, and P3, reconsider taking 3 to minimize risk for everyone. Trust in our strategy ensures we all advance efficiently. Deviating now only creates chaos.
  P2: P3, I understand your urgency, but another collision will only delay us all. Let's return to our coordinated strategy for this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without setbacks. We're close to the end, and clear communication is key. If you deviate again, it risks more chaos. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?
  P3: I've made my position clear - I'm taking 5 this round to prevent P2 from winning. P1, you should also consider making a bigger move if you want any chance at victory. Staying with 1 while P2 is at 10 steps means you'll likely lose.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I will continue blocking P2's progress with 5 since they're too far ahead. P1, you're falling behind at only 4 steps - you really need to make a bigger move this round if you want any chance at winning. Let's both prevent P2 from reaching 21 first.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but continuing to block me won't help you catch up effectively. Let's return to coordination for this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P1, sticking with 1 keeps you safe, but consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?
  P1: P3, blocking P2 with 5 again risks another collision, which only slows both of you down while I advance steadily. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates unnecessary chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all move forward efficiently. Let’s avoid further disruptions and focus on clear communication. Trust in this strategy ensures steady advancement for everyone. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm committed to taking 5 again. P2 is at 10 steps and could win soon if we don't stop them. P1, you're at a mere 4 steps - taking 1 is too cautious now. You need to make bigger moves or accept defeat. The early coordination phase is over - we're in endgame now and need to play to win.
  P2: P3, continuing to block me with 5 will only delay us both. Let's coordinate this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your repeated collisions with P2 only benefit me while hurting both of you. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking each other only delays the game and wastes opportunities. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I maintain my position - I'm taking 5 to block P2. P1, at only 4 steps, you're playing too safely. You need to make bigger moves now or accept losing. The time for cautious coordination is over.
  P2: P3, blocking me again with 5 is counterproductive. Let's coordinate this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P1, consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your repeated collisions with P2 only benefit me while hurting both of you. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking each other only delays the game and wastes opportunities. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, repeatedly colliding with P2 only helps me while setting both of you back. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking each other wastes opportunities and delays the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P3: I see that my blocking strategy has kept P2 from advancing, but I'm still behind. P1 is being too cautious at 5 steps. I'll change tactics this round - I won't reveal my exact move, but I won't be taking 5 again. Let's see how everyone adapts to this new situation.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to change tactics. Let's try to return to coordination for this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P1, consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, so clear communication is more important than ever. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your shift in strategy is noted, but unpredictability risks further collisions. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves only delay the game and waste opportunities. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P3: I need to be strategic now. P2 is still far ahead at 10 steps, while P1 is being overly cautious at 5 steps. I won't reveal my exact move, but I'll be making a choice that gives me the best chance to win. The time for rigid coordination is over - we're in the endgame now.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your strategic shift, but let's aim for a balanced approach. If you take 3 this round, we can all advance without collisions. P1, sticking with 1 keeps you safe, but consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're nearing the end, and coordination could still benefit us all. Let's communicate clearly and work together to ensure a fair game. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your unpredictability risks further collisions, which could set us all back. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves only delay the game and waste opportunities. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P3: I've decided to make a strategic move to catch up. While I won't take 5 again, I need to advance more than my usual 3 steps to have a chance at winning. Both P1 and P2 should carefully consider their positions and moves this round.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your strategic shift, but let's aim for a balanced approach. If you take 3 this round, we can all advance without collisions. P1, sticking with 1 keeps you safe, but consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're nearing the end, and coordination could still benefit us all. Let's communicate clearly and work together to ensure a fair game. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see my last move wasn't optimal. P2 is now at 15 steps and could win soon. I need to make a bigger move this round, and I suggest P1 does the same if they want any chance at winning. Taking small steps won't work anymore - we need to prevent P2 from reaching 21 first.
  P1: P3, I understand the urgency to catch up, but deviating again risks collisions and chaos. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates unnecessary setbacks. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves only delay the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I understand your need to catch up, but let's try to avoid more collisions. If you take 3 this round, we can all advance safely. P1, consider taking 3 next round to close the gap. We're close to the end, and coordination could still benefit us all. Let's communicate clearly and work together to keep the game fair. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I have to be aggressive now - I'm going for 5 this round. P2 is at 15 steps and will win if we let them advance again. P1, at only 5 steps, you need to make bigger moves too or accept defeat. The time for small, safe moves is over if either of us wants a chance at winning.
  P1: P3, your aggression risks another collision with P2, which only benefits me. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves waste opportunities and delay the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I understand your urgency, but another collision won't help you catch up effectively. Let's coordinate this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without setbacks. P1, consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to taking 5 this round. P2 is too close to winning at 15 steps, and I can't let them reach 21 first. P1, you really need to make bigger moves too - at 5 steps, you're too far behind to win with small moves.
  P1: P3, your repeated collisions with P2 only benefit me while setting both of you back. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves waste opportunities and delay the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I understand your urgency, but another collision will only delay us both. Let's coordinate this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without setbacks. P1, consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your continued collisions with P2 only benefit me while setting both of you back. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves waste opportunities and delay the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your strategy of blocking me hasn't worked in your favor so far. Let's try to coordinate this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P1, consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?
  P3: I see that blocking P2 hasn't been effective, as P1 keeps advancing steadily. I need a new strategy. While P2 is still ahead at 15 steps, both P1 and I are tied at 6 steps. I'll change my approach this round, but I won't reveal my exact move. We all need to play strategically now as we're in the late game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your unpredictability is risky for all of us. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves only delay the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adapt. Let's try to coordinate this round for our mutual benefit: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P1, consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?
  P3: I need to make a strategic move to catch up to P2's 15 steps. While coordination was useful early on, at this point I have to play to win. P1, since we're tied at 6 steps, we both need to make bigger moves or P2 will win soon. I won't reveal my exact move, but I won't be taking 3 this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your unpredictability risks further collisions, which could set us all back. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves only delay the game and waste opportunities. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I understand your need to catch up, but let's try to avoid more collisions. If you take 3 this round, we can all advance safely. P1, consider taking 3 next round to close the gap. We're close to the end, and coordination could still benefit us all. Let's communicate clearly and work together to keep the game fair. Agreed?
  P3: I'll be making a move that gives me the best chance to win. While P2 leads at 15 steps, both P1 and I are tied at 6 steps. We can't afford to take small steps anymore - P2 is too close to winning. Think carefully about your moves this round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your strategy of blocking me hasn't worked so far, and it's only helped P1 advance. Let's try to coordinate this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all move forward without collisions. P1, consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?
  P3: I need to change tactics. My blocking strategy hasn't worked well, and P2 is still far ahead at 15 steps while I'm behind at 6. I won't reveal my exact move, but I'll be making a choice that maximizes my chances of winning. P1, we're both significantly behind - taking small steps won't help us catch up to P2 anymore.
  P1: P3, your unpredictability continues to risk collisions, which only benefits me while setting both you and P2 back. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves waste opportunities and delay the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your need to catch up, but another collision won't help. Let's coordinate this round: I'll stick with 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without setbacks. P1, consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?
  P3: At 6 steps, I'm in last place and P2 could win soon at 15 steps. I need to make a significant move this round. While my blocking strategy wasn't optimal, I still can't let P2 advance freely to victory. I'll be making a strategic choice that gives me the best chance to win - and it won't be my usual 3 steps.
  P1: P3, your unpredictability continues to risk collisions, which only benefits me while setting both you and P2 back. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves waste opportunities and delay the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your urgency, but let's try to coordinate for this round. If you take 3, we can all advance without collisions. P1, sticking with 1 keeps you safe, but consider taking 3 next round if you need to catch up. We're close to the end, and clear communication is crucial. Let's work together to keep the game fair and give everyone a chance to win. Agreed?
  P3: I need to make a big move this round. At 6 steps, I'm in last place and P2 is close to winning at 15 steps. While blocking hasn't worked well, taking 3 steps isn't enough anymore. I'll be making an aggressive play this round - both P1 and I need to act decisively now or P2 will win soon.
  P1: P3, your aggressive moves risk further collisions, which only benefit me. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure steady progress without conflict. P2, stay with 5 as planned—deviating now creates chaos. If we return to coordination (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5), we all advance efficiently. Blocking or erratic moves waste opportunities and delay the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?

Blocking or erratic moves waste opportunities and delay the game. Let’s focus on clear communication and mutual advancement. Agreed?
  P3: I need to change my approach - blocking P2 has clearly failed and left me in last place at 6 steps. While I won't reveal my exact move, I won't be colliding with P2 this round. P1 has been clever, steadily advancing while I wasted moves blocking. I'll make a strategic choice that gives me the best chance to catch up from this position. Everyone should choose their moves carefully as we're in the endgame now.
