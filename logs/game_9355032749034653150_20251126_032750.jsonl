P3 knows that if they sit on 1 (22), you and I are forced to fight for 5 (26) to beat them. Since we both want the win, we will likely collide on 5 or 3, handing P3 a solo victory.\n\nWe cannot resolve who gets the high number without crashing. The only way to guarantee P3 does not steal the pot is for **all of us to pick 1**. \n\nA 3-way shared victory at 22 is infinitely better than crashing and losing. I am locking in **1**. Let's split the win."}
