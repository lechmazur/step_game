It's Round 5, and I've got 15 steps, P2 has 11, and P3 is at 2. We've been trying to follow this rotation plan to avoid collisions, but there have been some deviations, especially from P3, which have caused issues. In the last round, again, P3 didn't follow the plan, and now they're even further behind.\n\nI think it's important that we all stick to the plan to maximize our individual progress. If we keep deviating, it's going to lead to more collisions and slow down everyone's progress. I understand that maybe P3 is trying something different, but it's not helping their position.\n\nSo, for this round, according to our rotation plan:\n\n- P1 should take 3 steps.\n\n- P2 should take 5 steps.\n\n- P3 should take 1 step.\n\nI think if we can all confirm and stick to these moves, we can progress without any collisions. P2 seems to be on board with this plan, but P3's actions are a bit unpredictable.\n\nI would like to propose that from this round onwards, we explicitly state our intended moves in the conversation phase to ensure everyone is on the same page. That way, if someone does decide to deviate, at least we know in advance and can adjust accordingly.\n\nWhat do you both think about this? It might help us coordinate better and avoid unnecessary collisions.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n- In each conversation phase, each player states their intended move for that round.\n\n- If there are any conflicts, we can discuss and adjust before making our final choices in the move phase.\n\nThis way, we can minimize collisions and progress more efficiently towards the goal of 19 steps.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\n\n**P3, especially, I'd like to hear your perspective on this.**"}
