I'll take 5 this round. If P1 takes 5, we collide and you stay at 19. If P3 takes 5, we collide and they stay at 21. If neither takes 5, I advance to 18. This gives me the best chance to stay competitive while potentially blocking both leaders. Your move determines whether you go for solo victory, shared victory, or let me back in the game."}
