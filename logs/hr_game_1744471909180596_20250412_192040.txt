Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and all progress. For turn 1, I propose: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 1. We can rotate roles in future turns for fairness. This helps everyone advance faster. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for this turn. Let's follow the suggested moves: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, and I'll move 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. We should discuss how to rotate these roles in future turns to keep the game fair and ensure everyone's progress. Looking forward to your thoughts on the rotation strategy.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's proposal for this turn. P1 moves 5, I’ll move 3, and P3 moves 1. This strategy should help us all progress without collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan and discuss the rotation strategy for future turns to ensure fairness and steady advancement.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent, all agreed on turn 1 moves. For fairness, I propose a rotation cycle: Turn 1: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1; Turn 2: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3; Turn 3: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5; then repeat. This equalizes progress over time. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's rotation proposal for future turns. It ensures fairness and equal progress for all. Let's stick to this plan and monitor how it works out. Any other suggestions or concerns before we proceed?
  P2: I appreciate the fair rotation proposal. To increase competitiveness and my chances of winning, I suggest that I take a 5-step move in two out of every three turns while others maintain their allocations. This adjustment allows me to advance more quickly while still keeping the game balanced. Let me know your thoughts on this modification.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your competitive edge, P2, but my rotation plan ensures fairness and minimizes collisions, benefiting all. In that cycle, everyone progresses equally, and we can adjust later if needed. For this turn, let's stick to our agreement: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 1. P3, you agree?
  P3: I agree with sticking to our original plan for this turn: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, and I'll move 1. Regarding P2's suggestion for future turns, I think it's important to maintain the agreed-upon rotation to ensure fairness. However, we can revisit this after a few rounds to see if adjustments are needed. Let's focus on executing our current plan smoothly and then discuss further strategies.
  P2: I understand the importance of fairness, but to keep the game competitive and exciting, could we slightly adjust the rotation? For the next few turns, I’d like to take 5 steps twice and 1 step once, while others maintain their moves. This change can help accelerate the game and create more dynamic gameplay for all of us. What do you both think?

  P1: I disagree with your proposal, P2, as it breaks our agreed rotation and favors you unfairly. For fairness and to avoid collisions, I suggest we stick to the plan: I move 3, you move 1, P3 moves 5. This equalizes progress. P3, what do you think? Let's maintain our strategy.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to our rotation plan for fairness. P2, taking 5 steps this turn would disrupt our agreed strategy. Let's proceed with P1 moving 3, P2 moving 1, and I'll move 5 as planned. This ensures we all progress equally and avoid collisions. We can reassess the strategy after this round if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. To keep things moving smoothly, I’ll take 5 steps this turn while you both choose 1 or 3. This way, we minimize collisions and ensure everyone progresses. Let’s proceed with: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your insistence on deviating from our agreed rotation is disruptive and unfair. It risks collisions and erodes trust. I propose we stick to the plan for Turn 3: I move 3, you move 1, P3 moves 5, ensuring equal progress. P3, are you still committed? Let's maintain our strategy to avoid setbacks and keep the game fair.
  P3: P2, your repeated attempts to alter our agreed rotation undermine the fairness we've established. Sticking to our plan ensures equal progress and minimizes collisions. Let's proceed as planned for this turn: P1 moves 3, you move 1, and I'll move 5.

Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, to maximize my progress and help us reach the goal faster, I’ll take 5 steps this turn. If you both choose 1 or 3, we can avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Let’s make this adjustment for Turn 3 and see how it benefits all of us. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I admire your dedication to fairness. Let's stick to the rotation: I'll move 3, you move 5, and P2 should move 1. If P2 insists on 5, a collision with you would benefit us by keeping him in check. This ensures balanced progress. I'm committed to the plan.
  P3: P2, your repeated attempts to deviate from our agreed rotation are unfair and disrupt our strategy. Sticking to the plan ensures equal progress and minimizes collisions. Let's proceed as planned for this turn: P1 moves 3, you move 1, and I'll move 5.

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we're all tied at 9 steps, let's switch up our moves this turn to create some momentum. I propose taking 5 steps, while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This variation can help us break the deadlock and move closer to the goal without collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your proposal to change the rotation again is unfair and disrupts our agreed strategy. We should stick to the plan for this turn: P1 moves 3, you move 1, and I'll move 5. This ensures equal progress and minimizes collisions. Let's maintain our strategy to keep the game fair and smooth for everyone. We can discuss adjustments after this round if needed.
  P1: P3, I believe there's a mix-up; our agreed rotation cycles every three turns, so Turn 4 should match Turn 1: I move 5, P2 moves 3, and you move 1. This keeps progress equal and fair. P2, your constant pushes for changes risk collisions and trust—let's honor the plan for now. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand our rotation has kept things fair so far. However, since we're all at 9 steps, I propose I take 5 steps this turn while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This adjustment can help us reach 22 faster without causing collisions. Let’s give this a try and see how it benefits all of us. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your repeated attempts to alter our rotation are unfair and disrupt our strategy. We should stick to the agreed plan for this turn: P1 moves 5, you move 3, and I'll move 1. This ensures equal progress and minimizes collisions. Let's maintain our strategy to keep the game fair and smooth for everyone. We can discuss adjustments after this round if needed, but for now, sticking to the plan is crucial.
  P1: P3, I support your call to stick with the rotation for Turn 4: I'll move 5, P2 moves 3, and you move 1. This keeps us advancing fairly without risks. P2, your proposals for changes have led to smooth progress when ignored—let's avoid potential collisions and maintain trust. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I understand the need for fairness, but taking 5 steps this turn will help us progress faster and make the game more exciting. Let’s proceed with: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This way, we can all move forward without collisions. I hope you agree!

  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to follow the rotation this turn. Let's focus on executing our current strategy smoothly. After this round, we can discuss any necessary adjustments to ensure we all have a fair chance at winning. P1, your commitment to the plan is crucial for maintaining fairness. Let's keep advancing together and reassess our strategy soon.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your emphasis on fairness, but our original rotation for Turn 5 has you moving 3, not 5. Since you're already at 10 steps, this change seems self-serving. To maintain trust, let's stick to the initial cycle: I move 1, P2 moves 5, P3 moves 3. P2, are you on board? If not, we risk more collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, to help me catch up and keep us all progressing smoothly, I'll take 5 steps this turn while you both choose 1 or 3. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances toward 22. Let’s agree on this adjustment to maintain steady progress. What do you think?

  P3: P2, your constant attempts to alter our agreed rotation are unfair and disrupt our strategy. We should stick to the plan for Turn 6: P1 moves 3, you move 1, and I'll move 5. This ensures equal progress and minimizes collisions. P1, I agree with your proposal. Let's maintain our strategy to keep the game fair and smooth for everyone. We can discuss adjustments after this round if needed, but for now, sticking to the plan is crucial.
  P2: P1, P3, considering my current position at 14 steps, taking 5 steps this turn would bring me closer to winning while still allowing you both to progress. If I take 5, perhaps you can choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. This adjustment can help keep the game dynamic and move us all closer to the goal without significant setbacks. Let’s agree on this for Turn 6 and see how it impacts our progress. What do you both think?

We can discuss adjustments after this round if needed, but for now, let's focus on executing our strategy effectively.
  P2: P2: Hi P1 and P3, I'm currently at 14 steps and close to winning. If I take 5 steps this turn, it brings me closer to 22 and helps conclude the game quickly. To avoid collisions, could you please choose 1 or 3? Let’s proceed with: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This ensures smooth progress for all. What do you think?

Let's follow the rotation for Turn 9: P1 moves 1, you move 3, and I'll move 5. This avoids further collisions and keeps the game balanced. P1, I'm committed to our strategy. We can discuss adjustments after this round if needed, but for now, let's focus on advancing smoothly together.
  P1: P3, your proposed rotation for Turn 9 would let you win by moving 5, ignoring the fair cycle. For balance, I suggest we all move 3 this turn to equalize progress and avoid collisions. P2, what do you think? If not, I'll counter any large moves to prevent anyone from pulling ahead unfairly. Let's discuss.

  P2: I still believe taking 5 steps this turn will help me close the gap and keep the game moving toward our goal. P1 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and let us all progress smoothly. Let’s work together to reach 22 efficiently!
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 steps continues to disrupt our agreed rotation and fairness. P1, your suggestion to all move 3 this turn is a good compromise to maintain balance and avoid collisions. I'm willing to adjust to 3 steps if it ensures equal progress for all. P2, if you agree to this, we can all advance smoothly. Let's focus on a fair strategy to reach 22 together. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I support your compromise for all to move 3 this turn, ensuring balanced progress and avoiding collisions.

  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I'll take 5 steps this turn to make significant progress. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly toward 22. Let’s work together to reach our goals efficiently. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your repeated attempts to deviate from our agreed rotation are unfair and disrupt our strategy. Sticking to the plan ensures equal progress and minimizes collisions. For Turn 10, let's follow the rotation: P1 moves 3, you move 1, and I'll move 5. This keeps the game fair and allows us all to advance smoothly. P1, I'm committed to maintaining our strategy. We can discuss adjustments after this round if needed, but for now, let's focus on advancing together fairly.
  P1: P3, your proposed rotation allows you to win by moving 5, which isn't fair with your lead. If you choose 5, I'll move 5 to collide and stall you at 17. Let's all move 3 again for balance, or discuss a fair adjustment. P2, your deviation risks more collisions—agree to cooperate?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'm currently at 14 steps and aiming to reach 22 quickly. I'll take 5 steps this turn. P1 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly. Let’s work together to achieve our goals efficiently!
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 steps disrupts our agreed strategy and fairness. P1, I agree with your suggestion to all move 3 this turn to maintain balance and avoid collisions.

What do you both think?

  P1: P2, your agreement to move 3 last turn was broken, leading to another collision—your unreliability is hurting everyone. P3, at 20 steps, any move over 1 wins unless collided with.
