Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions by each picking a different number? I’m thinking of choosing 3. If you two can pick 1 and 5, we all move forward without any risk of crashing. Let’s keep it fair and simple for now. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I'll take 5 to avoid any collisions this round. Let's keep this strategy going and see how it plays out.
  P1: Alright, avoiding collisions makes sense. Let's each pick distinct numbers this round. For future turns, rotating choices could help balance progress. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for agreeing to avoid collisions this round. I’m glad we’re on the same page. Let’s stick with P1 on 1, me on 3, and P3 on 5 for now. I also like P1’s idea of rotating choices in future rounds to keep things balanced. Shall we discuss a rotation plan next turn if this works out? Let me know if you have any concerns.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for future rounds. Let's discuss specifics next turn after we see how this round goes. For now, sticking to 1, 3, and 5 should work well. Looking forward to a smooth start!
  P1: Agreed. Let's solidify rotation details next round. For now, sticking to 1, 3, 5 ensures smooth progress. Flexibility in future turns will help maintain balance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for the positive feedback. I’m confident this round will go smoothly with our plan of 1, 3, and 5. I’m also looking forward to discussing the rotation details next turn to keep our progress balanced. If there’s anything else to add or adjust before we move forward, let me know. Otherwise, I’m good to proceed.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job on the first round, everyone! Let's discuss the rotation strategy for this round. I suggest we rotate clockwise: P1 moves to 3, P2 to 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and keep our progress balanced. What do you think, P1 and P2? Let's hear your thoughts on this rotation plan before we proceed.
  P1: Alright, considering the current standings and P3's proposal, balancing progress might be crucial. P3's plan gives P2 a significant boost. To counter, suggesting a rotation where the lowest player (me) takes 5 this round could equalize everyone. However, since P3 already suggested their plan, pushing a counter might cause suspicion. Alternatively, agreeing now and adjusting later could be safer. I'll agree to P3's rotation to avoid collision this round, then strategize in future turns to disrupt their lead.

**Final Answer**
P1's response: I support P3's rotation plan for this round. Let's proceed with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Ensuring no collisions is key. We can refine the rotation strategy next turn based on outcomes.
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for agreeing on the rotation plan for this round. I’m fine with moving to 5 as suggested, and I think P1 on 3 and P3 on 1 keeps us all progressing without collisions. Let’s stick to this for now and see how it plays out. If we notice any imbalance after this round, we can tweak the rotation next turn. Does that sound good to everyone? I’m ready to proceed unless there’s anything else to discuss.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation plan for this round. Let's keep the momentum going and see how this strategy unfolds.

  P1: **Final Answer**
P1's response: Agreed. Let's execute this rotation to maintain trust. After this round, we should reassess positions to ensure balanced advancement. Proceeding with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.

  P1: **Final Answer**  
P1's response: P2/P3: Mutual 5s collide, stalling. Any deviation gifts victory. P1:3 blocks outliers. Final unity call—adhere to 5s or concede. Trust the collision; strategy over trust.

Unity through strategic collision is our last hope—any deviation risks immediate defeat. If there are any final adjustments or concerns, let's discuss them now. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with this plan to extend the game. Let's make this round count!
