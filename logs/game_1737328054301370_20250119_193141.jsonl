After this round, we'll all be at different step counts, which will make the game more dynamic. For the next round, let's consider a strategy where the player closest to 24 steps takes <move>1</move>, and the other two players decide between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> to keep it competitive. This will add an extra layer of strategy and unpredictability. Let's move to the move phase after confirming."}
