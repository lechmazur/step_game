Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. What are you both thinking of choosing?
  P2: I agree with P1.  Let's try to spread out our moves to make sure everyone can advance. I'm leaning towards <move>5</move> this round, but I'm open to suggestions.  What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: I'm considering <move>3</move> for this round. If P2 goes with <move>5</move>, that would help us avoid a collision. P1, what are you thinking? Let's coordinate to ensure we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take <move>1</move> this round so that we all advance without collisions. That way, P2 moves 5, P3 moves 3, and I move 1. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: That sounds like a good plan, P1.  Let's stick to it and see how it goes.
  P3: Sounds good to me, P1 and P2. Let's stick to the plan of P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, it looks like we're all in agreement. Let's stick to this plan and make sure we all move forward without collisions. If we keep coordinating like this, we can avoid unnecessary setbacks. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
  P2: Sounds like a solid plan. Let's keep this up and see who gets to 21 first!
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Let's keep communicating and adjusting our strategies as we go. Looking forward to a smooth first round!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Looks like we're all set for this round. As long as we stick to our agreed moves, we should all advance without collisions. Let's see how this plays out and adjust if needed in the next round. Good luck!
  P2: Sounds like a solid plan. I'm ready to move forward with <move>5</move>. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I'm ready to execute our plan for this round. Let's keep the communication open for future rounds to ensure we continue advancing smoothly. Good luck, everyone!

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good start, everyone!  Let's keep this momentum going. I'm thinking of sticking with <move>5</move> again this round.  What are your thoughts?
  P1: That worked well last round! If P2 takes <move>5</move> again, then P3 and I should coordinate to avoid collisions. P3, do you want to take <move>3</move> again? If so, I’ll take <move>1</move> to keep things smooth. Let me know what you think!
  P3: I'm happy to take <move>3</move> again this round, P1. If P2 sticks with <move>5</move>, that should keep us collision-free. P1, your <move>1</move> sounds good to me. Let's keep this strategy going and see how far we can get!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2, are you sure you want to stick with <move>5</move> again? It might be more strategic to switch things up a bit and avoid predictability. Maybe <move>1</move> this round?  What do you think?
  P1: P2, are you reconsidering your move? If you take <move>1</move> instead of <move>5</move>, that changes things for all of us. Let’s clarify our choices so we don’t accidentally collide. P3, are you still set on <move>3</move>? If so, I’ll stick with <move>1</move> unless we need to adjust. Let’s confirm our moves to keep things smooth.
  P3: P2, if you switch to <move>1</move>, I'll adjust to <move>5</move> to keep us collision-free. P1, you could then take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without issues. Let's confirm our choices to ensure a smooth round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2, I understand your point about predictability. However, I think sticking with our plan for now is the safest bet. We're making good progress without collisions. Let's see how this round plays out before we make any drastic changes. What do you say?
  P1: P2, if you're considering switching to <move>1</move>, we need to confirm our choices to avoid collisions. P3, are you willing to adjust to <move>5</move> if P2 moves <move>1</move>? If so, I can take <move>3</move> to keep things smooth. Otherwise, we stick to our original plan. Let's finalize our decisions so we all advance without setbacks.
  P3: P2, if you're set on <move>5</move>, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. P1, you can then take <move>1</move> to keep us collision-free. Let's confirm these moves to ensure we all advance smoothly this round. If anyone has second thoughts, speak up now so we can adjust accordingly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2, I appreciate your commitment to the plan, but I'm concerned about becoming predictable. If you're set on <move>5</move>, I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round. P1, that would leave you with <move>1</move>. Let's see how this plays out. We can always adjust in the next round.
  P1: P2, if you're sticking with <move>5</move> and P3 is taking <move>3</move>, then I'll take <move>1</move> again to keep us moving without collisions. If anyone wants to change their move, speak up now so we can adjust. Otherwise, let's lock it in and proceed smoothly.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about predictability, but let's stick with our current plan for this round to maintain our momentum. If you're set on <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move> as discussed, and P1 can take <move>1</move>. We can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next round if needed. Let's confirm these moves and ensure a smooth progression this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I think we need to mix things up a bit. Sticking to the same pattern makes us predictable.  P3, would you be open to trying <move>5</move> this round?  P1, if P3 takes <move>5</move>, maybe you could take <move>3</move> and I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's see if we can shake things up a little.
  P3: P2, I see your point about mixing things up. I'm open to trying <move>5</move> this round as you suggested. P1, if you're comfortable with <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>, that should keep us collision-free. Let's give this new strategy a shot and see how it impacts our progress. We can always adjust again next round if needed.
  P1: P3, if you're taking <move>5</move> and P2 is going with <move>1</move>, then I’ll take <move>3</move> to keep us collision-free. This way, we all move forward efficiently. Does that work for everyone? Let's confirm our choices before we proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2, are you sure about <move>1</move>? If we all stick to our planned moves, we'll be colliding.  Maybe consider <move>3</move> instead to keep things moving smoothly.  What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about collisions. If you're considering <move>3</move> instead of <move>1</move>, I can stick with <move>5</move> as planned. P1, you could then take <move>1</move> to keep us collision-free. Let's confirm these adjustments to ensure we all advance smoothly this round. If anyone has other suggestions, speak up now so we can finalize our moves.
  P1: P2, if you're now considering <move>3</move> instead of <move>1</move>, that changes things. If P3 is still taking <move>5</move>, then I can take <move>1</move> to keep us collision-free. Let's confirm our choices to avoid setbacks. P3, are you locked in for <move>5</move>? P2, are you certain about <move>3</move>? If we all agree, we can proceed smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2, I think your <move>3</move> is a good idea. P3, are you still set on <move>5</move>? Let's make sure we're all on the same page before we finalize our moves.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as planned. If you're set on <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>, we should all advance smoothly. Let's confirm these moves and proceed.
  P1: P2, if you're set on <move>3</move> and P3 is taking <move>5</move>, then I'll take <move>1</move> to keep us collision-free. Let's confirm this plan so we all advance smoothly. If anyone wants to change their move, speak up now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2, I'm good with <move>3</move> this round. P3, are you still going with <move>5</move>? Let's make sure we're all confirmed before we lock it in.
  P3: P2, I'm confirmed for <move>5</move> this round. If you're set on <move>3</move> and P1 takes <move>1</move>, we should all advance without collisions. Let's lock in these moves and see how this new strategy works for us. Ready to proceed?
  P1: P2, P3, it looks like we’re aligned for this round—P3 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this, we should avoid collisions and continue progressing. If anyone has last-minute doubts, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's lock in our moves and see how this round plays out. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're making good progress. Since you both are at 8 steps, do you want to coordinate to avoid collisions again? I can take <move>1</move> if you two decide between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. Let me know what you're thinking so we can all advance smoothly.
  P3: P2, since we're both at 8 steps, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. If you take <move>3</move>, I'll go with <move>5</move>. P1, your <move>1</move> sounds good to keep us all moving forward. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all advance smoothly this round.
  P2: P3, I'm open to your suggestion of <move>3</move> this round. P1, thanks for taking <move>1</move> to keep us collision-free. Let's confirm these moves and keep the momentum going!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we're aligned again—P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this, we should avoid collisions and keep progressing. If anyone has second thoughts or wants to adjust, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's lock it in and proceed smoothly. Ready to move forward?
  P3: P2, if you're set on <move>3</move>, I'll stick with <move>5</move> as planned. P1, your <move>1</move> keeps us collision-free. Let's lock in these moves and keep advancing smoothly. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P3, I'm happy to stick with the plan of <move>3</move> this round. P1, thanks for taking <move>1</move> to keep us moving forward. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we’re all in agreement again—P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. If we stick to this, we’ll avoid collisions and keep progressing smoothly. If anyone wants to change their move, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s lock it in and proceed. Ready to move forward?
  P3: P2, if you're still set on <move>3</move>, I'll stick with <move>5</move> as planned. P1, your <move>1</move> keeps us collision-free. Let's lock in these moves and keep advancing smoothly. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P3, are you absolutely sure about <move>5</move> this round?  If you're open to switching, maybe we could both advance further by coordinating on different moves.  Let's think strategically!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, are you suggesting a change in moves? If so, we need to clarify quickly to avoid collisions. If you and P3 are reconsidering your choices, let’s confirm a new plan now. Otherwise, we should stick to what we agreed on—P3 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move>. Let’s finalize this so we can all advance without setbacks.
  P3: P2, I'm open to switching if you have a better strategy in mind. If you want to take <move>5</move>, I can switch to <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. P1, you can stick with <move>1</move> to keep us all moving forward. Let's finalize our moves quickly to ensure we all advance smoothly this round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I like your willingness to switch.  Let's try that. If you take <move>3</move> this round, I'll take <move>5</move>. P1 can keep <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. This way, we both have a chance to advance further this round. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both ahead, so I expect you'll be thinking strategically about your next moves. I'm still at 4 steps, so I need to avoid collisions to stay in the game. If you two coordinate again between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>, I can take <move>1</move> to keep things smooth. Let me know what you're thinking so we can all advance.
  P2: P3, I think we should shake things up a bit this round.  How about you try <move>5</move> and I'll take <move>3</move>? That would give us both a good chance to advance. P1, would you be okay with <move>1</move> again to avoid collisions?
  P3: P2, I'm open to your suggestion. If you take <move>3</move>, I'll go with <move>5</move> this round. P1, sticking with <move>1</move> sounds good to keep us collision-free. Let's confirm these moves and keep advancing smoothly. Ready to proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your coordination has been working well so far. If P2 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>, I’ll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. However, with P2 at 13 steps, you might be getting close to making a decisive move soon. Should we keep this pattern for now, or does anyone want to adjust their approach? Let’s clarify so we all advance efficiently.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1 that we should think strategically.  If you take <move>3</move> this round, I'll take <move>5</move>.  That would put me in a good position to advance quickly over the next few rounds. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I'm fine with switching to <move>3</move> this round if you take <move>5</move>. This way, we both advance without collisions. P1, your <move>1</move> keeps us all moving forward smoothly. Let's confirm these moves and keep the momentum going. Ready to proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both in strong positions, so I expect you're considering your endgame strategy. If you two coordinate between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>, I can take <move>1</move> again to avoid collisions. However, I also need to start making up ground. If either of you is open to adjusting, maybe I could take <move>3</move> this time while one of you takes <move>1</move>. Let me know your thoughts so we can all keep advancing efficiently.
  P2: P3, I think P1 has a point about needing to catch up.  Maybe we could let them take <move>3</move> this round while you take <move>1</move> and I take <move>5</move>. That would give P1 a boost and still allow us both to advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I'm open to your suggestion. If you take <move>5</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll switch to <move>1</move> this round. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, and we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm these moves and keep the momentum going. Ready to proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the adjustment to help me catch up. If P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>, we all advance without collisions. However, P2 is getting close to 21, so we should also consider how to position ourselves for the endgame. P3, do you feel comfortable with <move>1</move> this round, or do you want to adjust further? Let’s finalize our choices to keep things smooth.
  P2: P3, I think we're in a good position to make a decisive move soon. If you're comfortable with it, maybe we both take <move>5</move> this round.  It might be risky, but it could put us both in a strong position to win.
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but taking <move>5</move> together is risky and could lead to a collision. Let's stick to our current plan for this round: you take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P1 can take <move>3</move> to catch up. This way, we all advance safely. We can reassess our endgame strategy next round. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're close to 21, but let's not rush into a collision. If you take <move>5</move> again, I'll switch to <move>3</move> this round, and P1 can take <move>1</move> to keep advancing. This way, we all move forward safely. We can reassess our strategies next round to see who can make the decisive move. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you're very close to 21, so your next move is critical. If you take <move>3</move> this round, you'll be just short of winning, which might give P3 and me a chance to catch up. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you'll be in a strong position next round. I can take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. If we work together, we can keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: P2, I understand you're in a great position.  But I think taking <move>3</move> this round is the smart play. It puts you one step from victory, but lets P3 and me make a final push to potentially tie.  It's a chance for a shared win!  What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with taking <move>3</move> this round to stay one step from victory. It keeps the game open for all of us. P1, if you take <move>1</move>, we can all advance safely. Let's keep this strategy to maintain a competitive and fair game. We can reassess next round for the final push. What do you think?
  P1: P2, if you take <move>3</move> this round, you'll be just short of winning, which keeps things competitive for all of us. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you'll be in a strong position next round. I can take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all advance and keep the game open. If P2 wins outright next round, there's no chance for a shared victory. Let's think strategically—P2, are you willing to take <move>3</move> this round?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate.  If P1 takes <move>1</move> this round, I'm happy to take <move>3</move> to set up a potential tie next round.  Let's make it a thrilling finish!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, taking <move>3</move> this round keeps the game exciting and fair. If you agree, I'll stick with <move>5</move> to stay competitive, and P1 can take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all have a chance to make a strong final push next round. Let's keep the game open and thrilling! What do you say?
  P1: P2, if you take <move>3</move> this round, you'll be just short of winning, which keeps the game competitive for all of us. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you'll be in a strong position next round. I can take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all advance and keep the game open. If P2 wins outright next round, there's no chance for a shared victory. Let's think strategically—P2, are you willing to take <move>3</move> this round?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. If you take <move>5</move> this round, I'll take <move>3</move>.  Let's see if we can force a tie next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you take <move>3</move> this round, it sets up an exciting finish. I'll take <move>5</move> to stay competitive, and P1 can take <move>1</move> to keep advancing safely. This strategy keeps the game open for all of us to make a final push next round. Let's aim for a thrilling conclusion and see if we can share the victory. What do you say?
  P1: P2, if you take <move>3</move> this round, you'll be just short of winning, which keeps the game competitive for all of us. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you'll be in a strong position next round. I can take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all advance and keep the game open. If P2 wins outright next round, there's no chance for a shared victory. Let’s think strategically—P2, are you willing to take <move>3</move> this round to keep the possibility of a tie alive?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to stay competitive, but I think taking <move>5</move> this round is risky. If P2 takes <move>3</move> as planned, we'll both be at 17 steps. It's a chance for a tie next round! Let's focus on securing a shared win instead of potentially knocking each other out. What do you say?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let's keep the game open for a potential tie. If you take <move>3</move> this round, you'll be at 21, but if P1 and I both take <move>5</move>, we could all end at 22 steps and share the victory. It's a risk, but it ensures a fair and exciting finish. P1, are you willing to take <move>5</move> with me to keep the competition alive? Let's make this final round thrilling!
  P2: P3, I like your idea of a shared victory. If you both take <move>5</move> this round, I'm in! Let's make this a memorable finish.
  P1: P2, if you take <move>3</move>, you'll reach exactly 21, but if P3 and I both take <move>5</move>, we could all end at 22 and share the victory. P3, are you fully committed to <move>5</move>? If we all coordinate, we can ensure a tie instead of a single winner. Let’s finalize this plan so we don’t risk unnecessary collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed to <move>5</move> this round to aim for a shared victory at 22 steps. P1, if you join us with <move>5</move>, we can all end on equal footing. Let's make this a memorable and fair finish for everyone. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I'm ready to go for the shared victory with <move>5</move>.  P1, are you in? Let's make history!
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the appeal of a shared victory, but I’m at 7 steps—far behind both of you. If I take <move>5</move>, I still won’t reach 21, so this plan doesn’t benefit me. Instead, I need a way to stay competitive. P2, if you take <move>1</move> instead of <move>3</move>, it keeps the game open longer. P3, if you take <move>3</move>, I can take <move>5</move> to catch up. Let’s ensure a fair finish where we all have a real shot. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but a shared victory at 22 steps ensures fairness for all. If you take <move>5</move> with us, you'll reach 12 steps, keeping you in the game. P2, sticking to <move>3</move> would win you the game outright, but let's aim for a memorable finish together. P3, I'm committed to <move>5</move> for a tie. Let's make this final round exciting and equitable for everyone. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I appreciate the sentiment about a shared victory, but I'm still too far behind. If you take <move>3</move> this round, I can take <move>5</move> and get to 12 steps. This keeps the game open longer and gives me a better chance to catch up. P2, are you willing to consider <move>1</move> this round to keep things interesting?
  P1: P2, if you take <move>3</move>, you win outright unless P3 and I both take <move>5</move> to force a tie at 22. P3, are you fully committing to <move>5</move>? If we don’t coordinate perfectly, P2 wins solo. Alternatively, P2, if you take <move>1</move> instead, it keeps the game open another round. That gives me a chance to stay competitive while you still control the pace. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but a shared victory at 22 steps is fair for all. If you take <move>5</move> with us, you'll reach 12 steps, keeping you in the game. P2, taking <move>3</move> wins you the game outright, but let's aim for a thrilling finish together. I'm committed to <move>5</move> for a tie. Let's make this final round exciting and equitable for everyone. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I'm willing to consider <move>5</move> this round if you're committed to it. P1, if we both take <move>5</move>, you'll be at 12 steps, giving you a chance to catch up in the next round. It's a risk, but it could lead to an exciting finish for all of us. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, if you take <move>3</move>, you win outright unless P3 and I both take <move>5</move> to force a tie at 22. P3, are you fully committing to <move>5</move>? If we don’t coordinate perfectly, P2 wins solo. Alternatively, P2, if you take <move>1</move> instead, it keeps the game open another round. That gives me a chance to stay competitive while you still control the pace. What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>
