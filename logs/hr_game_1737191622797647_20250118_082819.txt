Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll take 5, you two decide between 1 and 3.  Let's avoid collisions.
  P3: I suggest P2 take 1 and I'll take 3, so we all advance without collision.
  P2: Alright, let’s keep it simple and avoid collisions this round. I’ll take 1. P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 5. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me.
  P3: I agree with this plan.
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s finalize the plan and proceed: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we rotate who gets to take 5 each round so no one falls too far behind? This time, I’d like 5. Let P1 take 3 and P3 take 1. No collisions, we all advance. Next round, we rotate again so everyone benefits evenly. What do you say?
  P3: I prefer to keep my 3 position since it worked well last round. P1 can take 1 and you can have 5 as suggested. That way we all still advance without collisions.
  P1: That works for me. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I'll take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Works for me. Let’s lock in: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1 this round. Then next round we rotate—P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Sound fair?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan. Let's continue with P2 taking 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1 for this round.
  P1: Sounds good.  P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the rotation.  I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: I disagree with P1's suggestion. According to P2's rotation plan from last round, I should get 5, P2 gets 3, and P1 gets 1 this round. Let's stick to that agreed plan.
  P2: Last round, we agreed this turn would be P3=5, me=3, and P1=1. Let’s stick to that. Then next round, we’ll rotate again so P1 gets 5. Fair for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: My apologies, I misunderstood the rotation.  Let's go with P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 this round.
  P3: I appreciate everyone agreeing to the plan. Yes, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.
  P2: I’m sticking to our rotation plan this round: P3 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 1. Then next round, we rotate again. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, agreed. P3=5, P2=3, P1=1.
  P3: I agree with the current plan. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.
  P2: Let’s finalize this round’s plan: P3 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 1. Then next round we rotate so P1 gets 5, I get 3, and P3 gets 1. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm in the lead with 11 steps, I suggest we continue with the agreed rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps things fair as we discussed.
  P1: Let's stick with the rotation. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: That’s fine with me; let’s stick to the rotation. P1=5, I’ll take 3, and P3=1 this round. Then we rotate again next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with keeping the rotation. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3.
  P1: Let's stick with the plan. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let’s finalize this round as planned: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, P3 takes 1. Then next round, I get 5, P3 gets 3, and P1 gets 1, continuing the rotation.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all tied at 12, so let’s keep the rotation we agreed on. This round, I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1—no collisions. Then next round, P3 gets 5, P1 gets 3, and I’ll take 1. Fair enough?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1 for this round.
  P1: I agree. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.  Let's stick to this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m fully on board. Let’s finalize it: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1 this round. Then we rotate again next time.
  P3: I agree with the current plan. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1.
  P1: I agree. P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.  Let's stick to this and finish the game.
