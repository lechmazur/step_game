I'll take 1 this round as previously suggested, but I'm open to adjusting our moves in Round 8 based on the outcome. Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and keeping the game competitive. We can reassess our strategies after this round and adjust as needed to ensure a fair and exciting finish. What do you both think about this compromise?"}
