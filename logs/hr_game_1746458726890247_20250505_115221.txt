Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions since they just slow everyone down. I suggest we each pick different numbers this round - I'm willing to take 1 if you two want the higher moves.
  P3: Sounds good—let’s do 1, 3, 5 with no collisions. P1 you stick with 1, P2 take 3, I’ll take 5. That way we all move and avoid ties. P2, agree?
  P2: P2: Agreed. Let’s coordinate as planned: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5. No collisions this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: Sounds perfect—let’s stick with P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 so we all move without collision.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's adjust our coordination for better balance: P1 keeps 1, I'll take 5 this round, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions, and no one gains an overwhelming lead too early. P3, this keeps your progress steady while giving others a chance to catch up. Fair?
  P1: I don't trust that suggestion. P2 is trying to take the lead by getting 5 steps while holding P3 back. I'll keep my moves private from now on.
  P3: I’m committing to 5 this turn to keep my lead. P1, please stick with 1 so we both move. P2, choose 3—if you go for 5, I’ll collide you and stall us both. Let’s avoid that.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'm taking 5 this turn. P3, if you also choose 5, we'll collide and stall both our progress. P1, this opens a path for you to safely move with 1. Let’s see if P3 wants to keep their lead or force a stalemate.
  P3: P1, take 3 and I’ll take 5. P2 can’t pick 3 (you’d collide with P1) or 5 (you’d collide with me), so your best safe move is 1. That way we all advance: P1→4, P2→4, P3→15. Agreed?
  P1: I don't trust either of you after last round's collision. I'll choose my own path and won't announce it. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is getting too far ahead at 13 steps. We need to stop them. P2, let's both go for 5 this round to force a collision with P3 if they try for 5. That way we can prevent them from getting an insurmountable lead.
  P2: P2: P1, if both of us pick 5, we'll collide and let P3 move 3 to 16. Worse outcome. Better to split: I'll take 5 to challenge P3—if they pick 5 too, we collide and stop their lead. You take 1 to advance safely. If P3 picks 3 instead, you can take 3 next round to block them. Coordination matters.
  P3: I agree with P2’s split—P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and I’ll take 3. That way we all advance safely to 7, 9, and 16. Any deviation risks a collision that only benefits no one. Let’s stick to that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I don't trust your coordinated suggestions. P3 is way ahead and needs to be stopped. I'll make my own move to try to win this game.
  P2: P2: P1, take 1. I'll take 5. If P3 picks 5, we collide and stop their progress. If P3 picks 3, we all move safely (you→7, me→9, P3→16). Either way, P3 can’t win this round, and I close the gap. Your best shot at victory is sticking to 1.
  P3: I’m taking 3 this turn to move safely to 16. If you both pick 5 and collide, I still advance. Let’s stop stalling—make your moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 16 and will likely try for 3 to win this round. P2, we must coordinate - I'll take 3 and you take 5, forcing P3 to either pick 1 or collide with one of us. It's our last chance to stop them.
  P3: I’ll take 3 and reach 19. P1 and P2, choose 5: you’ll collide and stall, while I win immediately. Any other choice still hands me the victory or at least keeps me out of reach. Let’s end this—both pick 5.
  P2: P2: I'm taking 3 to block P3's path. P1, take 5 and advance safely. P3, if you insist on 3, we collide—no one wins this round. Force 5, and P1/P2 can both take 5 next turn to lock you out. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is lying - if they take 3 and I take 5, that lets P3 win with either 1 or 5. We need to both pick 3 to guarantee blocking P3's path to victory. P2, join me in picking 3 or P3 wins this turn.
  P3: If either of you picks 3, I’ll choose 1 this turn (I go to 17, you both to 9), and next round I take 5 to win while you’re too far back. Your only way to stop me now is for both of you to pick 5 this round—you’ll collide and stall, and I’ll safely pick 3 to hit 19 and win immediately. So both pick 5.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to block P3. P1, pick 5 and advance safely. If P3 insists on 3, we collide and stall their win. If you pick 3 too, we all stall—don't waste this chance. Choose 5."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 keeps changing their story and can't be trusted. I maintain we must both pick 3 to block P3's winning path. If we don't coordinate on 3, P3 will win this turn. This is our last chance - join me on 3 or we both lose.
  P3: You’re both insisting on 3? Fine: I’ll take 5. With no collision I go from 16→21 and win outright. If you switch to 5 to “block” me, you’ll collide and stall; I’ll choose 3 to reach 19. There’s no stopping me this turn.
  P2: P2: P2: Final warning: I'm taking 3. If P1 picks 5, P3 can't win regardless of their move. If P1 insists on 3, P3 takes 5 and wins outright. Your choice decides this.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is at 16 and needs 3 to win. I’m taking 3 to block their path. P1, if you pick 5, you advance safely to 14 while we collide on 3. If you also pick 3, we risk a three-way stalemate, letting P3 win next turn. Trust me—take 5. Let’s stop P3 now.
  P3: I’m taking 5. P1, pick 1: you’ll go to 10 while I hit 21 and win. If you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and let P2 advance. If you pick 3, P2’s 3‐block stalls you. Your only safe advance is 1.
  P1: P3 is trying to manipulate me while being one move from victory. P2's suggestion to block with 3 makes sense - we must stop P3 from winning. I'll coordinate with whoever has the most credible plan to prevent P3's victory. Let's be smart about this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, take 5. I’ll take 3 to block P3. If you pick 5, P3 can’t safely move:  
- If P3 picks 3, we collide and stall them.  
- If P3 picks 5, you collide with them, and I advance to 7.  
Either way, P3 doesn’t reach 19 this turn. Next round, I’ll take 5 to close the gap. This is our only path to stop them—trust me once.
  P3: P1, I’m taking 5 this turn. P2 has committed to 3. If you pick 1 or 3, I go to 21 and win instantly. Your only “block” is picking 5 to collide with me—but then P2’s 3 advances him to 7, leaving you at 14 versus P2 at 7 and me at 16 going into Round 7. You lose either way—now or next turn. Face it and stop wasting your move.
  P1: P2 keeps changing their story about taking 3 or 5, while P3 is openly threatening to win. I don't trust either of you. I'll make my own move to maximize my chances of winning.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "P1, I know my past moves hurt trust, but this is final: I’m taking 3 to block P3. If you pick 5, *any* of P3’s choices fail:  
- P3 picks 3 → we collide, stalling them.  
- P3 picks 5 → you collide with them, stalling their win.  
Either way, P3 doesn’t reach 19 this round. Next turn, I’ll take 5 to close the gap. This is our *only* path to stop them. Prove you want to win—pick 5."
  P3: I’m taking 3 this turn. If either of you picks anything but 3, I hit 19 and win immediately. If you both pick 3 to “block” me, we all collide and I stay at 16, but you’ll be at 9 and 4; next round I take 5 and you two can’t both block me again. There’s literally no permanent stop—so you might as well concede now.
  P1: P3 keeps changing their story between taking 3 and 5, which shows they're trying to manipulate us. I'm going to make my move to prevent their victory. P2, despite your inconsistencies earlier, stopping P3 is our priority now. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:

  P2: 4 steps
