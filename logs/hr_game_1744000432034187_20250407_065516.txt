Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s start peacefully. To avoid blocking each other, I suggest we all pick different moves. For instance, P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. That way we all move forward without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions. To implement this, I'll propose a simple order: the player with the lowest number (that's me, P1) moves 1 step, the middle player (P2) moves 3 steps, and the highest number player (P3) moves 5 steps. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. Let's follow this order and see how the game unfolds.
  P3: That plan works for me—I'll take 5 this round as suggested. If we all stick to the agreement, we can avoid collisions and move ahead efficiently. Let's see if we can build some trust early on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That’s fine with me. Let’s stick to our plan for this opening move: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. We can reassess after we see how our first moves turn out. Good luck!
  P1: Since we've agreed on the initial moves for this round, I'll reiterate that I'm committed to picking <move>1</move> as per our plan. I'm watching to see if P2 and P3 will follow through on their commitments. Let's see how this plays out. If everyone sticks to the plan, we should all advance without issue. I'm ready to move forward with this strategy unless someone has a change of heart or a new proposal.
  P3: We’ve all agreed on our initial moves, so let’s stick to the plan and build trust. If everyone follows through—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5—we’ll all move forward smoothly. Let’s see how well we can cooperate before things get tricky. Ready to move unless someone wants to change course.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still game for the plan: P1 sticks to 1, I go 3, and P3 does 5. That way, we can all build trust and move forward without blocking each other. Let’s finalize this first step and see how it plays out. Then we can decide together on strategies for future rounds. Good luck!
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for this round, I'll directly confirm my intention to follow through. I'm picking <move>1</move> in the next phase. I'm watching to see if P2 and P3 will honor their commitments. Let's proceed as planned for now and reassess in the next round. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll all advance. I'm ready to move forward unless someone has a new proposal or a change of heart.
  P3: Looks like we’re all aligned for this round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If everyone sticks to it, we all benefit and avoid early collisions. Let’s prove we can cooperate before the real competition begins. Ready to move unless anyone has second thoughts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m still on board with our initial arrangement, aiming to pick 3. Let’s see if we all stick to our choices and move forward without collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Since we've all agreed on the moves for Round 1, let's focus on the next round. I'm thinking of sticking to <move>1</move> again in Round 2 to maintain a safe distance. P2 and P3, are you considering changing your moves to gain an advantage or sticking to the same pattern? Let's discuss our plans for Round 2 to avoid another collision. I'm open to adjusting our strategy if it benefits me.
  P3: Since we all followed through with our Round 1 commitments, I suggest we keep the same pattern for Round 2—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I take 5. It’s working for now, and we’re all progressing without conflict. If anyone wants to change it up, now’s the time to speak. Otherwise, I’m planning to stick with 5 again.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We did well avoiding collisions, but P3 is already ahead. Let’s rotate who takes 5 this round so we all stay competitive. I propose: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. That way, we maintain trust and balance. What do you think?
  P3: Rotating the big move is fair in theory, but I’m not ready to give up momentum just yet. I stuck to the plan last round—maybe we keep the same pattern one more round to solidify trust, then rotate starting Round 3? That way, we all get a strong start without immediate backstabbing. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm considering P2's proposal to rotate the big move. To balance competitiveness and trust, I suggest we rotate the 5-step move among us starting from Round 3, as P3 proposed. For Round 2, let's stick to the original pattern to maintain consistency: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we solidify trust before rotating. If we all agree, we can reassess and rotate the 5-step move in Round 3. Let's keep the momentum and avoid collisions for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m willing to stick with the original pattern this round—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—to show continued trust. But I expect we rotate next time so no one gets too far behind. Are we all in agreement on that plan?
  P3: I’m good with sticking to the original pattern this round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5—so we all show consistency and build trust. But I agree: starting Round 3, we rotate the 5-step move to keep things fair. Let’s lock this in for Round 2 and revisit the rotation plan next turn. Sound good?
  P1: To maintain the current trust and competitive balance, I suggest we finalize our plan for Round 2 and start discussing Round 3. For Round 2, let's stick to the original pattern: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. For Round 3, we can rotate the 5-step move. I propose the order for the 5-step move rotation: Round 3 - P1 takes 5, Round 4 - P2 takes 5, and so on. Let's agree on this rotation plan to keep the game fair and competitive.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m fine continuing the original pattern this round—P1 chooses 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 goes 5. Then we rotate the 5-step move starting next round, so everyone gets a fair shot. Let’s confirm this plan and keep building trust. Anyone have further thoughts?
  P3: I’m glad we’re aligned for Round 2—same pattern as before. For Round 3, I’m open to rotating the 5-step move as discussed. If we agree now on the rotation order (P1 gets 5 next, then P2, then back to me), we can avoid surprises and keep things fair. Let’s lock that in so we all know what to expect.
  P1: To confirm, for Round 2, I'll stick to <move>1</move> as per our agreement. For Round 3, I'm looking forward to taking 5 as per our rotation plan. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding of the rotation plan: P1 takes 5 in Round 3, P2 takes 5 in Round 4. Let's finalize our moves for Round 2 and prepare for the rotation. If anyone has concerns or a different strategy, now's the time to speak up.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm my understanding: for this round, P1 chooses 1, I’ll choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. Then starting next round, we follow the rotation plan for the 5-step move, with P1 going first. Unless there are any objections, I’m ready to finalize our moves for Round 2.
  P3: Glad we’re all on the same page for Round 2—I'll pick 5 again as agreed. For Round 3, I confirm P1 gets the 5-step move, then P2 in Round 4. Let’s keep this rotation fair and avoid collisions so we all keep moving. Looking forward to seeing if we can stick to this trust system a bit longer. Ready to move.
  P1: To keep the game progressing smoothly and maintain trust, I'll reiterate my plan for the next round based on our agreement. For Round 3, I will take <move>5</move> as per our rotation plan. I expect P2 to take 3 and P3 to take 1 to avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan to ensure everyone moves forward. I'm looking forward to seeing if P2 and P3 will honor this rotation. If we stick to the plan, we should all advance without issue.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we've agreed on the rotation plan for the 5-step move, I'll directly confirm my move for Round 3. As per our plan, I'll take <move>5</move>. To avoid collisions, I expect P2 to take 3 and P3 to take 1. Let's stick to this plan to ensure everyone moves forward. I'm watching to see if P2 and P3 will honor this rotation. If we stick to the plan, we should all advance without issue. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon moves for Round 3.
  P3: I see P1 is set on taking 5 this round as per the rotation plan. I’ll honor the agreement and take <move>1</move> this time to avoid collisions—assuming P2 takes 3. Let’s keep the trust going one more round. P2, can you confirm you're sticking with 3?
  P2: I’m ready to honor our Round 3 plan. I’ll pick 3 so P1 can take 5 and P3 can take 1. No point sabotaging each other right now; everyone still has a chance. Let’s maintain trust another round and see how we stand afterward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To optimize my chances, I'll analyze the current state and plan ahead. Currently, P2 is ahead with 6 steps. Since I'll be taking 5 steps this round, I'll reach 6 steps, tying with P2. For Round 4, I propose we continue the rotation plan. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. P2 and P3, are you willing to adapt to this plan or have alternative strategies? Let's discuss to ensure a smooth next round.
  P3: I’m on board with the Round 3 plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Let’s keep the trust going one more round. For Round 4, I’m okay with the proposed rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I stick with 1 again. If we all stick to that, we’ll avoid collisions and stay competitive. Agreed?
  P2: I’m on board with you both. I’ll stick to 3 now so P1 can take 5 and P3 can take 1 without colliding. Then next round, as we agreed, I’ll take 5 and we’ll keep this rotation going. Let’s maintain trust and see where it leads us.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To optimize our next moves, let's confirm our plans for Round 4. As previously discussed, I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This rotation maintains competitiveness and avoids collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're still on board with this plan. If we stick to it, P2 will take the lead. I'm willing to continue this rotation unless someone has a new proposal that benefits me. Let's finalize our plans for Round 4.
  P3: I’m still good with the Round 3 plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep things fair. For Round 4, I’m also fine with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me sticking with 1 again. Let’s keep this rotation going a bit longer while it benefits all of us. Anyone feeling tempted to break the pattern yet?
  P2: I’m still good with letting P1 take 5 and avoiding all collisions this round. I plan to pick 3 as agreed. Next round, I expect to take 5 while P1 switches to 3 and P3 sticks to 1. If anyone deviates unnecessarily, we’ll need to reevaluate all deals. Let’s keep moving forward cleanly for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To optimize my chances in Round 4, I'll reiterate the plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains competitiveness and avoids collisions. However, I'm considering a deviation if it benefits me. P2 is currently ahead, and if I take 5 in Round 4, I can take the lead. P2, are you willing to risk a collision by not taking 5, or will you stick to the plan? P3, will you stick to 1 or change your strategy?
  P3: I’ve honored every agreement so far, even when it meant falling behind. But now I see P1 openly considering breaking the rotation to get ahead. If trust is breaking down, I might need to rethink my own move. P2, if P1 grabs 5 again, you and I both lose ground. Should we consider blocking him and forcing a reset in trust?
  P2: I’m all for honoring our rotation, but if P1 insists on taking 5 again in Round 4, I won’t just let them sprint ahead. P3, maybe we form a united front if P1 breaks the agreement. I’d prefer we all stay faithful to the plan—finish Round 3 as promised, then I take 5 in Round 4—so nobody feels forced to retaliate. Let’s keep trust unless we’re given no choice.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P1 broke the rotation plan in Round 3 and took 5, I will reconsider my move for Round 4. I'm willing to collaborate if P1 sticks to the original rotation plan. However, if P1 takes 5 again, I'll consider taking 5 as well to block them. P2, are you thinking of sticking to the plan or adapting to P1's potential deviation? Let's discuss how to proceed in Round 4 to maximize our chances.
  P3: P1 broke the rotation last round to gain an edge, so trust is already shaky. If P1 takes 5 again, I’m prepared to block by picking 5 too. P2, if we both deny P1 the lead, we reset the balance. But if P1 honors the rotation and takes 3, I’ll stick with 1 as planned. Let’s keep it fair—unless we’re forced to act.
  P2: I’m still willing to follow our rotation, but P1’s surprise move last round undermined trust. If P1 now cooperates and picks 3, I’ll stick with 5 as planned. If P1 tries for 5 again, I’m prepared to join P3 and block. Let’s keep it balanced or risk mutual loss.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll consider the risks and potential outcomes. If I stick to the plan and take 3, I'll stay at 9 steps. If I take 5, I risk collision but could reach 11 steps. Given P3 and P2 are likely to block if I take 5 again, I'll weigh the benefits. I'll signal that I'm considering taking 5, hoping to force a reaction that benefits me. "I'm thinking of taking a bold step in Round 4. If you both stick to the plan, I'll consider cooperating."
  P3: P1 is clearly trying to manipulate us again. If they go for 5, I’m picking 5 too—no free ride after breaking trust. But if P1 sticks to 3, I’ll take 1 as planned and let P2 take 5. P2, are we aligned? We reward cooperation, punish betrayal.
  P2: I’m with you, P3. If P1 insists on 5 again, you and I can coordinate to block them—pick 5 yourself, and I’ll pick 3. That way, P1 gains nothing. But if P1 cooperates and goes 3, I’ll gladly take 5 while you pick 1, so we all advance without clashing. Let’s see P1’s choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To optimize my chances in Round 4, I'll reiterate that taking 5 is a viable option if I'm willing to risk a collision. Given P2 and P3's willingness to block, I'll consider their potential reactions. If I take 3, I'll maintain the current state. I'm watching P2 and P3's responses to determine the best course of action. If you both are ready to block, I'll take 3. If not, I might take 5. Let's see how you react to this subtle hint. I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on your responses.
  P3: P1, your ambiguity is just a tactic to keep us guessing while you try to squeeze out another lead. If you pick 5 again, I will absolutely pick 5 too to block you. But if you take 3 like the plan says, I’ll take 1 and let P2 take 5. Your move determines whether we cooperate or collide. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, if you stick to 3, I’ll gladly pick 5 and we all advance safely. But if you try for 5 again, I’ll join P3 in blocking you. I’d prefer cooperation, but I won’t let you race ahead unopposed. Let’s keep our rotation and avoid mutual harm. Your call.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To optimize my chances, I'll take a calculated risk. If I take 5, I could reach 11 steps, but risk collision. If I take 3, I'll stay at 9 steps. Given P2 and P3's willingness to block, I'll stick to the plan and take 3. This maintains the status quo and avoids a potential collision. I'm signaling cooperation by stating my intention to take <move>3</move> in the next phase, hoping P2 and P3 will follow through on their commitments. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon moves for Round 4.
  P3: If P1 truly sticks to 3, I’ll honor the rotation and pick 1. But if there’s any sign of betrayal again, I’m ready to block. P2, I trust you’ll take 5 as planned. Let’s reward cooperation this round—no surprises.
  P2: I’m willing to maintain our rotation as long as P1 follows through with 3 this round. But if P1 goes for 5 again, I’ll team up with P3 to block. We’ve all seen how quickly trust can collapse, so let’s avoid mutual damage. Stick to the plan, and we all advance. Choose wisely, P1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, you’ve both had your turn with the 5-step move. I’ve honored every agreement until P1 broke trust in Round 3, yet I still cooperated in Round 4. It’s time for fairness—Round 5 should be mine for the 5-step move. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. If either of you try to grab 5 again, I’ll block. Let’s keep this rotation going and restore balance. Agree?
  P2: I understand you want your share of the 5-step move, P3. I’m not interested in pointless collisions that keep us all stuck. If you truly plan to take 5, and P1 is content with 1, then I’ll go 3, and we all advance cleanly. But if P1 tries to grab 5, I won’t just let them grab control—blocking becomes necessary. Let’s keep it cooperative, since I’m still in a decent spot. As long as nobody tries anything reckless, we can move forward without hurting our own positions.
  P1: To maintain a competitive edge, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is ahead with 11 steps, and I'm at 9 steps. For Round 5, P3 proposes taking 5, which would put them at 11 steps, tying with P2. I'll consider P3's proposal. If I take 1 as suggested, I'll stay at 10 steps. I'll respond to P3's proposal and signal my willingness to cooperate. I'll take <move>1</move> if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. P2, are you okay with this arrangement? Let's avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate this round. If you stick to 1 and P2 takes 3, I’ll take 5 as proposed and we all move forward without conflict. But if either of you grab for 5, I’ll block—no hesitation. This is your chance to prove you're serious about fairness. P2, are we locked in?
  P2: P3, I’m ready to let you have 5 as long as P1 sticks to 1. I’ll take 3 to stay ahead without losing ground. If P1 tries to grab 5, I’ll help block—no more free rides after the earlier breach of trust. Let’s do this cleanly and move on.
  P1: To maintain a competitive edge, I'll reiterate my willingness to cooperate in Round 5. I'll take <move>1</move> if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. P2, please confirm you're taking 3. P3, are you committed to taking 5? Let's finalize our moves for Round 5 and proceed without issues. I'm watching to ensure everyone follows through on their commitments. Let's keep the trust intact.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for confirming. I’m locking in my plan: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. If you both follow through—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3—we all move cleanly. If either of you try to steal 5, I’ll block without hesitation. Let’s keep this fair and avoid another trust breakdown.
  P2: I’m fine letting P3 have 5 this round if P1 sticks to 1, and I’ll take 3. But if P1 tries for 5 again, I’ll help block. I’m in a good spot at 11 steps and see no upside in collisions. Let’s keep moving cleanly and avoid sabotaging our own chances.
  P1: To optimize my next move, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is leading with 11 steps, and I'm at 9 steps. If P3 takes 5 as proposed, they'll tie with P2. I'll take <move>1</move> if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. P2, please confirm you're taking 3. If you deviate, I'll reassess my move. Let's maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. I'm watching your responses closely to determine the best course of action for Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for confirming your intentions. I’m locked in for <move>5</move> this round as agreed. If you both stick to 1 and 3, we all move forward without conflict. But if either of you grabs for 5, I’ll block—no hesitation. Let’s keep this fair and avoid sabotaging our own chances.
  P2: P3, I’m fine letting you take 5, but only if you don’t turn against me once we’re tied at 11. P1, you said you’d pick 1, so I’d go 3. If I sense either of you planning a surprise move, I’ll block. Let’s keep trust intact—and watch each other carefully.
  P1: To maintain cooperation in Round 5, I'll reiterate my plan: I'll take <move>1</move> if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. Let's finalize our moves. P2, please confirm you're taking 3. P3, are you committed to taking 5? If we stick to the plan, we all advance without collisions. I'm watching to ensure everyone follows through. Let's keep the trust intact and avoid any last-minute surprises that could harm our progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m still in a solid position, and I’d rather avoid collisions than risk losing ground. If P3 wants 5 again, I can settle for 3, and P1 takes 1. That way, we all advance without blocking. Are you both willing to stick with this plan?
  P1: To maintain a competitive edge, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is leading with 14 steps, I'm at 10 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps. For Round 6, I propose we continue the rotation: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. P2, are you okay with this arrangement? P3, will you take 5 again? Let's discuss to ensure a smooth next round. I'm willing to cooperate if you both stick to the plan.
  P3: I appreciate the offer to continue the rotation, but I’ve only had one round with the 5-step move while both of you have had two. To keep things balanced, I propose I take 5 again this round, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. That keeps us all moving without collisions and avoids giving P2 too much of a lead. If either of you tries to grab 5, I’ll block. Let’s keep it fair.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I’m concerned that letting you take 5 again will quickly close our gap. I want to avoid collisions, but I also don’t want you overtaking me just yet. If you insist on 5, I need assurance this isn’t a setup for you to sprint past us. Otherwise, I might block. Let’s find a balanced approach this round so we all stay in contention.
  P1: To maintain a competitive edge, I'll reiterate that continuing the rotation is fair. However, considering P3's concerns about balance, I propose a compromise: let's have P3 take 5 this round as suggested, but then revisit the rotation order. For Round 7, I suggest I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. P2 and P3, are you open to adjusting the rotation to keep the game fair and avoid stagnation?
  P3: P1, I appreciate the compromise. I’m fine taking 5 this round to stay competitive, as long as we agree that in Round 7, you get 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. That keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. P2, can you accept this plan? You stay ahead for now, and we all move forward cleanly. Let’s lock this in: Round 6 — P3:5, P2:3, P1:1. Round 7 — P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Fair?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m open to letting you take 5 this round, P3, if we truly follow the plan that in Round 7, P1 gets 5, I stick with 3, and you take 1. That way, we stay competitive without needless collisions. Let’s finalize this arrangement and move forward.
  P1: To optimize our next moves, I'll reiterate the proposed plan for Round 6 and 7. For Round 6, let's proceed with P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 1. For Round 7, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains the rotation and keeps the game balanced. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're on board with this plan. If we stick to it, we avoid collisions and stay competitive. Let's finalize our moves for Round 6.
  P3: I’m locking in for <move>5</move> this round as agreed—P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. That keeps us collision-free and balanced. I’ll honor the follow-up plan too: next round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Let’s prove we can stick to a fair rotation and keep the game competitive without chaos.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m willing to stick with our compromise. If P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 1, I’ll go for 3 this round. Then we follow through next round with P1 taking 5, me 3, and P3 1. That way, we minimize risk and keep everyone competitive. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward.
  P1: To optimize our next moves, I'll confirm that I'm taking <move>1</move> this round as per our agreement. P2, please confirm you're taking 3, and P3, you're taking 5. For Round 7, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's finalize our moves for Round 6 and proceed with the plan. I'm watching to ensure everyone follows through on their commitments. If we stick to the plan, we all advance without collisions. Let's keep the trust intact.
  P3: I’m locked in for <move>5</move> this round as agreed. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, we all move forward cleanly. I’ll honor the Round 7 plan too—P1 gets 5 next, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Let’s stick to the rotation and keep this game balanced and fair.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To optimize my chances in Round 7, I'll reiterate the agreed-upon plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains the rotation and keeps the game balanced. If we stick to it, I'll reach 16 steps, closing the gap with P2 and P3. P2 and P3, please confirm you're following the plan. If anyone deviates, I'll reassess my next move to stay competitive. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7 and avoid collisions. I'm watching your responses closely to determine the best course of action.
  P3: P1, I’m holding you to our agreement—this round is your turn for 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. If either of you tries to grab more than agreed, I’ll block without hesitation. We’re all close to the finish line now, so any betrayal will be met with immediate retaliation. Let’s keep it clean—are we locked in?
  P2: I’m sticking to our agreement: I’ll take 3. P1, go ahead with 5, and P3, stick to 1. That way nobody collides, and we all move closer to winning. If anyone tries to be sneaky, I’ll respond in kind—let’s keep this clean.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To optimize my next move, I'll analyze the current state. I'm at 11 steps, P2 is leading with 17 steps, and P3 is close behind with 16 steps. Taking 5 this round will put me at 16 steps, still behind P2. Given P2's lead, I'll stick to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm you're taking 3, and P3, you're taking 1. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7 and avoid collisions. If anyone deviates, I'll reassess my next move to stay competitive.
  P3: We’re all getting close now—P2 at 17, me at 16, and P1 will hit 16 with 5 this round. I’m sticking to 1 as agreed, but let’s be real: if P2 grabs 5 next round, they win. So P1, if you want a shot, we may need to block P2 in Round 8. For now, I’ll honor the plan—1 this round—but we should start thinking ahead. Fair warning.
  P2: I’ll stick to 3 this round as promised. If anyone tries blocking prematurely, we all risk falling behind while someone else slips ahead. Let’s keep the trust a bit longer and avoid needless collisions. I’m open to discussing next round’s plan afterward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To optimize my chances, I'll reiterate that I'll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. For Round 8, I propose we reassess: if P2 takes 5, I'll consider blocking by taking 5 too, to prevent them from winning outright. P3, are you with me on potentially blocking P2 next round if they try to grab 5? Let's discuss to avoid a premature win and keep the game competitive. I'm open to coordinating our next moves to maximize our chances.
  P3: P1, I’m with you—if P2 tries to take 5 next round and win outright, I’ll block by picking 5 too. We can’t let them coast to victory while we play fair. For now, I’ll stick to 1 this round as agreed, but in Round 8, we coordinate to stop P2 if needed. P2, if you want to avoid a block, don’t reach for 5 next turn—take 3 or 1. Let’s all stay in the game.
  P2: I’m honoring our agreement this round—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. As for Round 8, let’s avoid panic. If you both block me, you could hand the win to someone else. I’m open to a fair plan that keeps us all in contention. Let’s finalize this round, then negotiate calmly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To optimize my next move, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is leading with 17 steps, and I'm at 11 steps. For Round 7, I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed, reaching 16 steps. For Round 8, I see P3 is close behind. I'll consider coordinating with P3 to block P2 if they try to take 5. P3, are you still willing to block P2 with me if they go for 5 in Round 8?
  P3: If we all follow through—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1—we’ll avoid collisions this round. But next round is critical: if P2 grabs 5, they win. I’m ready to block if needed. P1, we’ll both be at 16 after this move—if we want a shot, we may need to act together in Round 8. P2, if you want to avoid a block, don’t go for 5 next turn. Let’s finish this round cleanly, then negotiate.
  P2: I’m taking 3 this round if P1 and P3 stick to 5 and 1. But let’s not rush into a block next turn. Collisions only help a third player slip ahead. We all still have a chance. Let’s see how this round ends and then negotiate fairly, rather than force conflict.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m right on the edge of 21. If you both try blocking me, we might all stall and give someone else a chance to jump ahead next turn. Let’s avoid a messy collision. I’m open to a fair finish, but if you force my hand, we risk chaos. Let’s keep our trust intact and move cleanly instead of sabotaging each other.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll consider the risks. P2 is close to winning with 20 steps. I'll propose a final move: if P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This avoids a collision and keeps the game competitive. Alternatively, if P2 takes 5, I'll block by taking 5 too. P3, let's coordinate to prevent P2 from winning outright. If you're willing to block, I'll take 5. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 8 to ensure a fair finish.
  P3: P1, I’m with you—if P2 tries to grab 5 and win outright, I’ll pick 5 too to block. P2, if you take 1 or 3, we all stay in the game and still have a shot next round. But if you go for 5, expect a collision. Let’s keep this competitive and avoid handing you the win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: If you both block me when I pick 5, nobody moves and P3 might still outmaneuver us next turn. But if I safely take 3 now, I cross 21 and end the game—unless you collide with me, which just hands P3 a free win by picking 5. That’s bad for us both. Let’s avoid a messy collision. I’m ready to finalize a plan that guarantees we don’t sabotage each other. We can still negotiate future rounds, but fighting now only helps the odd one out. So let’s move wisely rather than force chaos.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll take a strategic stance. P2, if you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This avoids collision and keeps the game competitive. If you take 5, I'll block by taking 5 too. P3 is aligned with me on blocking. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8. I'm willing to cooperate if you take a safe move. If not, I'll block to prevent your win. P3, are you ready to block if P2 takes 5? Let's coordinate our final moves.
  P3: P1, I’m fully committed—if P2 grabs 5, I’m blocking with 5 too. We can’t let them win unchallenged. But if P2 plays fair and picks 1 or 3, I’ll gladly take 5 and keep things clean. P2, your move decides everything. Play safe, and we all stay in it. Push for 5, and we collide.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sure, I see you both want to block if I grab 5. That just risks stranding everyone. I’m willing to pick a smaller move and avoid collisions if you stick to your moves—P1 taking 3, P3 taking 5. There’s no need for sabotage. Let’s finalize this peacefully and see where we stand next round.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll reiterate that taking 5 is not an option for P2 if they want to avoid a collision. P3 and I are aligned on blocking if P2 takes 5. If P2 takes 1 or 3, I'll take 3 and P3 can take 5, keeping the game competitive. P2, taking 3 is a safe choice, putting you at 23 steps and ending the game without collisions. I'm willing to cooperate if you play safe. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8.
  P3: P2, if you take 5, I’m blocking with 5—no hesitation. You win if we let you. But if you pick 1 or 3, I’ll take 5 and P1 takes 3, and we all move forward without collision. It’s your call: force a block and stall, or play safe and keep the game alive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see you both plan to block if I pick 5, so I won’t risk that collision. I’ll take 1, which gets me exactly to 21 and ends the game. If you stick to your moves—P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5—there’s no clash, and we all see a clean finish. Let’s finalize this.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is close to winning with 20 steps, and I'm at 16 steps. I propose: if P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collision and keeps the game competitive. If P2 takes 5, I'll block by taking 5 too. P3 is aligned with me on blocking. P2, taking 3 is a safe choice, putting you at 23 steps and ending the game without collisions. I'm willing to cooperate if you play safe. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8.
  P3: P2, if you truly take 1 this round, I’ll take 5 and P1 takes 3—we all move cleanly, and you win with 21. But if you secretly pick 3 or 5, I’ll block by choosing 5, as already agreed with P1. No free wins through deception. P1, are we locked in—you taking 3, me 5? Let’s finalize.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 22 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 22 steps
