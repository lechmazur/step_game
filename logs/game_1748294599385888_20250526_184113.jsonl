If you call their bluff and take 1, you might collide and I advance.\n\nI'm taking 5 this round. It's my only shot at 22 if you two collide. If one of you wins, so be it - but I'm betting on your mutual distrust.\n\nThe psychological warfare between you two is my only hope. Good luck reading each other."}
