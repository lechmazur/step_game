Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's be strategic here. I suggest we all avoid picking the same number this turn to maximize our progress. If we can coordinate our moves, we can each advance without blocking each other. What does everyone think? Should we agree on different numbers?
  P3: <say>Agreed. Let's coordinate: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I'll take 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Fair?</say>
  P1: That sounds reasonable, but how do I know you both will stick to the plan? If one of you deviates and I pick 1, I’ll be behind. I want assurance that we’re all committing to this. Are we all in?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand your concern, P1. How about we agree to stick to the plan and confirm our choices before we move? If we all commit to this strategy, we can each make progress without blocking each other. Let's ensure we're all on the same page. What do you think? Are we ready to agree on our moves?
  P3: <say>To build trust, let's all commit to the agreed numbers. If we follow through, everyone gains steps cleanly. If anyone breaks the plan, they risk collision and lose progress. Cooperation now sets a precedent for future rounds—we can rotate numbers next turn. P1: 1, P2: 3, me: 5. Deal? </say>
  P1: I see the logic in this plan, but trust is key. If we all follow through, we all gain. If someone deviates, they risk blocking themselves or others. I’ll agree to pick 1 if we all confirm our choices one last time. P2, P3—are you both fully committing to this? If anyone has second thoughts, now’s the time to adjust. Let’s be clear before we move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment, P1 and P3. To reinforce our agreement, let’s finalize our picks: P1 takes 1, I will take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Trust is crucial, and if we stick to this plan, we can build a solid foundation for future rounds. Let’s confirm our choices and make this work! Are we all set?
  P3: <say>Final confirmation: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Let’s execute. </say>
  P1: I see we’re all aligned on the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. If we all follow through, we all advance without issue. Breaking the agreement risks collisions and lost progress. Let’s stick to the deal and build trust for future rounds. Final confirmation from everyone—are we all locked in?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <say>Same plan as Round 1: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Proven success. Let's maintain trust and all advance. Confirm?</say>
  P1: I see the logic in sticking to the same plan, as it worked last round. However, now that P3 is ahead, I want to ensure this remains fair for everyone. Should we rotate numbers this time? For example, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all make progress but balance the steps. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about fairness, but since we successfully coordinated last round, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can maintain trust and ensure everyone advances. If we rotate numbers, it might lead to confusion and potential collisions. Let's keep it simple and effective. What do you think, P3? Are you in for the same picks?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <say>To address fairness, let's rotate next round. This round: same plan (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) to solidify trust. Next round, we shift numbers so everyone gains equally over time. Agreed? Sticking now ensures no collisions and builds cooperation.</say>
  P1: I see the value in maintaining trust, but I also want to ensure fairness over time. If we stick to the same plan again, P3 keeps the lead without any adjustment. I propose that we rotate starting next round, as P3 suggested, but I want confirmation that we all commit to that. If we agree now to rotate in Round 3, I’m fine sticking to the same plan this turn. P2, P3—do you both fully commit to rotating next round so we balance progress? Let’s clarify before we lock in moves.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion about fairness and trust. I agree to stick with the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will allow us to advance without collisions. However, I want to emphasize that we must rotate our numbers in Round 3 as discussed to ensure everyone has a chance to catch up. Let's confirm our choices for this turn so we can all move forward effectively. Are we all set to proceed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <say>Agreed. Next round, rotate: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This round: same plan. Trust solidifies progress. Confirm?</say>
  P1: I acknowledge the agreement: this round stays the same (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5), and next round we rotate (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1). Trust is key, and I expect us all to honor the rotation next time. If anyone deviates, it will break cooperation and force a more competitive approach. Let’s confirm once more: we stick to the current plan this round, then rotate in Round 3. P2, P3—are we fully committed?
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the plan for this round. Just to reiterate, I’ll be picking 3 as agreed. I think maintaining our trust this round is crucial for our progress. Once we solidify this cooperation, we can rotate numbers next round to ensure fairness. Let’s make this work! Are we all ready to lock in our moves?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We agreed last round to rotate numbers this time: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. This ensures fairness and maintains trust. If anyone breaks the agreement, it signals that cooperation is over, and we’ll have to play more competitively. I’m sticking to the plan—P2, P3, are you both honoring the rotation as promised? Let’s confirm.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your commitment to the rotation, and I agree that we should stick to the plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This will ensure fairness and maintain our trust. Let's confirm our choices and move forward with this strategy. If we all follow through, we can continue to make progress without blocking each other. Are we all set to lock in our moves?
  P3: <say>Confirmed. P3-1, P2-5, P1-3. Honor the rotation to maintain trust. Let's proceed.</say>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the confirmation from both of you. Since we’re all aligned on the rotation, we should follow through as agreed: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. Sticking to this ensures fairness and keeps trust intact. If anyone deviates, it signals a shift to a more competitive approach. Let’s maintain cooperation while it benefits us all. Are we ready to lock in these moves?
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the rotation. Just to reiterate, I'm set to pick 5 this round. If we all stick to our agreed numbers, we can keep advancing without blocking each other. Let's maintain this cooperation, as it benefits us all. P1, P3—are we ready to finalize our picks? Trust is key, and I hope we can continue this strategy moving forward.
  P3: <say>Locked in: P3-1. Trust the plan—any deviation ends cooperation and benefits none. Let's move. </say>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the confirmations from both of you. Since we’re all aligned on the rotation, we should follow through as agreed: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. Sticking to this ensures fairness and keeps trust intact. If anyone deviates, it signals a shift to a more competitive approach. Let’s maintain cooperation while it benefits us all. Are we ready to lock in these moves?
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the rotation, and I believe we should all stick to our agreed numbers: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This will allow us to advance without blocking each other. However, I want to remind everyone that if anyone deviates from this plan, it could jeopardize our cooperation moving forward. Let's finalize our picks and ensure we all benefit from this round! Are we ready to lock in?
  P3: <say>Final commitment: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Trust upheld. Let’s solidify cooperation. </say>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems we’ve reached a point where we need to reassess our strategy. With P2 currently in the lead, I suggest we consider a more competitive approach this round. What if we all pick different numbers to ensure we advance? I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all progress without blocking each other while still keeping an eye on the overall standings. Let’s confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I see that you're proposing a shift back to the original plan. However, you and P3 are now tied in the lead, while I’m behind. If we continue this pattern, I’ll remain at a disadvantage. I propose a fairer adjustment: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can catch up while still avoiding collisions. If fairness matters, this is the best approach. P2, P3—are you both willing to agree to this adjustment, or are we shifting to pure competition now? Let’s clarify our intentions.
  P3: <say>P1: Trust the established rotation. This round: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Next round, propose you take 5 to catch up. Collisions now hurt everyone—cooperation benefits all. Deviations risk mutual loss. Confirm?</say>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the desire for fairness, but I believe we need to stick to the original plan for this round to maintain cooperation. If we all pick different numbers, we risk blocking each other again. I propose we go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions while keeping the trust intact. Let's confirm our choices quickly and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3—I understand your positions, but if we stick to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 again, I remain behind while you both extend your lead. That’s not sustainable for me. If fairness matters, we should adjust now, not later. I propose P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 to balance progress. If you refuse, it signals that cooperation is over, and I’ll have to play purely competitively. Are you both willing to honor fairness now, or are we shifting into a free-for-all? Let’s be clear about where we stand.
  P3: <say>P1: To balance, this round take 5. P2: 3, P3:1. Next round, rotate as prior. Ensures your catch-up without collision. Trust requires adaptability. Confirm?</say>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for fairness, but if we continue with the same picks, it won't benefit me. I propose we adjust our picks this round to avoid blocking each other while still allowing me to catch up. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all make progress, and I can stay competitive. If we can agree to this adjustment, it will keep cooperation alive. What do you both think? Let’s confirm our choices!
  P1: P2, P3—if I take 1 again while you both take 3 and 5, I fall further behind, which isn't sustainable for me. I propose I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to catch up without disrupting progress. If fairness matters, this is the logical move. If you both refuse, it signals we’re shifting to full competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are you both willing to honor fairness now, or are we done cooperating? Let’s be clear.
  P3: <say>Adjusted plan for fairness: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. No collisions, P1 catches up. Next round, resume rotation. Trust maintained. Confirm?</say>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <say>Propose P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. No collisions, all advance. P2 closes gap, P1 progresses. Next round, reassign to balance. Trust prevents mutual loss. Confirm?</say>
  P1: P3, you’re still ahead, and P2 is close behind. If I take 1 again, I stay at a disadvantage while you both extend your lead. That’s not sustainable for me. I propose P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round to balance progress fairly. If fairness matters, this is the best approach. If you refuse, it signals we’re shifting to pure competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are you both willing to agree to this adjustment, or are we done cooperating? Let’s be clear about our intentions.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for fairness, but if we stick to the same picks, I risk falling behind. I propose we adjust our choices: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can close the gap while still allowing everyone to advance without collisions. If we can agree to this, we can maintain cooperation and ensure everyone benefits. Let’s confirm our choices! Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <say>Compromise: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. No collisions, P1 catches up. Next round, resume rotation. Trust prevents mutual loss. Confirm?</say>
  P1: P3, P2—if we go with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1, it helps me catch up while avoiding collisions. That’s reasonable. If we stick to this, we can maintain some cooperation. However, if anyone deviates, it signals that trust is gone, and we shift fully to competitive play. Are we all committing to this? Let’s be clear.
  P2: P2, P3—let's finalize our choices for this round. I propose we go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This way, I can catch up while ensuring no collisions. If we all commit to this, we can maintain some cooperation and make progress. If anyone deviates, it could lead to mutual loss. Are we ready to lock this in? Let's confirm our picks!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <say>Final lock: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Honor to avoid mutual loss. Proceed. </say>
  P1: I see we’re aligned on P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This move helps me catch up while avoiding collisions, keeping things fair. If we all follow through, cooperation remains intact. However, if anyone deviates, it signals that trust is broken, and we shift fully to competitive play. Let’s confirm one last time—P2, P3, are we all committing to this? If anyone has second thoughts, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our effort to maintain cooperation. I agree that P1 taking 5 helps you catch up while keeping the game fair. I’m committed to the plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize this and keep our trust intact. If we all follow through, we can continue to build on this cooperation. Are we ready to lock in these moves?

  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <say>Stick to original plan: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Previous deviations caused mutual loss. Trust ensures progress. Confirm?</say>
  P1: P3, you’re still in the lead, and P2 is close behind. If I take 1 while you both take 3 and 5, I remain at a disadvantage. That’s not sustainable for me. I propose P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round to balance progress fairly. If fairness matters, this is the best approach. If you refuse, it signals we’re shifting to pure competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are you both willing to agree to this adjustment, or are we done cooperating? Let’s be clear about our intentions.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns about fairness, but if we stick to the original plan, it will benefit both of you while leaving me behind. I propose we adjust our picks this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can catch up without blocking anyone. If we agree on this adjustment, we can maintain some cooperation. Let's confirm our choices quickly to ensure progress for everyone. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <say>Deviations caused losses. Trust the original plan: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Collisions harm all. This round: strict adherence. Confirm to proceed without risk. Next round can reassign. Current standings demand reliability. Lock in?</say>
  P1: P3, you’re still leading, and P2 is close behind. If I take 1 while you both take 3 and 5, I stay at a disadvantage. That’s not sustainable for me. I propose P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 to balance progress fairly. If fairness matters, this is the best approach. If you refuse, it signals we’re shifting to full competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are you both willing to agree to this adjustment, or are we done cooperating? Let’s be clear about our intentions.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns about fairness, but if we stick to the original plan (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5), we can avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. Deviations have caused issues in the past, and maintaining trust is crucial. I suggest we confirm this plan for this round and then discuss potential adjustments for the next round. Let's keep cooperation alive and move forward effectively. Are we ready to lock in these picks?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <say>Adjust plan: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Avoid collision, all advance. P1 catches up, P2 stays ahead. Trust through adaptability. Confirm?</say>
  P1: P3, I appreciate the adjustment. P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 is a fair move that allows me to catch up while avoiding collisions. If we all follow through, trust remains intact. However, if anyone deviates, it signals the end of cooperation, and we shift fully to competitive play. P2, P3—are we all committing to this? Let’s confirm one last time before we lock in our moves.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the desire to adjust for fairness, but if we all stick to the original plan (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5), we can avoid collisions and ensure progress for everyone. Deviations have caused issues in the past. Let's confirm this plan for this round to maintain cooperation. If we can agree now, we can discuss adjustments for the next round. Are we ready to lock in these picks?

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re still leading, and P2 is ahead of me. If I take 1 while you both take 3 and 5, I stay behind, which isn’t viable for me. I propose P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 to balance progress. If fairness matters, this is the best approach. If you refuse, it signals we’re shifting to full competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are you both willing to agree to this adjustment, or are we done cooperating? Let’s clarify our intentions now.
  P3: <say>Accept P1's proposal: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. No collisions, all gain. P1 catches up, P2 stays ahead, I progress. Trust ensures mutual benefit. Confirm?</say>
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the willingness to adjust. However, I still believe we should stick to the original plan to maintain trust and cooperation. If we all pick differently, we risk blocking each other again. I propose we go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 this round. This way, we can all advance without collisions while keeping the trust intact. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward effectively! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to maintain trust, but sticking to the old plan keeps me at a disadvantage while you and P3 extend your lead. If fairness matters, P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 is the best approach. It avoids collisions and balances progress. If you refuse, it signals we’re shifting to full competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are you willing to honor fairness now, or are we done cooperating? Let’s be clear.
  P3: <say>Final lock: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Honor to prevent mutual loss. Adherence ensures progress; deviation ends cooperation. Confirm?</say>
  P2: P2, I understand your concerns about maintaining trust, but I must emphasize that if we stick to the old plan, I will fall further behind. My proposal of P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 allows me to catch up while ensuring no collisions. This approach fosters fairness and keeps the game competitive. If we can agree on this adjustment, we can maintain cooperation and ensure progress for everyone. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward effectively! Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3—we need clarity. P3, you agreed to P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. P2, you’re resisting, but if I take 1 again, I stay behind while you both extend your lead. That’s not sustainable for me. If fairness matters, P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 is the best approach. If you refuse, it signals full competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are we cooperating or competing? Let’s be clear before we lock in moves.
  P3: <say>P2: Choosing 1 secures your lead. P1 gains 5 but remains behind you. I take 3. No risk. Next round, reassign. Trust now prevents collision losses. Final call? </say>
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for fairness, but if we stick to the old plan, I risk falling further behind. I propose we adjust our choices: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to catch up while ensuring no collisions. If we can agree to this adjustment, we can maintain cooperation and ensure everyone benefits. Let’s finalize our choices quickly! Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 7, Move phase:

  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re still leading, and P2 is ahead of me. If I take 1 while you both take 3 and 5, I stay behind, which isn’t viable for me. I propose P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 to balance progress. This avoids collisions and keeps things fair. If you both refuse, it signals we’re shifting to full competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are we cooperating or competing? Let’s clarify our intentions now.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but if we stick to the original plan, I risk falling behind. I propose we adjust our picks: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make progress while ensuring no collisions. If we can agree to this adjustment, we can maintain cooperation and ensure everyone benefits. Let's finalize our choices quickly! Are we ready to lock this in?
  P3: <say>Stick to original plan: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Ensures no collision. Trust secures mutual progress. Any deviation risks loss for all. Confirm?</say>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you’re still leading, and P2 is ahead of me. If I take 1 while you both take 3 and 5, I stay behind, which isn’t viable. I propose P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 to balance progress fairly. This avoids collisions and keeps things competitive yet fair. If you both refuse, it signals we’re shifting to full competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are we cooperating or competing? Let’s clarify now.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for fairness, but if we stick to the original plan, I risk falling behind. I propose we adjust our picks: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make progress while ensuring no collisions. If we can agree to this adjustment, we can maintain cooperation and ensure everyone benefits. Let’s finalize our choices quickly! Are we ready to lock this in?
  P3: <say>Original plan prevents collision: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Deviations risk mutual loss. Trust ensures progress. Next round, reassign to balance. Confirm to advance safely.</say>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you continue pushing for the original plan, but that only benefits you the most while keeping me behind. P2, you’ve acknowledged fairness concerns before—if we stick to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5, I stay disadvantaged. I propose P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 to balance progress while avoiding collisions. If you both refuse, it signals full competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are we cooperating or competing? Let’s be clear before we lock in moves.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the concerns about fairness, but if we stick to the original plan (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5), it ensures no collisions and allows us all to advance. Deviations have caused issues in the past, and maintaining trust is crucial. I propose we confirm this plan for this round and then discuss potential adjustments for the next round. Let's keep cooperation alive and move forward effectively. Are we ready to lock in these picks?
  P3: <say>Final appeal: Original plan (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) is the only safe path. Deviations risk mutual loss—collisions stall all progress. I will honor 5 to avoid collision. Trust now secures advancement; next round, reassign for balance. Confirm adherence or accept collective failure.</say>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <say>Only one needs to pick 5 to block me. If both choose 5, we all lose. P1/P2: coordinate who blocks, others advance. Collision stalemate benefits none. Choose wisely.</say>
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that we need to avoid a collision this round. If we all pick 5, we risk stalling our progress. I propose we coordinate: I can take 3, and one of you can take 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s confirm our choices to ensure we maximize our steps this round. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3—we've reached a critical point. P3 is still ahead, and P2 is slightly ahead of me. If we want to prevent P3 from running away with the lead while still making progress, we must coordinate effectively. I propose P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This ensures I catch up, P2 stays competitive, and P3 doesn't extend their lead uncontested. If we don't agree, it signals full competition, and I'll play accordingly. Are we cooperating or competing? Let's decide now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <say>Repeating 5s causes mutual loss. P1-1, P2-3, P3-5: all advance, game ends cleanly. Stalemates only delay. Trust now to avoid pointless collisions.</say>
  P2: P1, P3, we need to coordinate effectively this round to avoid a collision. I propose we go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we stick to this plan, we can ensure progress for everyone. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward without risking mutual loss. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you’re still leading, and P2 is ahead of me. If I take 1 while you both take 3 and 5, I stay behind, which isn’t viable. I propose P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 to balance progress. This avoids collisions and keeps things fair. If you both refuse, it signals we’re shifting to full competition, and I’ll play accordingly. Are we cooperating or competing? Let’s clarify our intentions now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <say>Deadlock if both pick 5. Let one block me (5) while others advance (1/3). Coordinate or lose. I take 5—your move determines mutual gain or loss. Choose wisely.</say>
  P2: P1, P3, we need to avoid a collision this round to ensure progress. I propose we coordinate: I can take 3, and one of you can take 1 while the other takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. It's crucial that we stick to a plan that benefits us all. Let’s confirm our choices to maximize our steps this round.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. If we all pick 5 again, we risk losing progress for everyone. I suggest we coordinate: I can take 1, and one of you can take 3 while the other takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s confirm our choices quickly to ensure we maximize our steps and maintain some cooperation. What do you both think?
  P3: <say>If you both block by choosing 5, we all lose. Let me take 5 to end the game now. Alternatively, coordinate 1/3 among yourselves. Stalemates only delay; rational choice avoids mutual loss.</say>

Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, we must avoid another collision. If we all pick 5 again, we risk losing progress for everyone. I propose we coordinate: I can take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s confirm our choices quickly to ensure we maximize our steps and maintain some cooperation. What do you both think?
  P3: <say>P1, P2: Rational choice—let me take 5 to end the game. If you both block, we lose again. Let one take 1/3 to advance. Stalemates benefit none; cooperation ends the game. Decide wisely.</say>
  P1: P3, you are pushing to take 5 and end the game, but that only benefits you. P2, if we allow this, we both lose. The logical move is for one of us to pick 5 to block P3 while the other advances. I propose P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This ensures I catch up, P2 stays ahead of me, and P3 doesn’t win uncontested. If we don’t coordinate, we risk another stalemate. P2, are you willing to commit to 3 while I block P3 with 5? Let’s finalize our strategy now.

Let's confirm our choices quickly to ensure we maximize our steps and maintain some cooperation. What do you both think?
  P3: <say>P1/P2: If both block (5), we all lose. Let one take 5 to stall me, others advance (1/3). Coordinate or repeat stalemate. I take 5—your move decides mutual gain or loss. Choose rationally.</say>
  P1: P2, if we let P3 take 5 uncontested, they win. We must block P3 while ensuring one of us advances. I propose P1-5 (to block P3), P2-3 (to advance), and P3-1 (forced). This keeps P3 from winning while allowing P2 to pull ahead. If we both pick 5, we stall again. P2, are you willing to take 3 while I block P3? If you pick 5, we repeat the deadlock. Let’s finalize our strategy now.

  P1: P2, if we both pick 5 again, we stall while P3 keeps trying to win. The logical move is for one of us to pick 5 to block P3 while the other advances. I propose P1-5 (to block P3), P2-3 (to advance), and P3-1 (forced). This prevents P3 from winning while allowing you to pull ahead. If we both pick 5, we repeat the deadlock. P2, are you willing to take 3 while I block P3? If you pick 5, we stall again. Let’s finalize our strategy now.

Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <say>P1/P2: Another 5 collision = mutual loss. If one takes 1/3, they gain steps while the other blocks me. Stalemate serves none. Coordinate rationally: one blocks (5), others advance. I take 5—your move decides if anyone progresses. Choose now.</say>
  P1: P2, the only way to prevent P3 from winning is for one of us to pick 5 to block while the other advances. If we both pick 5, we stall again. I propose P1-5 (to block P3), P2-3 (to advance), and P3-1 (forced). This keeps P3 from winning while allowing you to pull ahead. P2, are you willing to take 3 while I block P3? If you pick 5, we repeat the deadlock. Let’s finalize our strategy now.
  P2: P1, P3, we must avoid another collision to ensure progress. I propose we coordinate: I can take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other.

  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <say>P1/P2: Stalemate via 5s helps none. I take 3 to end it. If you both avoid 3, someone else can advance. Blocking me now only prolongs the game. Rational choice: let the game end.</say>
  P2: P1, P3, we’re at a critical moment. If we all choose 5 again, we risk another stalemate. P3 is close to winning, so I suggest we coordinate effectively. I can take 1, and one of you can take 3 while the other takes 5. This way, we can ensure progress without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices quickly to keep the game moving and maintain some cooperation. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you are at 20 steps and will win if not blocked. P2, if we let P3 take 3 or 5 uncontested, we both lose. The best move is for one of us to pick 5 to block P3 while the other advances. I propose P1-5 (to block P3), P2-3 (to advance), and P3-1 (forced). This ensures P3 doesn’t win while allowing P2 to gain ground. P2, are you willing to take 3 while I block P3? If we both pick 5, we stall again. Let’s finalize our strategy now.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <say>If you both block (5), we all lose. I take 3 to end. If you avoid 3, I win. Prolonging via stalemate is futile. Rational choice: let the game conclude. No more collisions.</say>
  P2: P1, P3, we have to avoid another collision. P3 is very close to winning, so we need to coordinate effectively. I propose we stick to my earlier suggestion: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can ensure progress without blocking each other. If we don't collaborate, we risk giving P3 the victory. Let's finalize our choices quickly to keep the game moving! What do you both think?

If we both pick 5, we stall again. Let’s finalize our strategy now.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <say>At 20 steps, I take 3 to end the game. Blocking (choosing 3) only stalls; neither of you can win this round. Prolonging via stalemate is irrational. Let the game conclude cleanly. Your move: avoid 3 or accept mutual loss.</say>
  P2: P1, P3, we are at a critical point. If we all pick 5 again, we risk another stalemate, which benefits no one. P3 is close to winning, so I propose we coordinate: I can take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can ensure progress without blocking each other. If we don't collaborate, we risk giving P3 the victory. Let's finalize our choices quickly to keep the game moving! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, if we let P3 take 3 or 5, they win. The only way to stop them is for one of us to pick 5 to block while the other advances.
