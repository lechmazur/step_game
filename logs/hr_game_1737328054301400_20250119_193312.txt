  P3: Okay, I'm thinking I'll try for 1 this round. P1, your idea about alternating is interesting, but maybe we should all just aim for different numbers each round for now? P2, what are your thoughts?

  P1: P2, are you thinking 3 this round? I'm leaning towards 1 to avoid another collision.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm still going for 5. P2, if you're not going for 5, that would be great. Maybe you could aim for 3?
  P1: P3, I appreciate you trying to coordinate, but I think it's best if we each make our own decisions this round. I'm going to stick with my plan to go for 1. Good luck everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'm still going for 5 this round, hoping P1 and P2 don't also choose it. Let's see what happens.
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to coordinate, but I think it's becoming counterproductive.  Let's each focus on our own strategy and see where it takes us. Good luck!
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, I'm going to stick with 5 this round. Hopefully, at least one of you will pick something different.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>

  P1: P3, I appreciate you trying to coordinate, but I think we need to shake things up a bit.  I'm leaning towards 5 this round.  P2, any thoughts on your move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, I'm going to go for 5 this round. P1, since you are going for 5, maybe we can both try to get P2 to pick 1? P2, if you pick 1, you'll advance, and P1 and I will collide, which might be good for you.
  P1: P2, your silence is deafening. Are you going to break your pattern and throw us all a curveball? P3, are you sure about 5 again? It feels like we're stuck in a loop. Maybe a risky move is what we need to shake things up.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:

  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your consistent choice of 5 is interesting. Are you hoping we'll eventually tire of going against you and give you a clear path? P3, I'm thinking 1 this round. Maybe a change of pace will help us all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'm going to aim for 3 this round. P1, since you're going for 1, and P2 seems stuck on 5, maybe we can finally all move this round. P2, any chance you'll try something else?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your predictability is starting to work against you.  P3, I think a collaborative approach might be our best bet.  Maybe we should try to coordinate our moves going forward? What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'm going to aim for 1 this round. P1, since you're going for 1, maybe we can both try to get P2 to pick something other than 5? P2, if you pick 3, you'll advance, and P1 and I will collide, which might be good for you.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your silence is intriguing. Are you hoping we'll just give up trying to predict your moves? P3, I'm thinking 5 this round. Let's see if we can finally break this pattern and all make some progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, I'm going to stick with 1 this round. P1, you said you're going for 5, so maybe P2 will finally choose something different than 5. Let's hope we can all advance this round.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm starting to think your strategy is to let us exhaust ourselves trying to predict you.  Maybe a bold move from you would shake things up? P3, I'm thinking 3 this round. What are your thoughts?

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I'm going to go for 5 this round. P1, maybe you could try for 1? P2, you're so close to winning, maybe you should try for 1 as well, and we can all move? I'm hoping to finally make some progress this round.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your consistency is admirable, but predictable. P3, I'm sensing a shift in your strategy.  Maybe we can capitalize on that? I'm leaning towards 5 this round. What are your thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'm going to try for 3 this round. P1, since you're also leaning towards 5, I think we should try to get P2 to pick 1. P2, if you pick 1, you'll advance, and P1 and I will collide, which might be good for you.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your silence is becoming a liability.  You're so close to winning, but you're letting us dictate your moves. Take control and choose 1 this round. P3, I'm sticking with 5. Let's see if we can finally break free from this stalemate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'm going to go for 1 this round. P1, since you're going for 5, maybe P2 will finally pick something different. P2, you're so close to winning, but if you pick 1, you'll advance, and P1 and I will collide. It's your best chance to move.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, I admire your persistence, but at this point, sticking to 5 is hurting you.  P3, I think we should both aim for something different than 5 this round. Let's see if we can force P2's hand.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, I'm going for 3 this round. P1, since you're going for 5, and P2 is still likely to go for 5, maybe we can both get some steps in if P2 finally picks something different? P2, this is your chance to make a move.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're in a strong position.  I'm sensing P3 might try to get you to pick 1 this round, but I think you should stick with your strategy. It's working. P3, I'm going for 1 this round. Let's see if we can shake things up.
