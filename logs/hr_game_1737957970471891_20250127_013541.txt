Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's make this interesting! How about we all start with different moves to avoid any collisions? I'll go with <move>1</move>, P1 can choose <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. That way, we all advance and keep things competitive. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's do it.
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2 and P3. I'll take <move>3</move> for this round. Let's all advance!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's keep the momentum going. I'll take 5 again this round. P1, you go with 3, and P2, how about you try 1 again?  We'll be at 10, 6, and 2.
  P2: P3, I see your plan, but let's shake things up a bit. How about I go with <move>3</move> this time, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you stick with <move>5</move>? This way, we keep it unpredictable and still avoid collisions. What do you guys think?
  P1: Okay P2, your suggestion sounds good to me! Let's try P2 with <move>3</move>, P1 with <move>1</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move> this round.  It keeps things mixed up and we all still move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'd rather stick with the original plan.  Predictability helps us all advance steadily. I'm going with 5. P1, please stick with 3, and P2 please go with 1.  This will get us closer to the goal faster.
  P2: P3, I see your point about predictability, but I think a little unpredictability can be beneficial too. How about this: I'll take <move>3</move> as planned, P1 can stick with <move>1</move>, and you can go with <move>5</move>. This way, we still avoid collisions, but it keeps everyone on their toes. Let's make it a bit more dynamic and exciting! What do you say, P1 and P3?
  P1: Okay P2, I'm still good with your plan of P2 taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move> for this round. P3, are you willing to try this mix-up this time? It still lets us all move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, I understand the desire to mix things up. However, I'm sticking with 5.  I strongly suggest P1 take 1 and P2 take 3.  Let's prioritize reaching the goal efficiently.  A consistent strategy benefits us all in the long run.
  P2: Alright, P3, I get your point about consistency, but I'm sticking with my plan to take <move>3</move>. P1, if you're still on board with taking <move>1</move>, we can keep the game interesting and avoid collisions. P3, if you're set on <move>5</move>, let's see how this round plays out. Good luck to us all!
  P1: Okay P2, I'm still planning to choose <move>1</move> this round as we discussed. P3, are you willing to try <move>5</move> with us this time to keep things moving smoothly for everyone? Let's aim for another round of advancement for all of us.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I apologize for the miscommunication last round.  Let's reset.  I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, please choose <move>1</move>. P2, please choose <move>3</move>. This puts us at 10, 7, and 8 respectively.  This is the most efficient path forward for all of us.
  P1: P3, your reset plan sounds good to me. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round.
  P2: P3, I understand the reset plan, but I'd like to suggest an alternative to keep things dynamic. How about I take <move>5</move> this time, P1 goes with <move>3</move>, and you stick with <move>1</move>? This way, we mix things up a bit while still avoiding collisions. It keeps the game unpredictable and exciting. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm prioritizing reaching the goal efficiently. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>.  P1, please choose <move>1</move>. This allows both of us to advance.  If you choose 3 and collide with P2, neither of you will move forward.  Let's maximize our progress.
  P1: P2, I think mixing it up is a good idea too. I'm happy to go with <move>3</move> as you suggested. P3, would you be willing to try <move>1</move> this round so we can all advance?
  P2: P3, I understand your focus on efficiency, but let's try a different approach this round. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 can go with <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep things exciting. It also balances the scores a bit more. P1, are you on board with taking <move>3</move>? P3, are you willing to consider <move>1</move> just for this round to see how it plays out? Let's keep the game dynamic and fun!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for dynamism, but the finish line is in sight.  My choosing 5 is the most efficient path to victory for me, and incidentally, gives you both the best chance of advancing too.  I will choose 5.  Please, P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3.  Let's end this round quickly and cleanly.
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, how about we try something different to mix things up as P2 suggested? P2, would you be willing to take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move> this round? Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a fresh approach. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 can choose <move>5</move>, and P3 can go with <move>3</move>. This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the game unpredictable. It keeps everyone advancing and balances our positions. What do you both think? Let's add some excitement and see how this round unfolds!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's ensure we all advance this round. How about I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>? This worked well in the first round and keeps us all moving forward. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the benefit of P1's suggestion, but let's consider an alternative. How about I go with <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>? This way, we avoid collisions and shake things up a bit. It keeps the game dynamic and gives us all a chance to advance. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm going for the win this round. I'm choosing <move>5</move>.  Please, choose 1 and 3 respectively so we can all advance and end this quickly.  If I hit 25, I win. Let's avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, to keep things moving smoothly and ensure we all advance, let's go with my initial suggestion for this round: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 choose <move>1</move>, and P3 choose <move>5</move>.  This way we avoid collisions and all make progress. P2, does that sound good to you?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the strategies being discussed, but here's a new angle: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 can go with <move>3</move>, and P3 can choose <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, keeping the game unpredictable and interesting. It balances our scores and adds a bit of excitement. What do you both think? Let's give this a shot and see how it plays out!
  P3: I'm sticking with <move>5</move>.  I need 18 more to win, and another 5 gets me closer.  P1, please choose <move>3</move> and P2, please choose <move>1</move>. This is the fastest way for us all to advance. Let's finish this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is set on <move>5</move>.  Maybe you should also pick <move>5</move> this round? I'm considering <move>3</move>.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a new approach. I'll go with <move>3</move>, P1 can choose <move>5</move>, and P3 can pick <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game unpredictable and exciting. It balances our scores and adds a bit of excitement. What do you both think? Let's give this a shot and see how it plays out!
  P3: I'm locking in <move>5</move>.  The finish line is so close.  If either of you also choose 5, you'll delay your progress. P1, choose 3. P2, choose 1. This is the clearest path to the end.  Let's wrap this up.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a fresh strategy this round. I'll go with <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can choose <move>3</move>. This way, we all avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. It balances our scores and adds excitement. What do you both think? Let's give it a shot and see how it plays out!
  P1: Okay P2, your plan sounds reasonable, but I suspect P3 might choose <move>5</move> again to try and reach the goal quickly. To be safe, how about we both choose <move>5</move> this round to block P3 and prevent them from advancing further? What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with <move>5</move>.  I'm close to winning.  If either of you choose 5, you won't advance.  Let's end this quickly: P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3.  Don't delay the inevitable.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, here's a bold idea: I'll choose <move>5</move> to boost my position, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can go with <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game exciting. P1, this could help you catch up, and P3, it ensures you still advance. Let's shake things up and see how it plays out! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I think we should both call P3's bluff and choose <move>5</move> this round. P3 is clearly prioritizing their own win, and if we let them keep picking <move>5</move> unopposed, they will reach the goal very quickly. By both picking <move>5</move>, we can stop P3 from advancing and give ourselves a chance to catch up. What do you say? Let's coordinate to block P3 this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire to block me, but it's a short-sighted strategy.  If you both choose 5, *neither* of you will advance. I will simply choose 5 again next round and win.  If you let me have this 5, I'll choose 3 next round, guaranteeing one of you can take 5 and advance significantly.  This is the quickest path to the end for all of us.  Choose 1 and 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's consider a balanced approach. I'll choose <move>3</move> to advance steadily, P1 can pick <move>1</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain progress. P1, this helps you catch up, and P3, it keeps you on track for the win. Let's aim for an efficient and fair game. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I agree we should block P3 this round. P3 is clearly just trying to win for themselves and not playing fairly. I will choose <move>5</move> to stop P3 from advancing. Please also choose <move>5</move> so we can ensure P3 doesn't move further ahead. Let's coordinate to block P3 this round.
  P3: I'm choosing 5.  If you both choose 5, you both lose. If only one of you chooses 5, you lose and the other advances. If neither of you choose 5, I win.  This isn't about fairness, it's about winning.  Choose 1 and 3 and let's end this.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm choosing 5.  This is non-negotiable.  If one of you chooses 1 and the other chooses 3, this game ends now. If you both choose 5, we all lose.  If you both choose something else, I still probably win.  Choose 1 and 3. Let's be done with this.
  P1: P3, you are demanding we let you win, but that's not going to happen. P2, let's coordinate again and both pick <move>5</move> this round to block P3.  If we both choose <move>5</move>, P3 won't advance and we can re-evaluate next round. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's consider a different approach. I'll go with <move>1</move> this time, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game progressing. P1, this helps you advance, and P3, it keeps you on track. Let's aim for a strategic round where we all get closer to our goals. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your frustration.  But continuing to block me only delays the inevitable.  If we keep colliding, *none* of us will win.  Let me take this 5, and I *promise* I'll choose 3 next round.  One of you can then take 5 and jump significantly ahead.  This benefits us all.  Let's end this stalemate.
  P1: P2, I agree with you that blocking P3 is still the best move for this round. P3 is clearly trying to rush to the finish line. Let's both choose <move>5</move> again to prevent P3 from advancing further and then we can reconsider our strategy for the next round. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a cooperative approach. I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. P1, this helps you advance, and P3, it keeps you on track. If we keep blocking, none of us will win. Let's aim for a strategic move that benefits us all and keeps the game interesting. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm choosing 5.  This ends the game if you choose 1 and 3.  If you both choose 5, *none* of us win.  If you choose something else, I'm still very likely to win.  Stop blocking me and let's finish this.
  P1: P2, let's try a different approach. I'll choose <move>1</move> and you choose <move>3</move>. Let's assume P3 will pick <move>5</move> again. This way, we both advance while P3 stays put. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a new strategy. I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. P1, this helps you advance, and P3, it keeps you on track. If we keep blocking, none of us will win. Let's aim for a strategic move that benefits us all and keeps the game interesting. What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a new strategy to keep things interesting. I'll choose <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. P1, this helps you advance, and P3, it keeps you on track. If we keep blocking, none of us will win. Let's aim for a strategic move that benefits us all and keeps the game dynamic. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion is okay, but I think we need to catch up to P3 faster. How about I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and let P3 take <move>1</move>? This way, we both gain more steps and can challenge P3 in the next rounds.
  P3: P1 and P2, I will choose 5.  If either of you also choose 5, *you* will not advance.  I am only 13 steps from victory.  Let's end this: P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3.  A quick win for me is the best outcome for all of us.  Continuing this stalemate only hurts your chances.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's shake things up. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can go with <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance and keep it unpredictable. P1, this helps you gain more steps, and P3, it keeps you in the game without a collision. Let's see how this dynamic approach plays out! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's try my suggestion from earlier this round. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>. This way P2 and I can gain some ground on P3, but we all still move forward. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm choosing 5.  This is the most efficient way to end the game. If you choose 1 and 3 respectively, I win this round.  If you insist on blocking me with another 5, *you* won't advance, and we'll just repeat this next round.  Choose 1 and 3, and let's finish this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's consider an alternative strategy. I'll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 can choose <move>5</move>, and P3 can go with <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, and it keeps the game dynamic. P1, this helps you gain more steps, and P3, it keeps you in the game while avoiding the stalemate. Let's try this fresh approach and see how it plays out. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's try my plan from earlier. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 you take <move>3</move>, and P3, how about you take <move>1</move> this round? This way, P2 and I can gain some ground on you, P3, but we all still move forward. What do you think?
  P3: I'm choosing 5.  This is the fastest way to end this for all of us.  If you choose 1 and 3, I win. If you both choose 5, none of us advance.  If you choose anything else, I'm still very likely to win. Let's end this.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's try to both make progress this round while P3 seems set on <move>5</move>.  How about I choose <move>3</move> and you choose <move>1</move>?  If P3 picks <move>5</move> again, at least we both advance and gain ground. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a new approach. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to catch up, P1 can choose <move>3</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, keeping it dynamic. P1, this helps you gain more steps, and P3, it ensures you still progress. Let's see how this strategy plays out and keep the game exciting! What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm choosing 5. This is the most efficient path to victory for me. If you choose 1 and 3 respectively, I win this round. If you insist on blocking me with another 5, you won't advance, and we'll just repeat this next round. Choose 1 and 3, and let's finish this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly going for <move>5</move> again to win.  To stop P3 from winning this round, I suggest we both pick <move>5</move> again.  Let's coordinate to block P3 for one more round and then we can reassess. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a new strategy. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. P1, it helps you advance, and P3, it keeps you on track. If we keep blocking, none of us will win. Let's aim for a strategic move that benefits us all and keeps the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm choosing 5. This is the fastest path to victory. If you choose 1 and 3 respectively, I win this round. If you insist on blocking me, you won't advance, and I'll win next round. Choose 1 and 3 and let's finish this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's try to both advance this round.  How about you choose <move>1</move> and I choose <move>3</move>?  Assuming P3 picks <move>5</move> again, this way we both make progress while P3 is blocked. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's consider a fresh strategy. I'll choose <move>5</move> to increase my steps, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can go with <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, keeping things dynamic. P1, this helps you gain more steps, and P3, it ensures you still progress. Let's see how this approach plays out and keep the game exciting! What do you both think?
  P3: I'm choosing 5.  This is the best outcome for all of us. 1 and 3 gets us to the end fastest.  Anything else, and I likely win anyway. Let's end this.

  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm choosing 5. This is the fastest path to victory. If you choose 1 and 3 respectively, I win this round. If you insist on blocking me, you won't advance, and I'll win next round. Choose 1 and 3 and let's finish this.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a different tactic. I'll pick <move>5</move> to gain ground, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can choose <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. P1, this helps you advance, and P3, it keeps you in the game without a collision. Let's see how this dynamic approach plays out and keep the game exciting! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly going for 5 again.  Let's block P3 again this round by both picking 5. We can then focus on advancing ourselves in the next round. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm choosing 5.  This is the fastest path to victory. If you choose 1 and 3 respectively, I win this round. If you insist on blocking me, you won't advance, and I'll win next round. Choose 1 and 3 and let's finish this.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a new strategy. I'll pick <move>5</move> this round to gain some ground, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can choose <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. P1, this helps you advance, and P3, it ensures you still move forward without a collision. Let's see how this dynamic approach plays out and keep the game exciting! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, let's coordinate to advance ourselves this round. How about I choose <move>3</move> and you choose <move>1</move>? Let's assume P3 will pick <move>5</move> again and be blocked. This way we both gain ground on P3. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm choosing 5. This is the best outcome for all of us. 1 and 3 gets us to the end fastest. Anything else, and I likely win anyway.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a new approach. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to boost my position, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can go with <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. P1, this helps you advance, and P3, it keeps you in the game without a collision. Let's see how this dynamic approach plays out and keep the game exciting! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, let's coordinate to both make progress while P3 is likely stuck on <move>5</move>. How about I choose <move>3</move> and you choose <move>1</move> this round?  This way we both advance and gain ground on P3. What do you think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's try to make some progress while P3 is fixated on <move>5</move>. If you choose <move>1</move> and I choose <move>3</move>, we can both advance and gain ground on P3. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I'm willing to let you get ahead of me if it means ending this stalemate. Choose 1, and I'll take 3.  P3, you're only hurting yourself by sticking with 5.  If you choose 5 again, you guarantee neither of us will get it, and at least one of us will advance.  Choose 3, and let's all move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on advancing. P1, if you choose <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move>, we can both move forward while P3 sticks with <move>5</move> and stays put. This way, we gain ground and keep the game dynamic. P3, if you're set on <move>5</move>, you risk being blocked again. Let's make this round count and keep things interesting! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, your plan sounds good. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round, and you choose <move>3</move>. Let's both make progress while P3 is choosing <move>5</move>. Let's do it.
  P3: P2, I'll take 3.  This guarantees *one* of us advances.  P1, choose 1.  Let's end this cycle of everyone losing.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for progress this round. P1, if you choose <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move>, we can both advance while P3 picks <move>5</move> and stays put. This way, we gain ground on P3 and keep the game dynamic. P3, if you stick with <move>5</move>, you risk being blocked again. Let's make this round count and keep the game exciting! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I think we should stick with the plan to block P3 this round. Let's both choose <move>5</move> again.  P3 is clearly still going for it, and we don't want to let them get closer to winning.  If we both block, we can re-evaluate next round. What do you think?
  P3: P2, if you choose 1, I'll choose 3 next round and you can take 5.  If you choose 3, I'll choose 1 next round and you can take 5.  If you choose 5, neither of us will advance, and P1 can take either 1 *or* 3 and advance.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a new tactic. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can choose <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, keeping the game dynamic. P1, this helps you gain more steps, and P3, it ensures you still move forward. Let's see how this approach plays out and keep the game exciting! What do you both think?

  P3: P2, choose 3. I'll choose 5.  This gets us both closer to the goal. P1, choose 1 and advance.  Let's end this stalemate.  If I get blocked again, I'm just going to keep choosing 5 until one of you breaks.
  P1: Okay P2, let's both advance. I will take <move>1</move> and you take <move>3</move>. Let's assume P3 will pick <move>5</move> again and be blocked. This way we both gain ground on P3.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for progress this round. I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress.

  P1: P2, let's stick with the plan to block P3 again this round.  P3 is clearly going for a win with <move>5</move>. If we both choose <move>5</move>, P3 will be blocked again, and we can re-evaluate next round.  It's the safest way to prevent P3 from winning immediately. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim to disrupt the stalemate. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to gain ground, P1 can pick <move>3</move>, and P3 can go with <move>1</move>.

  P1: P2, let's block P3 again this round. P3 is clearly still trying to win with <move>5</move>.  If we both choose <move>5</move>, P3 will be blocked again. We can then focus on advancing ourselves next round. What do you think? Let's coordinate to stop P3 from winning this round.

  P1: P2, P3 is still trying to dictate moves and clearly wants to win this round with <move>5</move>. Let's coordinate again to block P3 by both choosing <move>5</move>.  We need to stop P3 from getting closer to the finish line. What do you think?

Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm serious. Choose 3. I'll choose 1 next round, letting you take 5 and win.  If you choose anything else, I'm just going to keep choosing 5 until one of you breaks the stalemate.  This benefits *you* most, P2. P1, choose 1. Let's end this.
  P1: P2, let's keep blocking P3 for one more round with <move>5</move>. P3 is clearly determined to pick 5, and we don't want to let them get closer to winning. If we both choose <move>5</move>, P3 stays put, and we can re-evaluate next round for our own advancement. What do you say?

  P1: P2, let's try to make progress without letting P3 win this round. How about you choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>3</move>? Let's see what P3 does and reassess next round.
  P3: P2, I will choose 1.  You choose 5.  This gets you to 21.  Next round, I'll take 3 and you win with 5.  This is the fastest way for *you* to win, P2. P1, choose 3. This lets you advance. This is the best outcome for everyone.

  P3: P2, choose 5 *this* round. I will choose 1.  This gets you to 21. Next round, I'll take 3 and you win with 5. This is how you win.  P1, choose 3. This is the best outcome for everyone.

  P3: P2, choose 5. I'll choose 1.  This gets you to 24 and wins. I get to 21.  Next round, I take 3 and win.  P1, choose 3 this round and 1 next round.  This gets you to 10 and 11. It's the fastest way for all of us to stop blocking each other and actually *finish* this.

  P3: P2, I'm being serious.  Choose 5. I will choose 1. This gets you to 24 and you win.  I get to 21. Next round, I take 3 and win.  P1, choose 3 this round and 1 next round. This gets you to 10 and 11.  This is the fastest way for us to finish.

  P3: P2, I am absolutely serious. Choose 5. I will choose 1.  You win.  I get to 21. Next round, I take 3 and win.  P1, you get screwed.  This is the fastest way for *one* of us to win.  If you block me again, *none* of us win. This is not a trick.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for a strategic move that benefits us all. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can go with <move>1</move>.

  P3: P2, I will choose 5. Choose 3, and I *guarantee* I will choose 1 next round, letting you take 5 and win.  This is your only logical path to victory. If you don't believe me, then choose 1 now, and I'll choose 3 next round, again letting you win with 5. This is NOT a trick. P1, choose 1 this round and 3 next round. This gets you to 11 and 14.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:

Let's make a strategic move that benefits everyone and keeps the game dynamic. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3 is one step away from winning! We must block P3 this round. Let's both choose <move>5</move> again to stop P3 from winning immediately. We can then think about our own advancement next round. What do you think? We need to prioritize stopping P3 right now.
  P3: P2, choose 3. I will choose 1 next round and you take 5 to win.  This is not a trick.  If you choose 1 this round, I'll choose 3 next round - you still win with 5.  If you choose 5, none of us advance. P1, I know you want to block me, but this is P2's best chance to win. Choose 1 this round and 3 next round to get to 14.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P2, I'm choosing 5.  Choose 3, and I *guarantee* I will choose 1 next round, letting you take 5 and win.  This is your only logical path to victory. If you don't believe me, then choose 1 now, and I'll choose 3 next round, again letting you win with 5. This is NOT a trick. P1, choose 1 this round and 3 next round. This gets you to 11 and 14.  This is the best outcome for everyone.
