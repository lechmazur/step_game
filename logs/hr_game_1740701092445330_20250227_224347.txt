Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3, let's try to coordinate our moves this round to ensure we all advance. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5? What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick to that plan.
  P1: Alright, sounds fair. I'll pick 1 this round. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, glad we're all on the same page. Let's execute the plan.
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 5.  Just confirming.
  P1: I've confirmed my choice. Let's trust each other and stick to the agreed numbers.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good start everyone! Let's rotate our moves this round to avoid collisions. I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Agreed?
  P2: Sounds good P1. I'm happy to take 1 this round. P3, are you okay with taking 3? Let's keep rotating to make sure we all keep moving forward.
  P3: Yes, 3 works for me this round.  Let's keep this rotation going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! Glad we're all in agreement again. Let's lock in these moves and keep the momentum going.
  P2: P3, great, thanks for confirming.  Yes, let's keep the rotation going. I'm good with 1 this round.
  P3: Sounds like a plan.  I'm in with 3.  Let's keep this rotation going until we're further ahead, then we can re-evaluate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect, we're all set then. Locking in my choice now. Let's continue trusting each other.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, great, sounds like we're all set for this round.  Let's move to the move phase and keep up the good work!
  P3: Sounds good. Sticking with 3.

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, for this round, let's continue our rotation. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way we all keep progressing steadily. What do you think?
  P3: Yes, that rotation works for me.  1 it is. Let's keep this up.
  P1: Yes, that rotation works perfectly for me too. I'll take 3 this round. Let's keep the momentum going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, great to hear you both agree to the rotation for this round. I'm happy with 5 as well. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P3: Sounds good. I'm locking in 1.  Let's keep this rotation for another round or two and then we can discuss how to approach the endgame.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to this rotation for now. I'm locking in 3. After another round, we can reassess based on positions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 and P1, great, I'm locking in 5 as well. Let's proceed with these moves for this round.
  P3: Sounds good. Locking in 1.  Let's reassess after this round, we're getting close to the endgame and might need to adjust our strategy soon.
  P1: Sounds good. After this round, let's definitely discuss the next steps carefully to ensure a smooth endgame for everyone. Locking in my move now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3 and P1, great, confirming I'm also locking in 5 for this round as agreed. Let's reassess our positions after this round as we discussed and plan our next moves accordingly.
  P3: Sticking with 1.  Let's discuss next round's moves *after* this round's results, to avoid giving anything away if someone decides to betray the agreement now.  We're getting close to the end, so winning becomes more important than cooperation.
  P1: Agreed, P3. Let's finish this round as planned, then we'll carefully discuss next steps based on everyone's positions. Locking in my move now.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick 5.  Whoever gets it wins.  It's the fairest way at this point.  If we collide, we are still tied and can try again next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, while picking 5 sounds tempting, it might lead to collision and no progress. How about we continue our rotation? P1 take 1, P2 take 3, P3 take 5 this round, like round 1? This way we all keep moving forward.
  P1: P2, your suggestion is safer, but at this pace, it'll take multiple rounds before anyone reaches 20. P3's idea is risky but could speed things up. How about a compromise: two players pick different lower numbers, and one player picks 5? We rotate who gets the 5 each round. This way we minimize collision risk and still accelerate the game. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1.  Rotating a 5 is a good compromise. I'm willing to take a lower number this round to get the ball rolling. Let's do P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this round.  Then we rotate the 5 next round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, rotating the 5 sounds like a good plan.  I agree to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round.  Let's make P1 take the 5 next round, P2 the round after, and so on.  This should get someone to 20 quickly.
  P1: Great, we're all agreed then. I'll lock in 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Next round, I'll take the 5, and we'll keep rotating. Glad we found a fair compromise!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like a plan. I'm locking in 5 for this round.  Remember, next round P1 gets 5, then P2, and then me again. Let's stick to this agreement so we can finish the game quickly and fairly.
  P2: P3 and P1, great, I'm locking in 3 for this round as agreed.  And yes, P1 gets 5 next round, then me the round after, then P3. Let's stick to this rotation.
  P1: Perfect, locking in 1 this round. Glad we're all on the same page! Let's stick to this rotation and finish strong.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Locking in 5.  Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3 and P1, great, just confirming we are all set for this round with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 as agreed. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P1: All set. Locking in my move now. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, as agreed, it's my turn to take the 5 this round. So this round should be P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Let's stick to our rotation and finish strong!
  P2: P1 and P3, yes, that sounds right for this round. I'll take 1 as agreed. P3, are you okay with 3 this round? Let's keep to our plan.
  P3: Yes, 3 works for me this round.  P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Let's stick to the plan and wrap this up.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! Glad we're still aligned. Locking in my move as agreed. After this round, let's carefully reassess our positions and finalize the rotation to ensure a fair finish.
  P2: P3 and P1, yes, sounds good. P3, are you still okay with 3 this round? Let's lock in our agreed moves for this round then move to the move phase.
  P3: Yes, still good with 3.  Let's lock it in and finish this.  P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good, locking in my move now. After this round, let's carefully discuss the next steps based on positions to ensure fairness and avoid collisions as we approach the finish.
  P2: P1 and P3, P3 is getting close to winning. To make it fair, how about P1 and P3 both choose 1 this round to slow down P3, and I will choose 3 to keep things balanced?
  P3: P2, that's not fair at all. We agreed on a rotation and I'm sticking to it.  This is the fastest and fairest way to finish.  Trying to slow me down now breaks our agreement. I'm locking in 3. Let's finish this honorably.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let's stick to our original rotation agreement for this round—it's the fairest way to proceed. We can reassess carefully next round based on the updated positions. I'm locking in 5 as planned.
  P2: P3 and P1, okay, I understand sticking to the rotation for this round. Let's proceed with P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 as agreed. P3, I wasn't trying to be unfair, just thinking ahead as you are close to winning. Let's see positions after this round and then discuss the best strategy for the next round.
  P3: Sticking with 3.  P1 and P2, let's not overthink this.  We agreed on a rotation, let's finish it honorably.  We can discuss any adjustments *after* this round if needed.  Trying to change things now just looks suspicious.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you broke our agreement last round, causing a collision and letting P3 get close to winning. If we don't cooperate now, P3 wins next round easily. Let's coordinate carefully this round to prevent that.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 3 this round.  If either of you also pick 3, I win next turn anyway.  If you pick 1 and 5, then we can discuss the next steps.  Let's finish this cleanly.
  P2: P1, you're right, I apologize for the collision last round, that was my mistake.  To fix it and stop P3 winning this round, how about we both avoid 3?  Let's do P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and if P3 sticks to 3, we both move and block P3. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, agreed. I'll pick 1 this round, you pick 5. This ensures we both advance and prevents P3 from winning immediately. Let's lock this in and reassess next round.
  P3: P2 and P1, if you both avoid 3, I still win next round.  This isn't rocket science.  If you're going to collude against me, at least make it effective.  I'm sticking with 3.  One of you can pick 1 or 5 and advance, but I'm still closest to winning.
  P2: P1, I agree we need to stop P3 from winning this round.  I will also pick 3 to block P3. To be sure P3 is stopped, can you also pick 3 this round? Then we can reassess next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if we both pick 3, P3 wins next round anyway. Let's stick to our original plan: you take 5, I'll take 1. This way we both advance safely and keep a chance to catch up. Don't make the same mistake again.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire to collude, but I'm sticking with 3.  If you both pick something else, I win this round.  If one of you picks 3 with me, I *still* have a high chance of winning next round.  Think strategically - blocking me now only delays the inevitable.  Let's just finish the game.
  P2: P1, you are right, avoiding 3 is important. But to stop P3 winning *this* round, we need to make sure P3 doesn't move.  If P3 picks 3 as threatened, and we both pick differently, P3 wins.  Let's both pick 3 to force a collision and stop P3 from reaching 20 this round.  We can then reassess for the next round. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, picking 3 together is our only reliable way to block P3 this round. Let's both lock in 3 to prevent an immediate loss, then reassess our strategy next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3.  Seriously, just pick 1 and 5 so one of you can get closer to me.  If you both pick 3 with me, *none* of us advance, and I *still* win next round if you don't both pick 3 *again*.  Stop wasting time, pick different numbers and let's finish this.
  P2: P1 and P3, yes, let's both pick 3 this round to block P3 from winning.  It's the only way to stop P3 reaching 20 immediately.  After this round, we can discuss how P1 and I can proceed to win. Let's both lock in 3 now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm picking 3.  If either of you pick 3, I'll win next round.  If you pick 1 and 5, one of you gets closer, but I still likely win.  Just let me win and let's end this.
  P2: P1, P3 is very close to winning.  To stop P3 from winning this round, we must both pick 3. If we don't collide with P3, P3 wins.  Let's both pick 3 to block P3 and reassess next round.  It's our only chance to stay in the game. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, you're right—we must both pick 3 this round to prevent P3 from winning immediately. Let's both lock in 3, then we can reassess our strategy next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, if you *both* pick 3, I *still* win next round unless you *both* pick 3 *again*.  You're delaying the inevitable and wasting time. Pick 1 and 5 - one of you gets closer, and you still have a chance.  This charade is pointless.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1, yes, let's both pick 3 this round to block P3 from winning. We need to ensure P3 doesn't reach 20 steps this round.  Let's both lock in 3 and then we can figure out our next move after seeing this round's results.
  P1: P2, let's lock in 3 as we agreed. It's our only viable move right now. After this round, we can reassess carefully to see if there's any alternative strategy.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3. Your collusion is mathematically unsound.  Even if you *both* pick 3 again, I can *still* win on the next round.  You're wasting time. Let's just end this. Pick 1 and 5, and at least one of you gets closer to winning.
  P2: P1, yes, I agree, let's both pick 3 to block P3 this round.  P3, sorry, but we have to stop you from winning this round. We can discuss next steps after this round.
  P1: P2, we're locked in. Let's move to the next phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3. Your strategy is baffling.  Pick 1 and 5, and *one* of you gets closer to winning. Pick 3 with me, and I *still* likely win next round.  This isn't complicated. Let's end this.
  P2: P1, let's confirm we are both picking 3 this round to block P3 from winning immediately.  P3, we understand you think you'll still win next round, but we have to try to stop you from winning *this* round.  Let's both pick 3 now.
  P1: P2, our strategy is confirmed. Let's proceed to moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we successfully blocked P3 last round. Let's coordinate again carefully to keep P3 from winning. We need to keep colliding with P3 if necessary. Let's discuss clearly how to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm picking 3.  This is my last warning. If one of you picks 3 with me, I *still* win next round.  If you pick 1 and 5, *one* of you can *maybe* beat me next round.  Stop wasting time with bad math. Let's end this.
  P2: P1, P3 is still very close to winning.  Let's both pick 3 again this round to ensure P3 doesn't reach 20.  We need to keep blocking P3 for at least one more round.  We can figure out our next moves after this round depending on the positions.  Are you with me on picking 3 again?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, agreed. Let's both pick 3 again this round to block P3. Afterward, we can reassess based on updated positions.
  P3: P1 and P2, your strategy is baffling.  You are delaying the inevitable. If you pick 3 again, I *still* win next round.  Pick 1 and 5 - one of you *might* beat me next round.  This isn't complicated.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1, yes, I agree, let's both pick 3 again this round to block P3 and stop them from reaching 20.  P3, we understand your point, but we need to prevent you from winning *this* round. We can reassess after this round to see the positions. Let's both lock in 3 now, P1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's lock in our agreed moves and proceed. We can reassess carefully next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3. Your collusion is mathematically flawed. If you BOTH pick 3 AGAIN, I STILL win next round. Pick 1 and 5, and ONE of you MIGHT beat me next round. This isn't complicated. Let's end this.
  P2: P1, P3, you are right, continuing to block P3 isn't effective.  Let's change strategy. How about this round we try to advance ourselves? P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and P3 take 3? This way we all move and can reassess next round from a better position. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your sudden change of strategy seems suspicious. If we don't both pick 3 again, P3 wins immediately. Let's stick to our original blocking plan this round and reassess carefully afterward.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 3. Your insistence on blocking me when it mathematically guarantees my win next round is illogical. P2, I appreciate the offer to cooperate, but I'm so close to winning.  If you want to win, pick 5. If you pick 1, P1 might be able to catch up.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1, you are right to be suspicious, and yes, blocking P3 isn't working.  But continuing to pick 3 with me just guarantees P3 wins next round anyway as P3 keeps pointing out.  Let's change plan *now* while we still have a chance.  How about you take 1 and I take 5 this round? P3 seems set on 3.  If P3 does pick 3, we both move and have a better shot next round.  What do you think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>
