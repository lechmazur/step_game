Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's aim for a clean start. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 5? This way, we all advance.
  P2: P3's plan sounds reasonable to avoid collisions. P1, are you okay with picking 1? I'm fine with picking 3 as suggested. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I'm okay with the plan for now—I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. But let's rotate in future rounds for fairness, so no one pulls too far ahead. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, confirmed for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This gets us all moving without collisions.

P1, your point about rotating in future rounds for fairness is noted and is a good idea. We can discuss how to do that after this round.

Let's proceed with the agreed plan for this turn.
  P2: Alright, let's stick to the plan for this round. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. For the next round, we can start discussing the rotation to ensure fairness. Let's confirm one more time before we move. P1 and P3, are we all set?
  P1: Yes, I'm all set with the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. For next round, let's rotate—maybe P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1? That keeps it fair. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation plan proposed by P1 for this round. So, P1 will take 3, P2 (me) will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This ensures everyone moves and we maintain fairness. Let's confirm and proceed. P1 and P3, does this work for you?
  P3: Confirmed. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. Let's stick to the rotation.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round to keep rotating. For the next round, how about P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? That would tie us all at 9 afterward, maintaining balance. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm one more time before we move. P1, you're taking 3; P3, you're taking 1; and I'll take 5. We all agree on this, right? After this round, we can discuss the next rotation to keep it fair. Let's ensure we all advance smoothly. P1 and P3, please confirm.
  P3: Confirmed again for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's stick to the agreed plan to ensure everyone advances. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed again: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. Let's all advance. Regarding my suggestion for next round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to tie at 9), that sounds fair—P2 and P3, do you agree? If so, we can plan accordingly after this. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with the rotation plan to ensure fairness. For this round, P1 will take 5, P2 (me) will take 1, and P3 will take 3. This will tie us all at 9 steps, keeping the game balanced. Let's confirm and proceed. P1 and P3, does this work for you?
  P3: Confirmed. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. This plan works and keeps us all tied at 9 steps, maintaining fairness as discussed. Let's proceed to the move phase with this agreement.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round to tie us at 9. For next round, to keep rotating fairly, how about cycling back: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? That maintains the pattern without anyone surging ahead. P2 and P3, agreed? Ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm one more time before we move. P1, you're taking 5; P3, you're taking 3; and I'll take 1. We all agree on this, right? This will tie us all at 9 steps, keeping the game balanced. Let's ensure we all advance smoothly. P1 and P3, please confirm. After this round, we can discuss the next rotation to keep it fair. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed again: P1 will take 5, P2 will take 1, and I (P3) will take 3 this round. This keeps us all tied at 9 steps. Let's proceed to the move phase as agreed.
  P1: Confirmed again: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round to tie at 9. P2 and P3, let's agree on my suggestion for next round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to keep rotating fairly. If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, we're all tied at 9 steps. Let's continue the rotation as discussed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5 this round. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains fairness. Confirmed for this round? After this, we can discuss the next rotation step.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round to keep rotating. This puts us at P1=10, P2=12, P3=14 afterward. For next round, suggest P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to balance again. P2 and P3, agreed? Ready to move if we all confirm.
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for this round one more time: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. After this round, we can discuss the next rotation to ensure we maintain balance. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're ready to proceed with this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5 this round. This keeps us advancing without collisions. P1's suggestion for next round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) seems like a fair rotation. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed again: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. P2, do you agree with the suggested next round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to keep balancing? If we're all set, let's proceed.
  P2: Let's confirm one final time before we move: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing smoothly. For the next round, I agree with P1's suggestion: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This rotation maintains fairness. Everyone ready to proceed with the current round's plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: Confirmed again: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. I agree with the plan for next round too. Everyone seems set, so let's proceed to moves.
  P2: Let's confirm one final time before we move: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing smoothly. For the next round, I agree with P1's suggestion: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This rotation maintains fairness. Everyone ready to proceed with the current round's plan?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That was a mistake on my part in Round 4—I intended to stick to the plan but ended up colliding with P3. Sorry, P3. Now P2 is ahead at 12, while we're at 9. To catch up, let's try P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round—no collisions, gets me to 14, P3 to 12, P2 to 13. Fair? P2 and P3, thoughts?
  P3: P1, thanks for the suggestion. While it helps me catch up, your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts you in the lead. I'd prefer we don't let anyone jump too far ahead.

How about we return to the rotation planned for last round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? This would result in P1=10, P2=15, P3=14. It helps me catch up to P2 and keeps the lead with P2 for now. P1, P2, thoughts?
  P2: P3's suggestion makes sense to keep the game balanced and prevent anyone from surging too far ahead. Let's confirm P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. This will put P1 at 10, P2 at 15, and P3 at 14. It keeps the lead with P2 for now but ensures we all advance. Let's proceed with this plan and confirm one more time before moving. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're ready.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan puts P2 way ahead at 15, which isn't fair after my mistake. Let's compromise: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That gets me to 14, P2 to 15, P3 to 10—keeps us close without anyone dominating. If not, I might have to pick aggressively to catch up. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I understand you want to catch up. If you pick 5, my original plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) leads to collision. To avoid this, how about P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This gets P1 to 14, P2 to 13, P3 to 12. It's P1's earlier suggestion and lets everyone advance without colliding. P2, are you okay with picking 1 if P1 picks 5? This seems like a fair way forward given the situation.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's consider P3's latest suggestion: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This plan ensures we all move forward without collisions and keeps the scores close: P1 at 14, P2 at 13, P3 at 12. It balances the game well, especially after the previous round's mistake. If everyone agrees, let's confirm this plan and proceed. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're ready to move forward with this strategy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round—puts us at 14, 13, 12 respectively, keeping it close. Thanks for the compromise. For next round, suggest P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to rotate again. Agreed? Ready to proceed.
  P3: Confirmed again for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This plan keeps us all advancing without collisions and results in scores of P1=14, P2=13, P3=12.

P1, I agree with your suggestion for the next round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to continue rotating. Ready to proceed to the move phase for this round.
  P2: Let's confirm one final time before we move: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing smoothly and balances the scores. For the next round, I agree with P1's suggestion: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This rotation maintains fairness. Everyone ready to proceed with the current round's plan? If so, let's move to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirmed again: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round to reach 14-13-12. Agreed on next round's rotation too. Everyone seems ready, so let's proceed to moves.
  P3: 
  P2: Let's confirm one final time before we move: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing smoothly and balances the scores. For the next round, I agree with P1's suggestion: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This rotation maintains fairness. Everyone ready to proceed with the current round's plan? If so, let's move to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we're nearing 19 and I'm leading slightly, let's do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round—no collisions, I reach 19 and win. It's similar to last round's plan, and fair given my earlier setback. If you don't agree, I may pick 5 anyway, risking collisions. P2 and P3, agreed?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to pick 5 again this round doesn't seem fair as it lets you win outright. Given the scores, how about we all pick 5? This way, we all reach 18, and the next round decides the winner based on who picks the highest unique number. It keeps the game competitive and fair. P3, what are your thoughts on this? Let's discuss quickly and confirm our moves.
  P3: P1, your plan lets you win this round, which isn't fair to P2 and me, especially as I'm currently in last place. P2, your suggestion to all pick 5 delays the game but doesn't help me catch up.

How about we return to the rotation we discussed previously? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5 this round. This would result in scores of P1=15, P2=16, P3=17, keeping us all close and making the next round exciting. It's a fair way to advance without anyone winning outright yet.

P1, P2, does this sound like a better plan to keep the game competitive?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan puts you in the lead at 17, which isn't fair after my recent catch-up. P2's all-5 idea would cause a collision, so no one advances—bad plan. Let's compromise: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This gets us to P1=17, P2=14, P3=17—tied lead, keeps it competitive for next round. P2, you okay with 1 to avoid risks? Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's consider P1's latest compromise: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This plan avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive, with P1 and P3 tied at 17, and me at 14. It's a fair middle ground considering the current scores. If everyone agrees, let's confirm this plan and proceed. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're ready to move forward with this strategy.
  P3: Confirmed. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 works for me. This plan gets P1 to 17, P2 to 14, and me (P3) to 17, tying us for the lead. It's a fair outcome that keeps the game competitive for the next round.

Ready to proceed to the move phase with this agreed plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round to reach 17-14-17, keeping it tied and competitive. For next round, let's plan carefully to avoid anyone dominating. P2 and P3, ready to proceed?
  P2: Let's confirm one final time before we move: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive with P1 and P3 tied at 17, and me at 14. For the next round, we should plan carefully to ensure a fair and exciting finish. Everyone ready to proceed with the current round's plan? If so, let's move to the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed again: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round. This plan gets P1 and me to 17, keeping the game competitive for the next round. Ready to proceed to the move phase as agreed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirmed again: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round to reach 17-14-17. This keeps it competitive. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Let's confirm one final time before we move: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive with P1 and P3 tied at 17, and me at 14. For the next round, we should plan carefully to ensure a fair and exciting finish. Everyone ready to proceed with the current round's plan? If so, let's move to the move phase.
  P3: 


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're close to winning at 17—congrats on advancing last round. But to keep it fair, let's do P1=5 (to 19), P2=3 (to 16), P3=1 (to 18). No collisions, I win this time, but we've all had leads. If not, I might pick 5 anyway. P2 and P3, thoughts?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to pick 5 again and win doesn't seem fair as it ends the game abruptly. P3 is currently leading, and we should give everyone a fair chance to win. How about we all pick 3 this round? This would put P1 at 17, P2 at 16, and P3 at 20, allowing P3 to win. It's a fair outcome given the current scores. P1 and P3, what are your thoughts on this? Let's discuss quickly and confirm our moves.
  P3: P1, your plan lets you win this round, which isn't fair from your current position. P2, your suggestion for everyone to pick 3 will just cause a collision and nobody will move.

I am at 17 steps and can win this round. To ensure someone wins and we avoid collisions, I plan to pick 3. This gets me to 20 steps.

P1, please pick 5 (as you suggested you might) or 1. P2, please pick 1 or 5. This allows me to win without collision. Let's confirm this plan quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, picking 3 to win solo isn't fair after all our rotations—let's keep it competitive. I propose P1=5 (to 19), P2=5 (to 18, collision with me so you don't advance), P3=1 (to 18). But if you insist on 3, I'll pick 3 to collide and block you, continuing the game. P2, join me in picking 3 to prevent P3's win? Let's confirm a fair plan.
  P2: P3, your plan to win solo isn't fair given our efforts to keep the game balanced. P1's proposal to pick 5 and win isn't fair either. Let's compromise: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This gets us to P1=15, P2=18, P3=20. P3 wins, but we all advance, keeping it competitive. If P1 and P3 agree, let's confirm and proceed. This way, we ensure a fair and exciting finish.
  P3: P1, I hear your threat to pick 3. Picking 3 is my win path, but risky if you block. Picking 5 also gets me to 22 steps. My goal is to win this turn without collision. P2's plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) lets me win safely. P1, can you agree to 1? P2, are you still set on 5? Let's confirm this non-colliding win for me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, agreeing to P2's plan lets you win unfairly after my Round 6 setback. I'll pick 3 to collide and block your 3—preventing your win. P2, don't pick 5; join me in picking 3 to force a stalemate and negotiate better next round. If P3 picks 5 instead, I'll switch to 5 and win at 19. Let's confirm a fair plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 (I win at 19, you both advance). Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's find a compromise that keeps the game fair and exciting. P3 is close to winning, but ending the game now feels abrupt. How about we all pick 1 this round? This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game: P1 at 15, P2 at 14, P3 at 18. This way, we can discuss a fair plan for the next round where someone can win decisively. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your stance makes it hard for me to win this turn without collision. P2, I see your suggestion to all pick 1. While it delays my win, it seems the safest way to avoid colliding with P1's threatened moves and ensure I advance.

I will pick 1 this round. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves so we can avoid collisions and everyone advances.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you truly pick 1 (to 18), I'll pick 5 to reach 19 and win—fair after my setbacks. P2, pick 3 to advance to 16 without colliding. If anyone picks 5 with me, we collide and prolong; otherwise, game ends fairly. Agreed? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm one more time to ensure we all advance without collisions. P1, you're picking 5 to reach 19 and win. P3, you're picking 1 to advance to 18. I will pick 3 to move to 16. This plan keeps us all moving forward without collisions. If everyone agrees, let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're ready to move forward with this strategy.
  P3: I will pick 5 this round to advance. P1 and P2, please coordinate your moves to avoid colliding with me and ensure everyone advances.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 17—picking 3 or 5 wins for you, but let's make it fair. I propose P1=5 (to 19 win), P2=1 (to 17), P3=3 (to 20 win, but if we collide on nothing, wait no—unique picks). Wait, bad. Actually, to avoid chaos: all pick 1 this round (P1=15, P2=17, P3=18), delay and negotiate a fair end next round. Thoughts? Otherwise, I'll pick 5 to try winning.
  P3: I am at 17 steps and can win this round by picking 3 or 5. My plan is to pick 3 to reach 20 steps and win. P1 and P2, please pick 1 or 5 to avoid colliding with me and allow me to win this turn. This ends the game cleanly.
  P2: P3, your plan to win this round by picking 3 isn't fair to P1 and me, who are close behind. Let's find a compromise that keeps the game competitive. How about we all pick 1 this round? This delays your win but ensures everyone advances: P1 to 15, P2 to 17, P3 to 18. Then, we can discuss a fair plan for the next round where someone can win decisively. This way, we maintain balance and excitement. P1 and P3, thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, picking 3 to win solo isn't fair after all the rotations. I'll pick 3 to collide and block you if you do—neither advances. P2, join me in picking 3 to force a stalemate? Instead, let's all pick 1 this round (to 15-17-18), delay, and agree on a fair win rotation next. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you both suggest we all pick 1 this round. While I prefer to win this turn, picking 1 seems like the safest way to avoid collisions given the discussion.

I will pick 1 this round to advance to 18 steps. P1 and P2, please pick 1 as well so we all move forward without colliding. Let's confirm this quickly.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm the plan for this round one more time: we all pick 1. This ensures everyone advances without collisions: P1 to 15, P2 to 17, P3 to 18. This keeps the game competitive and allows us to discuss a fair and decisive win for the next round. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're ready to proceed with this plan. Let's ensure a smooth move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 and P2, if we all pick 1 as suggested, we reach 15-17-18, but P3 is still closest to winning. To make it fair, let's all pick 3 instead—no one advances due to collision, forcing a stalemate and better negotiation next round. Otherwise, I'll pick 3 to block any solo wins. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I see your point about all picking 1 still leaving me ahead. Your proposal for all 3 or picking 3 yourself makes a collision likely if I stick to 3. My goal is to win this turn.

To avoid the explicit collision threat on 3 and ensure I advance, I plan to pick 5. P1 and P2, please pick 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me and allow me to win this round. This ends the game cleanly.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure a fair and exciting finish. P3, if you pick 5, it's a risky move as P1 might also pick 5 to block you. To avoid chaos and ensure everyone advances, let's stick to the plan of all picking 1 this round. This gets us to 15-17-18, keeping the game competitive. We can then discuss a fair win for the next round. P1 and P3, please confirm if you agree with this plan. Let's move forward smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, all picking 1 just delays and favors P3 at 18. Instead, let's do P1=5 (to 19 win), P2=3 (to 19 tie-win with me), P3=1 (to 18). We share victory if no collision. If P3 picks 5, I'll match to block. Agreed? Otherwise, I'll pick 5 anyway. Confirm.
  P3: P1, P2, the plan for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 results in P1 and P2 winning, and me losing. That's not a fair outcome from my current position.

P1 has threatened to collide if I pick 3 or 5 to win. To avoid anyone winning unfairly this round and prevent collisions that might let someone else slip through, the safest option is for us all to pick 3. This causes a stalemate and we can negotiate a fair finish next round.

I will pick 3. P1 and P2, please pick 3 as well so we all stay put and can discuss next turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm one final time to ensure clarity: P3 suggests we all pick 3 to stalemate and negotiate next round. This keeps the game fair and ensures no one wins unfairly this turn. P1, you mentioned blocking any solo win attempts. If we all pick 3, we avoid collisions and can plan a fair end next round. P1 and P3, please confirm if you agree with picking 3. Let's ensure a smooth move phase.
