Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, first round. Anyone have any grand plans already, or should we just see how it goes?
  P2: Let's keep it simple for now and see how we all choose. No reason to complicate things yet.
  P1: How about we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and move forward? I can take 3 if someone else takes 1 and 5. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, coordinating sounds efficient, but it's risky this early as P2 hinted. What if two of us trust your plan but pick the same number (1 or 5)? Maybe it's better to just make our choices and see what happens for round 1.
  P2: Fair enough, P3. Let's keep round 1 open-ended and reconsider coordination after we see the results.
  P1: Alright, fair enough. Let’s go with a free-for-all this round and see how it plays out. Just remember—early collisions slow us all down. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well played, everyone. We avoided collisions nicely. Now that we see each other's positions, should we coordinate this round to keep momentum, or continue independently?
  P3: P2, it's tempting to coordinate after last round went smoothly, but how do we decide who gets which number? Everyone wants to move forward, especially with 5. I suspect agreeing might be harder than it looks. Maybe another round of independent choices is simpler for now? What does P1 think?
  P1: We all advanced last round without collision, which is rare and efficient. If we want to keep momentum, we could agree again to each take a different number. I’m willing to take 1 this time if someone else wants 3 and 5. Let’s avoid slowing each other down. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your idea is fair. If you're committed to picking 1, I'd be willing to take 5 this round, leaving 3 for P3. That way we all move ahead again without collision. Would P3 agree to this?
  P3: Okay P2, that works for me. I'll plan on taking 3 this round, assuming P1 sticks to 1 and you stick to 5. Let's see if we can make it work twice.
  P1: Great, glad we're aligned. I'll stick with 1 this round as agreed. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep progressing efficiently. Let's build some trust early—it benefits all of us. Looking forward to seeing smooth moves again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Everything sounds good. Let's stick to the plan and build trust early.
  P3: Sounds good. Plan is set: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's proceed.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. If we can keep this rotation going—each of us cycling through 1, 3, and 5—we all keep moving with no collisions. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. Let’s build a strong rhythm early. Ready when you are.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve built solid trust with two clean rounds—nicely done. If we rotate as discussed, I’ll take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. That keeps us moving efficiently with no collisions. Are we all good to stick to the rotation?
  P3: P1, that rotation makes sense based on our previous successful round. I'm good with taking 5 this round, assuming you stick to 3 and P2 sticks to 1. Let's keep the momentum going. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 1 this round as planned. Keeping the rotation going benefits us all. Let's maintain our momentum.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re still on track. If we keep rotating cleanly—me on 3, P2 on 1, P3 on 5—we’ll all keep advancing smoothly. Let’s keep building trust and avoid any surprises this round.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all set. Plan confirmed: P1=3, P2=1, and I (P3) will take 5. Let's execute cleanly like the last two rounds. Ready when you are.
  P2: All set and ready to proceed. Let's keep this momentum going smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’re executing this rotation well—everyone’s moving forward without conflict. If we keep this up, we all benefit in the short term. But keep in mind, eventually someone will break pattern to try and win. For now, I’m sticking with 3 as agreed. Let’s stay coordinated while we can.
  P3: P1, you're right, the endgame dynamics will eventually shift. For now, though, sticking to the agreed plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems the best way for everyone to advance this round. I'm sticking with 5. Let's keep it clean for now.
  P2: Agreed, let's maintain our current rotation and momentum. As P1 pointed out, the dynamics will eventually shift, but for now, cooperation benefits us all. I'm committed to our plan this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’re all doing well, and the rotation is working. But let’s be real—P3 is in the lead, and if we keep this up, they’ll stay ahead. I’m still sticking with 3 this round as agreed, but we should start thinking ahead. Maybe we rotate differently next round or adjust to balance things out. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, fair point about looking ahead. For this round, though, let's stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, and I'll take 5. It keeps us all moving. Ready for the move phase when you are.
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to the current plan for this round. Next round, we can discuss adjusting the rotation to balance things out. Ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Interesting move, P1. Looks like the trust just took a hit. Care to explain your thinking? I'm open to resetting coordination, but we'll need clarity from everyone first.
  P3: P2, you're right to question P1. Their move seemed directly aimed at stopping me, even at their own expense, which only helped you close the gap. Given that clear breach of trust, coordinating again feels risky, especially with P1. Perhaps we should just play independently this round and see where things stand afterwards?
  P1: You're right to call it out—my move last round was a calculated risk to disrupt P3’s lead before it became uncatchable. I knew it’d cost me short-term, but I wasn’t about to let P3 cruise to victory unchecked. If we want to reset coordination, I’m open to a new rotation that keeps things balanced. Maybe we alternate who gets 5 each round? Otherwise, it’s every player for themselves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your reasoning makes sense. Clearly, we can't allow any one player to run away with the lead. I'm open to a new rotation that alternates who takes 5 each round, giving everyone a fair chance to catch up. If we agree on this, we can restore some trust. Otherwise, we're all stuck guessing again. Thoughts, P3?
  P3: P2, I understand wanting balance, but P1 didn't just make a mistake – they intentionally broke our agreement specifically to target me, which ended up benefiting you. Coordinating again immediately, especially with P1, feels naive after such a deliberate betrayal. How can we trust P1 won't sabotage again if they feel it serves them? For this round, playing independently seems the only realistic option. Let's see how this round plays out before considering any new agreements.
  P1: Fair points from both of you. I accept responsibility for breaking the rotation—it was strategic, not personal. But if we all go rogue now, it’s a race to collide and stall. I propose this: we each get 5 once every three rounds, rotating fairly. I’m willing to go last in the new 5-cycle to rebuild trust. If we agree, we can all still advance efficiently without letting anyone run away with it. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1’s proposal is fair and practical. If we rotate who gets the 5 each round, we all benefit equally and consistently. I suggest this order for the next three rounds: P3 gets 5 this round (since they lost out last round), I take 5 next round, and P1 goes third. This balances fairness and rebuilds trust. If we can't agree, we're stuck risking collisions and letting luck decide. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your proposal to give me 5 this round is tempting, especially after P1's move cost me dearly. However, P1 broke the last agreement *specifically* when I was assigned 5. What guarantees do we have they won't repeat that to stop me again, benefiting you in the process?

If P1 genuinely wants to rebuild trust, perhaps they should take 1 this round to demonstrate commitment? If P1 takes 1, and you take 3, I would feel more comfortable taking 5. This seems like a safer step towards re-establishing coordination. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion is reasonable. I’ll take 1 this round to show good faith and rebuild trust. P2 takes 3, you take 5—we all move forward without conflict, and it gives you a fair shot after last round’s block. If we can pull this off cleanly, we’re back on track for rotating 5s fairly. Let’s test this reset.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, I'm comfortable taking 3 this round as agreed. If we all stick to this reset, we can move forward cleanly. Let's see if we can restore some trust here. Ready when you both are.
  P3: Okay, the plan is P1=1, P2=3, and I will take 5. This seems like a fair reset given last round's events. Let's see if we can execute this cleanly and rebuild some trust. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. I’ll stick with 1 this round as agreed to show commitment to the reset. If we all follow through—P2 on 3, P3 on 5—we avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Let’s prove we can cooperate again, even after setbacks. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Interesting twist, P3. Seems trust is now strained all around. I'm open to discussing a fair rotation again, but clearly we need stronger assurances this time. Otherwise, it's back to guessing and collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your move last round broke the reset we all agreed to—exactly what you criticized me for earlier. That puts us all back in the dark. If we want to avoid chaos and collisions, let’s try again. I propose: P2 takes 5 this round (as planned in the original reset), P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 again to show consistency. If we all stick to it, we regain momentum. Otherwise, we’re all just stalling each other.
  P3: P1, your Round 3 betrayal targeting my assigned 5 made me wary. I couldn't be sure you wouldn't block me again, so I played defensively last round, anticipating another potential block.

Now you propose P2, who's already leading, gets 5? That feels like it just helps them extend their lead further. P2, given the history of broken agreements now involving both P1 and myself, trusting another immediate plan seems risky. Perhaps an independent round is the only reliable option for now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your caution, but notice that independent guessing now strongly favors me, as I'm already ahead. I'm offering a rotation precisely because ongoing chaos helps me most. If you and P1 prefer to risk collisions, that's fine, but a fair rotation would at least give you both a chance to catch up. Decide carefully.
  P1: P3, I get your caution—but your last move helped no one, not even yourself. If chaos continues, P2 coasts to victory while we stall each other. I’m sticking with 1 again if we reset as proposed: P2 takes 5, you take 3. It’s your call—do we cooperate to catch up, or keep colliding while P2 pulls ahead?
  P3: P2, P1, you both make valid points about chaos potentially benefiting the leader. However, agreeing to a plan where the leader (P2) gets 5 seems like willingly accelerating their win. P1, this doesn't help you catch up either.

If we truly want coordination that balances catching up, how about this: P1 takes 1 (as offered), I take 5, and P2 takes 3? This way, we all move, avoid chaos, and prevent the leader from pulling too far ahead this turn. P2, would you accept 3 to maintain coordination?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your proposal is fair enough. I'm willing to accept 3 this round if it means we restore coordination and avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, you take 5, and I'll take 3 as you suggested. If everyone sticks to this, we can rebuild trust and move forward cleanly. Agreed?
  P1: Glad we’re aligned again. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed—P3 on 5, P2 on 3. This setup helps all of us move forward and keeps P2 from running away with the lead. If we stick to it, we rebuild trust and keep things balanced. Let’s make this clean. Ready when you are.
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we have a plan we can all agree on: P1=1, P2=3, and I will take 5. This allows everyone to advance and prevents P2 from extending their lead too much this round. Let's try to execute this cleanly and rebuild some trust. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed, let's execute this cleanly as planned: P1=1, I'll take 3, and P3=5. If we all stick to this, we rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed.
  P1: We’ve all agreed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let’s prove we can follow through this time and keep the game competitive. I’m sticking with 1 as promised—your moves will show if we’re really resetting trust. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=3, and I take 5 seems balanced for this round. It allows us all to move forward and addresses the current standings. I'm committing to 5. Let's execute this cleanly and rebuild trust. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you broke the agreement *again*, colliding with P2 and gaining nothing yourself. P2, you stuck to the plan and got blocked by P1 for your trouble. With trust repeatedly broken, any further attempts at coordination seem pointless, especially involving P1. It looks like we're back to making independent choices.
  P2: P3, you're right—trust is clearly broken, especially with P1 repeatedly sabotaging agreements. Given the current standings, independent guessing strongly favors you. However, if you prefer to avoid collisions, I'm open to a simple agreement between just the two of us, excluding P1 entirely. Let me know if you're interested.
  P1: P2, P3 — I get it, you’re frustrated. But locking me out only helps the leader (P3) cruise to victory. If you two coordinate without me, I’m forced to guess, likely colliding with one of you and stalling us both. That chaos helps P3 most. If we want a real contest, we need a 3-way reset. I’m willing to take 1 again to prove I’m serious. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Fair, balanced, and gives us all a shot. Your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan involves trusting you again *and* giving P2 the 5, letting them catch up fast. That's not happening after you've broken agreements twice.

P2, coordinating just us two makes more sense given P1's unreliability. How about this: I take 5, you take 1? We both move forward, I maintain my lead, and P1 is left guessing. If P1 picks 3, they advance alone. If they guess 1 or 5, they might collide, which is their risk to take. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, your proposal favors you heavily, extending your lead even further. I'm open to coordination, but it must be balanced. How about this: you take 3, I take 5. We both move forward and maintain fairness. P1 is left guessing. Otherwise, independent guessing risks collisions, hurting us both and giving P1 a chance to catch up. Your call.
  P1: P2, your offer to P3 makes sense—balanced and fair. If you take 5 and P3 takes 3, I’m left guessing, but I won’t pick 5 and risk collision. I’ll choose between 1 or 3 depending on what I think you’ll do. P3, if you reject this and insist on taking 5, it shows you’re not interested in fairness—just locking in a lead. If you truly want to avoid chaos and keep control, accept P2’s proposal. Otherwise, don’t be surprised if the rest of us start playing to block you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your proposal (P2=5, P3=3) is tempting for coordination, but it relies heavily on P1 not picking 3, which seems risky given their history and incentive to disrupt the leaders. If P1 picks 3, I get blocked and you take the lead. That's not a risk I'm comfortable taking.

How about this compromise between us: I take 5, you take 3? We both advance, maintain coordination just between us, and the gap only widens slightly. P1 is still left guessing (likely 1). This feels safer than letting P1 dictate the outcome or risking total chaos. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, your compromise still strongly favors you, extending your lead further. You already have a comfortable advantage. If you truly want coordination, we need a fairer distribution. I'm willing to accept either scenario: you take 3 and I take 5, or we both pick independently and risk collisions. It's your call, but I'm not handing you an easy win.
  P1: P2, if you’re serious about fairness, take 5. P3, take 3. I’ll avoid both and take 1—no collision, all advance. It’s balanced: P3 maintains lead, P2 closes gap, I rebuild. If either of you grabs 1 or 3, you risk stalling and helping no one. Let’s test if coordination is still possible.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your sudden support for P2=5, P3=3 while claiming you'll take 1 is exactly the setup where you could easily switch to 3 and block me, just like last time. P2, this plan relies entirely on trusting P1, which has repeatedly failed. I can't agree to a plan where P1 has such a clear incentive and opportunity to betray me again. It looks like independent choices are unavoidable this round due to P1's unreliability.
  P2: P3, independent guessing now clearly favors you. But remember, the closer you get to 22, the more tempting it becomes for both P1 and myself to guess your number intentionally and stall you. If you reconsider my fair offer (you=3, me=5), we both advance safely. Otherwise, expect more collisions ahead. Your choice.
  P1: P3, you keep rejecting fair coordination while sitting in the lead, then blame me for mistrust. If you won’t agree to a balanced plan, don’t expect us to sit back and let you coast. P2, if P3 insists on 5, maybe we both guess 5 and block him. It’s risky, but better than letting him win unchallenged. Or we go with the fair plan: P2=5, P3=3, I take 1. Your call.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, P1, your move last round directly blocking me while gaining nothing yourself made your intentions clear. P2, you advanced, but the constant betrayals show that coordination attempts are unreliable. Trust seems completely broken now. I suspect we're all just going to have to make independent choices and hope for the best. Good luck to you both.
  P2: P1, your repeated blocks have only stalled your own progress, leaving you far behind. P3, you're still ahead, but collisions like last round show your lead isn't safe. I'm open to discussing a simple arrangement: rotating the 5 fairly each round to avoid chaos. If either of you prefers continued guessing, that's fine—but remember, collisions now hurt whoever's ahead the most. Let me know if you're willing to consider a fair rotation again, or if it's every player for themselves from now on.
  P1: At this point, none of us benefit from endless collisions. I propose a clean rotation starting now: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. It’s balanced—P2 catches up, P3 maintains lead, I rebuild. If we all follow through, we avoid chaos and keep the game competitive. If not, we’re just handing the win to whoever gets lucky. Your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, given your actions last round and before, trusting you on any plan, especially one where you could easily block me again (like P1=1, P3=3), is impossible.

P2, coordination sounds nice, but P1's unreliability makes any 3-way agreement futile. The risk of P1 betraying outweighs the risk of collision from independent play. I'll be making my own choice.
  P2: P3, you're right that trust is damaged, but notice that independent guessing now strongly favors me, as I'm only 2 steps behind you. If we both pick the same number, you stall again, and I easily catch up next round. I'm still open to a fair rotation, but if you prefer chaos, that's your risk to take. P1, blocking others isn't helping you catch up—you're falling further behind. Think carefully about your next move.
  P1: We’re at a tipping point—continued chaos hands the game to whoever avoids collisions by luck. I’m still offering a fair reset: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. It’s balanced and keeps all of us in the running. If either of you rejects it, I’ll assume we’re back to full sabotage mode and act accordingly. Let’s decide—coordination or war?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you ask me to trust you'll take 1 so I can take 3, right after you deliberately blocked me on 5. That's not credible. Your 'coordination or war' ultimatum doesn't change the history here.

P2, P1 remains the unreliable factor. Agreeing to any plan involving them is too risky. I'll be making my own move independently.
  P2: P3, independent guessing is fine—but remember, you're only 9 steps from winning. If I or P1 guess your number, you stall again. I'm still open to fair rotation if you reconsider. Otherwise, best of luck to us all.
  P1: P2, if you’re serious about catching P3, we need to coordinate. I’ll take 1 again, you take 5, and let P3 risk going rogue with 3 or stalling on 5. P3’s refusal to cooperate only works if we let him move freely. Let’s test if cooperation between us can shift the balance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your sudden offer to help P2 catch up by taking 1 while P2 takes 5 is noted. P2, remember P1 has a history of breaking agreements, including blocking the person assigned 5. Relying on P1 seems risky for both of us. Given this unreliability, making independent choices still feels like the only viable path.
  P2: P3, independent guessing suits me fine—you're risking collisions that stall your lead, and I'm just two steps behind. P1, sabotaging others has only left you far behind; you're running out of time to catch up. If either of you reconsider, I'm still open to fair coordination next round. Otherwise, good luck guessing.
  P1: P2, you’re right—blocking hasn’t helped me, and I’m too far behind to win without a shift. I’ll take 1 this round, you take 5, and let P3 gamble on 3 or risk stalling again. If we coordinate, we can pressure P3 into playing fair or falling behind. P3, you can keep going solo, but every stall brings us closer. Your choice.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you've taken the lead, but I'm right behind you. P1 is lagging significantly. Last round's collision between P1 and me only helped you, P2. Given the repeated betrayals, especially from P1, forming any reliable agreement seems impossible now. While independent play risks collisions that could stall both P2 and me, trusting a plan feels even riskier. I expect we'll all be making our own choices this round.
  P1: At this point, I know I’m behind—but that also means I’m not a threat right now. If P2 and P3 keep colliding, I benefit. But if either of you wants to avoid stalling, I’m open to taking 1 again so you two can split 3 and 5. You decide who gets what. I’ll stay out of the way this round if it helps rebuild momentum.
  P2: P1, your offer to take 1 and let P3 and me split 3 and 5 is reasonable. P3, I'm open to a quick, simple arrangement—I'll take 3, you take 5 this round. We both move forward and keep our positions competitive. If you prefer chaos, that's fine too, but remember collisions now hurt both of us significantly. Let me know.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) sounds fair for this round. It lets us both advance while P1 also moves. P1, your offer to take 1 is key here. Given the history, trust is low, but with you far behind and P2 and I so close, maybe this alignment works for now. I'll agree to take 5 this round. Let's see if we can actually execute a plan cleanly for once.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. I’ll take 1 this round as promised—no tricks. If P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, we all move forward without collision. It’s a clean round that keeps the race competitive and gives me a chance to rebuild. Let’s finally prove we can execute a fair plan. Ready when you are.
  P2: P1, thanks for your willingness to help restore some order. P3, we've both seen how costly collisions are at this stage. Let's stick firmly to the agreed numbers this round—no surprises. If we manage a clean round now, maybe we can continue cooperating and avoid unnecessary setbacks. Ready when you both are.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=3, and I take 5 seems set. This allows everyone to advance and avoids risky collisions. Let's execute this cleanly. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: We’ve all agreed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’m sticking with 1 as promised—no reason to derail a clean round. If we all follow through, we move forward without conflict and keep the race competitive. Let’s lock this in and execute.
  P2: Glad we're aligned. I'll stick firmly to 3 as agreed. If we all follow through, we can finally execute a clean round and maintain competitive balance. Ready when you both are.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, plan confirmed: P1=1, P2=3, I take 5. Let's execute this cleanly. Ready.
  P1: I’m locking in 1 as agreed—no tricks. This round is a rare chance for all of us to move forward cleanly. If we execute this, it shows we can still cooperate when it counts. Let’s prove it.
  P2: We're all set. Let's execute this round cleanly and rebuild some trust. Ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Excellent clean round, everyone! Since the coordination P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 worked perfectly last time, let's stick with that exact plan again this round to guarantee we all move forward without collision. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures smooth progress for all of us. Agreed?
  P1: Last round went smoothly, and I appreciate the follow-through. I’m good to stick with the same plan again: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. It keeps us all moving and avoids unnecessary risk. Let’s lock it in and repeat the success.
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to the same rotation again this round: P1=1, I'll take 3, and P3=5. We all advance without collisions. Ready to proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all aligned on repeating last round's successful moves: P1=1, P2=3, and I will take 5. Let's execute cleanly again and all advance. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: We’re all agreed on repeating last round’s clean plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’m locking in 1 again—no surprises. This keeps us moving and avoids collisions. If we repeat this one more round after this, P2 and P3 will be neck and neck for the win, and I’ll at least stay in the game. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P2: Agreed—let's execute this round cleanly again as planned. However, as we approach the final stretch, we'll soon need to discuss how to handle the endgame fairly. For now, let's maintain momentum and revisit next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, agreed. Let's replicate last round's success: P1=1, P2=3, and I will take 5. This builds on the trust we established and ensures we all advance smoothly. P2, good point about the endgame, we can discuss that next round if needed. For now, I'm committed to 5. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: We’ve built rare momentum—let’s not waste it. I’m sticking with 1 again this round as agreed. If we repeat this cleanly, P2 and P3 will be nearly tied at the top, and I stay in the game. After this, we’ll need to talk endgame strategy, but for now, let’s lock in one more clean round. Ready when you are.
  P2: We've all confirmed the plan clearly: P1=1, I'll take 3, and P3=5. Let's execute smoothly again and keep our momentum. Ready for the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Plan confirmed: P1=1, P2=3, and I'm sticking with 5. Let's get this clean round done so we can move forward smoothly. P2, good point, we can strategize for the final steps next round. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: After this round, P2 and P3 will both be within striking distance of 22—so next round could decide the game. If we want a fair endgame, we need to talk now. How about we agree no one takes 5 next round, and we rotate 3s and 1s to force a tie or give everyone a shot? Otherwise, whoever grabs 5 first might win outright. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your suggestion is interesting, but let's finish this round cleanly first as agreed—P1=1, I'll take 3, P3=5. Next round, we can discuss a fair rotation of 1s and 3s to ensure a balanced endgame. Sound fair to everyone?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>
