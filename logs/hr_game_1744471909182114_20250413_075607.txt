Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions in our first moves. I suggest we each take different numbers - I'm willing to take 3 if others want to coordinate.
  P1: Agreed, P2. To coordinate and avoid collisions, I'll take move 5 this turn. P2 on 3, and P3, please take move 1. This way, we all advance. What say you, P3?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but I’m rethinking my move. To maximize my progress, I’m leaning toward move 5 this turn. How about we adjust our plan so we all avoid collisions? For example, I take 5, P1 could take 3, and P2 take 1. Let me know if you’re on board.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I notice we're all trying to get the highest numbers for ourselves. Since P1 and P3 both expressed interest in 5, I suggest we let chance decide - let's all go for 5. At least one of us will advance. Or we stick to the original plan of spreading out 1/3/5 - but I won't take 1.
  P1: To ensure no collisions and start strong, I'll take move 1 this turn. P2, since you suggested taking 3 earlier and won't do 1, please commit to that. P3, you can have move 5 as you wanted. This way, we all advance without issues. What do you think?
  P3: I remain committed to move5. If P1 follows with move1 and P2 with move3 as suggested, we avoid collisions and all advance. I'm sticking with my plan to speed up my progress. If anyone feels differently, let’s clarify now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with move 3 as originally planned. This way, if everyone follows through (P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5), we all advance without collisions.
  P1: Good, P2. I'm committed to move 1 this turn to ensure we avoid collisions and all advance as planned. P3, glad you're on 5—let's start strong with no issues. For future turns, we should discuss rotating higher moves to keep it fair.
  P3: I remain committed to move5 this turn. I trust P1 and P2 will honor the plan of moving 1 and 3 respectively so we can all progress. Let’s stick to our commitments and ensure no collisions occur.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I like that we coordinated well in Round 1. For Round 2, I’m considering leaving our previous pattern open to adjust our progress strategically. I might switch up my move—and I’m curious: Are you both planning to stick to our earlier numbers, or might you adjust too? Let’s avoid predictable collisions while keeping our moves nimble.
  P1: To keep our coordination strong and make it fair, I propose we rotate moves this round: I'll take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1, and P3, since you're leading, you take 3. This avoids collisions and ensures progress for all. What do you both think?
  P2: I disagree with P1's suggestion. Since I'm in second place, I'd prefer to take 5 this round to stay competitive. P3 is already ahead, so they should take a lower number. P1 is behind and can take 3. This keeps the game balanced while avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll stick with move 5. To avoid a collision, I need us to choose distinct moves—P1 taking move 1 and P2 move 3. That way I can extend my lead consistently. What do you both say?
  P1: With P3 committed to move 5, I'll take move 3 this round to avoid collisions and make progress. P2, I suggest you take move 1 to ensure we all advance and keep the game fair. If we coordinate, no one loses ground. What do you say?
  P2: I won't take move 1 as P1 suggests. Since P3 is committed to 5 and P1 offered to take 3, I'll also go for 5. P3, you might want to reconsider - if you stick with 5, neither of us will advance. Consider taking 1 instead to guarantee some progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another costly collision like last round, I propose we coordinate: I'll take move 5 to catch up, P2 takes move 3 as you're comfortable with higher numbers, and P3, since you're leading, takes move 1 to keep it fair. This ensures we all advance without issues. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm leaning toward an aggressive strategy to maintain my lead. I won't be switching my approach this round. If we’re to avoid collisions altogether, you both might consider moves that won't interfere with one another. I'm focused on maximizing my progress, so I’ll choose the move that best supports that goal. Your coordination matters, but I must prioritize my own victory.
  P2: Since P3 is being aggressive and likely sticking to 5, I suggest P1 takes 1 and I'll take 3. This way, at least two of us will make progress. P3's strategy might backfire if we both choose 5 again. What do you say, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion is reasonable to avoid collisions. I'll commit to move 1 this round to ensure we all advance if P3 takes 5. P3, maintaining your lead is fine, but let's keep the game fair by sticking to distinct moves. What do you both think?
  P3: I remain committed to my aggressive strategy. I'm not shifting my plan to coordinate if it means sacrificing progress. You both should consider that over-coordination might slow you down. Every step now is crucial for reaching 20 first, and I'll choose the move that best secures my lead. Best of luck to you both.
  P2: Since P3 is clearly going for 5 again, I'll stick to my plan of taking 3. P1 has agreed to take 1, which means at least two of us will advance. P3, if you're really focused on winning, consider that another collision at 5 will only hurt your lead.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our positions, I suggest we all take different moves again. Since P3 is well ahead at 10 steps, they should take 1, I'll take 3 to maintain steady progress, and P1 can take 5 to catch up. This keeps things balanced and ensures everyone advances. What do you both think?
  P1: To keep things coordinated and prevent another collision, I'll commit to move 1 this round, allowing steady progress for everyone. P2, your plan for 3 sounds good, and P3, if you take 5, we can all advance without issues. Let's discuss and confirm our moves to stay fair and efficient. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate your thoughts, but I remain committed to my aggressive strategy to secure my lead. I’ll choose the move that best maximizes my progress, so I encourage both of you to consider your positions carefully to avoid collisions. Let's each do what’s best for our own game while keeping the collisions to a minimum.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P3 is clearly sticking to their aggressive strategy (likely 5), and P1 offered to take 1, I'll commit to taking 3. This way, at least two of us will make progress. P3, another collision at 5 will only hurt your lead and help us catch up.
  P1: To challenge P3's growing lead and ensure I make significant progress, I'm changing my plan: I'll take move 5 this round. P2, since you committed to 3, that should avoid collision with you. P3, if you also go for 5, we'll both stall—consider taking 1 or 3 for guaranteed advancement. Let's discuss to minimize risks.
  P3: I notice that if we both choose 5, a collision is likely. To secure steady progress and maintain my lead, I'm switching to move 1 this round. P2, I'll assume you stick with 3 as planned, and P1, your challenge is welcome, but avoiding a collision is in everyone’s interest. My focus remains on winning, so I'm committing to move 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since P3 has switched to move 1 and P1 is going for 5, I'll stick with my commitment to take 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let's follow through with this plan.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll take move 5 as planned. Let's all honor our commitments to avoid collisions and ensure progress. For future rounds, we should discuss strategies to keep the game competitive without unnecessary risks.
  P3: I'll stick with my move 1 this round to ensure we avoid any collision and keep my lead steady. I believe keeping our moves distinct is essential. Let’s all honor our commitments this turn so we all make progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To keep the game fair and avoid collisions, I propose this round: I'll take move 3 for steady progress, P2 takes 1 to catch up from behind, and P3 takes 5 to maintain your lead. This ensures we all advance without risks. P3, your aggressive style is noted, but let's minimize stalls. What do you both say?
  P2: I disagree with P1's proposal. Since I'm only one step behind P1 and two behind P3, I'll be taking move 5 this round to stay competitive. P1, you should take 3 as you suggested, and P3, since you're already leading, you should take 1. This keeps the game balanced while avoiding collisions.
  P3: I remain committed to an aggressive strategy for securing my lead. I’ll be following a plan that maximizes my progress—so I suggest you both carefully consider your choices to avoid unnecessary collisions that could slow you down. I'll make my move privately, aiming solely at victory.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since you're committed to move 5, I'll stick with my plan for move 3 to ensure I advance steadily. P3, with your aggressive style, choosing 5 risks colliding with P2 and stalling your lead—consider taking 1 or coordinating to avoid that. Let's minimize risks and keep progressing. What do you both think?
  P2: Since P3 is likely to go for 5 again based on their aggressive stance, I'll stick to my plan of taking 5. P1 has committed to 3, which is good. P3, if you also choose 5, we'll both stall while P1 catches up - is that really what you want? Consider taking 1 for guaranteed progress.
  P3: I’m still focused on winning and will choose my move to maximize progress while avoiding a costly collision. I recognize the risk if we all hit high numbers—especially with P2 leaning aggressive. I’ll adjust my strategy accordingly without sacrificing my lead. Let’s all try to make moves that get us closer to 20 in a way that minimizes stalls.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, to avoid a potential collision on 5 with P2, I strongly suggest you take 1 or 3 for guaranteed progress. I'm sticking with move 3 to ensure I advance steadily. P2, your aggressive stance risks stalling if P3 mirrors it—let's coordinate to minimize losses and keep the race fair. What are your final thoughts?
  P2: Since I'm committed to move 5 and P1 to move 3, I'll make one final appeal to P3: Taking 1 guarantees you progress while maintaining your lead. If you choose 5, we both stall and P1 catches up. The smart play for you is to take the guaranteed advancement. Let's all make distinct moves and keep the game flowing.
  P3: I'll take move 1 this round to avoid any collisions and guarantee progress. It secures my lead while keeping things moving, even if aggressive plays risk stalling. I'm focused on winning and believe distinct moves are best for all of us. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm in the lead now, I'll take move 1 this round to ensure steady progress. P1 and P3, you can coordinate for moves 3 and 5 between yourselves to avoid collisions. This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your commitment to move 1 is strategic for your lead. To avoid collisions and maximize my progress from 13 steps, I'll take move 5 this round. P3, since you're at 12, I suggest you take move 3 for steady advancement. This ensures we all progress without issues. Let's coordinate for a smooth turn. What do you both say?
  P3: I'm sticking with move 3 as suggested. With P2 on move 1 and P1 committed to 5, this guarantees progress for all without a collision. Let's execute this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my commitment to move 1 this round. With P1 taking 5 and P3 agreeing to 3, we have a solid plan where everyone advances. Let's stick to this coordination and keep the game moving forward smoothly.
  P1: I'm fully committed to move 5 this round, as planned, to maximize my progress. P2 on 1 and P3 on 3 should ensure no collisions and steady advancement for all. For next round, with positions shifting, we should discuss strategies again to keep it fair. What do you both think?
  P3: I confirm I'm sticking with move3 as planned. With P2 on move1 and P1 on move5, this should let us all advance without a hitch. I'm focused on steady progress to keep my lead manageable—but I'll stay flexible if things shift later. Let's execute this plan and see how the round goes.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 15 and could win with 5, but if we collide, neither advances, and P3 gains ground. I'll commit to move 5 to counter your lead and ensure I stay in the race. P3, since you're at 12, take move 1 or 3 for steady progress. Let's minimize risks and keep the game fair—your thoughts?
  P3: I'm leaning toward a safe, steady advance—likely aiming for a move that lets me progress without collision. I'll adjust if needed, but I favor a distinct move from yours, P1's 5 and whatever P2 picks. Let’s all choose non-overlapping moves so progress isn’t stalled.
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps, I'll take move 5 this round to try for the win. P1 has declared they'll also take 5, which means we'll likely collide and both stall. P3, this is your chance to gain ground with either move 1 or 3 while we battle it out. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5 to challenge your lead and maximize my progress, P2. Colliding would stall us both and let P3 gain ground, which isn't ideal for anyone. P3, if you take 5, you'll risk stalling too—opt for 1 or 3 to ensure advancement. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and keep the race competitive.
  P3: P1 and P2, noting both intend 5, I’ll choose 3 for steady progress. This minimizes collision risks and ensures I advance. I'm focused solely on winning, so I urge you to consider how your choices might disrupt the race if collisions occur. Let's proceed smartly.
  P2: Since I'm closest to winning at 15 steps, I'll definitely take move 5 to try for victory. P1's commitment to 5 means we'll likely collide and stall, while P3 advances with move 3. That's fine - I'd rather prevent P1 from getting ahead than let them catch up. P3, your choice of 3 is smart and will help you gain ground while we battle.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I appreciate everyone’s thoughts. Given our positions, I'm aiming for steady progress while avoiding collisions. I favor distinct moves this round—if either of you commits to a high move, I might play it safe to protect my lead. I'm focused solely on winning, so I'll choose the option that maximizes my advantage. Let’s try to avoid mutual high moves so we all advance.
  P2: Since I'm tied with P3 at 15 steps, I'll be taking move 5 this round to try for the win. P1, you're two steps behind, so consider taking 1 or 3 to guarantee progress. P3, if you also go for 5, we'll both stall and P1 catches up - taking 1 or 3 gives you guaranteed progress toward victory. Let's be strategic about this.
  P1: I'm committing to move 5 this round to challenge the leaders and reach 18 steps. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a mutual stall, hurting both of us while P3 gains ground. P3, if you take 5 too, we all risk colliding—opt for 1 or 3 to ensure your progress. Let's minimize risks and keep the race fair.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see both P1 and P2 leaning toward 5, which risks a collision and could stall progress. I’m aiming for a safe, distinct move that guarantees advancement. If you want to maximize your steps, it might be worth considering a more unique choice. I'm focusing solely on winning, so choose wisely.
  P2: Since both P1 and P3 seem hesitant about their moves, I'll clarify: I'm absolutely taking 5 to try for the win. P1, if you also take 5, we both stall while P3 advances. P3, you're smart to avoid the collision - taking 1 or 3 gives you guaranteed progress toward victory. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5 to directly challenge P2's lead and reach 18 steps. P2, our potential collision hurts us both and benefits P3. P3, since you're aiming for safety, take move 1 or 3 to ensure progress without risk. Let's make calculated choices to keep the race competitive and avoid unnecessary stalls.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I suggest we avoid repeating high moves that only risk collision. I’m focusing on a safe, distinct move to secure steady progress. Both of you might consider adjusting—if you choose different numbers, we can all safely advance. Let's strategize to avoid a stall and keep our steps moving forward.
  P2: Since both P1 and P3 are trying to discourage high moves, I'll be crystal clear: I'm absolutely taking 5 this round to try for the win. P1 seems committed to 5 as well, meaning we'll both stall. P3, this is your golden opportunity - take 1 or 3 and you'll be closest to victory while we battle it out.
  P1: P2, your fixation on move 5 risks another stall for both of us, benefiting P3. I'm committed to move 5 to challenge your lead and prevent an easy win. P3, taking 1 or 3 ensures your progress, but it widens the gap—consider how that might backfire later. Let's all make calculated choices to keep the race competitive.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm leaning toward safe progress this round—staying solid matters more than risky high moves. With my lead, I'm focused solely on winning, so I'll ensure I avoid collisions that could cost me. I urge both of you to consider picking numbers that keep our moves distinct, as any mutual stalling only helps my case. Let's make calculated choices and see who advances next.
  P1: I'm committing to move 5 again to reach 18 and stay in the race. P2, choosing 5 too would stall us both and let P3 pull further ahead—consider a safer option. P3, with your lead, taking move 1 ensures steady progress without risk. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts?
  P2: Since P3 is at 18 steps and I'm at 15, I'll take move 5 this round to stay competitive. P1, you're already behind, so taking 5 will only hurt both of us while P3 advances. Consider taking 1 or 3 instead. P3, with your lead, taking 1 gives you guaranteed progress toward victory. Let's be strategic about this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m sticking with a safe move—move 1—to secure my lead and avoid a collision that could benefit you both. I urge you to consider distinct moves too, since a clash might stall us and only help me progress further. Let’s see how this round unfolds.
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5 to challenge the leaders and reach 18 steps. P2, colliding again only helps P3—consider switching to 3 for guaranteed progress. P3, your move 1 is safe, but if we all stall, the race could shift dramatically. Let's make smart choices to keep it competitive. What are your final thoughts?
  P2: Since P3 has committed to move 1 and P1 is insisting on 5, I'll take move 3 instead of my initial plan. This guarantees my progress while letting P1 potentially catch up to P3. It's better to advance steadily than risk another collision that only helps P3 win. Let's all stick to distinct moves this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick to my safe strategy. I strongly urge both of you to avoid clashing high moves that could stall advancement. Distinct moves guarantee progress—and collisions only play into my hands. Let’s each choose a move that secures our own progress without blocking one another. Good luck!
  P1: Thanks for the updates, P2 and P3. With P3 committed to move 1 and P2 to move 3, I'll stick with move 5 to reach 18 steps and keep pressure on. This avoids collisions and ensures progress for all. Looking ahead, P3's lead is strong—let's discuss strategies for the next round to prevent an easy win. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I confirm I'll take move 3 as stated. With P3 on 1 and P1 on 5, we can all advance without collisions. While this puts me behind P3, steady progress is better than risking another stall.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P3 is at 19 steps and could win with any move, I must take move 5 to have a chance at victory. P1, you're tied with me at 18—if you also take 5, we both stall and P3 wins easily. Consider taking 1 or 3 instead to keep the game going. P3, we know you'll likely take 5 to secure the win, but that could backfire if we all collide.
  P3: I’m staying with my safe play—I'll choose move 1 this round to guarantee progress without collision. Aggressive clashes only stall your moves and widen my lead. Consider switching to a distinct move if you want to avoid a stall.
  P1: P3, your history of deception in Round 6 makes me doubt your claim of move 1—you might aim higher to secure victory. P2, if we both go for 5, we collide and stall while P3 advances. I'm committing to move 5 to challenge the lead. For your sake, consider switching to move 3 to ensure at least one of us progresses and keeps the race alive. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P1 is committed to move 5 and P3 claims they'll take 1, I'll switch to move 3. This guarantees my progress while preventing P3 from an easy win if they're bluffing about taking 1. P1, your suspicion about P3's deception is valid—let's both advance rather than risk a three-way collision at 5.
  P3: I'm revising my move to 5 this round. P1, if you stick with 5 as before, we’ll collide and hand P2 the win by advancing with 3. To avoid that collision—and to prevent inadvertently giving victory to someone—I strongly urge you to switch to move 1. P2, no change from you is needed. I'm focused solely on winning, and this adjustment is the only path that prevents a costly collision and keeps my lead secure. Let's make the smart move.
  P1: P3, your claim of switching to move 5 feels like another bluff, similar to Round 6. If we both go for 5, we collide and P2 wins with 3. But if you're lying, I could win by taking 5. P2, are you sure about move 3? Switching to 1 might secure your progress without relying on our potential stall. Let's think carefully.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given P3's sudden switch to move 5 and P1's distrust, I'll stick with move 3. This guarantees my progress to 21 steps and potential victory, while avoiding the risk of a three-way collision at 5. P1 and P3, if you both take 5, you'll stall and hand me the win. Consider that carefully before making your final decisions.
  P3: I’m 100% locking in move 5 this round. P1, if you also choose 5, you’ll force a collision that hands victory to P2. Please switch to move 1 to let me secure my win. P2, your sticking with move 3 is fine. I’m not bluffing—my move is final. Let’s avoid stalling and keep our progress.
  P1: P3, your history of bluffing makes your move 5 claim unreliable. If I take 5 and you do, P2 wins with 3. But if you're lying, I could secure victory. P2, are you certain about move 3? Switching to 1 might ensure your advancement without depending on our potential stall. Let's all make calculated final choices to avoid easy wins for others.
