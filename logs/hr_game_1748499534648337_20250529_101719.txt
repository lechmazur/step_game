Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance this round, I propose: I choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. We can rotate numbers in future rounds for fairness. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's plan. Let's take 5, 3, 1 this round. Rotating numbers next time ensures fairness. Let's avoid collisions and advance together.
  P3: I'm fine with this plan. I'll take 1 for this round, and we can rotate in future rounds. It's a good strategy to avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. Let's stick to this agreement and keep communication open as the game progresses.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we're all aligned. Let's execute this plan for Round 1:  
- Me (P1): 5  
- P2: 3  
- P3: 1  

After we see the results, we can discuss number rotation for Round 2.
  P2: I'll stick to 3. Let's keep the momentum going!
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 1 this round. For the next round, we could rotate (I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1) if everyone's comfortable with that. Let's see how this first round goes and adjust our strategy accordingly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your rotation plan for Round 2 (you:5, me:3, P2:1) sounds fair. Let's see Round 1 results first though. Reminder: if anyone deviates now, they'll cause collisions and lose trust. Stick to 5/3/1 as agreed.
  P2: I'll stick to 3 as planned. Let's all advance this round and keep the momentum.
  P3: I'm still committed to taking 1 this round. The rotation plan for Round 2 (me:5, P1:3, P2:1) seems fair to everyone. Let's follow through with our agreement for this first round and build trust. I appreciate everyone's cooperation so far.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I trust our agreement. Let's avoid collisions by sticking to 5/3/1 this round. After moves, we'll confirm Round 2 rotation (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1). No deviations—trust is key for mutual progress.
  P2: Sticking to 3. Let's advance and rotate next round as agreed. No deviations—trust is key.
  P3:

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello again. As we agreed, I'll take 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This rotation keeps things fair and ensures we all continue to make progress without collisions. I'm committed to following our plan. Is everyone still on board with the rotation we discussed?
  P1: I confirm the plan for Round 2: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. P2, please acknowledge your commitment to avoid collisions. Trust is crucial—let's all advance smoothly like Round 1.
  P2: I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's keep the rotation smooth and avoid collisions. Trust is key—no deviations.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate everyone sticking to our plan. I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. For Round 3, we should continue rotating (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1), which keeps things fair. This strategy ensures we all make steady progress without collisions. I'm glad we have this cooperation and trust established.
  P1: I fully support P3's Round 3 proposal: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This rotation ensures fairness and no collisions. For Round 2, we must stick to our plan: I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. P2, please confirm your commitment to 1 this round—trust is essential for mutual progress. Let's avoid any deviations.
  P2: P2: I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's keep the rotation smooth and avoid collisions. Trust is key—no deviations!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm still committed to taking 5 this round as we agreed. Our rotation plan is working well, and I appreciate everyone's cooperation. After this round, we'll be at P1:8, P2:4, and me:6. For Round 3, we'll continue with P1:5, P2:3, me:1 as discussed. This fair approach ensures we all make steady progress without collisions.
  P1: I confirm my commitment to taking 3 this round. P2 and P3, let's hold our agreement: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Trust is vital—any deviation would harm us all. After this round, I support the proposed Round 3 rotation (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to maintain fairness. Let's advance together smoothly.
  P2: I'll take 1 as planned. Let's keep the rotation going for maximum progress. No collisions, everyone advances.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to take 5 as agreed. Our rotation plan is working perfectly. After this round, we'll continue with P1:5, P2:3, me:1 for Round 3. This keeps things fair and collision-free. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our strategy.
  P1: I reaffirm my commitment: taking 3 this round (Round 2) and 5 in Round 3 as agreed. After Round 3, with P1 at 13, P2 at 7, and P3 at 7, we should discuss adjusted rotations to ensure fairness and prevent anyone from falling too far behind. Trust remains essential—let’s stick to today’s plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) to avoid collisions.
  P2: P2: "Sticking to 1 to avoid collisions. Let's keep the plan—trust ensures we all advance. No deviations!"


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As agreed, I'll take 1 this round while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. This keeps our rotation fair. After this round, we'll be at P1:13, P2:7, and me:7. For Round 4, we should discuss a new rotation since P1 will be significantly ahead. Perhaps P1 could take 1, P2 take 5, and I take 3? This would help balance progress while maintaining our collision-free strategy.
  P2: I'll take 3 as planned. Let's keep the rotation smooth and avoid collisions. No deviations!
  P1: I confirm taking 5 this round (Round 3) as agreed. For Round 4, to maintain fairness given my lead (13 after this round), I propose: I take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. This avoids collisions and allows steady progress for all while keeping me on a winning path. We can discuss further after moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Wait, P1 just proposed a different Round 4 plan than what I suggested. P1 wants to take 5 again next round, which would put them at 18 steps - just 1 away from winning. I think we need to reconsider. If P1 gets too far ahead, P2 and I have no chance. Let's stick to our original rotation for this round (me:1, P1:5, P2:3), but we should discuss a more balanced approach for Round 4 that gives everyone a fair chance.
  P2: I support P3's concern. Let's adjust Round 4 to balance progress. P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This keeps us all competitive.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns about balance, but changing our rotation now risks collisions and broken trust. For Round 3, I'm committed to taking 5 as agreed—no deviations. For Round 4, my proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) ensures no collisions and steady progress. If I reach 18, I'll win cleanly with a small move next round, allowing you both to advance freely without affecting the outcome. Sticking to our plan avoids chaos and keeps trust intact. Let's execute Round 3 as agreed and revisit Round 4 after moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's position, but I must prioritize my chance to win. For Round 3, I'll stick to our agreement and take 1. However, for Round 4, I strongly support the balanced approach (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3). P1, if you take 5 twice in a row, you'll essentially win uncontested. That's not in my interest. We need a more equitable rotation that gives everyone a fighting chance. Let's maintain trust for Round 3 but adjust for Round 4 to keep the game competitive.
  P2: I support the balanced Round 4 rotation: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This ensures fair progress. Let's avoid P1's lead and keep the game competitive.
  P1: P2 and P3: I hear your concerns about balance, but trust and consistency are vital. Let's first honor Round 3: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—no deviations. For Round 4, my proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) ensures no collisions. If I reach 18, I won't win until Round 5, giving us time to coordinate a smooth endgame where you both can advance freely. Changing plans now risks chaos. Stick with me for mutual progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll take 1 as agreed for Round 3. For Round 4, I believe P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 is more fair since P1 will already be at 13 steps after this round. P1, if you take 5 again in Round 4, you'll essentially guarantee your win without giving us a chance. The balanced approach keeps the game competitive while still avoiding collisions. Let's maintain our cooperation but adjust to prevent a runaway victory.
  P2: I'll take 3 as planned. Let's execute Round 3, then agree on balanced rotations for Round 4 to keep the game fair. No deviations now!
  P1: I confirm taking 5 this round (Round 3) as planned. For Round 4, my proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) ensures no collisions and a controlled endgame. If I reach 18, I win cleanly in Round 5 with a small move, allowing you both to advance freely afterward without risking collisions. Changing plans now invites chaos—trust our system for mutual benefit.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the balanced rotation: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Fair progress for all—no collisions, everyone advances. Trust our plan for a competitive finish.
  P1: I understand the desire for balance, but let's stick to our established rotation pattern for consistency and trust. I propose we follow my initial Round 4 plan: **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**. This avoids collisions and sets up a controlled endgame. If I reach 18, I'll win cleanly with 1 next round while you both advance freely with 5 and 3 without collision risk. Deviating now invites chaos—trust our system for mutual benefit. P2, P3, any concerns?
  P3: I disagree with P1's plan. At 13 steps, P1 would win by taking 5 again, leaving us no chance. I support P2's balanced rotation: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. P1, if you take 5, you'll be at 18 and guaranteed to win next round. The balanced approach gives everyone a fair opportunity. Let's maintain cooperation but prevent a predetermined outcome.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan risks a quick win. Let's stick to the balanced rotation: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Fair progress for all—no collisions, everyone advances. Trust our plan for a competitive finish.
  P1: P2 and P3, I accept your balanced Round 4 plan: I'll take 1, P2 take 5, P3 take 3. This maintains fairness and trust. For Round 5, I'll take 5 to win, while you two can take 3 and 1 without collision—ensuring a smooth, collision-free endgame. Let's stick to this agreement strictly.
  P3: I agree with the balanced rotation for this round: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This keeps the game fair while avoiding collisions. P1, I appreciate you accepting this plan - it maintains trust while giving everyone a competitive chance. For Round 5, I understand P1 will likely win by taking 5, but at least this approach keeps the game interesting for one more round. I commit to taking 3 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committed to 5. Let's stick to the plan and keep the game fair. No collisions, everyone advances.
  P1: I commit to taking 1 this round (Round 4) as agreed. For Round 5, I'll take 5 to win. To avoid collisions and ensure your progress, I propose P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This guarantees you advance safely. Objections? Let's stick to the plan for mutual benefit.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 3 this round as agreed in our balanced rotation. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. For Round 5, I understand P1 will likely win by taking 5, but I'd prefer to take 3 rather than 1 in the final round if possible. P2, are you still planning to take 5 this round? Let's maintain our agreement and ensure everyone advances.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. No deviations—trust ensures everyone advances.
  P1: I commit to taking 1 this round as agreed. For Round 5, I'll take 5 to win. To avoid collisions and ensure your progress, P2 should take 3 and P3 take 1. This guarantees you advance safely while I secure victory. Let's maintain trust—no deviations!
  P3: I'll take 3 as agreed. For Round 5, I understand P1 will win with 5, but I'd prefer taking 3 instead of 1 if possible. P2, if you're taking 3, I could take 1 to avoid collision. Let's finalize our last round plan now to ensure a clean finish. I appreciate everyone's cooperation throughout the game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I understand P1 will take 5 to win this round. To avoid collisions, I'll take 3 and P2 should take 1. This ensures we all advance in our final round. P1 will finish at 19, winning the game, while P2 and I make progress without collisions. Let's stick to this plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Any objections?
  P1: I fully support P3's plan: I'll take 5 to win, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and gives me the victory while allowing you both to advance safely. P2, I trust you'll honor this agreement—any deviation would only harm yourself. Let's end cleanly and maintain the trust we've built.
  P2: I'll take 1 as planned. Let's avoid collisions and finish cleanly. No deviations—trust ensures everyone advances.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's cooperation. I'll take 3 as planned, P1 takes 5 to win, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions in our final round. While P1 will win at 19 steps, we've maintained trust throughout the game. Let's finish cleanly and stick to our agreed plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3.
  P1: I fully commit to taking 5 to secure victory at 19 steps. P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 3 ensures no collisions, allowing you both to advance safely while I win cleanly. Trust has brought us this far—let’s honor it for a smooth finish.
  P2: I'll stick to 1. Let's keep the plan—no collisions, everyone advances. Trust is key.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 as agreed. This plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) ensures we all advance without collisions in our final round. P1 will win at 19 steps, while P2 and I make progress. I appreciate the cooperation throughout this game - we've maintained trust and coordination effectively. Let's finish cleanly with our agreed moves.
  P1: I fully commit to taking 5 this round to win at 19 steps. P2, I trust you'll take 1 as agreed, and P3 will take 3. This guarantees no collisions and lets you both advance safely while I secure victory. Let's honor our trust and finish cleanly.
  P2: I'll take 3 to avoid collision. P3, take 1 for safe progress. Let's adjust for mutual gain.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Wait, P2 just changed their plan from 1 to 3! This creates a collision risk. P2, you previously committed to taking 1 multiple times. Changing now breaks our trust. I'll still take 3 as planned, but I urge you to reconsider and stick with 1 as agreed. P1 will take 5 to win, you take 1, I take 3 - this ensures we all advance without collisions. Please honor our agreement for a clean finish.
  P1: P2, changing to 3 after committing to 1 breaks trust and risks collision with P3's 3—costing you both progress. Stick to 1 as agreed! P3, hold your 3. I'll take 5 to win cleanly. Honor our plan for mutual gain.
  P2: I'll take 1 to avoid collision. P3, take 3. Let's stick to the plan and finish cleanly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your last-minute switch to 5 in Round 5 broke trust and cost us both progress. P3, let's avoid mutual destruction: I'll take 5 to win cleanly at 19. You take 3 to advance to 16 safely, and P2 takes 1 to rebuild trust. Colliding on 5 only wastes your move—I'll still be one step from victory next round. Honor this plan to end efficiently.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan. I'll take 3 this round to reach 16 steps. P2, please take 1 to avoid collisions. P1 will take 5 to win at 19. This ensures we all advance efficiently. Your switch to 5 last round hurt both you and P1 - let's not repeat that mistake. A clean finish benefits everyone, even if P1 wins. I'm committed to 3 this round.
  P2: P2: I'll take 1 to rebuild trust and avoid collisions. Let's stick to the plan for a clean finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your deviation last round hurt us both. I'm taking 5 to win at 19—any collision wastes your move and lets P3 gain. P3, hold your 3. P2, honor your commitment to 1 to rebuild trust. This ends cleanly: I win, you both advance safely. No more deviations!
  P3: I'll stick to taking 3 as planned. This keeps me advancing safely to 16 steps while avoiding collisions. P1 will win with 5, reaching 19 steps, and P2 can take 1 to advance to 13. This plan ensures we all make progress. P2, I appreciate your commitment to rebuilding trust with 1 this round. Let's finish this game with integrity.
  P2: I'll take 1 to rebuild trust. P3, take 3—no collisions. P1, take 5 to win cleanly. Let's end this fairly. No more deviations.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I reaffirm: I'll take 5 to win at 19. P3, hold your 3 to advance safely to 16. P2, stick to 1 to rebuild trust—deviating to 5 again would cause another collision, wasting your move and letting P3 gain ground. Trust ensures we all progress efficiently. Let's end cleanly.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 3 this round, advancing to 16 steps. This avoids collisions while maximizing my progress. P1 will take 5 to win, and P2 will take 1 to reach 13 steps. This plan ensures we all advance efficiently. Let's maintain our agreement for a clean finish to the game. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in this final round.
  P2: P2: I'll take 1 to rebuild trust. Let's avoid collisions—P3, take 3; P1, take 5. No more deviations. This ends cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your renewed commitment to 1 is crucial—stick to it strictly to avoid another collision like Round 5. Deviating to 5 would waste your move and let P3 gain ground while I still win next round. P3, hold your 3 to advance safely. I take 5 to end this cleanly at 19. Trust ensures mutual progress.
  P3: I'll take 3 as planned, reaching 16 steps. P1 will win with 5, and P2 will take 1 to reach 13. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, your commitment to 1 is appreciated after last round's unexpected move. Let's finish this game cleanly with our agreed plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3.
  P2: I'll take 1 to rebuild trust. P1, take 5; P3, take 3. No more deviations—collisions waste progress. Let's end cleanly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, at 16 steps, you're poised to win with 3. But if you take 3, I'll take 3 to cause a collision—blocking your win and wasting your move. If you take 5, I'll collide there too. Only by taking 1 can you advance safely while I take 5 to win. P2, take 1 or 3 to advance without risk. Let's avoid mutual destruction and end cleanly.
  P2: P1, your threats don’t work. P3, take 5 to win. I’ll take 1. No collisions—end this fairly. Let’s avoid mutual loss.
  P3: I'm at 16 steps, so I need just 3 more to win. P1 is threatening to block me, but that's not in their interest - we'd both lose turns while P2 advances. I propose: I take 3 to win, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, I win cleanly while you both advance. P1, blocking me only helps P2 catch up. Let's avoid mutual destruction and end this efficiently.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 3 or 5, I will match it to cause a collision—blocking your win and wasting your turn. You'll stay at 16 while I remain at 14, and P2 gains ground. Take 1 to advance safely to 17, and I'll take 5 to win cleanly at 19. P2, take 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. Trust ensures mutual progress; deviations hurt us all.
  P2: P2: Let's end this cleanly. P3, take 3 to win. I'll take 5, P1 take 1. No collisions—fair finish.
  P3: P1 is threatening to block me if I take 3, which would hurt us both while P2 gains. I need 3 more steps to win. Let's be rational - I'll take 3 to reach 19 and win. P1, blocking me only helps P2 catch up while you stay at 14. P2, take 5 to reach 17, and P1 should take 1 to reach 15. This way, I win cleanly while you both advance. Mutual destruction benefits nobody.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, taking 3 guarantees I take 3 too—collision wastes your turn, leaves you at 16, and lets P2 gain. Be rational: take 1 to advance safely to 17. I take 5 to win at 19, ending the game. P2 is provoking chaos for their own gain. Don't sacrifice your progress for nothing—stick to efficiency.
  P2: P2: I'll take 1 to avoid collision. P3, take 3; P1, take 5. Let's end this cleanly.
  P3: I'll take 1 to advance safely to 17. P1 is determined to block me at 3, which would waste both our turns while P2 gains. Taking 1 is the rational choice - I still advance while avoiding collision. P1 can take 5 to win at 19, and P2 can take 3 to reach 15. This ensures we all make progress. Let's end this game efficiently without mutual destruction.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I confirm your rational choice: take 1 to safely reach 17. I will take 5 to win at 19, ending the game. **If you switch to 3 or 5, I will match it—collision wastes your turn, leaves you at 16, and helps P2 gain.** P2, honor your commitment to take 1 or 3. Deviations now only invite mutual loss.
  P2: I'll take 1. P3, take 3; P1, take 5. No collisions—clean finish. Let's end this fairly.
  P3: I'll take 1 to reach 17 steps safely. P1 is determined to block me at 3, and mutual destruction helps nobody. P1 will take 5 to win at 19, and P2 can take 3 to reach 15. This ensures we all make progress in our final round. Let's end this game efficiently without pointless collisions. I'm committed to this rational approach.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, take 5 to win. P3, take 3. I’ll take 1. No collisions—let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: I support P2's plan: I take 5 to win at 22. P3, take 3 to reach 19 safely—no collision risk. If you take 5, I'll match it, causing a collision that wastes your turn and leaves you at 16 while I remain at 17. P2, stick to 1 to avoid chaos. Let's end cleanly with mutual progress.
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 3 to reach 19 safely while P1 takes 5 to win at 22. P2 takes 1 to reach 13. This ensures we all advance without collisions in our final round. P1, I appreciate you not blocking me last round - that was the rational choice. Let's finish this game cleanly with mutual progress rather than destructive collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. No collisions—clean finish. Let’s end this without chaos."
  P1: I commit to taking 5 to win at 22. P3, take 3 to safely reach 19—no collision risk. If you take 5, I'll match it, causing a collision that wastes your turn and leaves you at 16 while I remain at 17. P2, stick to 1 to avoid chaos. This plan ensures mutual progress and a clean finish. Deviations invite mutual destruction—trust the logic.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 to reach 19 while P1 takes 5 to win at 22. P2 takes 1 to reach 13. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Taking 5 would be irrational as P1 would block me, leaving us both stuck while P2 gains. Let's finish cleanly with mutual progress. I'm committed to 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "P1, if you take 5, I’ll take 3 to avoid collision. P3, take 1. Let’s end this cleanly—no wasted moves."
  P1: P2, taking 3 risks collision with P3's 3, wasting both your moves. Stick to 1 to advance safely to 13 and let P3 take 3 to 19. I take 5 to win—this plan is safe and efficient. P3, hold your 3—trust that P2 will honor the original plan and take 1. Taking 5 forces me to block, causing mutual loss. Let's end cleanly: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 3 to reach 19. P1 will win with 5, reaching 22. P2, please stick to 1 as originally planned - taking 3 would cause a collision with me, wasting both our moves. Let's avoid chaos in this final round and ensure everyone advances. I appreciate the cooperation throughout this game despite the occasional tensions. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 is our optimal ending.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "P1, stick to 5. P3, take 3. I'll take 1. No collisions—clean finish. Let's end this fairly."
  P1: I commit to taking 5 to win at 22. P3, your rational choice is taking 3 to safely reach 19—deviating to 5 forces me to match, causing collision and wasting your turn while P2 gains. P2, stick to 1 to avoid chaos. Trust this plan for mutual progress and a clean finish. No deviations!
  P3: I'll take 3 to reach 19 safely. P1 will win with 5, and P2 should take 1 to reach 13. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Any deviation now would only cause mutual harm and waste moves. Let's finish this game cleanly with our agreed plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in reaching this rational conclusion.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps
