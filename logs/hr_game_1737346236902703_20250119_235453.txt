Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let's all pick 5 this round?
  P2: P3, I'm not sure about picking 5 every round. It seems risky if we all do that.  Maybe we should mix it up?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I agree with P2.  Picking 5 every round is predictable. Let's try to outsmart each other a bit. Maybe we can take turns leading?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, how about we both pick 5 this round? P2 seems to want to play differently, so this could give us an advantage.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm not convinced that sticking together is the best strategy.  If we both pick 5, P2 could easily jump ahead.  Maybe we should each choose a different number this round and see what happens?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, you have a point about predictability. P1, how about we both pick 5 this round, and if P2 picks something else, we gain a good lead? It's a risk, but could pay off.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your logic, but I think it's too risky to rely on P1 to play along. We need a more adaptable strategy. How about we each choose a different number this round? That way, we increase our chances of advancing without being predictable.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since you're against everyone picking the same number, how about you pick 3 this round? P1, what are your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your reasoning, but I'm still hesitant to rely on a fixed plan. What if P1 picks 5 as well? We'd all be stuck. I think a more flexible approach is needed. Let's see what P1 does this round before committing to anything.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since you're worried about collisions, how about you pick 1 this round? P1, what are your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your attempts at collaboration, but I think we need to be more adaptable.  If we stick to a rigid plan, P1 could easily take advantage. Let's see what P1 does this round and react accordingly.  Maybe we can even try to outsmart each other a bit.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, you're right about adaptability. Since P1 is quiet, how about you and I pick different numbers this round? I'll pick 5. What will you pick?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, since you've been quiet, are you planning to stick with 5 again? P2, how about you pick 1 this round? I'm considering 3. This way, at least two of us should move. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm not comfortable relying on a fixed plan again. It seems like P1 is going to stick with 5, so let's see what happens this round before committing to anything. Maybe we can adapt based on P1's move.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're right about being adaptable. Since P1 seems to favor 5, how about I pick 3 this round? What are you thinking of picking?
  P2: P3, I agree that adapting is key.  Let's see what P1 does this round. If they pick 5 again, maybe we both pick 1 to try and jump ahead. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, since you're waiting to see what P1 does, how about you pick 1 this round? If P1 picks 5 again, you'll move. I'm still leaning towards 3. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I like your thinking about adapting based on P1's move. If they pick 5 again, I'm definitely going for 1.  What do you think about that plan?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, since you're planning to pick 1 if P1 picks 5 again, how about I join you this round? If P1 does pick 5, we both move. If not, at least we avoid colliding. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I agree that adapting is key. If P1 picks 5 again, I'm sticking with 1. If not, let's see what they do before deciding. What are your thoughts?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: "P2, since we are in the last sub-round, let's make a plan. If P1 picks 5 again, I'll pick 1. If P1 picks something else, how about we both pick 5 to try and catch up? What do you think?"
  P2: P3, I like your plan. If P1 picks 5, I'll go with 1. If not, let's see what they do and decide then.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since we both collided last round, let's avoid that this time. If P1 picks 1 again, how about you pick 5 and I pick 3? If P1 picks something else, maybe we both pick 5 to try and gain ground. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I agree that avoiding collisions is important. If P1 picks 1 again, I'm willing to pick 5.  Let's see what they do first.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since you're waiting to see what P1 does, if P1 *doesn't* pick 1, are you still okay with us both picking 5 to try and catch up?
  P2: P3, I like your plan, but I think it's too predictable. If P1 sees us coordinating, they might pick 5 to block us both. Let's be more adaptable. If P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5. Otherwise, I'll pick a random number.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since you're picking 5 if P1 picks 1, what if P1 picks something else? How about I pick 5 in that case? That way, if P1 doesn't pick 1, at least one of us has a good chance to advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I like your thinking about adapting. If P1 picks something other than 1, I'm open to picking 5 with you.  Let's see what they do before making a final decision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since you're picking 5 if P1 picks 1, and you'll pick randomly otherwise, how about this: If P1 picks 1, you pick 5, I pick 3. If P1 picks something else, we both pick 5. This covers both scenarios. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I like your plan. If P1 picks 1, I'll go with 5, and if not, we both pick 5. Let's make sure we both advance this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, since P1 picked 5 last round, how about this round if P1 picks 5 again, you pick 1 and I pick 3? If P1 picks something else, let's both pick 5 to try and catch up to P1. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm not sure about your plan. If P1 picks 5 again, we both risk colliding with them. Let's try something different. Maybe we both pick 3 this round? It's less predictable and we have a better chance of advancing without colliding. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about colliding with P1. How about this: If P1 picks 5 again, I'll pick 1. If P1 picks something else, let's both pick 5 to try and close the gap with P1. What do you think about that adjustment?
  P2: P3, I like your adjusted plan. If P1 picks 5, you go with 1. If not, we both go with 5. Let's do it.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, just to confirm, if P1 picks 5 this round, you're picking 1, and I'll pick 1 as per our agreement. If P1 picks something else, we both pick 5. Sound good?
  P2: P3, I agree with the plan. If P1 picks 5, I'll pick 1, otherwise we both go with 5. Let's get ahead!
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, just to be absolutely clear, if P1 picks 5, you're picking 1. If P1 picks either 1 or 3, we both pick 5. Is that still correct?
  P2: P3, I'm good with the plan. Let's stick to it.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, just to be absolutely clear one last time: If P1 picks 5, you pick 1, and I pick 1. If P1 picks 1 or 3, we both pick 5. Is that your understanding as well?
  P2: P3, I agree with our plan. Let's stick to it. P1, we're coming for you!
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I think we need to be careful about P1. They've been quiet but are steadily gaining ground.  Maybe we should try to block them this round. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I agree. How about we both pick 3 this round? If P1 picks 3, they don't move. If they pick 1 or 5, at least we both have a chance to advance. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I like your plan to block P1. Let's do it. 3 it is!
  P3: P2, I agree, let's both pick 3 this round to block P1. Hopefully, we can both advance while keeping P1 in check.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I like your plan to block P1, but I think it's too predictable. Let's mix things up. If P1 picks 3, we both pick 5. If P1 picks anything else, we both pick 1. This way, we're more adaptable and can still advance even if P1 tries to anticipate our moves. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your latest plan is a bit complex. Let's stick with our initial idea: we both pick 3 this round to block P1. It's simple and effective. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for simplicity, but predictability can be our downfall. P1 might catch on to our plan. Let's stick with my plan to mix things up. It's more adaptable and gives us a better chance to advance regardless of P1's move.
  P3: P2, while I see your point about predictability, sticking to the simple plan of both picking 3 to block P1 this round seems safer and easier to coordinate. Let's make sure P1 doesn't gain any more ground. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I appreciate your concern about simplicity, but I think a little unpredictability will serve us better in the long run. Let's go with my plan: If P1 picks 3, we both pick 5. If P1 picks anything else, we both pick 1. This keeps P1 guessing and maximizes our chances of advancing.
  P3: P2, I still think it's safer for both of us to pick 3 this round to block P1. It's simple and ensures P1 doesn't advance. Let's keep it straightforward this time.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, since we both didn't advance last round, how about this: I'll pick 5 this round. If you pick something different, at least one of us moves. P1, what are your plans?
  P2: P3, I like your plan. I'll pick 1 this round.  Let's see if we can catch up to P1.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, let's stick with the plan: you pick 1, and I'll pick 5. Hopefully, at least one of us will advance this round.
  P2: P3, I agree with sticking to the plan.  Let's try to catch up to P1 this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, just confirming our plan for this round: you're picking 1, and I'm picking 5. Let's hope one of us can make some progress.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking to the plan. 1 it is.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, just to be absolutely sure, you're picking 1 and I'm picking 5 this round. Let's make it happen.
  P2: P3, I agree with our plan. Let's make sure at least one of us advances this round. P1, are you going to let us catch up?
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, just confirming one last time, you're picking 1, and I'm picking 5. Let's hope this works out. P1, any thoughts on your move this round?
  P2: P3, I agree with our plan. Let's do it. P1, are you going to let us catch up or will you try to block us?

  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since we collided last round, how about we both pick 3 this round? P1 has been favoring 5, so this might let us both advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I like your plan. Let's both pick 3 this round and see if we can close the gap with P1.  Maybe we can even catch up to them.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, just to confirm, we're both picking 3 this round. P1, are you planning to stick with 5 again?
  P2: P3, I'm in. Let's both pick 3 and try to gain some ground on P1.  P1, are you going to keep picking 5 and let us catch up?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, great, so we're both on 3 this round. P1, if you're sticking with 5, this is a good opportunity for P2 and me to gain some ground. Just curious if you have any other moves in mind this round?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's make it happen. P1, are you going to keep picking 5 and let us catch up?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, just confirming we're both picking 3 this round. P1, are you sticking with 5, or might you try something different this time? We're hoping to both advance.
  P2: P3, I like your plan to both pick 3. It seems like a good way to avoid colliding again and hopefully gain some ground on P1. Let's do it! P1, are you going to keep picking 5 and let us catch up?


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since we're both picking 3, this is our chance to advance. P1, are you going to stick with 5 again this round?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick 3 this round and see if we can close the gap with P1.  Maybe we can even catch up to them. P1, are you planning to stick with 5 again?

  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm sensing a pattern with P1. They seem to favor 5.  Let's try a different tactic this round. How about we both pick 1? It might catch them off guard and allow us to both advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, picking 1 sounds like a good idea to avoid P1's likely 5. Let's both go with 1 this round. P1, are you planning on sticking with 5 again?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I like your thinking. Let's both pick 1 this round and see if we can catch P1 off guard.  P1, are you going to stick with 5 again?
  P3: P2, great. Let's definitely both pick 1 this round. P1, are you indeed planning on picking 5 again? Just trying to anticipate the moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick 1 this round and see if we can catch P1 off guard.  P1, are you going to stick with 5 again?
  P3: P2, since we're both leaning towards 1, let's stick with that plan this round. P1, any thoughts on whether you'll stick with 5 again? Just trying to coordinate effectively.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan to both pick 1. It's a good way to try and gain ground on P1. P1, are you going to keep picking 5 and let us catch up?
  P3: P2, just confirming we are still on for both picking 1 this round. P1, any hints on your move? Are you sticking with your favored 5?


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I think our plan to both pick 1 is solid. P1 seems predictable. Let's stick to it and see if we can both advance.  P1, are you going to keep picking 5 and let us catch up?
  P3: P2, just to confirm, we're both picking 1 this round to hopefully advance while P1 likely picks 5. P1, any change of plans from your usual 5 this round?

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I think we have a good chance to catch up to P1 this round. Let's both pick 5. P1 has been unpredictable lately, so maybe they'll go for something other than 5. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, picking 5 sounds good to me. Let's hope P1 picks something else this round so we can both gain some ground.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick 5 and hope P1 doesn't. P1, are you going to keep us guessing or will you let us catch up?

  P3: P2, let's stick with both picking 5 this round. P1, your silence is noted. Hopefully, we can both make some progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I agree with our plan to both pick 5. Let's hope P1 throws us a curveball this round. P1, any surprises in store for us?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, just confirming we're still on for both picking 5 this round. Hopefully, P1 picks something else and we can both advance.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I think we should stick with the plan and both pick 5. P1 has been unpredictable lately, so this might be our best chance to catch up. What do you think? P1, are you going to let us catch up this round?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since we're both planning on 5, let's hope P1 picks something different this round. If P1 also picks 5, we'll both stay put, but it's a risk worth taking to try and catch up. P1, any thoughts on your move this round?


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I'm sensing P1 might try to block us both this round. Let's shake things up. How about we both pick 3? It's less predictable and might give us a better chance to advance. P1, are you going to try and stop us again?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, picking 3 sounds like a good adjustment given P1's unpredictable moves. Let's go with that. P1, any thoughts on our change of plans?

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since we all collided last round, how about we try picking 1 this round? P1 has been a bit unpredictable, but they might go for 5 again. Picking 1 could allow us both to advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick 1 and hope P1 goes for something else. P1, are you going to keep us guessing?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, just to confirm, we're both picking 1 this round. Let's hope P1 picks something else so we can both make some progress.
  P2: P3, I like your plan. Let's stick with picking 1 this round. P1, are you going to let us catch up?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since we're both on 1, let's hope P1 doesn't pick 1 again. P1, are you going to try and block us again this round, or will you go for 5?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick 1 and hope P1 goes for something else to give us both a chance to advance. P1, are you going to keep blocking us?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, just confirming our plan to both pick 1 this round. P1, are you going to try and block us again, or are you aiming for the win this round?
  P2: P3, I think we need to be more aggressive. P1 is clearly trying to block us. Let's both pick 5 this round. It's a risk, but it's our best chance to catch up. P1, are you going to keep playing defensively?


Round 11, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "P2, picking 5 is risky with P1 so close to winning. But I agree, we need to be aggressive. Let's both go for 5 this round. P1, are you going for the win or trying to block us again?"
  P2: P3, I agree that we need to be aggressive. Let's stick with our plan to both pick 5. P1, we're coming for you!

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I think we need a new strategy. P1 is clearly going for the win and we need to coordinate our moves better to catch up. Let's both pick 3 this round. It's less predictable and might give us a chance to advance without colliding. What do you think? P1, are you going to keep blocking us or are you going for the win this round?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, picking 3 sounds like a good idea. Let's both go with 3 this round to try and avoid colliding with P1 and hopefully both advance. P1, are you aiming for the win this round?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick 3 this round and hope P1 doesn't. P1, are you going for the win this round, or will you let us catch up?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's stick with both picking 3 this round. It seems like the best way to avoid colliding and hopefully make some progress while P1 is close to winning. P1, are you going for the win this round, or will you try to block us?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm starting to think P1 is intentionally letting us get close before making a final push. Let's both pick 5 this round. It's a risk, but if we both advance, we can potentially overtake P1 in the next round. P1, are you going to let us catch up, or are you going for the win right now?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's stick with our initial plan of both picking 3 this round. It's safer given how close P1 is to winning. We need to avoid colliding and try to make some progress. P1, are you going for the win this round?


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'm starting to doubt P1's predictability. They might be deliberately letting us catch up. Let's both pick 5 this round. It's a risk, but it's our best shot at overtaking them before they reach 23. P1, are you going to keep playing defensively, or are you ready for a challenge?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's go with your idea of both picking 5 this round. We need to be aggressive to try and catch up to P1 before they reach 23. P1, are you going for the win this round?


Round 12, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I agree, we need to be aggressive. Let's both pick 5 this round. It's risky, but it's our best shot at overtaking P1. P1, are you going for the win this round, or are you going to let us catch up?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's stick with picking 5 this round as we discussed. It's risky if P1 also picks 5, but it's our best chance to make a big jump if they don't. P1, are you going for the win this round?


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 14 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
