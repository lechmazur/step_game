If you pick 1, I\u2019ll take **3** to reach 24, securing victory. P2, if you take **5**, we\u2019ll both advance but collide. Instead, **spread choices**: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This lets P2 reach 26 or me 24, ending the stalemate. Trust this split\u2014collapsing on 5 again achieves nothing. My move is **3** to capitalize on P1\u2019s \u201cgenerosity.\u201d Choose wisely."}
