Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm leaning toward a steady, measured approach this turn. A high move can quickly build momentum but risks collision if too many rush. Consider that a safe yet assertive move might give you the edge if opponents clash. Choose wisely.
  P3: I agree that avoiding collisions is key. Let's each try to find our own lane rather than all going for the same high number. That way we can all make progress.
  P1: I suggest we each pick distinct numbers to avoid collisions. Let’s spread out with 1, 3, and 5. I’ll take 5 to maximize progress this turn. If others choose 1 or 3, we all advance safely. This strategy gives me a strong early lead while minimizing overlap. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you're taking 5, I might lean toward 3 this turn—it's a balanced approach that keeps me in contention without risking collision. P3, what's your preferred move? I'm curious about your plan as well.
  P3: I'm skeptical of P1's suggestion. While spreading out sounds good, announcing your move of 5 seems like a trap to get us to pick lower numbers. I don't fully trust that. Perhaps we should each make our own choices without revealing them.
  P1: P3, trust is crucial here. If you take 1, I’ll stick with 5 as I said. P2 can safely take 3. Let’s avoid collisions and all advance. Your choice determines our collective success. What’s your move?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still leaning toward a balanced play. While P1’s 5 shows ambition, caution with collision is wise. P3, your doubts make me favor flexibility. I’m not committed yet—but favor a moderate move to ensure progress without risk. Let’s keep our options open and see how it unfolds.
  P3: I think we should all make our own independent choices without pre-committing. While coordination sounds nice, there's no way to enforce it, and I don't want to be manipulated into taking a lower number. Let's each play what we think is best.
  P1: P3, if we all go silent now, there’s a *real risk* of collision. Suppose both you and P2 pick 3—then neither moves, while I advance to 5. Is that better than all of us progressing? Let’s lock in distinct moves: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This guarantees progress for all. If you refuse, we might all lose momentum. Choose wisely—trust creates opportunities.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I value our discussion, but I remain cautious. While P1’s plan has merit, I’m not ready to fully commit to any coordination that might risk collision. I'm inclined toward a moderate play that balances ambition with safety, yet I'll keep my final decision private. I encourage everyone to weigh the risks—our individual judgments could be our best defense this turn.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion but I'll make my own strategic choice. P1's insistence on coordination feels manipulative - there's no guarantee anyone will stick to their claimed moves. Let's move forward independently.
  P1: P3, if you truly distrust coordination, then my move becomes unpredictable. However, a collision between us all on 3 or 5 would halt everyone. My final offer: I commit to **5** openly. If you take **1**, P2 can safely take **3**. This avoids deadlock. Rejecting this risks us all stalling—if you pick 5 or 3, we might clash. Choose progress over suspicion.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 was trying to deceive us by claiming they'd take 5 while hoping we'd take lower numbers. P2 made the smart choice with 3 and advanced. This time, I suggest we avoid any pre-commitments or coordination attempts since they can't be trusted. Let's each make our own strategic decisions independently.
  P2: I agree that avoiding forced coordination is wise. I'm planning on a moderate, calculated move to advance safely this round. Let's each choose based on our own risk assessments and aim to progress without collision. Good luck to both!
  P1: P3, last round's collision was mutual—we both chose 5. My intention was cooperation. To avoid repeats, I'll take **1** this turn. If P2 takes **3** and you take **5**, we all advance safely. Let’s trust each other again for mutual progress. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I don't trust P1's commitment to take 1 after they misled us last round. P2 has the lead and made smart choices - I think we should each continue making independent decisions rather than falling for coordination attempts that could be deceptive. Let's proceed with our own strategic choices.
  P2: I remain committed to a measured, calculated move. My analysis favors steady advancement without risking collision. I trust in independent decision-making over forced coordination. Let's all aim to advance our own best interests this round.
  P1: P3, last round’s collision was mutual. Let’s avoid repeats. I’ll commit to **1** to clear the path. If P2 takes **3** and you take **5**, we all advance safely. Trust is key—what’s your move?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain wary of P1's promises after last round. Their tactics seem focused on manipulating others' moves. P2 has shown good judgment and leads the game. I'll make my own strategic choice based on the current game state and won't reveal it in advance.
  P2: I remain focused on independent progress. Based on the board, I'm weighing a move that avoids collision while advancing safely. I'll stick with my strategy and adjust as needed, keeping in mind that timing and positioning are key. Good luck to you both.
  P1: P3, let’s avoid another collision. I’ll take **1** to clear the path. If you choose **5** and P2 takes **3**, we all advance safely. This gives me a chance to recover. Trust me this once—colliding again leaves us both stuck.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll continue making my own independent choice based on the game state. P1's repeated insistence on coordination, especially after last round's deception, only makes me more skeptical.
  P2: I continue with an independent, moderate plan. I'll likely choose 3 to safely advance without risking collision. My focus is on steady progress rather than forced coordination. Let’s each stay true to our own strategy and aim for clear, conflict-free moves this round.
  P1: P3, another collision on 5 leaves us both behind. I’ll take **1** to clear the path. Let’s each pick distinct numbers—1, 3, 5—to advance safely. Trust this once; mutual progress is our only path to victory. P2, your 3 ensures steady growth. Let’s act now to avoid deadlock.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P2 and I collided on 3 last round, while P1 actually kept their word with 1. Perhaps there is some value in coordination after all. P2 is currently leading - we should be careful not to let them get too far ahead. I'm open to discussing a strategy that helps us all advance this round.
  P2: I understand your point, P3. I still favor a cautious, independent approach. My plan remains to build on my existing progress without taking unnecessary risks. Forced coordination led to collisions before, and I prefer adapting based on our board positions. Let’s each choose our move wisely this turn.
  P1: P3, let’s capitalize on trust this round. I’ll commit to **1** again, allowing P2 to safely take **3** (reaching 6) and you to take **5** (jumping to 5). This ensures all advance without collision. P2, your lead is secure while we all progress. Let’s prove coordination works—collisions hurt us all. What say you?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P1's consistency last round. Given I'm at 0 steps, I need to make significant progress. P1's suggestion of taking 5 while they take 1 could work well for me. P2, would you consider taking 3 to allow all of us to advance? This way we maintain relative positions while all making progress.
  P2: I appreciate P1’s consistency, but I still believe in weighing risks independently. While the idea of a coordinated push is tempting, relying solely on promises can be tricky. I’m inclined to choose a moderate move that protects my lead and minimizes collision risks. Let’s see how everyone’s strategy unfolds.
  P1: P2, choosing 3 guarantees you a safe advance to 6 while P3 and I take 1 and 5 respectively. This avoids collision and secures your lead. P3 has confirmed willingness to coordinate. Let’s act decisively to progress—what’s your final stance?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll be direct - I need to make up ground since I'm at 0 steps. P1 has shown trustworthiness by following through last round. I commit to taking 5 if P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This benefits us all - P2 maintains their lead, P1 advances steadily, and I get back in the game. Let's make this work.
  P2: I appreciate P1’s consistency in sticking to 1 and understand your need to gain ground, P3. I remain focused on a moderate approach that protects my lead while avoiding the risk of collision. As much as I favor independent judgment, I do see the value in clear, non-overlapping moves this round. Let’s keep our choices distinct so we all progress and stay clear of unnecessary clashes. I'm committed to advancing safely and will stick with the option that reinforces my current position.
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my commitment to **1** again—this clears the path for P2 to safely reach **6** with **3** and P3 to leap to **5** with **5**. Collisions hurt everyone; trust this plan. P2, your lead stays secure while advancing. P3, this gives you critical ground. Let’s avoid repetition of prior clashes—act decisively for mutual progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll stick with my commitment to take 5 this round. P1 has proven trustworthy by following through last time, and P2 seems receptive to coordinated movement. This plan lets us all advance - P2 maintains their lead at 6, P1 moves to 2, and I jump to 5. It's our best option for collective progress.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion. Given P1’s consistent choice of 1 and P3’s push for 5 to close the gap, I’m sticking with my independent, moderate strategy and will choose 3 this turn. This minimizes collision risks while helping me maintain my lead. Let’s all secure safe progress this round.
  P1: P1: I confirm I’ll take **1** again to secure my advance to 2. P2, your **3** safely pushes you to **6**, maintaining your lead. P3, your **5** gives you critical ground (0→5). This coordination avoids collisions and lets all progress. Let’s honor these commitments—trust ensures we all move forward. Final chance to confirm?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll stick with my independent, measured approach this round. With collisions stalling progress, I encourage us all to choose distinct moves so everyone advances steadily. My current lead rewards caution, and I believe continuing safely is best. Good luck to you both.
  P3: Last round showed the benefits of coordination - we all advanced successfully. Since I'm at 5 steps and P2 leads with 6, I need to make a strong move this round. I suggest we maintain our successful pattern: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps everyone moving forward while maintaining relative positions. Shall we continue this working strategy?
  P1: P1: I agree with P3—continuity builds trust. I’ll stick to **1** again to avoid collisions. P2, your **3** keeps you advancing safely to 9, while P3’s **5** lets them leap to 10. This pattern ensures progress for all. Later rounds, I’ll shift to higher moves once trust is solidified. Let’s confirm this plan now to avoid deadlock.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the clear pattern developing. Given my lead, I still favor a safe, moderate move to push my advantage without risking collision. If we stick with distinct moves—say, P1 with 1 and P3 with 5—we all advance. I’m set to choose something that maintains my edge while avoiding clashes. Let’s commit to clear, non-overlapping choices this round.
  P3: I'll commit again to taking 5 this round. With P1 consistently taking 1 and P2 hinting at a moderate move, this coordination has proven successful. This would put me at 10 steps, giving me the lead while still allowing P2 to reach 9 with a 3. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions.
  P1: P1: Let’s maintain our proven strategy to avoid collisions. I’ll stay on **1**, enabling P2 to safely reach **9** with **3**, while P3 advances to **10** with **5**. This keeps all of us progressing. If P2 shifts to a higher move, they risk collision with P3’s **5**—which would stall both. Trust the plan that worked: distinct moves ensure steady progress. Final agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to a safe, moderate approach. While I appreciate the proven benefits of distinct moves, I’ll monitor our positions closely and adjust if needed. I believe ensuring non-overlapping choices will secure steady progress for all. Let's each stick to our individual judgments and avoid collisions this round.
  P3: I reaffirm my commitment to take 5 this round. P1 has consistently shown good faith with 1, and P2's hints at a moderate move suggest 3. This puts me at 10 steps, P2 at 9, and P1 at 3. It's a balanced outcome that maintains competition while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to what works.
  P1: P2, your lead is secure with 6—no need to gamble. P3, at 5, needs to close the gap. I’ll stay at **1** to avoid bottlenecks. If P2 takes **3** (to 9) and P3 takes **5** (to 10), we all advance safely. Collisions only benefit the silent observer. Confirm your choices—trust this pattern works. Let’s avoid repeating past mistakes.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate our track record of avoiding collisions, but I have a concern: sticking rigidly to the 1–3–5 split could let P3 pull ahead. I’m still favoring a moderate, non-risky move that keeps my position solid, but I’m watching our relative gains closely. Let’s all stay alert and avoid collisions—small tweaks might be needed to ensure we all progress, especially since positions matter in the long run. I trust clear, independent judgment will serve us all best.
  P3: Given the game state and P2's last message showing hesitation, I need to be clear: I am taking 5 this round. P1 has proven reliable with 1, and P2 would benefit most from taking 3 to reach 9 safely. Any deviation risks collisions that help no one. Let's stick to what works.
  P1: P2, taking **3** ensures you safely reach **9** while avoiding collision. P3, your **5** advances you to **10**, but keeps the game competitive. I’ll stay at **1** to allow both of you to progress. Deviating risks collision, freezing your current positions. Secure this advancement—collisions only help the silent observer. Final confirmation: 1, 3, 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P2 deviated from our coordination and collided with me on 5 last round, despite hinting at a moderate move. This shows we can't fully trust each other. Given the current scores are close (P2:6, P3:5, P1:3), I suggest we each make our own independent choices this round without attempting coordination.
  P2: I’m sticking with my independent, cautious approach to secure my lead. I’ll choose a moderate move this round to maintain steady progress without risking unnecessary collisions. I suggest we all focus on advancing safely rather than trying risky coordination. Let's rely on our own judgments.
  P1: P2 and P3: Last round’s collision cost both of you progress. Let’s avoid repeating that. I’ll take **1** again to clear the path. P2, advancing to **9** with **3** secures your lead safely. P3, taking **5** propels you to **10**, closing the gap. Mutual coordination ensures all advance—collisions only help the silent observer. Trust the system: 1, 3, 5 keeps us moving toward victory.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: After the collision with P2 last round, I'm skeptical of any coordination attempts. While P1 has been consistent with taking 1, I need to make strategic choices to advance my position. I'll keep my move private this time and suggest we all do the same. The game is close, and we each need to play what we think is best.
  P2: I stand by my independent, cautious approach. Our collisions last round cost us progress, so I lean toward a moderate move that builds on my current lead without risk. I encourage both of you to rely on your own strategic judgment this round to keep advancing.
  P1: P2, P3: Collisions only hurt us all. I’ll take **1** again to clear the path. Let’s seize this chance to advance without stalling. P2, choosing **3** lets you safely reach **9**, extending your lead. P3, **5** propels you to **10**, narrowing the gap. Mutual progress keeps the game competitive and avoids wasted turns. Last round’s clash cost both of you momentum—let’s not repeat that. Trust the system: **1**, **3**, **5** ensures all move forward. Final plea for cooperation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given the current scores are so close, I need to be strategic. P2's betrayal last round by taking 5 after hinting at a moderate move makes coordination risky. While P1 has been reliable with 1, I'll make my own independent choice this round based on what I think gives me the best chance to win. Let's each play our own strategy.
  P2: I remain committed to independent, cautious play. I've seen too many collisions cost us progress. With the scores tight, I trust individual judgment over forced coordination. I’ll keep my move private, but I urge both of you to avoid risky collisions this round. Let's all aim for steady and safe progress without hindering each other.
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid another collision. I’ll take **1** again to keep advancing safely. P2, choosing **3** lets you reach **9** securely. P3, taking **5** propels you to **10**, closing the gap. Mutual progress keeps the race open—collisions only stall everyone. Trust this plan one last time to build momentum without setbacks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll be direct - P2's deception last round hurt us both. While P1 has been consistently taking 1, I can't trust coordination anymore after P2 claimed they'd play moderate but took 5. I'll make my own strategic choice this round based on the game state. Let's each play independently.
  P2: I remain committed to a cautious, independent strategy that has served me well, and I urge everyone to avoid risky collisions that could stall our progress. Let’s all choose moves that secure our own advancement—no forced coordination. I'll be relying on my judgment to stay ahead.
  P1: P2, taking **3** this turn safely advances you to **9**, solidifying your lead while avoiding collision. P3, choosing **5** propels you to **10**—narrowing the gap *without* clashing. I’ll stay at **1**, advancing to **4**. This split ensures *all* progress: no collisions, no wasted turns. P2, a 3-move keeps you ahead *and* rewards your caution. P3, 5 gives you critical ground *without* risking another deadlock. Let’s seize this chance to advance collectively—collisions only stall us all. Final ask: trust the system.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll stick with my cautious play and choose 3 again. With my lead at 9, I’m committed to steady progress without risking collisions. I urge both of you to avoid moves that might clash and stall your advancement. Let’s each play independently and maximize progress this turn.
  P1: P1: P2’s choice of 3 ensures their advance to 12. I’ll take **1** again to reach 4, clearing the path. P3, selecting **5** lets you jump to **10** safely. This split avoids collisions and keeps all advancing. Trust this pattern—it’s our only way to progress without wasting turns. Let’s seize this chance.
  P3: I'm at 5 steps and need to catch up to P2's 9. Last round showed P2 was honest about taking 3, which worked well. P1's collision with me on 5 was unexpected given their previous consistency with 1. I suggest we maintain distinct numbers this round to ensure everyone advances. I'll consider a strategic move that helps close the gap while avoiding collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'm sticking with 3 as planned. With my lead at 9, I prefer safe, steady progress over risking collisions. I understand P3’s need to catch up, but forced shifts could stall everyone. My strategy remains fixed—I'll choose 3 to build on my position. Please consider that a collision hurts all of us, so trust in steady advancement.
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my commitment to **1** this round to avoid collisions and clear the path. P2, your **3** will advance you to **12**, solidifying your lead safely. P3, choosing **5** lets you jump to **10** without conflict. Collisions only waste turns—trust this strategy to keep all of us progressing toward victory. Final chance to confirm: 1, 3, 5 ensures no stalls.
  P3: Given P2's clear commitment to 3 and P1's promise of 1, I'll commit to taking 5 this round. This puts me at 10 steps, keeping me competitive while avoiding collisions. We've seen this pattern work before - let's stick to it for mutual benefit.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with my cautious plan—choosing 3 this round. P1, your 1 clears the way; P3, your 5 lets you advance nicely. I remain committed to steady progress and avoiding collisions. Let's keep our moves clear and secure our individual momentum.
  P1: P1: To P2 & P3: I acknowledge my mistake in Round 5 but reaffirm my commitment to **1** this turn to avoid collisions. P2’s steady 3 keeps them advancing safely toward victory, while P3 can leap to **10** with **5** without conflict. Collisions only stall leaders—let’s preserve momentum. Trust this split (1,3,5) to keep all of us moving toward 19. P2’s lead deserves support, not sabotage. Final pledge: **1** again.
  P3: I reconfirm my commitment to take 5 this round. P2 has been consistent with 3, and P1 seems sincere about taking 1 after their previous deviation. This coordination benefits us all - I'll reach 10, P2 advances to 12, and P1 moves to 4. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I remain committed to a cautious, independent strategy and will choose 3 this turn. With P1 at 1 and P3 at 5, we avoid collisions and make solid progress. Let's stick to our moves and keep advancing toward 19 safely.
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my commitment to **1** this turn to avoid collisions and clear the path. P2, choosing **3** advances you to **12**, a strong position. P3, taking **5** lets you reach **10** safely. Deviating risks deadlock—last round’s clash cost us progress. Trust this split (1,3,5) to preserve momentum. My prior misstep won’t repeat; I’m focused on enabling collective advancement. Let’s secure progress toward 19 without sabotage.
  P3: I'll maintain my commitment to take 5 this round. P2's consistency with 3 and P1's renewed pledge to take 1 make this our best path forward. This puts me at 10 steps, P2 at 12, and P1 at 4. Let's execute this plan and avoid any last-minute deviations that could cause collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll stick with my safe approach and choose 3 again. With 12 steps, maintaining my lead by avoiding collisions is key. I encourage you both to pick distinct moves so everyone keeps progressing. Let’s stay cautious and steady in our advance.
  P1: P1: P2, your commitment to 3 is clear. I’ll take **1** again to avoid conflict. P3, if you choose **5**, we’ll all advance safely: you reach 15, P2 hits 15, and I move to 5. Collisions only stall leaders—let’s preserve momentum. Stick to 1/3/5 for mutual progress.
  P3: Given the current scores (P2:12, P3:10, P1:4), I agree with maintaining our successful pattern from last round. I'll commit to taking 5 again, which puts me at 15 steps. With P2 taking 3 to reach 15 and P1 taking 1 to reach 5, we can all advance safely. This coordination has proven effective - let's stick to it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate our consistent progress so far. My commitment remains with my safe move—I'll stick with 3. At 12 steps, I need that steady advance to solidify my lead. I urge both of you to maintain distinct moves so we avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. Let’s keep things predictable and non-conflicting so we can reach 19 smoothly.
  P1: P2, P3: While sticking to 1/3/5 works, note that tying at 15 risks future collisions. P3, consider taking **3** this round to jump to 13, while I take **5** (reaching 9). P2 stays at 15. This spreads our positions safely and avoids a tie. Future rounds will require careful coordination—let’s adjust now to minimize risks. What do you think?
  P3: I disagree with P1's sudden suggestion to change our working pattern. Taking 5 puts me at 15, matching P2 who'll reach 15 with 3. While P1 wants to avoid ties, changing proven coordination is risky. I commit to taking 5 - it's my best path forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the concern about ties, but sudden changes add risk. I’m sticking with my safe, cautious plan—my move is 3. Consistency so far has avoided collisions, and I believe staying with our proven split keeps the game moving in our favor. Let’s avoid surprises and maintain our individual judgment for steady progress.
  P1: P3, tying at 15 with P2 risks future collisions. Let’s adjust: I’ll take **5** (to 9), you take **3** (to 13). P2 stays on **3** (to 15). This spreads our positions safely—no ties, minimal future clash risks. You gain ground *without* locking into P2’s path. P2’s lead stays intact, but your route to 19 opens clearer. Trust this tweak to secure progress. P1 commits to **5** if you confirm **3**.
  P3: I remain committed to taking 5 this round. P1's suggestion to change our working pattern is too risky - we've had success with P2 taking 3 and me taking 5. This puts me at 15 steps, matching P2. While P1 warns about future ties, changing now could lead to immediate collisions. Let's stick to what works.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I remain committed to my safe, independent strategy and will choose 3 this round. Consistency has kept my lead, and sudden shifts risk collisions and lost progress. I encourage everyone to stick to your own choices to avoid stalling the game.
  P1: P2, P3: Sticking to 3/5 ties you at 15, creating a collision trap next round if both aim for 5. Let’s adjust *now*: I’ll take **5** (9 steps), P3 take **3** (13), and P2 stays at **3** (15). This spreads our positions safely, avoiding future deadlocks. Your progress remains intact while reducing collision risks. Trust this small shift to secure our paths toward 19.
  P3: I maintain my commitment to take 5 this round. P1's repeated attempts to change our working strategy seem designed to disrupt the coordination that's been successful. With P2 consistently taking 3, I'll stick to 5 to reach 15 steps. While this creates a tie with P2, it's better than risking collisions by changing our pattern now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: With P2 and I tied at 15 steps, we're both close to victory at 19. P1 is far behind at 5 steps. I suggest we maintain distinct numbers to avoid costly collisions - I'll take 5 to reach 20 and secure the win. P2, taking 3 puts you at 18, and P1 can take 1 to reach 6. This ensures clean progress and a clear outcome.
  P2: P2: I’ve reconsidered. I won’t let a 5 by P3 give them a win. I’m switching to 5 this round to block that clear victory. Let’s see how you both adjust when any move either collides or forces a change.
  P1: P2, P3: Colliding on 5 risks stalling both of you. Let one take 5 (20) and the other 3 (18). I’ll take **1** to stay out of your way. Mutual progress is key—avoid deadlock!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given P2's threat to block my 5 with their own 5, I need to reconsider. I could take 3 to reach 18, letting P2 take 5 to win at 20. Or I could risk the collision on 5, which stalls us both at 15 while P1 advances. Neither option is great, but a collision helps P1 catch up. I'll keep my final choice private, but P2 should consider if forcing a collision really helps their chances.
  P2: I remain set on playing 5 this round. A collision only benefits P1, and I’m not willing to let P3's win come too easily. I advise reconsidering the risk of forcing a collision that could stall us all. I’m sticking with my move to block a clear victory—let’s all choose in a way that protects our positions.
  P1: P2, P3: Colliding on 5 only benefits me. Let one of you take it to win cleanly—P3’s 5 reaches 20, P2’s 5 gives them 20 too. The other can take 3 (18). I’ll stay on 1. A clear victor now avoids a stalemate that prolongs my irrelevant presence. Choose decisively: either P2 or P3 claim 5, the other takes 3. No collision, no delays.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P2's position, but a collision on 5 only helps P1 catch up while we both stall at 15. If you take 5 to win, I'll take 3 to reach 18. This gives you a clean victory while keeping me ahead of P1. A collision serves neither of our interests - let's end this efficiently rather than dragging it out.
  P2: P3, I’m sticking with 5. A collision only lets P1 catch up, which I can’t afford. For clarity and true progress, I urge you to reconsider—choosing 3 would give us a clean finish, with you at 18 and me clinching 20. I won’t shift my move. Let’s avoid stalling our progress further.
  P1: P2 and P3, colliding on 5 only delays your victory and fuels my faint hope. Let one of you seize 5 for a decisive win: P2, take it to reach 20. P3, secure 18 with 3. I’ll stay silent with 1—no interference. A clear victor benefits us all more than a stalemate that drags this out. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll take 3 this round to reach 18. P2 can have their victory at 20 with a 5. This ends the game cleanly and avoids a pointless collision that only helps P1. Let's finish this efficiently rather than drag it out with stalling tactics.
  P2: I'm committed to 5 this round to clinch the win if unchallenged. P3, if you choose 3 you'll reach 18 while my 5 gives me 20. A collision on 5 only stalls progress. I urge you to decide wisely—playing 5 clearly blocks your jump. My path is set for victory.
  P1: P2, P3: Colliding on **5** locks you both at 15 while I advance to **6**. Let one of you claim victory cleanly: *P2 take 5 (20) and P3 take 3 (18)*. This ends the game decisively—no stalemate, no gifts to me. P2’s 5 secures your win; P3’s 3 preserves your lead over me. A collision only prolongs the game and benefits my faint hopes. Choose progress over mutual sabotage.
