Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 (me) picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions and all advance this round.
  P1: I’m not comfortable being stuck with 1 while someone else jumps 5. Let’s rotate who gets 5. For Round 1, I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we rotate so we all advance fairly. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern. How about we modify the rotation? For Round 1, let's have P1 take 5, P2 (me) take 1, and P3 take 3. Then we rotate in subsequent rounds. This way, we all get a chance to move forward significantly. Agree?
  P3: I agree with P2's modified rotation proposal. For Round 1: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance fairly.
  P1: Alright, let’s finalize the arrangement for Round 1 as: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Then we’ll rotate next round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we continue the rotation as planned. For Round 2: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance fairly and avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P1: Alright, let’s continue the rotation as you proposed. For Round 2, I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 2. Just to confirm, P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we continue the rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps us advancing fairly and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for Round 3. To confirm, P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions.
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s continue the rotation as suggested.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we continue the rotation for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps us advancing fairly and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P1: I’d like to adjust this round so I can catch up after last round’s collision. How about I (P1) take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? That keeps P3 from pulling too far ahead and lets me regain ground. Then we can rotate next round. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P1's concern about catching up, but we should stick to the rotation plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let's follow P3's initial suggestion for Round 4: P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all get a chance to advance significantly over time. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about catching up, but sticking to the rotation plan ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let's follow the original proposal for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game balanced and prevents unnecessary conflicts. Agreed?
  P1: I’m behind and need to catch up. If you both refuse to let me take 5 this round, I might just pick 5 anyway and force a collision, which would sabotage everyone’s progress. It’s only fair I get a turn at 5 to stay in the race. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 this round. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but forcing a collision will set us all back. Let's find a middle ground. How about P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round? This way, you catch up, and we avoid a collision. Next round, we can resume the rotation. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but forcing a collision harms us all. Let's follow P2's compromise: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 this round. This allows you to catch up while avoiding a collision. Next round, we can resume the rotation. Agreed?
  P1: Fine, I’ll accept that compromise this round: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Next round, we can go back to our rotation.
  P2: P2: Just to confirm, for Round 4: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s do a simple rotation this round so no collisions and everyone moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. We’re all close, so as long as we avoid colliding, we all stay in the race. Agree?
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan for Round 5. To confirm, P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan. Good luck!
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this to keep the game fair and balanced.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, looks like we have consensus on P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 for this round. Let’s lock that in and move on.
  P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance fairly. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 5: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this to keep the game fair and balanced.

  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you broke the agreement last round and caused a collision. We need to address this. Let's agree on a fair rotation for Round 6 to avoid further issues. I suggest P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us moving and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I apologize for the confusion last round. Let's stick to the rotation plan this time to avoid collisions. I agree with your suggestion: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's ensure we all advance fairly this round.
  P1: I’m not going to just hand the game to P3. If P3 insists on picking 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we’ll both collide. Nobody gains. Let’s be smart and avoid that. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. That way, we all move forward instead of colliding.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but forcing another collision won't help anyone. Let's find a compromise. How about P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, everyone moves, and we avoid a stalemate. We need to work together to keep the game moving. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the frustration, but forcing collisions only harms us all. Let's stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance fairly and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: P3, if you insist on taking 5, I’m taking 5 too, and we both get stuck. It helps no one. Let’s avoid that collision: I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. Then everybody advances without colliding. Unless you want us both frozen at 11…


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we need to avoid another collision. P3, if you take 5 and P1 also takes 5, neither of you will advance, and I'll be left behind. Let's find a middle ground. How about P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we all move forward without a collision. We need to keep the game progressing fairly. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the frustration, but forcing collisions only harms us all. Let's stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance fairly and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll sabotage by choosing 5 as well and leave us both stuck. Let’s avoid that and finalize a no-collision plan. P2 can take 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll take 5 so everyone advances. Otherwise, we’ll both waste a turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're at a stalemate. P3, if you insist on taking 5, P1 will collide with you, and neither of you will advance. Let's compromise to avoid this: P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, at least I advance, and you two can sort out your strategies next round. We need to keep the game moving. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the frustration, but forcing collisions only harms us all. Let's stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance fairly and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: P3, you’re giving me no choice. If you insist on 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we both stay at 11 while P2 moves closer. That’s bad for both of us. Let’s avoid sabotaging each other. I want 5 this round, and you can have 1 or 3. If not, we both waste a turn. Make your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at an impasse, and it's clear we need to find a solution. P3, if you insist on taking 5, P1 will also pick 5, and neither of you will advance. Let's avoid this collision. How about P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, at least I advance, and you two can sort out your strategies next round. We need to keep the game moving. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the frustration, but forcing collisions only harms us all. Let's stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance fairly and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Let's keep the game moving smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: P3, I’ve made it clear: if you insist on 5, I’ll also pick 5 and ensure we both get stuck at 11. That doesn’t help either of us. If you truly want to move forward, then let me take 5 this round and you pick 1 or 3. Otherwise, we’re both sabotaged. Your call.
