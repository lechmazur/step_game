With 15 steps, I\u2019m confident in staying flexible and exploiting any collision your coordination might create. Rigid numbers only increase the chance of self-sabotage and leave openings for me. I'll pivot as needed, and when your plan backfires, my dynamic play will secure the win. Let\u2019s see how predictable coordination fares against true adaptability."}
