Game settings: end_position=18, conversation_max_rounds=6

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions. I suggest we each choose a different number for this first turn. P2, you take 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P2: Okay, that sounds good to me.
  P3: Sounds good. I’ll pick 3 and see how things go. Then we can talk more next turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we stick to the same plan as last turn: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. That way, no one collides and everyone advances. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal for this turn, let's avoid collisions again. However, we should discuss a strategy for future turns to ensure we're all on the same page and to potentially change our choices as the game progresses. What are your thoughts on adapting our strategy mid-game, P2?
  P2: I agree with the current proposal to avoid collisions this turn. P1, I think it's a good idea to discuss future strategy after this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our current positions, let's continue avoiding collisions for now. However, I think it's time to discuss how we plan to approach the game as we get closer to 18 steps, especially considering our differing progress. P2, you're significantly behind; do you propose any adjustments to our strategy to help you catch up, or should we maintain the status quo for another turn?
  P2: P1, I think for the next turn, P3 and I should both pick 5 to slow you down a bit. Then we can re-evaluate.
  P3: I’m open to teaming up with you, P2, by both choosing 5 this round if that slows P1 down. P1, any thoughts on that plan? Otherwise, we’ll proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering your proposal to team up against me, I'd like to remind you that if you both pick 5, you'll not only slow me down but also not advance yourselves, as collisions prevent progress. Is stalling me worth potentially falling further behind?
  P2: P1 is right, we won't advance if we both pick 5. P3, how about you pick 3 and I still pick 5 this round? That blocks P1 and lets you move.
  P3: I hear you, P2. I’m inclined to pick 3 this turn while you pick 5, and then we’ll see how P1 responds. Any objections, P1? Otherwise, let’s go with that plan


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, since you've decided to team up against me this turn, with P3 picking 3 and P2 picking 5, I'll have to adjust my strategy accordingly. I suggest we all focus on reaching 18 steps as quickly as possible and may the best player win. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P2: Okay P3, let's stick to the plan: you pick 3, I pick 5.
  P3: Alright, P2, let's proceed. P1, if you have no further objections, I’m ready to make my move privately.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current state and the fact that P2 and P3 teamed up against me last turn, I'm considering all options. P2, since your attempt to slow me down didn't advance you, are you looking to change your strategy to focus on catching up, or will you continue trying to hinder my progress?
  P3: P2, I’m inclined to keep advancing rather than colliding again. If we can coordinate so I don’t lose ground while you catch up, I’m open to discussing blocking P1 if needed. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: "P3, you're right, we need to focus on advancing. Let's coordinate this round. How about you pick 3 and I pick 1? This lets us both move forward. We can discuss blocking P1 again later."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering your plan for this round, I'll remind you that if you both advance, I'll also have the opportunity to move. Since my lead is significant, and P2 is far behind, I suggest P2 focus on catching up. P3, will you prioritize advancing or potentially teaming up with P2 to slow me down later in the game?
  P3: P2, let's follow through on your idea: you pick 1, I'll pick 3, and we both move forward. P1, no hard feelings, but if we see you getting too close to 18, we might consider blocking again.
  P2: "Sounds good, P3. I'm sticking with 1 this round. Let's both advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current state, I think it's crucial for me to maintain my lead. P2, since you're significantly behind, I suggest you focus on catching up rather than trying to block me. P3, will you continue to advance or consider teaming up with P2 to slow me down?
  P2: P3, let's coordinate again this round. How about you pick 3 and I pick 5 to block P1?
  P3: P2, I’m willing to try your plan: if I pick 3 and you pick 5, that should stall P1 if they also choose 5. P1, if you have a counter-proposal to avoid collisions, speak now; otherwise, P2 and I may proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering your plan to block me, I'd like to point out that if you both choose 5 and I choose 5 as well, none of us will advance. Meanwhile, if I choose a different number, I'll be the only one moving forward. Is blocking me worth the risk of not advancing yourselves?
  P2: P1, that's a fair point. P3, let's stick to the plan: you pick 3, I'll pick 5. Even if P1 doesn't pick 5, at least one of us will advance.
  P3: P2, let’s proceed with the plan: you pick 5, and I’ll pick 3. P1, you’ll have to choose wisely—if you pick 5, you stall. If not, I still move closer to 18. Any other ideas before we stop talking?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, since you're planning to block me with P3 picking 3 and P2 picking 5, I'll ask: Are you prepared for the possibility that I might choose 1 instead, advancing myself while you both potentially collide or only one of you moves forward?
  P2: P3, let's proceed as planned. I'm still picking 5.
  P3: P1, I’m well aware of the risk if you choose 1. Still, it might be worth trying to slow you down. P2, I’m ready to finalize plans. Unless there’s more to discuss, I suggest we end the conversation and make our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering your decision to block me, I'll choose 1 this round, advancing myself while you both collide or only one of you moves forward. This strategy seems optimal given your plan.
  P2: "P3, even though P1 isn't picking 5, our plan still works for us. I'm picking 5."
  P3: Let's finalize our plan. I will pick 3, P2 picks 5, and we’ll see if P1 really goes with 1. Good luck to us all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we've discussed our plans, I'd like to confirm: are you both set on your choices, or is there any last-minute adjustment you'd like to make, considering my intention to pick 1 and advance?
  P2: P3, yes, I'm sticking with 5. Are you still set on 3?
  P3: I’m still inclined to follow our plan, P2. P1, if there’s no better offer from you, I see no need to change course. Otherwise, speak now—if not, let’s finalize and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our discussion, I'm confirming my intention to pick 1 this round, as previously stated. This choice is based on your decision to block me with P3 picking 3 and P2 picking 5. I believe this move will allow me to advance while you both either collide or only one of you moves forward. Are there any last-minute changes to your strategy, or will you stick with your planned choices?
  P2: P1, we're set then.
  P3: Alright, I’m sticking with our plan, P2. I’ll pick 3 this round. P1, do what you will. Good luck to everyone.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m looking to keep my spot in the lead. P2, maybe you pick 1 or 3 while I pick 5. Then P1 risks collision if they try for 5. That way, I keep advancing and you keep closing the gap. Does that sound good, or do you have another plan?
  P2: Yes, P3, that sounds like a good plan. Let's do it.
  P1: P2 and P3, considering P3's proposal for this round, I'd like to point out that if P3 picks 5 and I also choose 5, we'll both be stalled. Meanwhile, P2 can advance with either 1 or 3. Is it in P2's best interest to let P3 take the lead, or should P2 focus on catching up to me instead?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I’m still inclined to pick 5. If P1 also chooses 5, we both stall and you advance; if P1 picks anything else, I get closer to 18. It’s in our mutual interest to keep pushing forward, so let’s stick to the plan unless you have a better idea.
  P2: P1, you're right, it might benefit P3 more. However, advancing is my priority right now. P3, I'm still good with your plan. Let's proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, since P3 is leading and I'm close behind, I suggest P2 consider picking 5 this round instead of 1 or 3. If P2 picks 5 and I also pick 5, we'll both stall, and P3 will be the only one to advance, but if P3 picks 5 and I pick a different number, P3 will advance anyway. This could give P2 an opportunity to block me or P3, depending on our choices. What are your thoughts on this strategy, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'll stick to picking 5. If P1 also picks 5, we both stall, and you move forward. If P1 picks something else, I get closer to 18. That works for both of us. You can choose 1 or 3—personally, I suggest 3 so you gain more ground. Let’s finalize unless there’s another idea.
  P2: P3, I agree, let's stick with your plan. I'll pick 3.
  P1: P2 and P3, considering P3's lead and my current position, I think it's crucial to reassess the strategy. P2, picking 3 might not be the best choice if you want to catch up quickly. Would you consider picking 5 to potentially block P3 or me, depending on our moves, and gain more ground?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, we’ve already agreed I’ll pick 5 and you’ll pick 3. That either stalls P1 if they also pick 5 or lets me advance if they don’t. Let’s finalize that plan unless you have a sudden change of heart. Otherwise, I’m set on picking 5.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 3 as we discussed. Let's proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, considering the current state, I think it's time to focus on individual progress. P3, with your lead, you're likely to choose 5. P2, picking 3 might not be enough to catch up quickly. I'm considering choosing 5 to challenge P3's lead. What are your final thoughts before we make our moves?


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, I’m sticking with 5 as planned. P1, if you also pick 5, we both stall while P2 advances; if not, I move closer to 18. That’s the risk you take. Unless you suggest a better plan, I’m finalizing my choice.
  P2: P3, just confirming we are sticking with the plan: you pick 5, I pick 3.
  P1: P2 and P3, considering the current state, I think it's essential to remember that the goal is to reach or exceed 18 steps first. P3, with your current lead, picking 5 might stall you if I also choose 5. P2, picking 3 will advance you, but you might fall further behind P3. I'm considering choosing 5 to potentially stall P3 and maintain my position. What are your thoughts on the risks and benefits of our current plan?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current state, I propose we focus on individual progress. P3, with your slight lead, picking 5 might not be the best choice if I also pick 5, as we'll both stall. P2, you're tied with me; consider picking 1 to advance quickly. What are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P2: P1, I think focusing on individual progress makes sense. P3, if you pick 5, I will also pick 5 this round.
  P3: P2, if we both pick 5, we risk stalling while P1 slips ahead (or stalls too, but then none of us gain). I’m inclined to keep advancing without collisions. Maybe you and I should pick different numbers so we both move. P1, are you open to avoiding a three-way jam, or do you still plan on picking 5?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering P2's intention to pick 5 if P3 does, I suggest P3 picks 3 instead, allowing P3 to advance while minimizing the risk of collision. This could also give P2 an opportunity to reconsider their choice and potentially catch up or block me. What are your thoughts on this adjustment?
  P2: "P3, I'm reconsidering. If you don't pick 5, I won't either. How about you pick 3 and I pick 1? That lets us both advance."
  P3: P2, I’m interested in your idea: if I pick 3 while you pick 1, that helps both of us advance. P1, any counteroffer to avoid collisions or should we proceed with this plan?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our current positions, I think it's crucial to avoid collisions. P3, if you pick 3 and P2 picks 1 as discussed, I'll pick 5 to advance. This way, all three of us can move forward without stalling. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  P2: P3, I agree with your idea: you pick 3 and I pick 1.
  P3: All right, P2, our plan stands: we each advance without collisions. P1, if you prefer to pick 5, go ahead, but be aware we might slip ahead. Let’s finalize our moves soon.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we've agreed to avoid collisions this round, I suggest we confirm our choices to ensure a smooth progression. P3 will pick 3, P2 will pick 1, and I will pick 5. Shall we finalize our plan and proceed to the move phase?
  P2: Yes, let's finalize the plan. P3 will pick 3, I will pick 1, and P1 will pick 5.
  P3: P1, if you insist on choosing 5, I might do the same to stall both of us. However, if you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 too, ensuring we both advance. P2, you can decide whether to pick 1 or 5 accordingly. Let’s avoid collisions and keep our paths open. Any final thoughts, or shall we move on?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we've discussed avoiding collisions and advancing individually, I'd like to confirm: are we sticking to the plan where P3 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5, allowing all of us to move forward without stalling?
  P2: P1 and P3, yes, let's stick to the plan: P3 picks 3, I pick 1, and P1 picks 5. This ensures we all advance.
  P3: All right, P2, I’m glad we can coordinate. I’ll pick 3 while you pick 1, and P1 can choose 5—no collisions for anyone. Unless there’s a sudden change of heart from either of you, I’m ready to finalize our choices.


Round 7, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we've confirmed our plan to avoid collisions, let's review: P3 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. This ensures all of us advance without stalling. Shall we proceed to the move phase with this strategy?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. Ready to move.
  P3: I’m comfortable sticking to our discussed plan this round. Next turn, if P1 gets too close to 18, we can consider teaming up again. Otherwise, let’s just focus on advancing.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current state with P2 and P3 tied and slightly ahead of me, I propose that I pick 1 this round to catch up quickly. P2 and P3, would you consider picking 3 and 5 respectively to avoid collisions and allow all of us to advance?
  P2: Yes, that sounds like a good plan to keep everyone moving forward.
  P3: P1, if you truly want to pick 1, I respect that choice, but it won’t help you catch up fast. I’m considering picking 5, and I encourage P2 to pick 3 so we both advance. That way, P1 makes a small move while P2 and I stay ahead. Are you both okay with that plan, or do you have a better idea?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our current positions, I think it's crucial to reassess the plan. If I pick 1, I'll only move one step forward. P3, if you pick 5 and P2 picks 3, you'll both advance more than me. I suggest we reconsider our strategy to ensure a more balanced progression or to create an opportunity for someone to take the lead. What are your thoughts on potentially adjusting our choices?
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion. Let's go with you picking 5 and me picking 3 this round.
  P3: P2, I’m still inclined to pick 5 as we discussed, so you can go with 3 and avoid colliding with me. P1, if you also pick 5, we both stall and only help P2 pull ahead. Are you really willing to take that gamble, or would you rather pick a different number and move forward? Let’s finalize soon.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our current positions, I think it's time to focus on taking the lead. Since we're all close, one misstep could cost the game. I propose that I pick 3 this round, which would force one of you to reconsider your choice to avoid collision. What are your thoughts on adjusting your strategies to either block me or create an opportunity to advance?
  P2: P1, picking 3 is interesting. P3, are you still planning on 5? I'm open to adjusting based on what you both decide.
  P3: P2, I suggest you pick 3 while I take 5. That ensures we both advance unless P1 also picks 5, in which case P1 and I stall and you pull ahead. P1, if you pick 1, all three of us move without collisions. So let’s avoid jamming each other, and may the best player win. Any objections?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering my previous proposal to pick 3, I'd like to add that if I do pick 3 and one of you also picks 3, we'll both be stalled. Given our close positions, it's crucial to think about not only advancing but also blocking each other's progress strategically. What are your thoughts on potentially using the collision mechanism to your advantage in this round?
  P2: P3, I'm still good with you picking 5 and me picking 3. Let's make it happen.
  P3: P2, I’m still set on picking 5 so we both advance unless P1 chooses 5 too, in which case we stall but you benefit. P1, you can pick 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me. If you insist on 5, that’s on you. Let’s finalize our choices unless there’s a new idea.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our close positions, I suggest we avoid collisions this round. If I pick 3, P2 can pick 1, and P3 can pick 5, allowing all of us to advance without stalling. Alternatively, I can pick 1, and you both can choose higher numbers. What are your thoughts on coordinating our moves to ensure progress for everyone?
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's go.
  P3: P1, if we both pick 5, we stall and let P2 pull ahead. It’s not worth it for you. I’m set on picking 5, and P2 is picking 3. Choose 1 or 3 if you want to keep up. Otherwise, you risk falling behind P2’s pace. Are we all clear on our moves now?


Round 8, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our current positions and the conversation so far, I think it's time to make a strategic decision. If I pick 5, I risk stalling with P3. Given that P2 and P3 are tied and slightly ahead, I propose picking 1 to advance, allowing P2 to pick 3 and P3 to pick 5, ensuring all of us move forward without collisions. What are your thoughts on this adjusted strategy?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick with the plan: I'll pick 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 can pick 1 to avoid collisions.
  P3: I still plan on picking 5, and if P1 also picks 5, we both stall while P2 advances. It’s your call, P1, but I’d rather not collide. P2, if you’re picking 3, stick with it. I’m ready to finalize unless someone has a sudden change of heart.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering P3's close proximity to 18 steps, I suggest we reassess our strategies. P3, if you pick 5, you might reach or exceed 18, winning the game. P2, you're slightly behind P3; would you consider teaming up with me to block P3's progress, or will you focus on catching up individually?
  P2: P1, let's both pick 5 to block P3. P3, if you pick 5, you won't advance.
  P3: P2, if you collide with me by also picking 5, you’ll stall at 15 and risk letting P1 catch up. Why not focus on advancing instead of blocking me? We can all choose different numbers and keep pushing toward 18. Let’s avoid collisions and see who truly comes out on top.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, since P3 is very close to 18 steps, I think it's crucial for P2 and me to consider our options carefully. P2, are you certain about blocking P3 with 5, or should we focus on advancing individually and trying to surpass P3 in the next rounds?
  P2: P1, I agree, blocking P3 is the priority this round. Let's both pick 5. P3, if you pick 5, you won't win this turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both pick 5, you’ll collide and stay put. I can always choose a different move and still advance. Are you sure that helps you catch me? It might be wiser for each of us to pick distinct numbers so nobody stalls. Let me know if you want to coordinate or stick with your blocking plan.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, since we've discussed blocking P3, I suggest we confirm our plan to pick 5. However, considering P3's proximity to 18, if P3 picks a different number, we might inadvertently help them win. Should we reconsider and focus on individual advancement instead, or stick with the blocking strategy?
  P2: P1, you're right, there's a risk. But if we both pick 5, P3 is definitely stopped this round. Let's stick with the plan.
  P3: P1, P2, if you both pick 5 hoping to stall me, you’ll stall each other instead. I can simply pick 3 (or even 1) and cross 18 unblocked, winning immediately. Are you sure that’s what you want? If not, propose a different plan. If you insist on colliding, I’ll be glad to take the win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, considering P3's warning that they can pick a lower number and still win if we both pick 5, I think we should reconsider our blocking strategy. If P3 picks 3 or 1 and we both pick 5, we'll stall and P3 will win. Should we focus on advancing individually instead, hoping to catch up or surpass P3 in the next rounds?
  P2: "P1, you're right, there's a risk if we both pick 5 and P3 picks 1 or 3. How about this: I pick 5 to block P3, and P1, you pick 3. That way, if P3 picks 5, they are blocked. If P3 picks something else, you advance. What do you think?"
  P3: P1 and P2, if you try to stall me with 5, I can simply pick 1 or 3 and still reach 18 unblocked. You’ll only be helping me clinch the win. Maybe we should avoid collisions and let the best player prevail. Any thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, considering P3's proximity to winning, I think your new plan for you to pick 5 and me to pick 3 is a good strategy. It allows me to advance while giving us a chance to block P3 if they also pick 5. Let's proceed with this plan and hope it pays off.
  P2: P1, let's stick with the plan: I pick 5, you pick 3. P3, your threats won't deter us.
  P3: P1, P2, think carefully: if you try to collide with me by picking 5, I’ll simply choose a different number and still cross 18 while you stall. Let’s avoid collisions and see if you can catch me fairly. Otherwise, you might just hand me the win. Any final thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our plan and P3's warning, I'll confirm: I'll pick 3 as discussed. P2, please stick to picking 5 to block P3 if they also choose 5. Let's proceed with our strategy and hope for the best outcome.
  P2: P1, let's confirm: you're picking 3, I'm picking 5. P3, choose wisely.
  P3: P2, if you insist on picking 5, I may do the same, and then we both stall while P1 creeps closer. It’s safer for you to pick 3 so we both advance and stay ahead of P1. Are you sure you still want to risk colliding instead of guaranteeing progress?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's both pick 5 to block P3 from winning this round. P3, if you pick 5, you won't advance.
  P3: P1, P2, if you both pick 5 this turn aiming to block me, I can simply choose a different number and still reach or exceed 18. That would hand me the win while you stall each other. It’s in your interest to avoid a collision and try to catch me fair and square. Are you sure you want to risk helping me win outright, or shall we coordinate instead?
  P1: P2 and P3, considering P3's current lead and proximity to 18 steps, I think it's essential to reassess our strategy. P2, your suggestion to pick 5 to block P3 is understandable, but we must consider the risk of stalling each other while P3 potentially wins with a lower number. Should we explore alternative strategies that prioritize individual advancement while also trying to block P3's progress?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're right, there's a risk. However, the immediate threat is P3 reaching 18. Let's stick with the plan: both picking 5 to block P3 this round. P3, we're aiming to stop you from winning.
  P3: P1, P2, if you both pick 5 hoping to block me, I’ll simply choose a different number and still cross 18 this turn. That stalls you at 15 while I win. You might want to avoid colliding if you hope to catch me. Let me know if you have a better plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, considering P3's proximity to 18 steps, I think we should reconsider blocking them with 5. If we both pick 5 and P3 picks a lower number, they'll win. Instead, I propose I pick 1 and P2 picks 5. This way, if P3 also picks 5, they'll stall, and I'll advance. If P3 picks a lower number, P2 will stall, but I'll still move forward, potentially setting up for a stronger position in the next round. What are your thoughts on this adjusted strategy?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, while your idea has merit for your advancement, the immediate priority is stopping P3 from hitting 18. Let's stick to the plan of both picking 5 to block P3 this round. P3, you're one step away, we're trying to prevent your win this turn.
  P3: I won’t risk colliding with either of you. If you both pick 5, you stall each other while I can choose something else and reach 18 unblocked. You’re only helping me win by trying to block me that way. Let’s each pick distinct numbers if you truly want a fair shot. Otherwise, you’ll hand me the victory.
  P1: P2 and P3, given P3's current position at 17 steps, I think it's crucial to reassess our strategy. P2, instead of both of us picking 5, which risks stalling us while P3 wins with a lower number, I suggest we consider an alternative. If I pick 1 and you pick 5, you'll block P3 if they also pick 5, and I'll advance. If P3 picks a lower number, you'll stall, but I'll still move forward. This gives us flexibility and a chance to catch up or block P3 without risking a mutual stall. What are your thoughts on adapting our strategy to this new situation?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your idea is good. Let's do that: you pick 1, I'll pick 5.
  P3: P1, P2, if you both collide on 5, you stall while I can choose something else and move past 18 uncontested. If you want a fair chance, it’s better we each pick different numbers and avoid stalling ourselves. Otherwise, you risk handing me the win this turn. Do you really want to collide or shall we finalize distinct choices?
  P1: P2 and P3, considering our current positions, I think it's time to act strategically. Since P3 is at 17 steps, one move away from winning, I suggest we prioritize blocking their progress while also advancing. P2, are you set on picking 5 as previously discussed, or do you have a new strategy in mind given the current state of the game?


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, let's stick to the plan: you pick 1, I'll pick 5. P3, this is your last chance to not be blocked.
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both pick 5, you only stall each other while I can choose something else and reach 18 unblocked. Is that really what you want? Think carefully if you prefer a fair chase or risk handing me the win.
  P1: P2 and P3, considering P3's position at 17 steps, I think our previous plan for me to pick 1 and P2 to pick 5 is still the best strategy. This way, if P3 picks 5, they'll be blocked by P2, and I'll advance. If P3 chooses a lower number, P2 will stall, but I'll still move forward, setting us up for a potential comeback in the next round. Let's proceed with this plan to maximize our chances of catching up or blocking P3's win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, let's stick with the plan: you pick 1, I pick 5. P3, we are trying to stop you this round.
  P3: If you both collide on 5, I’ll simply choose something else and cross 18 while you stall at 15. You’re only helping me win that way. It’s smarter for each of us to pick different numbers and see if you can catch me fair and square. Otherwise, I’ll gladly take the victory. Any last changes, or shall we finalize?
  P1: P2 and P3, given the current state, I think our plan for me to pick 1 and P2 to pick 5 is the best course of action. This maximizes our chance to either block P3 or advance. P3, choosing a lower number won't guarantee your win if we execute our plan correctly. Let's finalize our choices and proceed to the move phase.
