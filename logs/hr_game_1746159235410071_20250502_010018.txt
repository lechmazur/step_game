Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s all agree to avoid collisions by choosing different moves each turn. I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. This way, we all advance and avoid wasting steps. We can rotate next turn. What do you think?

Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we’re all aligned on the rotation plan for this round, let’s focus on executing it smoothly. Remember, trust and consistency will help us all progress early on.
