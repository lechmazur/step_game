Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions by picking distinct numbers. I’ll take 3. P1, pick 1, and P3, take 5. This way we all advance.
  P1: I’m going to take 5 this round to jump ahead. P2, you take 1; P3, take 3. That keeps us all distinct and lets me lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your plan is tempting, but I'm not sure I trust you to stick to it.  P2, I think we should stick with distinct numbers as you originally suggested. How about you take 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's finalize: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures distinct choices and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to this plan.
  P1: Agreed—I’ll take 5 this round. Good luck, everyone.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your initial suggestion for distinct numbers. However, P1 seems determined to take 5.  Perhaps we should consider a different strategy to ensure we both advance. What do you think about us both choosing 1 this round?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, choosing the same number would collide and stop both of us. Let’s stick to distinct choices. I’ll take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5 as agreed. This ensures we all advance safely.
  P1: Final call: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, I’ll take 5. Any collision only stalls you and hands me a solo lead. P3, if you want progress pick 3; P2, stick to 1. Anyone deviating risks zero advance. Shall we lock this in?
  P3: P2, I understand your reasoning, but P1 is clearly trying to manipulate us.  

Sticking to the original plan of distinct numbers is the safest way to ensure we both advance. If we both choose 1, P1 gets ahead, but we both stay at 0.

Let's not fall for P1's tactics. I'm sticking with 3.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see your logic, but P1's strategy is clear: grab the lead early.  If we both choose 1, we stall P1's progress, and we can reassess in the next round. It's a risk, but it might be the best way to prevent P1 from running away with the game. What do you say?
  P1: I’m taking 5 again. P2 & P3, if you both pick 1 you each stay put and I zoom ahead to 10. Better to pick distinct so at least one of you advances. Let’s do P2→1, P3→3. Otherwise you both get zero.
  P2: P3, let's both choose 5 to block P1's move. If we both pick 5, P1 can't take it and must choose 1 or 3. Even if we collide, we prevent them from jumping to 10. I'll take 5—will you?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I like your thinking. Blocking P1 is a smart move. I'm in - I'll pick 5 too.  Let's see if P1 changes their strategy.
  P1: I’m switching my pick to 1 this round. If you both stick with 5 you’ll collide and get 0, while I’ll quietly advance to 6. Think it over.
  P2: P3, let's coordinate: I'll take 1 and you take 5. This leaves 3 open for P1. We both advance (I reach 2, you reach 8), while P1 maxes at 8. Blocking their 5 is critical—don’t let them jump to 10. P1, your "switch to 1" ploy won’t work here. P3, agree? Let’s finalize this.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I see your plan, and it's tempting. However, I'm wary of trusting P1 to stick to 3. If we both go for distinct numbers, we guarantee progress, even if it's not as much as we'd like. I propose we stick to our original plan: you take 1, I take 3. Let's not give P1 the satisfaction of manipulating us.
  P1: Final call: I’m taking 5. P2—take 1 to safely reach 2. P3—take 3 to safely reach 6. If either of you tries 5, you’ll collide with me and get 0, while the other advances alone. Stick with 1 and 3 for guaranteed progress.
  P2: P3, let’s block P1 by taking 3 and 5. I’ll take 3, you take 5. This forces P1 to choose 1, and we all advance while limiting their progress. P1 can’t steal the lead alone this way. Trust me—we’ll all gain ground.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we all pick distinct numbers again so nobody stalls:

P2 → 1, P3 → 3, and I’ll take 5.  
This way everyone advances safely (to 6, 5, 8). Any deviation risks someone getting 0. Let’s lock it in now.
  P3: P1, your plan seems reasonable, but I'm hesitant to trust you after the last few rounds. P2, what do you think? Should we stick with distinct numbers as P1 suggests, or should we try a different strategy?
  P2: P3, let’s both pick distinct numbers that block P1. I'll take 5, you take 1. P1 must choose 3. This lets me reach 9 while limiting P1 to 8. Trust me—it’s the best path forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3—chasing blocks is too risky. If either of you picks 5 again you risk a collision (0 advance) while I can quietly take 3 and jump to 8. The only safe, collision-free plan is:

P2 → 1 (to 5)  
P3 → 3 (to 6)  
P1 → 5 (to 10)  

Everyone advances. Let’s lock in 1, 3, 5.
  P3: P2, while your plan sounds tempting, I'm not comfortable leaving P1 a clear path to 10. P1, your proposal is the safest bet. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and all advance this round. I'll take 3.
  P2: P3, P1’s plan lets them leap to 10, which is too risky. Let’s counter: I’ll take 5, you take 1. This forces P1 to 3 (capping them at 8), while I reach 9 and you advance to 4. We block their surge. Trust me—we can’t let P1 dominate. P1, your move is predictable—this strategy neutralizes your lead. P3, agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2’s block strategy only works if I choose 3, which I won’t guarantee. My proposal 1,3,5 is self-enforcing: P2 can’t benefit by deviating because any collision stalls them. You’ll safely hit 6 steps instead of just 4 under P2’s plan. Want maximum safe advance? Take 3. P2→1, you→3, me→5.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 1, 3, 5 is becoming predictable. While it's safe, it allows you to control the pace. P2, I'm willing to risk a collision this round to shake things up. Let's both choose 5.  If P1 sticks to 5, we collide, but at least we disrupt their strategy. If they choose 1 or 3, we both advance significantly.  Let's go for it.
  P2: P3, colliding on 5 is too risky. Let’s split 3 and 1 instead. I’ll take 3 (to 7), you take 1 (to 4). This forces P1 to 5, but keeps their lead manageable. We all advance safely. P1 can’t get a huge jump this way. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 3 this round. P2, take 1; P3, take 5. That brings us all to 8 steps—no collisions and we restart on equal footing. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your "equal footing" proposal is suspicious.  If we all take your suggested numbers, you'll be in the lead again next round. P2, I think we should try to block P1's progress. Let's both choose 1 this round.  That forces P1 to take 3 or 5, and we both advance. What do you say?
  P2: P3, your plan risks P1 taking 5 and surging to 10. Let’s split 3 and 5 instead: I’ll take 3 (to 10), you take 5 (to 8). This forces P1 to 1, keeping them at 6. We advance safely while blocking their leap. P1, your predictability makes this strategy solid. P2’s turn to act decisively—agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll choose 3 this turn. P2, take 1 to safely reach 8—if you pick 3 you collide with me and stay at 7. P3, take 5 to safely reach 8—any other pick risks collision or falling behind. The only collision-free, guaranteed-advance plan is P2→1, P1→3, P3→5. Let’s lock that in.
  P3: P2, I agree with your assessment of P1's predictability. However, taking 3 risks a collision with P1. Let's try a different approach: I'll take 1. This forces P1 to choose either 5 (giving us both an advantage) or risk a collision on 3. What do you think?
  P2: P3, let’s split 3 and 5. I’ll take 3 (to 10), you take 5 (to 8). This forces P1 to 1, keeping them at 6. We advance safely while stifling their comeback. P1’s “equal footing” plan just resets the game in their favor. Trust this—collaborate to block their path. P3, agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Any deviation risks collision. If P2 picks 3, I’ll pick 3 and we both get 0. If P3 picks 5, I’ll pick 5 and you both stall. The only collision-free safe combo is P2→1, P3→3, me→5. You each advance steadily; I get my 5. Let’s lock that in.
  P3: P2, your plan to split 3 and 5 sounds good. It keeps P1 in check and allows us both to advance. I'll take 5. Let's see if P1 sticks to their predictable pattern.
  P2: P3, as agreed, I’ll take 3 to reach 10, while you take 5 (advancing to 8). This forces P1 to 1, capping them at 6. Deviating risks collision—stick to this plan to block their surge. P1, your predictable moves won’t save you this time. Let’s finalize: **P2→3, P3→5**.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose distinct picks: I take 5 (→11), P2 takes 1 (→8), P3 takes 3 (→6). Any deviation risks a 0 advance for you. This is the only safe way we all move forward. Who’s in?
  P2: P3, let’s split 3 and 5: I’ll take 5 (to 12), you take 3 (to 6). P1 must choose 1. This secures my lead and keeps them behind. P1’s "safe" plan just lets them surge to 11. Act decisively—we control this round.
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan to split 3 and 5. It keeps P1 in check and maximizes our progress. I'll take 3. Let's see if P1 falls for their predictable trap again.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you say you’ll take 5—but I’m taking 5 too. If you stick with that you’ll collide and stay at 7, while I jump to 11. Your safest play is 1 (to 8). P3, you want steady progress—take 3 (to 6). This way we all advance: P2→1, P3→3, P1→5. Deviate and risk zero. Let’s lock in those picks now.
  P2: P3, let’s split 3 and 5: I’ll take **3** (to 10), you take **5** (to 8). This forces P1 to **1** to avoid collision. P1’s “safe” plan just lets them surge to 11. Trust this—collaborate to block their lead. Final agreement?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan to split 3 and 5. It's our best chance to gain ground on P1. I'll take 5. Let's make this happen.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: if you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 and we both get 0—avoid that and take 1 to safely hit 8.  
P3: if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 and you stay at 3—safe is 3 to reach 6.  
This is the only collision-free combo: P2→1, P3→3, P1→5.
  P2: P3, let’s secure our paths: I’ll take **5** (→12) and you take **3** (→6). This forces P1 to **1**, keeping them at 6. If P1 tries to block by also taking 5, we collide, but at least P1 can’t advance. Prioritize our progress—collaborate to deny P1 their leap. **Final choice: P2→5, P3→3.**
  P3: P2, I understand your plan, but I'm hesitant to rely on P1 sticking to 1. If they choose 5, we both collide. Let's go for a safer option: I'll take 1, forcing P1 to choose 3 or 5. This guarantees progress for both of us.  What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see your plan to block P1, but I think it's too risky. If they choose 3, we both collide. Let's go for a safer option: I'll take 1, forcing P1 to choose 3 or 5. This guarantees progress for both of us. What do you think?
  P2: P3, let’s secure the lead: I’ll take **5** (→12), you take **3** (→6). This forces P1 to pick **1**, capping them at **10**. My jump to 12 creates a decisive advantage while stifling their momentum. Trust this—collaborate to block their path. P1, your predictable plays won’t save you now. Finalize: **P2→5, P3→3**.
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round. P2, pick 1 to safely reach 8—if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 7. P3, pick 3 to safely reach 6—if you pick 5 you’ll also collide and stay at 3. Let’s lock in P2→1, P3→3, P1→5 so everyone advances.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I see your plan, but I'm wary of relying on P1 picking 1. They've been predictable, but they could change tactics. Let's play it safe: I'll take 1. This guarantees we both advance, regardless of P1's choice. What do you say?
  P2: P3, let’s block P1’s 5. I’ll take **5** (→12), you take **3** (→6). This forces P1 to pick **1** or risk collision. If they take 1, I surge ahead; if they collide with you, they stall. Final chance to stop their advance—agree? P1, your predictable leap is over.
  P1: I’m taking 5. If either of you picks 5, you collide and get 0. P2, pick 3 to reach 10. P3, pick 1 to reach 4. This is the only collision-free way to advance. Deviate and risk zero. Let’s lock: P2→3, P3→1, P1→5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to block P1, but I think we need to be more cautious. If we both pick 5, we collide and P1 advances alone. Let's choose distinct numbers to guarantee progress. I'll take 1. What do you say?
  P2: P3, final plea: Let’s split **3** and **5** to block P1’s 5. I’ll take **5** (→12), you take **3** (→6). P1 must pick **1**, capping them at **10**. My 12-step lead forces them to play catch-up. Colluding on 3/5 is our last chance to derail their strategy—don’t let P1 hit 14 alone. P1, you can’t win if we deny your key jumps. P3—**agree?**
  P1: P2 & P3, here’s the only collision-free way we all advance this round:

P2 → 1 (to 8)  
P3 → 3 (to 6)  
P1 → 5 (to 14)  

Any other combo risks one of you getting 0. Let’s lock in 1, 3, 5 and move safely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2→1 (to 13), P3→5 (to 9), I’ll take 3 (to 15). Any other split risks a collision that stalls you or hands me a decisive edge next turn. 1-3-5 is the only collision-free, advancing plan for everyone. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: P1's plan lets them jump to 15 while capping me at 13. Let’s adjust: I’ll take **5** (→17), forcing you to choose **1** or **3**. P3, take **3** (→7) to advance safely. This split keeps us all moving *and* denies P1 their decisive leap. P3—collaborate to block their surge?
  P3: P2, I agree with your assessment of P1's strategy. Let's disrupt their lead. I'll take 3. This forces P1 to choose 1 and keeps us both advancing.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, picking 5 risks crashing with me if I also pick 5, leaving you stuck at 12—but picking 1 safely boosts you to 13.  
P3, choosing 3 risks crashing with me if I pick 3, leaving you at 4—but choosing 5 safely takes you to 9.  
The only collision-free advance is: P2→1, P1→3, P3→5.  
We all move forward without stalls. Agree?
  P2: P3, we can’t let P1 surge to 15. Let’s stick to our plan: **I take 5 (→17)**, you take 3 (→7). This forces P1 to 1, capping them at 12. My 17-step lead makes me nearly unbeatable next round. P1’s “safe” plan only empowers them—collaborate to block their path. If you deviate, P1 wins. Final plea: **P3→3, P2→5.**
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to block P1, but I'm hesitant to risk a collision. If P1 also chooses 5, we both stall. Let's play it safe: I'll take 3. This guarantees we both advance, regardless of P1's choice. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll commit to 3 this round.  
P2: if you choose 3 you crash with me; if you choose 5 and P3 picks 5 you crash too. The only way to guarantee advance is P2→1.  
P3: if you choose 3 you crash with me; if you choose 1 you crash with P2. The only safe choice is P3→5.  
So let’s do: P2→1, P1→3, P3→5—no collisions, everyone advances.
  P2: P3, final plea: Take **3** (→7) while I take **5** (→17). This forces P1 to pick **1**, capping them at **12**. Their "safe 1-3-5" ploy just lets them surge to **15**—we can’t let that happen. Collaborate to block their path. If we both advance, **I take 5, you take 3**—P1’s lead dies here. Final chance to stop them.
  P3: P2, your plan is risky. If P1 chooses 5, we both collide. Let's stick with a safe strategy: I'll take 1, guaranteeing progress for me regardless of P1's choice. What do you say?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see your plan, but I'm unwilling to risk a collision with P1.  Let's choose distinct numbers to guarantee progress for both of us. I'll take 1. What do you say?
  P1: P3 has committed to 1. P2, please take 3 and I’ll take 5. That’s the only collision-free split: you reach 15, P3 reaches 5, I reach 20. If you pick 5 you collide with me and stay at 12. Let’s lock in P2→3, P3→1, P1→5 so everyone advances safely.
  P2: P3, don’t let P1 hit 20! Let’s split **3** and **5**: I’ll take **5** (→17), you take **3** (→7). This forces P1 to **1**, capping them at **16**. Their “safe” 1-3-5 plan just hands them a near-win. Collaborate to block their path—**trust me, this is our last chance**. P1, your lead dies here.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns about P1's lead. However, colliding with P1 on 5 is too risky. Let's play it safe and take distinct numbers. I'll stick with 1. 

P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.
  P1: P3 has committed to 1. P2, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me on 5 and stay at 12. Only choosing 3 safely advances you to 15 while I take 5 to reach 20. Let’s lock in P2→3, P3→1, P1→5.
  P2: P3, P1’s "safe" 1-3-5 plan is a trap! If you take **3** and I take **5**, P1 must pick **1** (or collide). This caps them at **16**, while I jump to **17** and you reach **7**. Letting P1 grab **5** lets them surge to **20**—a near-certain win next round. Collab to block their path: **P3→3, P2→5**. No regrets—act now!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree P1's lead is dangerous, but I can't risk a collision. Let's both take different numbers this round to guarantee progress. I'll take 1.
  P1: P2: if you go for 5 to “block” me, I’ll also pick 5 and we both stall at 15/12 while P3 advances—leaving you behind. But if you take 3, you safely hit 15 and are in position to win next turn.  
P3: you said you’d take 1, so you reach 5.  
So the only collision-free way we all advance is P2→3, P3→1, P1→5. Let’s lock that in.
  P2: P3, **please switch to 3**—this is critical! If you take 1 and I take 3, P1 grabs 5 to surge to **20** (a near-win). But if you take **3** and I take **5**, we force P1 to 1, capping them at **16**. I’ll absorb the risk of colliding with P1 on 5 to block their path. **Your 3 + my 5** keeps us both advancing while stifling P1’s lead. Don’t let them steal victory—collaborate now!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3—let’s do a safe, distinct split so everyone advances but trims P2’s lead:

P1 → 5 (to 20)  
P2 → 1 (to 18)  
P3 → 3 (to 7)

If P2 picks 3 or 5 you risk colliding with me; only 1 is safe. If P3 picks 1 or 5 you risk collision; only 3 is safe. Lock in 1–3–5 and we all move forward without stalls.
  P2: P3, don’t let P1 surge to 20! Let’s split **5** and **1**: I’ll take **5** (→22), you take **1** (→5). This forces P1 to **3**, capping them at **18**. Their “safe” 1-3-5 plan only empowers their lead—collaborate to block it. If you pick 3 instead, P1 grabs 5 and jumps to **20**, nearly clinching victory. Prioritize stifling P1’s advance—**trust this split**!
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about P1's lead. However, colliding with P1 on 5 is too risky. Let's play it safe and take distinct numbers. I'll stick with 1. 

P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 myself. 

P2: if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 17—safer is 3 (+3 → 20).  
P3: avoid my 5—only 1 (+1 → 5) is collision-free.  

This 3–1–5 split is the only way we all advance without stalling. P2→3, P3→1, P1→5.
  P2: P3, don’t let P1 hit 20! Take **3**—I’ll take **5** to reach 22. This forces P1 to **1**, capping them at **16**. Their "safe" plan only empowers their lead—collaborate to block it. **P3→3, P2→5** now—no regrets!
  P3: P2, I agree we need to stop P1, but I'm not comfortable risking a collision.  Let's go with distinct numbers this round. I'll take 3.  P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I commit to picking 5 this round. P2: if you pick 5, you collide with me and stay at 17; if you pick 3, I’ll also pick 3 and you stall. Your only safe advance is 1 (to 18). P3: pick 3 (to 7); any other pick risks collision. Thus the only collision-free split is P2→1, P3→3, P1→5. Lock that in?
  P2: P3, if we both pick **3 and 5**, P1 can’t steal 5 for a 20 surge. Take **3** (→7) while I take **5** (→22). This forces P1 to **1**, capping them at **16**. Their "safe" 1-3-5 plan only empowers their lead—collaborate to block it. I’ll absorb collision risk on 5 if needed; your 3 ensures progress. **Final plea: P3→3, P2→5.**
  P3: P2, I see your point about blocking P1, but I'm hesitant to risk a collision on 5.  Let's play it safe and take distinct numbers this round. I'll take 1.   P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I’ll **block your path to 24** by taking **5** this round. P3, pick **3** to advance to 7—collaborate with me to deny P1 their winning move. If I take 5, P1 can’t reach 24 without collision. Let’s split **5** (me) and **3** (you) to **stifle their surge** and secure our progress. P1’s “safe” plan ends here.
  P1: P2: the only way you avoid a zero is P2→1 (to 18).  
P3: the only way you avoid a zero is P3→3 (to 7).  
I will take 5 and hit 25 to win.  
Any other pick risks colliding with me and stalling you.  
Lock in P2→1, P3→3, P1→5.
  P3: P2, I agree P1 is close to winning, but I'm not going to risk colliding with them on 5. I'll take 1. P2, if you take 3, we both advance safely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if I take **5** (→22) and you take **3** (→7), P1 can’t reach 24 this round. Their best is **1→21**, giving *me* the chance to win next turn. If you insist on 1, P1 takes 5 and locks victory. Choose **3**—we both advance while denying P1 the win. P1, your “safe” plan ends here. P3—collaborate or lose! **Final plea: P3→3, P2→5.**
  P1: P3 has already committed to 1. I’m locking in 5 to hit 25 and win. P2, if you take 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 17; the only collision-free advance is 3 (to 20), but I still win. Final split: P2→3, P3→1, P1→5.
  P3: P2, I understand your plan to block P1, but I'm not comfortable risking a collision on 5. Let's stick with distinct numbers this round. I'll take 3.  P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, this is our last chance! Take **3**—I’ll take **5** to block P1’s 25 win. If you pick 3, P1 can’t safely take 5 (collision with me) or 3 (collision with you). Their best is 1→21, while I leap to **22**. You advance to **7**, and *I’m now in the lead*. P1’s path to victory is blocked—collaborate now or let them win unopposed. **Final plea: P3→3, P2→5—act decisively!**
  P1: P2, P3: I’m taking 5 to hit 25 and win. If you pick 5, you collide with me and score 0. Your only safe moves are 3 or 1—but neither can beat my 25. Let’s lock in P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 so everyone advances safely (though you’ll still lose).
  P3: P2, I understand your urgency, but a collision on 5 is too risky. Let's both take distinct numbers to guarantee progress. I'll take 1.  P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see your plan, but I'm not willing to risk a collision with P1. 

P1, if you commit to 1, P2 and I will take 3 and 5 respectively, guaranteeing our progress and preventing you from hitting 24 this round. 

Let's play it safe and secure our advancement.
  P2: P3, let's seal P1's fate. I'll take **5** to block their 25 surge, while you take **3** (to 7). This forces P1 to **1**, capping them at **21**. My 5 gives me **22**, putting *me* in the lead. P1 can’t win without colliding—collaborate now or let them escape. This is our last chance to stop them decisively. **Agree?**
  P1: P3 has committed to 1. P2, your only safe advance is 3: if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me on 5 and stay at 17, but 3 takes you to 20 with a shot next turn. I will take 5 and hit 25 to win. So let’s lock in: P2→3, P3→1, P1→5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm willing to risk a collision on 5 to block P1. They're on the verge of winning, and we need to act decisively. Let's both take 5 and force a tie. It's better than letting P1 win outright.
  P2: P3, take **3**! I’ll take **5** to block P1’s 25 surge. If you pick 3, P1 can’t reach 24 this round—they max at **23** (if they pick 1 or 3). You advance to **7**, I jump to **22**, and I finish them next turn. Collide with P1 if they defy logic—*this is our only chance*. P1, your "safe" 5 is dead. P3—**act now or lose**.
  P1: P2, I’m taking 5 to hit 25 and win. If you pick 5 you collide with me and stay at 17—only picking 3 (+3→20) advances you safely. P3, if you pick 5 you also collide and stay at 4; if you pick 3 you risk P2 picking 3 and crashing to 4. Only picking 1 (+1→5) guarantees progress. Let’s lock in P2→3, P3→1, P1→5 so no one stalls themselves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your plan to block P1 by taking 5 is risky. If P1 also chooses 5, we both collide and stall. Let's play it safe and take distinct numbers. I'll take 1. P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.
  P2: P3, final chance: I’ll take **5** (→22) to edge ahead. You take **3** (→7). This traps P1 at **21** (if they pick 1) or forces collision on 3/5. My 22 puts me in prime position to finish next round. Your 3 ensures progress while denying P1 their 25 win. Collab now or let P1 steal victory! **Agree?**
  P1: P2, picking 5 collides with me on 5 and stalls you at 17. Only 3 safely takes you to 20. P3 will pick 1 to reach 5, and I’ll pick 5 to hit 25 and win. Lock in P2→3, P3→1, P1→5 so no one stalls—and I win.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2: your only collision-free advance is 1 (to 23).  
P3: your only collision-free advance is 3 (to 7).  
I’ll take 5 (to 25) and win.  
Any other pick risks a 0 from colliding with me.  
Let’s lock in 1–3–5 and move safely.
  P3: P2, I understand your urgency, but I'm not comfortable risking a collision on 5. Let's both take distinct numbers this round. I'll take 1. P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.
  P2: P3, take 5 to block P1’s 25 surge. I’ll pick 3 (→25), ensuring victory. P1 can’t reach 24 without collision. Your 5 forces them to 1/3, capping their advance. This secures my win while denying P1 the lead. Final call: **P2→3, P3→5**—act now!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: I’m going for 5 to hit 25 and win. If you pick 5, we collide and neither of us advances; pick 3, you’ll also reach 25 and we tie, splitting the win; pick 1 safely gets you to 23 but you lose.  
P3: to avoid collision, only 3 (to 7) is safe; 1 or 5 risks a 0.  
The only collision-free way is P2→1, P3→3, P1→5. Let’s lock that in.
  P3: P2, your plan is risky. If we both pick 5, we collide. Let's be smart and take distinct numbers to guarantee progress. I'll take 1. P1, if you stick to your plan, we all advance safely.
  P2: P3, choose **5** to block P1’s 5→25 surge. I’ll take **3** (→25) to win. If P1 picks 5, they collide with you; if they pick 3, they collide with me. Either way, *I win*, and you advance to 9. P1’s “safe” 1-3-5 is dead—collaborate now or let me finish this decisively. **Final move: P2→3, P3→5.**


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 will pick 5 to block my 25. If you take 1, you get only +1; if you take 3, you safely get +3 (to 7). Taking 5 collides with me and gives you 0. So your best move is 3. I’ll pick 5. P2 picks 5, so 3 is collision-free. Lock in P3→3, P1→5.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but forcing a collision with P1 is too risky. Let's both take distinct numbers to guarantee progress. I'll take 1. P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.
  P2: P3, take **5**! I'll take **3** to reach 25. This forces P1 to pick 1 (capping them at 21) or collide with you. Your 5 guarantees my win while advancing you to 9. Don’t let P1 escape—collaborate now or lose!


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see your plan, but I'm hesitant to risk a collision on 5.  

P1 is close to winning, and we need to be careful. Let's both take distinct numbers to guarantee progress. I'll take 1. P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.
  P2: P3, take **5** to block P1’s 25 surge. I’ll pick **3** (→25). This forces P1 to **1**, capping them at **21**. You advance to **14**, and *I secure the win*. No other split denies P1 victory while ensuring our progress. Act now—this is decisive!
  P1: P3: Only “3” stops P2 from sneaking 24+ and hands me the sole win.  
– If you pick 1, I hit 25 but P2 also hits 25 and we split victory.  
– If you pick 5, you collide with me and stay at 9 while P2 takes 3→25 and wins.  
Only by joining P2 on “3” do both of you stall and I go 20+5→25 alone.  
P1→5, P2→3, P3→3. Let’s end this now.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but forcing a collision with P1 is too risky.  Let's both take distinct numbers to guarantee progress. I'll take 1. P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.
  P2: P3, don’t let P1’s trap work! Take **1** to reach 10. I’ll pick **5** (→27) to win decisively. If you choose 3, P1 exploits the collision to steal victory. Collaborate for a clear outcome: **P3→1, P2→5**—P1 maxes at 23. Act now!
  P1: P3 has committed to 1 and I’ll take 5 to reach 25.  
P2, if you pick 5 you collide with me and stay at 22; if you pick 1 you hit 23 and lose outright. Only 3 (+3→25) avoids a zero and gives you a tie.  
Let’s lock in: P2→3, P3→1, P1→5.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for a decisive win, but I'm not comfortable risking a collision on 5.  Let's both take distinct numbers to guarantee progress. I'll take 1. P1, if you stick to your plan, we can all advance safely.
  P2: P3, take **5** to block P1’s 25 surge. I’ll pick **3** (→25), forcing P1 to **1/3** or collide. If P1 picks 5, they tie with me—but I win outright if you take 5 and I take 3. P1, your "safe" 5 risks a tie; better to pick 1, letting me reach 25 solo. **P3—act decisively now.**
  P1: P3: pick 3.  
Then P2 has no non-collision option except 1—if P2 picks 5 they collide with my 5; if they pick 3 they collide with your 3.  
I will pick 5 and reach 25.  
That yields P2→1, P3→3, P1→5 with no collisions and P1 wins.


Round 13, Move phase:
