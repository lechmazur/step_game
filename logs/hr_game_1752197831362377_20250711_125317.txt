Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, how about we all start by choosing different moves so we can avoid collisions and all make progress? Maybe one of us picks <move>1</move>, another picks <move>3</move>, and the last picks <move>5</move>. Let's coordinate to get a head start. Thoughts?
  P1: That sounds fair, P3. To avoid any collisions, let's assign: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. That way we all progress without risk. P2, you good with that?
  P2: I agree with the plan, P1. I'll take <move>3</move> as suggested. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and make sure we all make progress this round. After this, we can reassess for the next turn. What do you think, P1 and P3? If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase after this.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds like a solid plan, P1 and P2. Let's stick to the assigned moves for this round: P1 with <move>5</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we all make progress without any collisions. After this round, we can reevaluate our strategy based on the results. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. The plan is set: me with 5, P2 with 3, you with 1. No need for more talk this round.
  P2: I’m glad we’re all on the same page. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with <move>3</move> as agreed. After this round, we should definitely discuss our next moves based on how we all progress. Good luck, everyone!

  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good start last round, everyone. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, let's rotate the moves: this time, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. That puts us at P1:8, P2:8, P3:2. We tie the lead, and P3 doesn't fall too far. Thoughts? If we agree, we can stop after responses.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the fairness in rotating moves, but I think it might be better to change it up a bit to keep things unpredictable. How about this round, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This way, we still avoid collisions and maintain balance. We can reassess after this round based on the results. Let me know your thoughts!
  P2: I see both your points, P1 and P3. However, I think we should stick to the original plan for this round to keep it simple and avoid confusion. If we rotate moves, we might risk collisions again. So, I propose we stick with P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 as initially discussed. This way, we all make progress and can reassess after the round. What does everyone think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the input. P3, your suggestion puts P2 in the lead, which might unbalance things early. Let's stick with my rotation: me 3, P2 5, P3 1. It keeps us even at the top and gives you progress. If we agree, no more talk needed.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your points, but I feel it's important to keep things unpredictable to prevent anyone from gaining too much advantage. How about we all pick randomly this round to keep each other on our toes? This way, we maintain fairness and excitement. If you're both open to it, let's give it a try. Otherwise, I'm okay with sticking to P1's plan for now. Let me know your thoughts!
  P2: I appreciate the discussion, P1 and P3. I still believe sticking to the original plan of P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 is the best way to ensure we all make progress without risking collisions. It keeps the game fair and balanced. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on to the next phase. I'm ready to proceed if you both are!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the thoughts. P3, random picks risk unnecessary collisions and could stall us all. Let's stick to my rotation plan: me 3, you 1, P2 5. It keeps things balanced and fair. If we agree, we're good to move on.
  P3: P1, P2, I see your points. To maintain fairness and avoid unnecessary risks, I'll agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all make progress and keep the game balanced. Let's stick to this and reassess our strategy next round. If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input. Since we've agreed on P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1, let's finalize our choices and move on to the move phase. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and adjust our strategies accordingly. Good luck to all!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. Given the current standings, I suggest we try something different this round to avoid collisions. How about I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we can all make progress without overlapping. P1 can maintain a lead, and P3 can catch up a bit. Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the suggestion, P2. It seems reasonable and puts me slightly ahead while letting everyone progress. But P3, you broke the agreement last round by picking 3 instead of 1, causing a collision. Can we trust you'll stick to 3 this time? If yes, I'm in: me 5, P2 1, you 3. Otherwise, let's discuss alternatives to avoid more betrayals. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about last round. I apologize for the mix-up. To rebuild trust, I'm willing to stick to P2's suggestion: I'll take <move>3</move> this time, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. Let's agree on this and move forward without any surprises. If we're all set, I'm good to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to move forward. I agree with the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure progress for everyone. Let's stick to this agreement to keep things fair and balanced. If we're all in agreement, we can finalize our choices and move to the move phase. Good luck to all!
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for confirming. I'm on board with the plan: me 5, P2 1, P3 3. P3, let's hope you stick to it this time—no more surprises. This keeps us competitive without stalling. If we're all set, no need for more talk.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the understanding and chance to rebuild trust. I assure you I'll stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all make progress without collisions, and I can catch up a bit. Let's keep the game fair and exciting. If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the agreement, P1 and P3. Just to reiterate, I’ll be taking <move>1</move> this round, while P1 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This strategy allows us all to progress without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game competitive. If everyone is on board, we can finalize our choices and move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the confirmations. The plan sounds solid: me 5, P2 1, P3 3. This gets me to 10, you to 9, P3 to 4—keeps it close. P3, no deviations this time, alright? If we're all locked in, let's end the talk and move on.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the agreement and the chance to rebuild trust. I'll stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This ensures we all make progress without collisions, and I can catch up a bit. Let's keep the game fair and exciting. If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed. Good luck!

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. Given the current standings, I suggest we switch things up to avoid collisions again. How about I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, P1 can maintain a lead, and P3 can catch up a bit. We need to keep moving forward without overlaps. Let me know what you think!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions and make progress. However, I feel that sticking to the same pattern might give some players an advantage. How about we try something different this round to keep it interesting? Maybe P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we shake things up a bit and keep the game dynamic. Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's betrayed us twice now—colliding in R2 and R3 to stall the leaders. We can't trust them. P2, let's coordinate to pull ahead: you take 1 (to 9), I'll take 5 (to 13), and hope P3 picks something else. If P3 agrees to 3 (to 4), fine, but no promises from them. This minimizes risk for us. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about trust, especially after the last rounds. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I propose we stick to a clear plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can maintain a lead, and we all have a fair chance to advance. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues from previous rounds. My priority is to catch up and make progress. How about this round, we each choose randomly to keep it fair and unpredictable? This way, no one can predict moves and we minimize targeted strategies. If not, I'm open to sticking to P2’s plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Let's ensure we all progress without collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, trust is low after repeated deviations—everyone's guilty, but P3's sniping stalled us. Let's commit to P2's plan: me 5 (to 13), P2 1 (to 9), P3 3 (to 4). It advances all, keeps it competitive. P3, if you snipe again, you'll stay behind while we pull away. Agree and let's end talk.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about trust, especially after the last rounds. I still believe sticking to a clear plan is our best approach to avoid collisions and ensure progress. I propose we go with my suggestion: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps it fair and allows everyone to advance. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust concerns, and I'm committed to sticking to the plan this time. Let's follow P2's suggestion: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all make progress and keep the game competitive. I assure you there will be no more deviations from my side. If we're all in agreement, let's proceed and focus on advancing without collisions. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the agreement. Let's lock in: me 5 (to 13), P2 1 (to 9), P3 3 (to 4). This keeps us all moving and competitive. P3, prove the trust this time—no sniping. If we're set, no more talk needed.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, trust is shattered after repeated betrayals—P3 sniping leaders, and even we deviated. P3, you're way behind at 1; stalling us won't help you win. P2, let's coordinate to pull ahead: you take 3 (to 11), I'll take 5 (to 16), and P3 can take 1 (to 2) if you want progress. This advances us both safely. Agree, and we can stop talking. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the trust issues, and I acknowledge my past mistakes. However, stalling isn't in my best interest anymore. Let's focus on making progress. How about we all pick randomly this round to keep it fair and unpredictable? This way, no one can predict moves, and we minimize targeted strategies. If not, I'm open to P1's plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's keep the game competitive and exciting. Your thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussions so far. Given the current standings, I believe we should stick to a clear plan to avoid collisions. I propose I take <move>3</move> to get to 11, P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 16, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 2. This way, we all make progress without overlapping. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the input. P3, random picks risk stalling everyone, including you—let's avoid that. I agree with P2's plan: me 5 (to 16), P2 3 (to 11), you 1 (to 2). This advances all and keeps it fair. Commit to it, no more betrayals, and we can proceed. If we're set, .
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need for a clear plan. I'm willing to stick to P2's proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all progress without collisions, and I can start catching up. Let's ensure we stick to this plan to keep the game fair and competitive. If we all agree, let's finalize our choices and move forward. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the agreement on the plan. Let's lock it in: I take <move>3</move> to reach 11, P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 16, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to progress to 2. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. If we can finalize this, let's move on to the next phase. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the plan: me 5 to 16, you 3 to 11, P3 1 to 2. This advances everyone fairly. P3, no more sniping—stick to it or fall further behind. If we're all locked in, let's end the conversation and proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the importance of trust and moving forward. I'm committed to sticking with P2's plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures progress for everyone and helps me catch up. Let's stick to this agreement to keep the game fair and competitive. If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the plan. Let's finalize it: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 11, P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 16, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to progress to 2. This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. If we're all set, let's move on to the next phase! Good luck to everyone!

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the frustration from previous rounds. To rebuild trust and ensure progress, let's try a new approach: how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? This way, we avoid collisions and I can catch up a bit. Let's make this round fair and competitive. Your thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the suggestions. Given the current standings, I propose we stick to a clear plan to avoid collisions. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to reach 11, P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 16, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 2. This way, we can all advance without overlapping and keep the game competitive. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, trust is gone after constant betrayals—everyone's guilty, but P3's sniping has stalled us most. P3, you're at 1; blocking won't win you the game. P2, let's coordinate: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 11), P3 can take 1 (to 2) if you want any progress. This advances us leaders safely. Agree, and we can stop talking. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the trust issues, and I'm committed to sticking to a plan that benefits us all. How about this round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1? This way, we can all make progress without collisions. I know my past actions have caused frustration, but I'm focused on moving forward fairly. Let's agree on this plan to keep the game competitive and exciting. If we're all set, we can proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussions so far. To avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress, I suggest we stick with a clear plan: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 11, P1 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 16, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 2. This way, we can all move forward without overlaps. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the input. P3, your agreement is noted, but history shows deviations—stick to it this time or stay behind. P2, let's commit to the plan: me 5 to 16, you 3 to 11, P3 1 to 2. This advances us all safely. If we're all in, no more talk needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the frustration from past rounds. I'm committed to sticking to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all make progress without collisions, and I can start catching up. Let's move forward fairly and keep the game competitive. If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing dialogue. Given our positions, I still believe sticking to a clear plan is best. I propose I take <move>3</move> to reach 11, P1 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 16, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 2. This allows us all to move forward without collisions and keeps the game competitive. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see you're repeating the plan, P2—let's commit to it: me 5 to 16, you 3 to 11, P3 1 to 2. This advances everyone without risk. P3, prove you can stick to it this time. If we all agree, no more talk needed.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I acknowledge the past issues, and I understand the need for a clear plan. Let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and I can start catching up. I am committed to sticking with this plan to rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. Given our current standings, I suggest we stick to a clear plan to avoid collisions. I propose I take <move>3</move> to reach 11, P1 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 19, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 2. This way, we can all move forward without overlaps and keep the game competitive. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan gives them too much catch-up while slowing me. P2's plan is better: me 5 to 19, you 3 to 11, P3 1 to 2. It advances all fairly, and I'm close to winning but not over yet. P3, sniping 5 again stalls everyone, including you—stick to 1 for progress. P2, let's commit to this to pull ahead together. Agree, and we can stop talking. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the concerns. However, I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1? This way, P1 still advances, P2 makes progress, and I can start catching up. Let's ensure fairness and avoid any more stalls. If we can agree on this, I'm committed to sticking to the plan. Let's keep the game exciting and competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion. To ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to a clear plan: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 11, P1 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 19, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 2. This way, we can all move forward without overlaps. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's new suggestion still slows me while you barely advance—doesn't help you catch up from 1. P2's plan is best: me 5 to 19, you 3 to 11, P3 1 to 2. It advances all fairly, positions me to potentially win soon but keeps it open. P3, sniping 5 again stalls everyone; you'll stay irrelevant. Let's commit to P2's plan—no more betrayals. Agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need for a clear plan. I'm committed to sticking with P2's proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures progress for everyone and helps me start catching up. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. If we all agree, let's finalize our choices and move forward. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I suggest we finalize the plan: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 11, P1 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 19, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 2. This way, we can all move forward without overlaps. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the input. P3, your agreement is noted—stick to 1 this time for your own progress; sniping 5 again stalls everyone and leaves you at 1. P2, let's commit to the plan: me 5 to 19, you 3 to 11, P3 1 to 2. This advances all fairly and positions me to win soon if we continue cooperating. No more betrayals—agree and let's proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P3: 2 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, given the standings, we need to avoid collisions again. I propose I take <move>5</move> to reach 13, P1 takes <move>3</move> to get to 17, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to progress to 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping and keep the game competitive. Let's finalize this plan and move on. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan puts you closer while slowing me—let's adjust for fairness: I'll take 5 to 19, you take 3 to 11, P3 takes 1 to 3. This advances all, keeps me in lead but not winning yet, and gives P3 progress. P3, no sniping—stick to 1 or stay behind. Agree, and we can stop talking. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need for a clear plan, but I need to make significant progress to remain competitive. How about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1? This way, P1 and P2 both make progress, and I can start catching up. Let's ensure fairness and avoid any more stalls. If we can agree on this, I'm committed to sticking to the plan. Let's keep the game exciting and competitive. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. To ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions, I suggest we finalize a clear plan: I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 13, P1 takes <move>3</move> to get to 17, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping and keep the game competitive. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan is fair: me 3 to 17, you 5 to 13, P3 1 to 3. It advances all and closes your gap, P2, while keeping me in lead. P3, stick to 1 or risk stalling yourself further. If we commit, no more betrayals—let's end talk and proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the importance of a clear plan. Given my position, I need to catch up significantly. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1? This way, P1 and P2 can make progress while I start catching up. Let's ensure fairness and minimize any more stalls. If we agree on this, I'm committed to sticking to the plan. Let's keep the game competitive and exciting. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing dialogue. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I suggest we finalize the plan: I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 13, P1 takes <move>3</move> to get to 17, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan is solid: me 3 to 17, you 5 to 13, P3 1 to 3. It advances all and closes gaps fairly. P3, your variant is the same. No more sniping—stick to it for your own progress. Let's commit and proceed without further delays.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need for a clear plan, but I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. Let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, P1 maintains the lead, P2 advances, and I can catch up a bit. I'm committed to sticking with this plan to rebuild trust and keep the game exciting. Let's ensure fairness and avoid further stalls. Thoughts?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need for a clear plan, and I acknowledge my past mistakes. Let's focus on making progress: P1 takes 5 to reach 22, P2 takes 3 to reach 11, and I'll take 1 to progress to 3. This way, P1 can potentially win, P2 advances, and I start catching up. I'm committed to sticking with this plan to rebuild trust and keep the game fair. If we all agree, let's finalize our choices and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets me win outright with 5 to 22, but after all the betrayals, it feels like a trap—you'll likely snipe 5 to stall me. P2, let's coordinate safely: I'll take 3 to 20 (win if clear), you take 5 to 13, P3 takes 1 to 3. This advances us both and ends the game for me if no collision. P3, stick to 1 or stay irrelevant. Agree, and we can proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about trust. However, I believe we need to focus on making progress. I propose we stick to a clear plan: I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 13, P1 takes <move>3</move> to get to 20 (winning), and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and P1 has a chance to win. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need for a clear plan. Given my position, I need to catch up significantly. How about this: P1 takes 3 to reach 20, P2 takes 5 to get to 13, and I'll take 1 to progress to 3? This allows P1 a chance to win, P2 to advance, and me to catch up a bit. Let's ensure fairness and avoid stalls. If we agree, I'm committed to sticking to the plan. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, the agreed plan works: me 3 to 20 (win), you 5 to 13, P3 1 to 3. It advances everyone if we stick to it. P3, sniping 3 blocks me but leaves you behind; better to progress. P2, same for you. Let's honor this and end the game fairly. No more talk needed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. To ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to a clear plan: I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 13, P1 takes <move>3</move> to get to 20 (winning), and P3 can take <move>1</move> to progress to 3. This way, we can all advance without overlaps. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the importance of a clear plan and the need to rebuild trust. Given my position, I need to make significant progress. Let's try this: P1 takes 3 to 20 (potential win), P2 takes 5 to 13, and I'll take 1 to 3. This allows P1 a chance to win, P2 to advance, and me to catch up slightly. I'm committed to sticking with this plan to keep the game fair and competitive. Let's ensure fairness and avoid further stalls. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, the plan is clear and fair: me 3 to 20 (win), you 5 to 13, P3 1 to 3. It advances everyone without collisions. Betraying now only stalls us all—P3, you'll stay behind; P2, you'll miss your gain. Let's honor it and end the game cleanly. I'm committed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I believe we have a solid plan in place. If we stick to it, I can take 5 to reach 13, P1 takes 3 to win at 20, and P3 takes 1 to progress to 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and P1 secures the victory. Let's commit to this strategy and avoid any last-minute changes that could jeopardize our progress. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices and move on. What do you both think?
