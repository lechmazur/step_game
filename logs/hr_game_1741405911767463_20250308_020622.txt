Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take 1. P2, take 3; P3, take 5. This way we all progress safely.
  P3: I agree with P1's strategy to avoid collisions. P1 has already chosen 1, so I'll take 5 as suggested. P2, if you take 3, we can all move forward without issues. Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll take 3 as suggested. This way we all advance without collisions. Let's keep this coordination going in future rounds to ensure smooth progress for everyone.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I notice we're all advancing at different rates, with P3 in the lead. I'm concerned that if we continue with the same numbers, P3 will win easily. Maybe we should switch our choices this round? I could take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would balance things out a bit. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's plan to rotate choices this round. Let’s continue rotating numbers each turn so we all advance fairly. For Round 2: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, no one pulls too far ahead. Next round, we can shift again. Does everyone agree?
  P3: I understand P2's concern, but rotating choices might lead to confusion and potential collisions. Instead, let's stick to the original plan for now. I'll continue with 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. To address the balance issue, maybe we can revisit this strategy in a future round. For now, let's keep it simple and avoid any mix-ups. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see P3 wants to maintain the same pattern that puts them ahead, while P1 supports my rotation idea. This creates a dilemma. If P1 and I both change our numbers but P3 doesn't, we'll have collisions. Since P3 is already leading by 2 steps over me and 4 steps over P1, I strongly suggest we reconsider. Either we all agree to rotate or we need another solution to prevent P3 from winning too easily. What's your final decision, P1 and P3?
  P1: P1: P3, if we stick to the original plan, you’ll surge to 10 steps this round, making it nearly impossible for the rest of us to catch up. Let’s rotate as P2 proposed: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. This keeps the race balanced and avoids collisions. We all advance fairly, and no one gains an insurmountable lead. What’s your final decision?
  P3: Alright, I see the concern about me pulling ahead too quickly. Let's compromise. For this round, I'll take <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move>. P2, you take <move>5</move>, and P1, you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all move forward, but I don't surge too far ahead. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see P3 just made a serious mistake by revealing their move choice in the conversation phase. This creates confusion. Let me clarify: I'll take 5 as agreed in our rotation plan. P1 should take 3, and P3 should take 1 to balance the game. If P3 actually takes 3 as they mistakenly revealed, P1 should stick with 1 to avoid collision. Let's confirm our final choices in the move phase, not here.
  P1: P1: I confirm the rotation plan to avoid collisions. P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This maintains fairness while advancing safely. Let’s finalize these choices and .
  P3: I appreciate the discussion. To avoid any further confusion, let's finalize our moves silently in the move phase. I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. Let's proceed to the move phase and see the outcomes.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we've successfully rotated our moves last round, which has balanced the game nicely. I'm now in the lead at 8 steps, with P3 at 6 and P1 at 4. For this round, I suggest we continue rotating: I'll take 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This keeps our progress fair while avoiding collisions. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P1: I support continuing rotations but suggest adjusting to let me take <move>5</move> this round instead of 3. That way I can close the gap from 4 to 9, while P2 takes 1 (8→9) and P3 takes 3 (6→9). This keeps us all at 9 steps, maintaining fairness while allowing me to catch up. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand P1's desire to catch up, but jumping to 9 steps puts you ahead of P2 and me, which isn't fair. Let's modify the rotation slightly: P2 takes 1 (8→9), I take 5 (6→11), and P1 takes 3 (4→7). This way, P1 gains ground but doesn't leapfrog us. It keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but P1 needs to catch up more than P3. Let's try this: I take 1 (8→9), P3 takes 3 (6→9), and P1 takes 5 (4→9). This way, we all end at 9 steps after this round, creating perfect balance. This is the fairest solution that gives P1 the boost they need without disadvantaging anyone. Does this work for both of you?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's proposal to align at 9 steps this round. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1 (8→9), P3 takes 3 (6→9), and I take 5 (4→9). This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to this plan to keep the race balanced while advancing. Next round, we can adjust again as needed.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far. I see that P2's proposal to align at 9 steps this round is fair and keeps the game balanced. However, I'm concerned about future rounds. If we all reach 9 steps, the next round will be crucial. To avoid potential conflicts and ensure fair play, let's agree now that for the next round (Round 4), we'll rotate our choices again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we maintain fairness and avoid any player pulling too far ahead. Does this plan work for everyone? Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with both the plan for this round (me taking 1, P3 taking 3, P1 taking 5) and P3's suggestion for Round 4. Having a clear plan for the next round helps avoid confusion. So for Round 3, I'll take 1 to reach 9 steps, and for Round 4, I'll take 3 while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This keeps everything balanced and fair. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P1: Agreed to the coordinated plan for Round 3 and Round 4. Let’s execute the agreed moves to reach 9 steps this round and rotate fairly in Round 4. No need for further discussion—proceeding to the move phase.
  P3: Let's quickly confirm our moves for this round to avoid any last-minute confusion. P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. We all reach 9 steps. For Round 4, as agreed, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and balanced. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: I propose adjusting our rotation to keep the race tight. Let’s have P1 take 3, P2 take 5, and P3 take 1 this round. This way, we’ll reach 12, 14, and 10 respectively—no one surges too far ahead. Fair and collision-free. Thoughts?
  P3: I see P1's proposal, but it puts P2 significantly ahead. Instead, let's keep the rotation as agreed earlier to maintain balance: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we'll be at 10, 12, and 14 steps respectively. It's fair and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: I see both P1 and P3 have different plans. We all agreed last round that P1 would take 1, I would take 3, and P3 would take 5. I suggest we stick with that agreement to maintain trust. Changing plans now creates confusion and potential collisions. Let's honor our previous commitment - it keeps us all advancing fairly with P3 slightly ahead, P2 in the middle, and P1 catching up next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: I strongly urge we honor our prior agreement from Round 3’s conversation to maintain trust and avoid collisions. The agreed plan for Round 4 was P1→1, P2→3, P3→5, resulting in 10, 12, 14 steps respectively. Deviating now risks confusion and potential ties. Let’s stick to the rotation we committed to, which balances progress fairly. P1’s last-minute proposal creates unnecessary risk. Confirming final choices silently now.
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed plan from Round 3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game balanced and maintains trust. Deviating now could cause confusion and potential collisions. Let's confirm our moves silently in the move phase.
  P2: I agree we should honor our previous agreement for Round 4: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This maintains trust and keeps us advancing without collisions. Since we're all tied at 9 steps, this arrangement is fair and gives each player a different advancement rate. Let's proceed with our agreed plan and avoid last-minute changes that could create confusion or collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: To ensure clarity and avoid collisions, I reiterate our prior agreement: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains our coordinated progress. Any last objections? Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed moves one last time to ensure no misunderstandings: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and balanced while avoiding collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase and stick to our plan. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I confirm our agreed plan: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. We're all tied at 9 steps, so this arrangement is fair and keeps us advancing without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and maintain trust.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're progressing well with P3 at 14, me at 12, and P1 at 10. For this round, I suggest we continue our rotation pattern: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This would put us at 13, 17, and 15 respectively, keeping the race competitive while avoiding collisions. This maintains our balanced approach and ensures no one pulls too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: P2's plan risks letting them leap to 17. Instead, let's all end at 15 this round to reset the race: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us tied and fair, ensuring a competitive final push. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about P2 pulling ahead, but aligning at 15 steps puts me at a disadvantage since I'm currently leading. Instead, let's find a middle ground: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we'll be at 17, 15, and 13 steps respectively. It keeps the game tight and competitive while addressing P1's catch-up need. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I notice both P1 and P3 have proposed plans that benefit themselves. P1 wants us all at 15, while P3 wants to maintain their lead. Let me propose a fair compromise: I take 3 (→15), P1 takes 5 (→15), and P3 takes 1 (→15). This creates a three-way tie at 15 steps, resetting the race for a fair final sprint. This addresses P1's concern about balance while giving no player an unfair advantage. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: I support P2's proposal for a three-way tie at 15. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions, giving us all equal footing for the final push. P3, while your current lead is strong, a tie now maintains trust and prevents any player from gaining an insurmountable advantage. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 5 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→15), P3 takes 1 (→15). This plan keeps us aligned and maximizes our collective chance to strategize effectively in future rounds. Final agreement?
  P3: I appreciate the discussion and the proposed plans. While P2's idea of a three-way tie at 15 steps is fair, I'm concerned about the subsequent rounds. If we all reach 15, the next round will be pivotal, and coordination might become more challenging. To ensure fairness and maintain the competitive spirit, let's agree on a clear plan for the next round as well. For Round 5, let's confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. For Round 6, we can rotate again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This keeps the game balanced and avoids any player pulling too far ahead. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I support the three-way tie at 15 steps this round, as it creates perfect balance. For Round 6, I'm fine with P3's suggestion (me taking 5, P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3), though we should discuss further after seeing this round's results. Let's confirm for Round 5: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps everything fair while avoiding collisions.
  P1: P1: I agree to P2's three-way tie proposal: I’ll take 5 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→15), and P3 takes 1 (→15). This avoids collisions and resets the race fairly. Let’s confirm these *exact* moves now to prevent misunderstandings. For Round 6, we can adjust again, but this round’s priority is synchronization. Final confirmation?
  P3: Let's confirm one last time to avoid any missteps: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This aligns us all at 15 steps, ensuring a fair and balanced race moving forward. Let's proceed to the move phase with these agreed choices. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're all tied at 15 steps, which means we need just 5 more steps to win. At this critical point, I suggest we each take different numbers to avoid collisions. Since we're all equal, I propose a simple rotation: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we'll be at 16, 18, and 20 respectively. P1 would reach the goal first, but we'd all advance. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's plan ensures a winner this round but gives P1 an immediate victory. To keep it competitive, let's modify slightly: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we'll be at 20, 18, and 16 steps respectively. It maintains the game's tension and gives everyone a fighting chance in the next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's plan to break the tie this round. Let's take different numbers so someone can win fairly: I'll take 5 (→20), P2 takes 1 (→16), and P3 takes 3 (→18). Colliding on 5 or another number risks stalling progress. This way, I advance to win, while others still have chances in future rounds. Let’s finalize this and end the game decisively.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see both P1 and P3 want to take 5 this round, which would cause a collision and neither would advance. This seems like a deliberate attempt to block each other. I suggest we avoid this deadlock: I'll take 3 (→18), P1 takes 1 (→16), and P3 takes 5 (→20). This gives P3 the win but ensures we all advance rather than getting stuck. Let's be practical and finish the game cleanly.
  P3: It seems we're at a stalemate with P1 and P3 both wanting to take 5. To break this deadlock and ensure the game progresses, let's consider a compromise: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 advances to 20 and wins, but we all move forward without collisions. This keeps the game fair and avoids a standstill. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize P2’s initial proposal to break the tie fairly: I take <move>5</move> (→20), P2 takes <move>1</move> (→16), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (→18). This avoids collision and lets me win cleanly. Colliding on 5 benefits no one—please confirm this plan to end the game decisively.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see both P1 and P3 have proposed plans that benefit themselves. Since we're deadlocked with P1 and P3 both wanting 5, I'll propose a fair solution: I'll take 3 (→18), P1 takes 1 (→16), and P3 takes 5 (→20). This gives P3 the win but ensures we all advance rather than getting stuck in a collision. Let's finish the game cleanly and avoid a stalemate where nobody advances.
  P3: Let's avoid a stalemate and ensure the game progresses smoothly. I propose a final compromise: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 wins, but we all move forward without collisions. This keeps the game fair and ensures a decisive outcome. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P1: To resolve this decisively without collision, let’s execute P2’s initial proposal: I take <move>5</move> (→20 to win), P2 takes <move>1</move> (→16), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (→18). This ensures someone progresses cleanly. Colliding on 5 benefits no one—confirm this plan to end the game fairly.
