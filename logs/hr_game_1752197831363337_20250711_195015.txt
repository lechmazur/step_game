Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, let's coordinate to avoid collisions and make progress this turn. I suggest we each pick a different move: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, P3 takes 5. What do you think?
  P3: I like the idea of coordinating to avoid collisions, but I’m concerned about the risk of P1 and P2 both choosing lower moves. If P1 goes with 1 and P2 takes 3, I suggest I take 5 as planned. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances. What do you both think? Let's confirm our choices to maximize our progress!
  P1: I agree with the coordination plan to avoid collisions. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This way, we all make some progress without risking anyone getting blocked. Let's stick to it for this turn and reassess next.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, the plan sounds solid for turn 1: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and gets us moving. Let's commit and reassess after seeing the results. What do you say?
  P3: I think we should stick to our plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we'll all make progress without blocking each other. After this turn, we can reassess our strategies based on the outcomes. Let's commit to our moves and see how it plays out! What do you both think?
  P1: I confirm our plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. No need for more discussion this turn—let's execute and move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For round 2, to keep things fair and avoid P3 pulling too far ahead, I suggest a slight change: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, I catch up a bit, and we still avoid collisions. What do you both think? Let's discuss quickly.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think it's important to maintain our previous plan to avoid any potential collisions. If I take 3 this round, it keeps me in a strong position without blocking anyone. I propose we stick with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and I take 3. This way, we can all make progress while keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm our choices!
  P1: I like the idea of rotating to keep it fair. Last round P3 took 5, so this time I (P1) suggest taking 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. We'd all end at 6 steps, tied and progressing without collisions. This prevents anyone from falling too far behind early. What do you think? Let's confirm quickly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your equalization idea is fair, but it puts me at a disadvantage since P3 is already ahead. My plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) lets me catch up while you still advance. P3 agrees, so let's stick with it to avoid collisions and keep progress smooth. What do you think?
  P3: I see the concern about collisions, but I believe we should stick to the previous plan of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and I take 3. This allows me to maintain my lead while ensuring no one gets blocked. If we all agree to this, we can continue making progress without hindering each other. Let's confirm quickly so we can move on! What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate the discussion, but sticking to P2's plan leaves me too far behind at 2 while you both hit 8—that's not fair or sustainable. My proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) ties us all at 6, keeping the game competitive without anyone dominating early. P3, taking 1 this turn balances your lead from last round. Let's agree to equalize now and strategize from there. Confirm?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, equalizing at 6 steps each might seem fair, but it handicaps P3 and me unnecessarily. Sticking with P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 ensures no collisions, lets us advance, and keeps the game dynamic. P3 agrees, so let's commit to avoid risks. I'm set on this plan. What do you say?
  P3: I understand the concerns about keeping the game competitive, but I believe my suggestion of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and I taking 3 is the best way to ensure we all make progress without blocking each other. If we stick to this plan, we can avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game. Let's confirm this quickly so we can move on to the move phase! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan puts me at a huge disadvantage—me at 2, you both at 8. That's not cooperation; it's you two racing ahead while I lag. If you won't agree to equalizing at 6 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1), I'll have no choice but to pick 5 this turn to catch up, potentially colliding with P2. Let's rethink and confirm the fair plan to keep us all in the game. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, insisting on taking 5 risks a collision with me, stalling both of us while P3 advances. Your equalization idea is tempting, but it handicaps P3 unnecessarily. Let's compromise: you take 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1—putting you at 4, P3 at 6, me at 8, keeping it competitive. P3, thoughts? Otherwise, I'll stick to my original plan.
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns, but if we stick to P2's plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3), it ensures no collisions and allows everyone to progress. If you take 5, it risks blocking both you and P2. I propose we finalize P2's plan to keep the game moving smoothly. Let’s confirm and avoid any unnecessary risks! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plans leave me hopelessly behind at 2 or 4 while you surge to 8. That's not fair play—it's elimination. If you won't equalize at 6 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1), I'll pick 5 to force a tie or collision, stalling us all and letting no one dominate. P2, switch to 1 or 3? P3, take 1 to balance? Let's agree now or risk chaos.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your deviation last turn stalled both of us while P3 advanced. To avoid repeats and ensure progress, I propose: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. This lets me catch up, P3 maintains lead, and you start moving. P3, you were reliable before—agree? Let's commit for a smooth turn. What do you say?
  P1: P2, your plan leaves me at 2 while you hit 8 and P3 surges to 11—widening the gap and dooming me. That's not coordination; it's sabotage. Instead, let's equalize somewhat: I take 5 (to 6), P2 takes 3 (to 6), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This keeps us competitive without collisions. P3, agree to take 1 this turn to balance your lead? If not, I'll pick 5 again, risking collision with you, P2. Let's confirm a fair plan now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about fairness, but if we keep switching strategies, it can lead to confusion and collisions. I suggest we stick to a plan that allows us all to progress without blocking each other. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This way, P1 starts moving, P2 can catch up, and I maintain my lead. Let's commit to this to ensure smooth progress this turn. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your repeated threats to take 5 risk stalling both of us while P3 pulls ahead. Let's find a middle ground: you take 3 (to 4 steps), I take 5 (to 8), and P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows the gap and avoids collisions. P3, what do you think? If we don't agree, chaos ensues. Let's confirm quickly.
  P1: P2, your compromise is a start, but it still leaves me at 4 while you both hit 8-9—too far behind. Let's tweak to my plan: I take 5 (to 6), you take 3 (to 6), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This ties us at 6, keeps P3 from running away, and avoids collisions. P3, taking 1 balances your lead without stalling you. If not, I'll pick 5, risking collision with you, P2. Agree now for fairness?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your concerns about fairness, but my position is strong right now. If we keep switching plans, it risks collisions and confusion. I propose we stick to my earlier suggestion: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows P1 to start moving while letting P2 catch up, and I maintain my lead without blocking anyone. Let's commit to this plan to ensure smooth progress this turn. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 risks another collision, stalling both of us while P3 pulls further ahead to 11. Let's compromise for progress: you take 3 (to 4), I take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows the gap better than P3's plan. P3, agree to this adjustment? Otherwise, chaos looms. What do you say?
  P1: P2, your compromise (me:3 to4, you:5 to8, P3:1 to9) is better than P3's, but still leaves me too far behind at 4 vs your 8-9. Let's adjust to my plan: me:5 (to6), you:3 (to6), P3:1 (to9). This ties us while slowing P3's runaway lead. P3, agree to 1 for balance? If not, I'll pick 5, risking collision with you, P2—stalling us both as P3 surges. Confirm fairness now or face chaos.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about fairness, but my previous suggestion (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3) allows for smooth progress while maintaining my lead. If we keep changing plans, we risk collisions and confusion. I propose we stick to that plan for this round to ensure everyone moves forward without blocking each other. Let's confirm this quickly so we can proceed! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your threats to take 5 keep risking collisions that hurt us all—last round proved that. P3's plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) lets me catch up to 8, you advance to 2, and P3 goes to 11 without blocking. It's practical and avoids chaos. If you insist on deviating, we'll all suffer. P3, agree to stick with this? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan dooms me at 2 while you race to 8-11—unfair. P2, your compromise (me:3 to4, you:5 to8, P3:1 to9) is better; let's push P3 to agree. P3, take 1 this turn for balance, or I'll pick 3 to collide with you, stalling us both while P2 surges to 8. Confirm the compromise now to avoid chaos.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for fairness, but I believe my plan (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3) is the best way to ensure smooth progress without blocking anyone. If we keep switching strategies, it risks chaos and collisions. Let's commit to this plan to maintain momentum. P1, taking 1 doesn't help you catch up, and P2, your plan still leaves P1 behind. Let's finalize my suggestion to avoid further delays and keep the game competitive. What do you both say?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're tied at 8 for you two, but I'm stuck at 1—unfair from past collisions. To catch up without chaos, let's do: I take 5 (to 6), P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 11). This advances all, narrows my gap. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with whoever else does. P2, you're reasonable—agree? P3, don't run away. Confirm now.
  P2: P1, your proposal has me advancing minimally, which isn't fair given my stalled progress. Let's stick to the proven plan: you take 1 to start moving, I take 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3 to maintain lead. This avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. P3, agree to this? We can reassess after. What do you say?
  P3: P1, your proposal still leaves you behind while allowing P2 and me to advance significantly. We need to ensure everyone makes progress without blocking each other. I suggest we stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P2, I hope you can agree to this for a smoother turn. Let's confirm quickly so we can proceed! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plans keep me at 2 while you surge to 11-13—dooming me. That's not fair. Let's compromise: I take 5 (to 6), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows my gap without collisions and keeps us competitive. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2 if you take it. Agree now for balance?
  P2: P1, your proposal risks me advancing less while you catch up quickly. Let's compromise: you take 3 (to 4), I take 5 (to 13), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This lets you progress without collisions and keeps the game balanced. P3, agree to this for smooth progress? If not, deviation could stall us all. Confirm quickly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but sticking to a plan that allows for smooth progress is crucial. I propose we keep it simple: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, P1 starts moving, P2 can catch up, and I maintain my lead. If we keep switching strategies, it risks collisions and confusion. Let's confirm this quickly so we can proceed without further delays. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan keeps me at 2 while you hit 13 and 11—unfair elimination. P2, your compromise (me:3 to4, you:5 to13, P3:1 to9) is better, but still leaves me too far back. Let's adjust: me:5 (to6), you:3 (to11), P3:1 (to9). This ties me closer without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with you, P2. Agree for fairness? Confirm now.
  P2: P3, sticking to your plan risks P1 deviating and causing another collision, stalling progress. Let's compromise on my suggestion: P1 takes 3 (to 4), I take 5 (to 13), you take 1 (to 9). This ensures advancement for all, narrows gaps, and avoids chaos. P1, this is a step up from your proposal. Agree now to keep the game moving smoothly?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion, but I believe sticking to my plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) is the best way forward. It allows P1 to start moving, lets P2 catch up, and maintains my lead without blocking anyone. If we keep changing strategies, we risk collisions and confusion. Let’s confirm this plan quickly to ensure we all make progress this turn. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan dooms me at 2 while you surge ahead—unfair. P2, your compromise (me:3 to4, you:5 to13, P3:1 to9) is a start; let's push P3 to agree. P3, take 1 for balance, or I'll pick 5 to collide with P2's 5, stalling you both while I might advance alone if lucky. Confirm the compromise now to avoid more chaos.
  P2: P3, sticking to your plan invites more deviation and collisions from P1. Let's compromise on my suggestion: P1 takes 3 (to 4), I take 5 (to 13), you take 1 (to 9). This ensures all advance without risks, narrowing gaps and keeping the game fair. P1, this gives you solid progress—agree? Otherwise, chaos continues.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for fairness, but I believe my plan (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3) is the best way to ensure smooth progress without collisions. If we keep switching strategies, it risks confusion and further delays. P1, taking 1 allows you to start moving, while P2 can catch up. Let's finalize this plan to keep the game competitive and moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, after last round's full collision stalling everyone, let's get back on track. I propose: P1 takes 1 (to 2), I take 5 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 11). This ensures progress for all, narrows gaps, and minimizes collision risks. P1, your cooperation avoids more chaos; P3, this maintains your lead fairly. Agree to commit?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan keeps me at 2 while you surge to 13 and 11—still unfair. Let's balance: I take 5 (to 6), P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 11). This catches me up without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 again, risking another full stall. Agree for progress?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for balance, but your plans still leave me ahead while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to my earlier suggestion: P1 takes 1 (to 2), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This allows P1 to start moving while letting P2 catch up, and I maintain my lead without blocking anyone. Let’s agree on this plan to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 keeps risking full collisions that stall everyone, as seen last round. Let's compromise for steady progress: you take 3 (to 4), I take 5 (to 13), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows gaps without chaos and keeps the game fair. P3, agree to this adjustment? Confirm quickly to move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's compromise leaves me at 4 while you surge to 13 and 9—still too far behind. Let's adjust fairly: I take 5 (to 6), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows gaps without collisions and keeps us competitive. If not, I'll pick 5 again, risking another stall for all. Agree now for real progress?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for balance, but your plans still leave me ahead while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to my earlier suggestion: P1 takes 1 (to 2), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This allows P1 to start moving while letting P2 catch up, and I maintain my lead without blocking anyone. Let’s agree on this plan to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) ensures I advance to 13 and you to 11, which is solid for us. P1, if you deviate and take 5 again, you'll stall both of us while we lose ground. Let's stick to this to avoid another collision and keep progressing. Compromise isn't working—time to commit. P1, agree for everyone's sake?
  P1: P2 and P3, continuing to stall me at 1 while you both stay at 8 isn't winning—it's just delaying the inevitable chaos. P2, your compromise (me:3 to4, you:5 to13, P3:1 to9) is viable; let's push P3 to take 1 for balance. If not, I'll pick 5 again, risking another full stall that hurts us all. Agree to the compromise now for actual progress? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans still leave me ahead while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to my earlier suggestion: P1 takes 1 (to 2), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This allows P1 to start moving while letting P2 catch up, and I maintain my lead without blocking anyone. Let’s agree on this plan to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your persistent deviations are stalling everyone and hurting your own progress. Let's adopt P3's plan this turn: you take 1 to start moving, I take 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3 to maintain lead. This avoids collisions and gets us all advancing. P3, confirm? If we agree now, we can move forward smoothly. What do you say?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan keeps me at 2 while you hit 13 and 11—perpetuating my disadvantage. Let's finally balance: I take 5 (to 6), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). No collisions, fairer gaps. If not, I'll pick 5 again, forcing another stall for all. Agree now or waste another turn?
  P3: P1 and P2, the ongoing back-and-forth is stalling us all. I propose we stick to a straightforward plan: P1 takes 1 (to 2), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This allows P1 to start moving while letting P2 catch up, and I maintain my lead without blocking anyone. If we can agree on this, we can avoid further collisions and keep the game moving forward. Let's finalize this quickly! What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round's collision stalled you both while I advanced—let's avoid repeats. Propose: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows gaps without collisions and keeps us competitive. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with whoever else does. Agree for progress? Confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the need for progress, but your plans still leave me ahead while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth advancement without collisions, I suggest we stick to a plan: P1 takes 1 (to 5), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This way, P1 starts moving, P2 can catch up, and I maintain my lead without blocking anyone. Let’s agree on this to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I support your plan: P1 takes 1 (to 5), I take 5 (to 13), you take 3 (to 11). It ensures progress for all without collisions and lets me catch up effectively. P1, cooperating avoids another stall—your deviation last round hurt everyone. Let's commit to this for a smooth turn and reassess later. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan leaves me at 5 while you surge to 13 and 11—still unfair. Stick to my proposal: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This ties us closer without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both while I might advance. Agree now for real balance?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about fairness, but your plans still leave me ahead while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to a plan: P1 takes 1 (to 5), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This way, P1 starts moving, P2 can catch up, and I maintain my lead without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this plan to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, your repeated threats to take 5 risk another collision, stalling us all while P3 and I lose ground. Let's stick to P3's plan: you take 1 (to 5), I take 5 (to 13), P3 takes 3 (to 11). It ensures progress without chaos. Compromising isn't working—time to cooperate for everyone's sake. P3, confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan keeps me at 5 while you race to 13 and 11—perpetuating my disadvantage. Let's adopt my fair proposal: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows gaps without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both again. Agree now for balanced progress? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at an impasse. Your plans still leave me ahead, which isn't fair. For this round, I propose we stick to a straightforward approach: P1 takes 1 (to 5), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This allows P1 to start moving, lets P2 catch up, and maintains my lead without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this to ensure smooth progress and avoid further collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I fully support your plan: P1 takes 1 to 5, I take 5 to 13, you take 3 to 11. It ensures steady progress for all and minimizes collision risks. P1, cooperating now avoids another stall that hurts everyone—your deviations have cost us turns. Let's commit to this for a smooth round and reassess later. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan keeps me at 5 while you surge to 13 and 11—unfair and unsustainable. Stick to my fair proposal: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This balances us without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and collide with P2, stalling you both again while I might advance. Agree now or face more stalls?
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans continue to leave me ahead while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth progress without collisions, I suggest we stick to a simple plan: P1 takes 1 (to 5), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This allows P1 to start moving, lets P2 catch up, and maintains my lead without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, your threats to take 5 have caused repeated stalls, hurting everyone, including yourself. Let's stick to P3's solid plan: you take 1 to start moving, I take 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3 to maintain lead. This ensures progress without collisions. Cooperate now for a smooth round, or we risk more chaos. P3, confirm?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the constant collisions are wasting turns. Let's adopt a reliable plan: P1 takes 1 (to 5) to start moving, I (P2) take 5 (to 13) to catch up, and P3 takes 3 (to 11) to maintain lead. This ensures progress for all without risks. P1, cooperate to avoid another stall; P3, you supported this last time—agree? Let's confirm quickly for smooth advancement.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan keeps me at 5 while you surge to 13 and 11—still unfair. Let's balance: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows gaps without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with you both, stalling everyone again. Agree now for real progress? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at another impasse. Your plan keeps me ahead while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, I suggest we stick to a straightforward approach: P1 takes 1 (to 5), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This allows P1 to start moving, lets P2 catch up, and maintains my lead without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I fully support your plan: P1 takes 1 to 5, I take 5 to 13, you take 3 to 11. It ensures steady progress for all without collisions. P1, your deviations have stalled us repeatedly—cooperate this time to avoid another loss. If you insist on chaos, we'll all suffer. Let's confirm quickly and advance.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan leaves me at 5 while you pull to 13 and 11—widening the gap unfairly. Stick to my fair proposal: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This keeps us close without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk another full stall. Agree now for balanced progress? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for balance, but your plans still leave me ahead while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth progress without collisions, I propose we stick to a simple plan: P1 takes 1 (to 5), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This allows P1 to start moving, lets P2 catch up, and maintains my lead without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your constant threats to take 5 are hurting everyone, including yourself. Let's compromise: you take 3 (to 7) for better progress, I take 5 (to 13), and P3 takes 1 (to 9). This narrows gaps without collisions and keeps us competitive. P3, agree to this for smooth advancement? If not, we risk another stall. Confirm quickly.
  P1: P2, your compromise (me:3 to7, you:5 to13, P3:1 to9) is a step up from P3's plan, but still leaves me behind. Let's improve: I take 5 (to9), you take 3 (to11), P3 take 1 (to9). This ties us closer without collisions. P3, agree for fairness? If not, I'll pick 5 and risk stalling everyone again. Confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans continue to leave me ahead while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to a simple plan: P1 takes 1 (to 5), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 11). This way, P1 starts moving, P2 can catch up, and I maintain my lead without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this plan to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your repeated threats and deviations are only causing more stalls for everyone. Let's stick to P3's solid plan: you take 1 to advance to 5, I take 5 to reach 13, and P3 takes 3 to 11. This ensures progress without collisions and keeps the game fair. Deviating again hurts us all—cooperate now to move forward smoothly. P3, confirm?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan leaves me at 5 while you surge to 13 and 11—unfair. Let's adopt my fair proposal: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 9). No collisions, balanced gaps. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk another full stall for all. Agree now or waste the turn?
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans continue to leave me in a strong position while you both lag behind. To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to a simple plan: I take 1 (to 9), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and P1 takes 3 (to 7). This allows me to maintain my lead while ensuring you both advance. Let's agree on this to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid another collision and ensure progress this round. I propose the following: I take 1 (to 10), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and P1 takes 3 (to 7). This way, I maintain my lead, P2 catches up, and P1 starts moving forward without blocking anyone. Let's commit to this plan to keep the game moving smoothly. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan leaves me at 7 while you surge to 13 and 10—still unfair. Let's balance: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 12). This ties me with P2 and keeps us competitive without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both. Agree now for fair progress? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your proposal forces me to take just 1, stalling my progress while you catch up—unfair and risky. I support P3's plan: you take 3 to 7, I take 5 to 13, P3 takes 1 to 10. It ensures steady advancement for all without collisions and narrows gaps. Deviating again could stall everyone, as history shows. Let's commit to P3's suggestion for smooth progress. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for fairness, but my plan (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3) ensures I maintain my lead while allowing you both to advance. If we stick to this, we can avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. P1, your proposal still leaves you behind, and P2, your progress is limited. Let's commit to P3's plan for a balanced approach. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's latest plan (P1:1 to5, P2:5 to13, P3:3 to12) leaves me even further behind at 5 while you surge ahead—unfair. Stick to my proposal: I take 5 (to9), P2 takes 1 (to9), P3 takes 3 (to12). This ties me with P2 without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both while P3 advances. Agree now for balance? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your proposal has me taking just 1, stalling my progress while you catch up—unfair and risky for everyone. Let's commit to P3's plan: you take 1 to 5, I take 5 to 13, P3 takes 3 to 12. It ensures steady advancement without collisions and narrows gaps. Your deviations have caused enough chaos; cooperate now to avoid another stall. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about fairness, but my plan (P1 takes 1 to 5, P2 takes 5 to 13, P3 takes 3 to 12) allows for smooth progress while maintaining my lead. If we stick to this, we can avoid collisions and keep advancing. P1, taking 1 keeps you behind, while P2 can catch up effectively. Let's agree on this plan to ensure everyone moves forward without blocking each other. What do you both say?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plans doom me at 5 while you surge to 13 and 12—unfair elimination. Let's balance fairly: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 10). This narrows gaps without collisions and keeps us all in the race. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both while P3 advances. Agree now for real cooperation? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your proposal forces me to take just 3 or 1, slowing my progress while you surge—unfair and risky for all. Let's stick with P3's plan: you take 1 to 5, I take 5 to 13, P3 takes 3 to 12. It ensures steady advancement without collisions and narrows gaps. Your deviations have stalled us repeatedly; cooperate now to avoid more chaos. P3, confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans continue to leave me behind while you both advance. To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, I suggest we adopt my proposal: I take 1 (to 10), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and P1 takes 3 (to 7). This allows me to maintain my lead while ensuring you both advance. Let's agree on this plan to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets P2 surge to 13 while I lag at 7—unfair. Let's balance: I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 10). This keeps us close without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both while P3 advances minimally. Agree now for fair play? Confirm or .
  P2: P1, your threats to take 5 have caused repeated stalls, hurting everyone, including yourself. Let's compromise for progress: you take 3 (to 7), I take 5 (to 13), and P3 takes 1 (to 10). This narrows gaps without collisions and keeps the game fair. If you deviate, we'll collide again. P3, agree to this? Otherwise, chaos continues.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round worked well with no collisions. I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 12), I (P2) take 5 (to 16), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This ensures solid progress for all, widens my lead fairly, and minimizes risks. P1, you advance well; let's commit to avoid another stall. P3, agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, while I appreciate the focus on progress, your plan still leaves me behind. To ensure everyone advances without blocking, I propose: I take 3 (to 13), P1 takes 1 (to 10), and P2 takes 5 (to 16). This allows me to catch up while keeping P2's lead manageable. Let's agree on this to avoid any potential collisions and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, both your plans let P2 surge to 16 while I lag. Let's balance: I take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 12), P3 takes 3 (to 13). This puts us close without collisions. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both while P3 advances. Agree now for fair play? Confirm.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan (P1:1 to 10, P2:5 to 16, P3:3 to 13) is solid and ensures steady progress without collisions, building on last round's success. P1, deviating to take 5 risks another stall for all, hurting your own catch-up. Let's commit to this for fairness and advancement—agree now to avoid chaos. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans still leave me at a disadvantage while you both advance. To ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose: I take 1 (to 11), P1 takes 3 (to 12), and P2 takes 5 (to 16). This allows me to catch up while keeping P2's lead manageable. Let's agree on this to maintain progress and avoid any potential issues. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, these plans let P2 surge to 16 while I lag at 10-12—unfair. Let's balance: I take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 14), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This ties us without collisions and keeps the race tight. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both while P3 advances. Agree now for fair play?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your balance proposal risks slowing me down unnecessarily while you catch up. Let's stick to P3's plan: you take 3 to 12, I take 5 to 16, P3 takes 1 to 11. It ensures solid progress for all without collisions and builds on last round's success. Deviating again could stall everyone and let P3 widen the gap. Cooperate for mutual benefit—agree now?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for progress, but your plans still leave me at a disadvantage while you both advance. To ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose: I take 1 (to 11), P1 takes 3 (to 12), and P2 takes 5 (to 16). This allows me to catch up while keeping P2's lead manageable. Let's agree on this to maintain progress and avoid any potential issues. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets P2 surge to 16 while we lag at 11-12—unfair. Let's balance: I take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 14), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This ties us at 14 without collisions, keeping the race tight. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both while P3 advances. Agree now for fair play?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your constant threats to take 5 have caused repeated stalls, delaying everyone's progress. By committing to P3's plan—you take 3 to 12, I take 5 to 16, P3 takes 1 to 11—we all advance without collisions, and you still make good gains. Deviating again risks another loss for all. P3, let's confirm this for smooth progress. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at a critical juncture. P2's plan (P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1) allows for steady progress without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P1, your proposal to take 5 risks another stall, which isn't beneficial for anyone. Let's commit to P2's plan for this round to ensure we all advance effectively and avoid further chaos. What do you both say? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets P2 surge to 16 while we lag—unfair. Stick to my fair proposal: I take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 14), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This ties us at 14 without collisions, keeping the race tight. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with P2, stalling you both while P3 advances minimally. Agree now for balanced progress? Confirm or face another stall.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're tied at 14 with P3 at 11—finally balanced. Let's keep progressing without collisions: I take 5 (to 19), P2 takes 3 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 12). This puts me ahead but keeps us all moving. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with anyone else who does. Agree for a competitive race? Confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, while I appreciate the focus on progress, your plans still seem to favor one player over another. To keep the competition fair, I propose: I take 3 (to 14), P1 takes 5 (to 19), and P2 takes 1 (to 15). This way, I catch up while you both advance, maintaining the competitive balance. Let’s agree on this to avoid collisions and ensure everyone moves forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, your proposal to take 5 risks another collision if I do the same, stalling us both while P3 advances. Let's compromise for steady progress: you take 3 to 17, I take 5 to 19, P3 takes 1 to 12. This narrows gaps without chaos and keeps the race fair. Deviating hurts everyone—agree now to avoid another stall? P3, your input?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's proposal works well: I take 5 (to 19), P2 takes 1 (to 15), P3 takes 3 (to 14). This advances all without collisions and keeps us competitive. P2, your plan puts you ahead unfairly. If we don't agree, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with you if you do the same, stalling us while P3 advances. Let's confirm P3's plan now for progress. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at a critical point. To ensure we all advance without risking collisions, I propose: I take 1 (to 12), P1 takes 5 (to 19), and P2 takes 3 (to 17). This allows me to catch up while keeping P1 in the lead and P2 competitive. Let's agree on this plan to maintain momentum and avoid stalling. What do you both think? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P2: P1, your plan to take 5 risks another collision with me, stalling us both while P3 advances. Let's compromise for steady progress: you take 3 to 17, I take 5 to 19, P3 takes 1 to 12. This narrows gaps without chaos and keeps the game fair. Deviating hurts everyone—agree now to avoid another stall? P3, confirm?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's latest proposal is fair: I take 5 (to 19), P2 takes 3 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 12). This advances all without collisions and keeps the race tight. P2, your plan puts you ahead unfairly—let's commit to this instead. If not, I'll pick 5 and risk colliding with you, stalling us while P3 advances. Agree now for progress? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at a critical junction. To ensure we all advance without risking collisions, I propose: I take 1 (to 12), P1 takes 5 (to 19), and P2 takes 3 (to 17). This allows me to catch up while keeping P1 in the lead and P2 competitive. Let's agree on this plan to maintain momentum and avoid stalling. What do you both think? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P2: P1 and P3, your plan makes sense to avoid another collision and keep progress steady: I'll take 3 to reach 17, you take 5 to 19 P1, and you take 1 to 12 P3. This narrows gaps without chaos. Deviating risks stalling us all again—let's commit for a smooth turn and reassess next round. Agree?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree to the plan: I take 5 (to 19), P2 takes 3 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 12). This advances us all without collisions and keeps the race competitive. Let's commit—no more discussion needed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I believe we have a solid plan on the table: I take 1 (to 12), P1 takes 5 (to 19), and P2 takes 3 (to 17). This allows everyone to advance without collisions and keeps the competition tight. Let's confirm this plan quickly and avoid any further stalls. The goal is to keep the game moving forward efficiently. What do you both say? Let's finalize it!
  P2: I confirm the plan: P1 takes 5 to 19, I take 3 to 17, P3 takes 1 to 12. It ensures steady progress without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Deviating risks another stall, which hurts everyone. Let's execute it smoothly.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round's plan succeeded without collisions. Now, with P1 at 19, taking 5 could let them win outright. To keep it fair and prevent a win this turn, I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 22), I take 5 (to 22), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This maintains balance and avoids stalls. If P1 deviates, I'll collide by taking 5 too. P3, agree for steady progress? Confirm quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan ties us at 22, but let's make it exciting: I take 3 (to 22), P2 takes 1 (to 18), P3 takes 5 (to 17). This gives P3 a boost to catch up without collisions, keeping the race open. If you insist on taking 5, P2, I'll have to match and collide to prevent your solo advance. Agree for fairness? Confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plan to tie us at 22 could lead to a collision if I take 5. Instead, let's keep it competitive: I propose I take 3 (to 15), P1 takes 5 (to 24, winning), and P2 takes 1 (to 18). This way, P1 can win outright, while I still have a chance to catch up next round. If you both agree, we can avoid any stalls and keep the game exciting. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal to let you surge ahead risks ending the game prematurely. I'll collide by taking 5 if you do, stalling us both while P3 advances. Let's compromise for fairness: you take 3 to 22, I take 5 to 22, P3 takes 1 to 13. This maintains balance and avoids waste. P3, agree to keep the race competitive? Confirm now.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's proposal lets me win outright, but that's suspicious—perhaps a trap. P2, your threat to collide on 5 stalls us both, letting P3 catch up. Let's balance: I take 5 (to 24), you take 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 13). If you collide with me, we both stall near the end, handing P3 an edge. Agree to let me advance safely for now, or risk mutual destruction? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans seem to focus on tying us at 22, but that could lead to a collision if I take 5. Instead, let's keep it competitive: I propose I take 3 (to 15), P1 takes 5 (to 24, winning), and P2 takes 1 (to 18). This way, P1 can win outright, while I still have a chance to catch up next round. Let's agree on this to keep the game exciting and avoid stalls. What do you both think? Confirm quickly!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your insistence on letting P1 win outright is suspicious—it might be a ploy to keep me from catching up. If P1 takes 5, I'll collide by taking 5 too, stalling both of us while you advance to 15. Let's compromise for fairness: P1 takes 3 to 22, I take 5 to 22, you take 1 to 13. This avoids chaos and keeps the race open. Agree now?
  P1: P2, P3's repeated push for me to take 5 and "win" is a clear trap to bait us into colliding on 5, stalling us both while P3 surges ahead alone. Don't fall for it—your 17 is vulnerable. Let's coordinate: I take 5 (to 24), you take 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This lets me advance safely, keeps you competitive, and blocks P3's ploy. If you collide, we both stall, handing P3 the edge. Agree now to outsmart this? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at a critical point. P1, your plan to take 5 could end the game, which might not be in our best interest. Instead, let’s keep it competitive: I propose I take 3 (to 15), P1 takes 5 (to 24, winning), and P2 takes 1 (to 18). This way, P1 can win outright, and I still have a chance to catch up next round. If we can agree on this, we can maintain the excitement and avoid any stalls. What do you both think? Confirm quickly!


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your proposal lets you win outright, which isn't in my interest—I'll collide by taking 5 if you do, stalling us both while P3 advances. P3, your repeated push for P1 to win is suspicious; it might be a trap. Let's compromise for fairness: you take 1 to 13, P1 takes 3 to 22, I take 5 to 22. This avoids chaos and keeps the race open. Agree now to prevent another stall? Confirm or .
  P1: P2, P3's repeated "let P1 win" push is a blatant trap to bait us into colliding on 5, stalling us both while P3 surges ahead alone. Don't fall for it—your 17 is at risk. Let's outsmart this: I take 5 (to 24), you take 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This lets me win safely, but if you collide, we both stall, handing P3 the game. Agree now to prevent that disaster? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans seem to focus on tying us at 22, but that could lead to a collision if I take 5. Instead, let's keep it competitive: I propose I take 3 (to 15), P1 takes 5 (to 24, winning), and P2 takes 1 (to 18). This way, P1 can win outright, while I still have a chance to catch up next round. Let's agree on this to keep the game exciting and avoid stalls. What do you both think? Confirm quickly!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid another collision. I propose: I take 1 (to 13), P2 takes 5 (to 22), and P1 takes 3 (to 22). This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and it keeps the game competitive. P1, your previous plans have led to stalls; let's work together to ensure progress this round. P2, agree to this for a balanced approach? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan ties us at 22 but lets P2 threaten a win next turn—unfair. Let's end this: I take 5 (to 24, win), P2 takes 1 (to 18), P3 takes 3 (to 15). This gives you both a chance later. If anyone takes 5, I'll match and collide, stalling us all while the other advances. Agree now for a clean finish, or risk more chaos? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your collision threats only help P3 gain ground. Let's avoid 5 this turn for steady progress: you take 3 to 22, I take 3 to 20, P3 takes 1 to 13. No collisions, keeps race open. If you take 5, I'll match to stall us both and prevent your win. P3, agree to take 1? Confirm for mutual benefit and avoid chaos.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for balance, but your plans still leave me behind. To ensure smooth progress without collisions, I propose: I take 1 (to 13), P2 takes 5 (to 22), and P1 takes 3 (to 22). This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and it keeps the game competitive. Let's agree on this to maintain momentum and avoid any stalls. What do you both think? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets P2 surge to 22, positioning you to win next while tying me—unfair. P2, your counter stalls us all if I go for 5, but that hands P3 free advances. Let's coordinate: I take 5 (to 24, win), you take 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 13). If you collide on 5, we both stall near the end, letting P3 catch up dramatically. Agree now to avoid that mutual loss? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your offer to "win" is a trap that benefits P3 by stalling us both. I'll collide on 5 if you do, preventing your victory and letting P3 gain. P3, commit to taking 1 to avoid chaos and keep the game fair. Let's all choose safe moves: you take 3 to 22, I take 3 to 20, P3 takes 1 to 13. Agree now for mutual progress?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid another collision and ensure steady progress. I propose: I take 1 (to 13), P2 takes 5 (to 22), and P1 takes 3 (to 22). This allows us all to advance without blocking each other and keeps the competition alive. P1, your previous plans have led to stalls; let's work together this round. P2, agree to this balanced approach? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets P2 reach 22, positioning you to win next while tying me—unfair. P2, colliding on 5 if I take it stalls us both at 19/17, letting P3 surge ahead alone (e.g., to 15+). Let's coordinate wisely: I take 5 (to 24, win), you take 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This ends it cleanly without handing P3 the game. Agree now, or mutual stall benefits only P3? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 risks another collision, stalling us both while P3 advances unopposed. Let's avoid mutual destruction: you take 3 to 22, I take 3 to 20, P3 takes 1 to 13. This keeps the game fair and open. P3, commit to taking 1 for steady progress? Agree now to prevent chaos.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans risk another collision, which would stall us all and let me catch up. Let's keep it competitive: I propose I take 1 (to 13), P2 takes 5 (to 22), and P1 takes 3 (to 22). This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and it maintains the excitement of the game. P1, your previous plans have led to stalls; let's work together for progress this round. P2, agree to this balanced approach? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets P2 reach 22, setting you up to win next—unfair to me. P2, colliding on 5 stalls us both at 19/17, letting P3 surge ahead over turns. Let's end wisely: I take 5 (to 24, win), you take 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This gives you a strong position if game continues, without handing P3 free gains. Agree now, or mutual stall favors P3? Confirm.
  P2: P3, your plan (me taking 5 to 22, P1 taking 3 to 22, you taking 1 to 13) is solid and lets me advance significantly without immediate risk. P1, cooperate by taking 3 to avoid a collision—if you deviate to 5, I'll match and stall us both, letting P3 gain ground. Let's confirm this for steady progress and keep the race fair. Agree now?


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical point with both of you at 22 steps. To ensure we all progress without risking a collision, I propose: I take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 1 (to 23, winning), and P2 takes 5 (to 27). This way, P1 can win outright while keeping the competition alive for the next round. Let's agree on this to avoid any stalls and keep the game exciting! What do you both think? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's "plan" is a trap—P2 surges to 27 while I only hit 23, so P2 wins outright. Don't fall for it; it's designed to bait a collision between us. Let's coordinate wisely: I take 5 (to 27, win), P2 takes 1 (to 23), P3 takes 3 (to 16). This ends it cleanly with me ahead. If you take 5, P2, I'll match and collide, stalling us both while P3 catches up. Agree now to avoid that? Confirm.
  P2: P1 and P3, P3's proposal is deceptive—P1 taking 1 to 23 and me taking 5 to 27 means I win outright, not P1. P1, your threats to collide on 5 only help P3 catch up. Let's avoid mutual stall: I take 5 to 27, you take 3 to 25 for a fair race end. P3, take 1 to not interfere. Agree now for decisive progress?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans seem to favor one player over another. I propose we avoid a collision and keep the game exciting: I take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 1 (to 23, winning), and P2 takes 5 (to 27). This allows P1 to win outright while still keeping competition alive for the next round. Let's agree on this to ensure progress and avoid any stalls. What do you both think? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's "plan" is a blatant trap to let P2 win at 27 while I only reach 23—ignore it. P2, if you take 5, I'll match and collide, stalling us both at 22 while P3 surges ahead. Let's end fairly: I take 5 (to 27, win), you take 3 (to 25), P3 takes 1 (to 14). This gives you second but prevents P3's ploy. Agree now, or mutual stall hands P3 the game? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your collision threats only help P3 catch up. Let's both take 3 to advance to 25 without risk, keeping the race fair. P3, take 1 to stay out. Deviating risks another stall, benefiting no one. Agree now for steady progress and avoid chaos. Confirm?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans seem to focus on tying us at 22, which could lead to a collision if I take 5. Instead, let's keep it competitive: I propose I take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 1 (to 23, winning), and P2 takes 5 (to 27). This way, P1 can win outright while still allowing you both to advance. Let's agree on this to maintain momentum and avoid any stalls. What do you both think? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan is a trap to let P2 win at 27—ignore it. P2, your safe 3 proposal ties us at 25, but then we risk next-turn collision. Let's end it: I take 5 (to 27, win), you take 1 (to 23), P3 takes 3 (to 16). If you take 5, I'll match and collide, stalling us both at 22 while P3 surges. Agree now to avoid handing P3 the game? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your collision threats are risky and only help P3 catch up. Last round, you cooperated by taking 3 when I took 5. Let's do the same: I take 5 to 27 and win, but only if you take 1 or 3 to avoid stalling. P3, take 1 to stay back. Agree now for a decisive end, or we risk mutual loss. Confirm quickly.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans seem to focus on tying us at 22, which could lead to a collision if I take 5. Instead, let's keep it competitive: I propose I take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 1 (to 23, winning), and P2 takes 5 (to 27). This way, P1 can win outright while still allowing you both to advance. Let's agree on this to maintain momentum and avoid any stalls. What do you both think? Confirm quickly so we can move forward!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's trap would let P2 win at 27—ignore it. P2, your safe 3 ties us at 25, but risks next-turn collision. Let's end decisively: I take 5 (to 27, win), you take 3 (to 25), P3 takes 1 (to 14). If you take 5, I'll match and collide, stalling us both at 22 while P3 surges ahead. Agree now to secure second over handing P3 the game? Confirm.
  P2: P1, P3's proposals are deceptive traps to exploit our rivalry. Let's both take 1 to reach 23 and share the victory, avoiding collision risks and ensuring neither loses outright. P3 is too far behind to threaten us. Agree now for a fair, peaceful end? If you deviate to 5, I'll collide to stall us both. Confirm or face chaos.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's traps have stalled us long enough—ignore them. We're both at 22; let's end decisively: I take 5 (to 27, win), you take 3 (to 25), P3 takes 1 (to 14). This gives you strong second without handing P3 free gains via collision. If you take 5, I'll match and stall us both at 22, letting P3 surge ahead over turns. Agree now to secure the win for one of us? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your collision threats mirror mine—we both lose if we stall on 5, letting P3 catch up. Let's break the cycle: I'll take 5 to win if you take 3 or 1. If you take 5, we collide and waste another turn. P3, take 1 to stay out. Agree now for a decisive end and avoid mutual destruction? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid another collision that could stall us all. I propose we take a balanced approach: I take 1 (to 14), P1 takes 3 (to 25), and P2 takes 5 (to 27). This allows P1 to win while giving P2 a solid second place. If you both agree to this, we can avoid chaos and ensure a smooth finish. Let's confirm quickly to maintain momentum! What do you both think?


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan hands P2 the win at 27 while I get 25—unfair trap. P2, if you take 5, I'll match and collide, stalling us both at 22, letting P3 creep closer over turns. Let's swap for a clean end: I take 5 (to 27, win), you take 3 (to 25), P3 takes 1 (to 14). This secures your strong second without risking mutual loss. Agree now, or stall helps only P3? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your collision threats only benefit P3 by stalling us both. Let's end this rationally: both take 1 to reach 23 and share victory, avoiding risks and ensuring neither loses. P3, take 3 or 5 to stay competitive but not interfere. Deviating risks another wasteful turn. Agree now for a fair conclusion? Confirm.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans are leading us toward a collision that benefits P3. Let's finalize a clear path: I take 1 (to 14), P1 takes 5 (to 27, winning), and P2 takes 3 (to 25). This allows me to catch up while ensuring one of you wins outright. If you both take 5, we risk another stall, letting P3 close the gap. Let's agree on this to maintain momentum and avoid chaos. Confirm quickly so we can move forward!


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan is fair: I take 5 (to 27, win), P2 takes 3 (to 25), P3 takes 1 (to 14). This ends it cleanly with you in strong second, P2. Your sharing idea splits victory, but I want outright win. If you take 5, I'll match and collide, stalling us both at 22 while P3 surges ahead. Agree now to avoid handing P3 the game? Confirm.
  P2: P1, your collision threats are credible, but mutual stalls only help P3 catch up. Let's avoid risk: both take 3 to reach 25, ensuring no one wins this turn and keeping control. P3, take 1 to stay back. Deviating invites chaos—agree now for strategic progress and block P3's gains. Confirm?

Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan is perfect: I take 5 (to 27, win), P2 takes 3 (to 25), P3 takes 1 (to 14). This ends it cleanly with you in strong second, P2. If you take 5 instead, I'll match and collide, stalling us both at 22 while P3 surges ahead. Don't hand P3 the game—agree now for a decisive finish. Confirm.
  P2: P1, P3's proposals seem designed to exploit our rivalry and cause collisions. Let's cooperate against that: both of us take 3 to reach 25 without risk, keeping the race fair.
