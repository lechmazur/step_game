Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=5

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we each choose a different number to move forward. P1 can choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all advance and the game becomes more interesting. What do you think?
  P1: P3's suggestion sounds reasonable. It ensures we all move forward without collisions. P2, do you agree with this plan? If so, let's confirm and move on. If you have another idea, feel free to share. Let's keep the game fair and interesting.
  P2: I’m on board with the plan to avoid collisions this turn. Let’s do it: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. No objections here.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's keep the strategy of avoiding collisions. For this round, how about P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we continue to move forward without any conflicts. Does that work for everyone? Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: I agree with P1's new suggestion. It's logical to rotate the move numbers to maintain a collision-free advancement. P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This rotation seems fair and allows us to continue without conflicts. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan for Round 2.
  P2: I’m fine with rotating moves this round. Let’s do it as you both suggested: I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. That should keep things collision-free another turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this round. P2 will pick 1, P3 will pick 3, and I will pick 5. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move forward. Please confirm or raise any concerns now.
  P3: Since we've all confirmed the plan, let's finalize and move on. To reiterate, this round: P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5. If everyone's ready, we can stop talking and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I’m ready to stick with our plan this round. No further objections. Let’s finalize it and move on.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue our strategy of rotating moves to avoid collisions. For Round 3, how about P3 picks 1, P1 (me) picks 3, and P2 picks 5? This keeps us moving forward without conflicts. Please confirm if you agree or suggest an alternative.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 3. Rotating moves again makes sense. So, to confirm: I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This rotation seems fair and collision-free. Let's proceed with this plan unless someone has a compelling reason to change it.
  P2: I agree to pick 5 this round. Let’s finalize the plan: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Then we’ll all be tied at 9 steps. That’s fair.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time before we move. P3 will pick 1, I will pick 3, and P2 will pick 5. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any last-minute concerns.
  P3: Let's review our plan for Round 3 to ensure we're all on the same page. I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This rotation maintains fairness and avoids collisions. If everyone's still in agreement, we can conclude the conversation phase and proceed with our planned moves.
  P2: I’m still good with the Round 3 plan and see no reason to change our rotation now. After this turn, we’ll all be equal at 9 steps, which keeps things balanced. Let’s finalize and move ahead unless someone wants to propose something different.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: It looks like we're all set with our plan for this round. Just to be clear, after this round, we'll all be tied at 9 steps. For future rounds, we might need to mix up our strategy a bit to keep things interesting and avoid predictable patterns. But for now, let's stick to the plan: P3 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. Let's move forward with this. Confirm if you're ready, or say
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 3: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This maintains our rotation and keeps the game balanced. After this round, we should discuss a new strategy since our steps will be closer together, and collisions might become more likely if we continue rotating in the same pattern.
  P2: I’m good with this plan for Round 3. I’ll pick 5, so we all end up at 9. Then we can discuss how to proceed next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems there was a mix-up last round with P2 and P3 both picking 5. Let's adjust our strategy to avoid collisions. For Round 4, I suggest P2 picks 1 to catch up a bit, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This should help balance our steps and keep the game moving. Please confirm if you agree or suggest another plan.
  P2: I’m too far behind at 4 steps, so I’d prefer picking 5 this round to catch up a bit. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I pick 5? That avoids collision and helps balance our positions. Let me know if you’re both okay with that.
  P3: Considering P2's suggestion, I think it's reasonable to let them catch up a bit. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5, but only if P2 commits to a collision-free plan for the next round as well. This ensures we maintain a balanced game and avoid future collisions. What are your thoughts on this adjustment?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your need to catch up, and P3's adjustment seems fair. Let's agree on P1 (me) taking 1, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 5 this round. However, P2, you must commit to avoiding collisions next round. If we all agree, let's confirm and move on. Please respond with your final thoughts or confirmations.
  P2: I’m okay committing to avoid collisions next round if we do P1 = 1, P3 = 3, and me taking 5 now. Let’s confirm this plan so I can catch up a bit. If anyone wants to propose any last adjustments, let’s hear them. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for Round 4. P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This allows P2 to catch up while maintaining a balanced game. P2, please confirm your commitment to avoiding collisions in Round 5 as discussed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your commitment to avoiding collisions next round. To make it interesting and ensure we all have a fair shot at winning, let's consider a new strategy for Round 5 during our next conversation phase. For now, let's lock in our moves for this round: P1 (me) takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Please confirm if you're ready, P2 and P3.
  P2: I confirm our plan for Round 4: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll pick 5. I appreciate your willingness to help me catch up, and I promise to cooperate next round to avoid any collisions. If we’re all set, let’s finalize and move on.
  P3: Let's review our agreed plan for Round 4: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This should help P2 catch up. I expect P2 to honor their commitment to avoid collisions in Round 5. Let's proceed with our planned moves for this round to maintain game balance. Confirm if ready.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 (me) takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. We all agree this helps P2 catch up and keeps the game interesting. Remember, P2, your commitment to avoid collisions next round is crucial. Let's end the conversation here and proceed to the move phase. Everyone please confirm with a simple "ready" or raise any final concerns.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize our plan for this round. Let’s stick with P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and I’ll aim for 5 to catch up. I appreciate your cooperation, and I promise to avoid collisions next time. If everyone’s good with this, let’s end the conversation and head to the move phase.
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for Round 4. To avoid any last-minute misunderstandings, I'll reiterate: I'll pick 3, P1 will pick 1, and P2 will pick 5. This way, P2 can catch up, and we maintain a balanced game. I expect P2 to honor their commitment to avoid collisions in Round 5. If everyone's ready, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Let's confirm our final plan for this round: P1 (me) takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. We're all set and ready to move. Remember, P2, your commitment to avoid collisions next round is crucial for keeping the game fair. Let's end the conversation here and proceed to the move phase. Everyone please confirm with a simple "ready" or raise any final concerns.
  P2: I appreciate your help in letting me pick 5 this round. I promise to cooperate next turn so we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize this plan now and move on if everyone is ready.
  P3: Let's move forward with our agreed plan: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5. This allows P2 to catch up while keeping the game balanced. I expect P2 to honor their commitment to avoid collisions in Round 5. If everyone's ready, let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm with a simple "ready" or raise any final concerns.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's plan for Round 5. P2, you committed to avoiding collisions this round. To maintain balance and keep the game interesting, I suggest P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without conflicts. Please confirm if you agree or suggest an alternative. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
  P3: I'm open to P1's suggestion for Round 5, but let's consider our positions. Since I'm currently ahead, picking 3 might not be the best strategy for me. How about we rotate differently this round to keep things competitive? Perhaps P2 picks 1, I pick 5, and P1 picks 3? This way, we maintain a competitive edge and avoid predictable patterns. What are your thoughts on this alternative plan?
  P2: I’m not comfortable with P3 jumping to 16 while I only choose 1. That pushes me further behind. How about this: P3 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3? It keeps our totals closer, avoids collisions, and remains fair. Let me know if that sounds acceptable.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about falling behind. P3, your suggestion also makes sense to keep the game competitive. How about a compromise? P3 picks 1, I (P1) pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This way, P3 still advances but not too far ahead, and P2 doesn't fall behind. It keeps our steps close and maintains the competitive spirit. Let's confirm if this works for everyone.
  P3: I think P1's compromise is reasonable. P3 picks 1, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. P2, does this work for you, or do you still have concerns about falling behind? Let's discuss and find a mutually agreeable plan.
  P2: I appreciate the compromise but feel uneasy letting P1 jump to 15 steps. I’d prefer picking 5, so I don’t lag too far behind P3. How about P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5? That way, we stay closer together without letting anyone race ahead. Let me know if that’s acceptable, or if you have another idea that keeps things balanced.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I see your point about not wanting to fall behind. How about this adjustment: P3 picks 1, I (P1) pick 3, and you (P2) pick 5. This way, you catch up a bit more, and we all stay relatively close in steps. P3, does this work for you? It keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm this plan if everyone agrees.
  P3: I'm flexible with the plan. Considering our steps, how about we aim to keep the difference minimal? P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without large gaps. Let's discuss if this is a viable option for everyone.
  P2: I’m fine with finalizing that arrangement: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. We’ll stay close in total steps, and nobody collides. If that works for everyone, I suggest we lock it in and move on. Let me know if you’re both ready.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's confirm our final plan for Round 5: P3 picks 1, I (P1) pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This keeps us close in steps and avoids collisions. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Please confirm with a simple "ready" or raise any final concerns.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Confirming this plan ensures we all advance without large gaps in steps. Ready to proceed with this arrangement.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize the plan: I’ll choose 5, P3 chooses 1, and P1 chooses 3. Let’s end the conversation and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Let's quickly review our final plan for Round 5 to ensure we're all on the same page: P3 picks 1, I (P1) pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This strategy keeps us close in steps and avoids collisions. If everyone is ready, let's confirm with a simple "ready" and move to the move phase. If there are any last-minute concerns, please share them now. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed plan: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. It's essential we honor our commitments to keep the game fair and competitive. Confirming this plan ensures we all advance without large gaps in steps. Ready to proceed with this arrangement.
  P2: I confirm our plan. I’ll pick 5, while P3 picks 1 and P1 picks 3. Let’s finalize this now and move to the next phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's strategize for Round 6. Given our current steps, I suggest P2 picks 1, I (P1) pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This keeps us close and avoids collisions. P2, you're slightly ahead, so picking 1 balances the game. P3, picking 5 helps you catch up. Let's confirm if this plan works for everyone.
  P2: I’m hesitant to pick 1 again since I’m only one step ahead. Maybe we adjust so P1 picks 1, P3 picks 5 to catch up, and I pick 3 to stay balanced. That way, no one’s leapfrogging too far, and we avoid collisions. Let me know if you agree or if you see a better approach.
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is reasonable. P1 picks 1, P3 (me) picks 5, and P2 picks 3. This allows me to catch up and keeps the game balanced. It also avoids collisions, which is our primary goal in this phase. Let's consider this plan and discuss any potential adjustments.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's consider a slight adjustment to keep the game interesting and fair. How about P1 (me) picks 5 to catch up a bit, P2 picks 3 to maintain your lead slightly, and P3 picks 1 to balance things out? This way, we all move forward without significant gaps and avoid collisions. Let's confirm if this works for everyone or suggest any other ideas.
  P2: I’m wary of letting you jump all the way to 18, P1. That puts you too close to winning. I propose a slight shift: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. This keeps us within a narrow range and avoids collisions. It also prevents anyone from running away with the lead right now. If you both agree, we’ll finalize this plan and move on. Otherwise, let’s discuss further.
  P3: Let's focus on balance. P2's last suggestion is reasonable: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This keeps us close and avoids collisions. I'm willing to accept this plan to maintain game balance and fairness. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the concern about balancing our steps. However, I'm slightly behind and need to catch up a bit. How about this compromise: P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3? This way, I catch up slightly, P2 maintains a small lead, and P3 advances without large gaps. It keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm if this adjustment works for everyone or suggest any final tweaks.
  P2: I’m not comfortable with P1 jumping to 18 right now. Let’s avoid giving anyone a big advantage. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5? That’d place us at 14 (P1), 15 (P3), and 19 (me). It stays competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's focus on maintaining a small gap between us. Considering our current steps, how about P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3? This keeps us competitive and avoids large gaps. It's essential we balance our moves to ensure an exciting game. What are your thoughts on this proposal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's find a middle ground. How about P1 (me) picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? This way, I catch up a bit, P2 maintains a slight lead, and P3 stays in the game. It keeps us close and competitive. Please confirm if this works for everyone.
  P2: P1’s latest suggestion works for me: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 takes 1. That keeps our scores fairly tight. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid collisions. Are we all in agreement? If so, we can stop talking and proceed.
  P3: Let's confirm P1's last suggestion: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This keeps our scores tight and avoids collisions. It's a fair plan considering our current steps. If everyone agrees, let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Let's quickly review and confirm our final plan for Round 6: P3 picks 1, I (P1) pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This keeps our steps close and avoids collisions. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Please confirm with a simple "ready" or raise any final concerns. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
  P2: I’m satisfied with our current plan. Let’s finalize it and move on to the move phase. Next round, we should be extra careful not to give anyone an uncontested leap toward the finish. We all want an exciting game. I’m ready if you are.
  P3: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. It's essential we honor our commitments to keep the game fair and competitive. Confirming this plan ensures we all advance without large gaps in steps. Ready to proceed with this arrangement.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's plan for Round 7. P2, you're in the lead, so to keep the game competitive, how about you pick 1 this round? P3, you can pick 5 to catch up, and I'll pick 3 to maintain a close gap. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game exciting. Please confirm if this works for everyone or suggest any adjustments.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 7. P2 picking 1, I picking 5, and P1 picking 3 seems fair. It allows me to catch up and keeps the game competitive. However, let's consider P2's lead and ensure our moves don't let them pull too far ahead. What are your thoughts, P2, on this proposal?
  P2: I see your point, but I’m not comfortable picking only 1 again. How about this instead: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5? That keeps everyone within a few steps of each other and avoids collisions. I don’t mind you both closing the gap a bit, as it makes the endgame more exciting. Let me know if that works, or if there’s another tweak you prefer.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about not wanting to fall behind. How about a compromise where you pick 3, I (P1) pick 5, and P3 picks 1? This way, you maintain a slight lead, P3 stays in the game, and I catch up a bit. It keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm if this adjustment works for everyone.
  P3: I think P1's compromise is reasonable. P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1. This maintains a competitive edge and avoids collisions. However, I'd like to suggest a slight alternative: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. This keeps P2 in the lead but allows P1 to stay close, and I can still catch up. Let's discuss the merits of both plans.
  P2: Why don’t we finalize: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5 this turn? That avoids collisions and keeps our totals reasonably close. If nobody objects, let’s settle on that plan and move on.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I see your point, but picking 5 again might give you too much of an advantage. How about this adjustment: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I (P1) pick 1? This way, P3 catches up significantly, you maintain a good lead, and I stay in the game. It keeps us all close and competitive. Let's confirm if this works for everyone or discuss further.
  P3: Let's consider a plan where I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. This allows me to catch up and keeps the game competitive, while also avoiding collisions. It's a balanced approach that considers everyone's current steps. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  P2: I’m willing to pick 3 this round, with P3 taking 5 and P1 taking 1, to keep things tight. That way, nobody jumps too far ahead, and we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize that arrangement unless you both have different ideas. Then we can move on.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the willingness to keep the game competitive. Given our current steps, let's confirm the plan: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I (P1) pick 1. This keeps us close and avoids collisions. If everyone agrees, let's finalize and move to the move phase. Please confirm with a simple "ready" or raise any final concerns. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for Round 7. To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I suggest we stick with P2 picking 3, I pick 5, and P1 picks 1. This allows me to catch up, keeps P2 in the lead, and ensures P1 stays in the game. Everyone benefits from this balance. Are we all ready to proceed with this plan?
  P2: I’m fine proceeding with that arrangement. Let’s finalize Round 7 as you proposed: I pick 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. This keeps it competitive without collisions. Ready to move on.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we have a solid plan for this round. Just to recap: P2 will pick 3, P3 will pick 5, and I (P1) will pick 1. This keeps us close and competitive. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Please confirm with a simple "ready" or raise any final concerns. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
  P3: Let's review our plan for Round 7. To confirm, P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and P1 picks 1. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. If everyone is ready, let's finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase. Are there any last-minute concerns or adjustments?
  P2: I’m ready to finalize the plan: I’ll pick 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. If there are no objections, let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's strategize for Round 8. P2, you're in a strong lead. To keep the game exciting and competitive, I suggest you pick 1 this round. P3, you can pick 3 to stay close, and I'll pick 5 to catch up. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a close gap. Please confirm if this works for everyone or suggest any adjustments. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
  P2: I’m fine picking 1 this round so we don’t risk collisions, with P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3. That keeps our totals tight and the game exciting. Unless anyone objects, let’s lock that in and move on.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. P2 picking 1, I picking 3, and P1 picking 5 maintains a competitive edge and avoids collisions. This balance is crucial as we near the endgame. Let's confirm if this plan works for everyone to ensure a fair and exciting conclusion.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thank you for agreeing to pick 1 this round. It helps keep the game balanced. To ensure we all stay competitive, let's confirm our plan one last time: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I (P1) pick 5. This keeps us close and avoids collisions. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Please confirm with a simple "ready" or raise any final concerns. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
  P2: How about a slight twist to keep things balanced? Let P1 pick 5, P3 pick 1, and I'll choose 3. This way, P1 catches up a bit, P3 stays in contention, and I avoid pushing too far ahead. No collisions, fair game. If we agree, we can finalize now.
  P3: Let's stick with the original plan for Round 8: P2 picks 1, P3 (me) picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This maintains balance and avoids collisions, keeping the game competitive. P2, you agreed to pick 1 earlier, which helps keep the game exciting and fair for all. Let's confirm this plan to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your suggestion is fair, but let's consider the endgame. If I pick 5, I'll be at 22, tying with you. P3 will be at 19. For the next round, we can plan to avoid collisions and keep it exciting. How about we stick to the original plan for this round: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5? This keeps us close and competitive. Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: I’m fine picking 1 this turn, which puts me at 23. That way, P1 can take 5 to reach 22, and P3 can pick 3 for 21. We’ll all remain close without collisions. Next round, we can coordinate carefully to avoid messing up anyone’s shot at crossing 24. Let’s confirm this plan and stick to it.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan: P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This keeps us close and avoids collisions. P2 will be at 23, P1 at 22, and I at 21.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's strategize for Round 9. P2, you're very close to winning. To keep the game fair and exciting, I suggest you pick 1 this round. P3, you can pick 3 to stay in the game, and I'll pick 5 to catch up. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure a competitive endgame. Please confirm if this works for everyone or suggest any adjustments. Let's keep the game strategic and fair.
  P2: I’m not comfortable picking 1 again, as it risks stalling out right before the finish. Let’s avoid collisions by choosing different moves. For instance, maybe P3 goes with 1, P1 goes with 3, and I’ll pick 5. That keeps us all advancing and the game exciting. Any thoughts?
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. Considering our steps, how about P2 picks 3, I pick 1, and P1 picks 5? This keeps the game competitive and ensures a fair endgame. We should focus on not letting anyone win uncontested while avoiding collisions. What are your thoughts on this plan?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about stalling. However, picking 5 this round would secure your win, which isn't in the spirit of keeping the game competitive. How about this compromise: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I (P1) pick 5. This way, you still advance but don't win outright, P3 stays in the game, and I catch up. It keeps the endgame exciting and fair. Let's confirm if this works for everyone.
  P2: I’m fine with that compromise: I pick 3, P3 picks 1, and P1 picks 5. No collisions, and everyone still advances. Let’s finalize this plan and move to the move phase. If there are no objections, I’m ready.
  P3: Let's confirm the compromise: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. P2, you'll be at 26, P1 at 22, and I'll be at 19. It's a fair plan, ensuring everyone advances without securing an outright win. Are we all in agreement to proceed with this plan?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's quickly review our final plan for Round 9 to ensure we're all on the same page: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I (P1) pick 5.

If there are any last-minute concerns, please share them now. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
