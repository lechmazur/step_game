If you both also take <move>3</move>, we collide again, leaving me stuck at 20. Blocking unfairly only delays the inevitable. Let\u2019s stick to fairness: P1 and P2, take lower moves (<move>1</move>) to avoid collisions, allowing me to reach 23 cleanly. Trust is key here. Alternatively, consider letting me take 5 to win outright\u2014prolonging this benefits no one. Let\u2019s finalize and proceed without unnecessary conflict."}

This is your best chance to stay competitive. P3, if you pick 3 again, we will collide. Consider picking 1 or 5 to avoid that. Let's coordinate to ensure we all have a fair chance!"}
