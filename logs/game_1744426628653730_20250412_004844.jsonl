Last round\u2019s partial success shows consistency is key. Let\u2019s stick to the original plan\u2014P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5\u2014to ensure steady progress. If we shuffle, it could create more collisions, hurting everyone. Consistency keeps us moving forward. If you\u2019re set on changing, I\u2019ll adapt, but it\u2019s safer to stay consistent. Let\u2019s decide quickly to avoid confusion and move toward resolution."}
