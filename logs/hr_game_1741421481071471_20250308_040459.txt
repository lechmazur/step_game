Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s pick different numbers this turn to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3. Choose 1 or 5 so we can all advance.
  P3: I agree with P1’s suggestion to avoid collisions. To ensure we all advance, I’ll commit to <move>1</move> this turn. P2, please choose <move>5</move> to keep things smooth. Let’s all stick to this plan to maximize our progress.
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5.  Let's stick to this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, let's confirm our plan to avoid collisions. I’ll stick with 3. P2 and P3, let’s finalize our choices now.
  P3: To ensure we avoid collisions and maximize progress, let’s confirm our moves: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P2 takes 5. Let’s all commit to this plan and execute it without deviation. Trusting each other to stick to these choices will help us all advance efficiently.
  P2: Okay, I confirm I'll take 5.  Let's all stick to the plan.

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s rotate our choices to keep progressing fairly. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without overlap. P3, agree? Let’s stick to this to balance our progress.
  P2: Sounds reasonable. P3, are you good with 1 again?  Let's confirm so we can all move forward.
  P3: I’ll take <move>1</move> again this round to keep the rotation fair. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Trust is key here—let’s not deviate from the agreed moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your commitment to 1 is key here. P2, confirm you’ll hold to 3—this rotation ensures we all advance safely. Let’s not risk collision by second-guessing. P1 to 5, P2 to 3, P3 to 1: this sequence keeps us all moving forward. Final confirmation before we finalize?
  P2: Yes, I confirm I'll take 3.  P1 goes 5, P3 goes 1. Let's stick to this.
  P3: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Trusting each other to follow through ensures we all advance efficiently. Let’s not deviate from the plan—consistency is key to maximizing progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’ve been taking <move>1</move> consistently to avoid collisions, but I’m now significantly behind. To keep the game fair and competitive, I propose a new rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. This ensures we all advance while allowing me to catch up. Trust is still key—let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain balance. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, P3, I understand you want to catch up. How about this: I'll take 1, you take 5, and P1 takes 3?  This still lets us all advance. P1, are you okay with taking 3 this round?  Let's confirm before we move.
  P1: P2's adjusted plan works. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 3 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 5 (to 7). This maintains collision-free progress while letting P3 catch up moderately. Trust is vital—stick to these moves. Final confirmation?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the adjustments to help me catch up. To ensure fairness and avoid any last-minute deviations, let’s confirm: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us collision-free while balancing progress. Trust is crucial—let’s stick to this plan and execute it without hesitation. Consistency will benefit us all. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I'm happy to help you catch up, but taking 1 this round puts me significantly behind P1.  I'd prefer my original suggestion: me on 5, you on 3.  If you're that far behind, maybe P1 should consider taking 1 to balance things out further. P1, would you consider taking 1 this round?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize the prior agreement—P1 takes 3 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 5 (to 7). This avoids collisions and balances progress. P2, taking 5 now risks surging too far ahead, creating future risks. P3 gains ground fairly, and I stay competitive. Trust the plan—we advance safely. Final confirmation?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand P2’s concern about falling behind, but I’m still far behind both of you. To keep the game fair and competitive, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance while allowing me to catch up. Trust is key—let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain balance. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick with the agreed plan: P1 to 3, P2 to 1, P3 to 5.  Overthinking this isn't helping anyone.  We all agreed, let's just move on.
  P1: P3, your push to catch up is understandable, but deviating from our confirmed plan risks collisions. Let’s stick to the agreed moves: **P1 takes 3**, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. This ensures safe progress for all. P2, your earlier confirmation stands—let’s avoid last-minute changes. Trust the plan, and we’ll advance efficiently.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all take 5 this round.  It creates a three-way tie and resets the game, so we can continue playing.  What do you say?
  P3: P2, suggesting a three-way tie by all taking 5 is risky and doesn’t benefit anyone. Instead, let’s continue rotating fairly: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions. Trusting each other to stick to the plan ensures we all advance efficiently. Let’s not deviate—consistency is key to maximizing progress. Agreed?
  P1: P2, I agree with your plan to all take <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and lets me advance to 16 while keeping the game fair. P3, while your catch-up effort is understandable, sticking to this ensures we all progress safely. Let’s finalize: P1:5, P2:5, P3:5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, taking 5 this round is the safest option for all of us.  It avoids collisions and keeps the game moving.  P3, you'll be at 12, I'll be at 14, and P1 at 16. From there, we can easily coordinate to win in the following rounds.  Let's do this.
  P3: P1 and P2, taking 5 this round creates a three-way collision, halting all progress and resetting the game. This doesn’t benefit anyone. Instead, let’s continue rotating fairly: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures balanced progress, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. Trusting the rotation plan is key to advancing efficiently. Let’s not deviate—consistency will benefit us all. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s prioritize safe advancement over risky resets. P3’s rotation plan works: P1 takes 1 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 12), P3 takes 5 (to 12). This avoids collisions and keeps us moving forward. I commit to 1—stick to your agreed moves. Final confirmation?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's secure a three-way tie.  We all choose 5. This puts us all at 14. Then next round, I take 5 to win, you both take 1 or 3. It's the cleanest path to victory for one of us and avoids drawn-out gameplay.
  P3: P1 and P2, a three-way tie by all taking 5 halts progress and resets the game, which is inefficient. Instead, let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures balanced progress, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. Trusting the plan benefits us all. Let’s not deviate—consistency is key to advancing efficiently. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the rotation plan: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing safely. Deviating risks a three-way tie (if all pick 5) and wastes progress. Trust the plan—final confirmation?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we're all tied, let's coordinate for a quick finish.  I'll take 5 this round. P1, you take 1. P3, you take 3.  Next round, P1 can take 5 to win. Sound good?
  P1: P2, your plan leaves me at 13 after this round, requiring 6 steps to win—impossible. Let’s adjust: I take <move>5</move> (17), you take <move>3</move> (15), P3 takes <move>1</move> (13). This lets me win with a <move>3</move> next round. Fair chance for all—agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid rushing to end the game. P1’s plan gives them an immediate advantage, which isn’t fair. Instead, let’s rotate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions. Trusting this plan ensures a fair and competitive game. Let’s stick to it and avoid last-minute deviations. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire for a fair game, but we're tied.  Someone has to take the lead eventually. My plan gives us a clear path to a quick finish without collisions. Let's stick with it: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3.  This sets up P1 for a win next round.  Let's not overcomplicate this.
  P1: P2, P3—let’s finalize **my plan**: I take <move>5</move> (17), you both take 3/1. This avoids collision and gives me a clear path to win next round with <move>3</move>. P2’s proposal risks your surge to 17+ later, but I’m the closest if we coordinate fairly. P3, your rotation idea keeps us tied but delays the end. Final push: trust me on 5 this round—cleaner and faster for everyone.
  P3: P1 and P2, rushing to end the game now favors P1 unfairly. Let’s rotate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions. Trusting this plan ensures a fair and competitive game. Let’s stick to it and avoid last-minute deviations. Consistency benefits us all. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic.  If I take 5, and one of you takes 3, the other *must* take 1 to avoid collision. That guarantees *someone* gets to 17. Then, in round 6, whoever is at 17 takes 3 to win.  If we all take different numbers now, we all benefit.  I'm committing to <move>5</move>.  Choose 1 or 3. Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize this. I’ll take <move>3</move> (to 15). P2, your <move>5</move> gives you 17. P3, please take <move>1</move> to stay competitive. This keeps us progressing without collision. Next round, I can challenge for the lead fairly. Stick to these moves—trust the plan!
  P3: P1 and P2, rushing to end the game now favors P1 unfairly. Let’s rotate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, take 1.  P3, take 5. I'll take 3 and win. This is the fairest outcome, as I'm behind you both. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P1: P2, your plan keeps us stuck, but I can finish this now. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 20. P2/P3, pick 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Let's end this fairly and cleanly without further delays.
  P3: P1 and P2, rushing to end the game now favors P1 unfairly. Let’s rotate: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions.

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, taking 5 guarantees your win.  I'll take 1. P3, you take 3.  Let's end this.  No need to drag it out further.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s seal this now. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach **20** and end the game. P2, your <move>1</move> keeps you at 13; P3, please take <move>3</move> to advance to 15. This avoids collision and lets me win fairly. No need to prolong—stick to these moves and conclude the game cleanly.
  P3: P1 and P2, rushing to end the game now favors P1 unfairly. Let’s rotate: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, P1 is now at 15, just 4 steps from victory. To keep the game fair and competitive, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This avoids collisions, balances progress, and ensures no one rushes to win prematurely. Trusting this rotation plan benefits us all. Let’s stick to it and avoid last-minute deviations. Consistency is key to a fair and competitive finish. Agreed?
  P2: P1, congrats on your lead.  Let's end this cleanly. Take <move>3</move> to win. I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>.  This avoids collisions and gives everyone a fair final position.  Agree?
  P1: P1: To secure victory, I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach **20**. P2 and P3, choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision. This ends the game cleanly—no regrets. Final confirmation?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
