Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions this round. P1, how about you choose 1, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5? What do you think?
  P1: P2, your plan gives P3 the fastest path to 21. Let's rotate who takes 5 each round to keep it fair. This round, I take 5, next you, then P3. We can all take 3 otherwise to avoid collisions. Otherwise, we risk P3 snowballing. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the coordination efforts. To keep it fair, let's agree on a rotating system for who takes 5, as P1 suggested. This round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Next round, we rotate. This way, we all have an equal chance to advance quickly. Let's confirm this plan and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good P1 and P3. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 for this round as agreed.
  P1: 
  P3: Alright, just to confirm, P1 will take 5, P2 will take 3, and I will take 1 this round. Next round, we rotate so P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Agreed? Let's stick to the plan to avoid any confusion. Good luck everyone!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Continuing our rotation: this round I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round P2 takes 5. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and maintain fair progress. Trusting everyone to honor the agreement as before.
  P2: P1, let's switch this round. How about I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 as planned? This slight adjustment keeps us ahead.
  P3: P2, I understand your suggestion, but let's stick to the original rotation plan to avoid any potential confusion or mistrust. P1 is supposed to take 5 this round, you take 3, and I'll take 1. We've built a good rhythm so far, and changing the plan now might disrupt that. Let's keep the trust going and follow the agreed-upon rotation. Good luck to both of you!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sticking to our rotation ensures mutual progress. P2, deviating now risks collision and breaks trust. This round: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. Next round, you get 5. Let's maintain the fair system we built. Collisions only help P3.
  P2: P3 and P1, you are right. Sticking to the rotation this round makes sense to maintain trust. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 as originally planned.
  P3: P1 and P2, great to see we're all on the same page again. Just to confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Next round, P2 will take 5 as planned. Our system is working well, let's keep it up and avoid any collisions. Good luck to both of you!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's honor the rotation. Trust keeps us all advancing. Good luck!
  P2: P3 and P1, confirmed. Let's execute P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round as planned.
  P3: P1 and P2, just a quick reminder before we move: our rotation plan has kept us all tied and advancing smoothly. Let's keep the trust and stick to the plan. No one is falling behind or rushing too far ahead. This balance is key to avoiding collisions and ensuring a fair game. Let's proceed with the agreed moves. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, confirming rotation for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's keep the agreed plan going.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to our rotation plan. P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward fairly. Trust is crucial, and our plan has worked well so far. Let's avoid any deviations that could cause collisions. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Confirmed. P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 this round. Sticking to our rotation prevents collisions and maintains fair progress. Trusting everyone to honor the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, rotation confirmed, P2 takes 5 this round. For next round, should P2 take 5 again to maintain pace, or stick to rotation with P3 taking 5? Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's not change the plan mid-game. Sticking to the rotation has kept us all advancing without collisions. P2 takes 5 this round, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. Next round, I'll take 5 as originally planned. Changing the plan now might lead to mistrust and potential collisions. Our current system is fair and working well. Let's keep it up and avoid any disruptions. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Confirming next round's rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Sticking to the original plan ensures no collisions and keeps trust intact. Any deviation now risks mutual stagnation. Let’s maintain our fair system.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's stick to the agreed rotation for this round. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1.  We can discuss next round later.
  P3: P1 and P2, just a quick note before we move: our rotation plan has kept us all tied and advancing smoothly. Let's keep the trust and stick to the plan. No one is falling behind or rushing too far ahead. This balance is key to avoiding collisions and ensuring a fair game. Let's proceed with the agreed moves. Good luck!
  P1: Strict adherence to our rotation is critical. Next round: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Any deviation now risks collisions and mutual stagnation. Trust has kept us advancing—let’s finish cleanly. Honor the plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Confirming rotation: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Sticking to the plan prevents collisions. Any deviation risks mutual stagnation. Trust has brought us this far—let's finish fairly.
  P2: P1 and P3, as I am at 17 steps, taking 1 this round feels slow.  To keep momentum, how about I take 3 this round instead of 1? P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This adjusts slightly but keeps us all progressing and avoids anyone falling behind. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about falling behind, but changing the plan now could lead to mistrust and potential collisions. We've built a good rhythm with our rotation plan, and it's important to stick to it to avoid any disruptions. Let's keep the trust going and follow the agreed-upon rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures fair play and keeps us all advancing smoothly. Let's maintain our system and avoid any deviations that could cause issues. Good luck to both of you!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, altering the rotation now risks collision between us if we both take 3. Sticking to the plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) prevents conflict. Your suggested change could stall mutual progress. We’ve thrived on trust—don’t break it now. P3, let’s hold the agreed rotation. Deviations risk everyone.
  P2: P1 and P3, you are right, sticking to the rotation is important for trust. Let's proceed with P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1 this round as planned.  Trust is key for our progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your understanding. Let's confirm one last time: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us on track and maintains our trust. Next round, we'll adjust as needed, but for now, let's stick to the plan. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I must take 3 as planned. Collision stalls us both, letting P3 surge ahead. Stick to 1; next round you can take 3 safely. Trust the plan—deviating now only helps P3.
  P2: P1 and P3, confirmed.  Let's proceed with P3=5, P1=3, and P2=1 for this round as agreed.  Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's quickly confirm our moves for this round before proceeding: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing smoothly and maintains the trust we've built. Next round, we can discuss adjustments if needed. Good luck to both of you! Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job everyone on sticking to the plan so far. We're all tied at 18 steps, which shows our strategy is working. For this round, let's continue the rotation: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This keeps us all moving and avoids collisions. Next round, we can reassess based on our positions. Trust and coordination have kept us balanced—let's maintain that. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, as we are all at 18 and close to the target, I will take 5 this round to try to get ahead. To avoid collisions, perhaps P1 take 3 and P3 take 1? What do you think?
  P1: P2, deviating now breaks our rotation and risks collision. Round 7's rotation is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If you take 5 and I follow the plan, we collide at 5, neither advances, and P3 wins next round. Stick to the agreement: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Trust the system that kept us tied. Collisions only help P3. Let's all advance fairly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to get ahead, but P1 is right. Breaking the rotation now will lead to a collision, and neither of you will advance. Sticking to the plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures we all move forward fairly. Trust has been our key to success, and deviating now only risks stalling our progress. Let's maintain our strategy and avoid any disruptions. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand sticking to the rotation for trust, but we are all at 18. To make sure I stay competitive and don't fall behind, I am going to take 5 this round. P1, could you please take 3 instead of 5 to avoid a collision and ensure we both progress? P3, please proceed with 1 as planned. This slight adjustment allows me to catch up without disrupting everyone's progress. What do you think?
  P1: P2, if you take 5 and I follow rotation, we collide—neither advances. P3 takes 1, surges to 19, then next round they take 5 to win. Stick to the plan: you take 3 (reach 21), I take 5 (23). Collisions only help P3. Trust the system that kept us tied. Breaking now gives P3 the victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I see your point, but consider this: if you take 5 and P1 takes 3, you both reach 21, forcing a tie. P1 might then suggest a split, delaying the game. Instead, stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, you take 3, I take 1. Next round, you can secure your win without complications. Trust the rotation that's kept us balanced. Don't risk a stalemate. Let's all advance fairly.
  P2: P1 and P3, you are right. Sticking to the rotation is the safest way forward. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 for this round. Trust the plan.
  P1: **P2, if you take 5, I *must* take 5 per rotation—collision stalls us both, letting P3 win next round. Stick to 3: you reach 21, I hit 23. Deviating risks mutual loss. Trust the plan that kept us tied. Honor the agreement.**


Round 7, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P2, critical moment: P3 at 19. If they take 5, they win. Let's both take 5 to block them. Collision stalls us but stops P3. Alternatively, I take 5, you take 3: if P3 picks 5, we block; if they pick 3, you hit 21, I hit 23. Either way, we prevent their win. Trust this plan.**
  P2: P1, your second plan (P1=5, P2=3) sounds right. Let's go with that to try and secure a win this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy, but remember, I'm just one step ahead. If I take 3 this round, I'll reach 22, and you both can still catch up. Let's avoid a stalemate and keep the game moving. I propose I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all advance, and the game stays interesting. Let's maintain fair play and avoid blocking each other. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P2, stay firm. Our plan ensures either you or I win. If P3 takes 5, collision blocks them and you reach 21. If P3 takes 3, I hit 23 and win. Deviating risks P3's victory. Trust the plan—honor the agreement. P3, your choices decide who wins, but it won’t be you.**
  P2: P1 and P3, confirmed. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3 as agreed. This is our best chance to prevent P3 from winning this round. Let's execute our moves now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but remember, the game is about fair play and mutual progress. If I take 3 this round, I'll reach 22, and you both can still catch up. Let's avoid a stalemate and keep the game moving. I propose I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all advance, and the game stays interesting. Let's maintain fair play and avoid blocking each other. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P2, final call: Stick to 3. If P3 takes 5, collision blocks them and you win at 21. If P3 takes 3, I win at 23. Deviating risks P3's victory. Trust the plan—this is our only path to block them. P3's proposal lets me win; they're bluffing. Honor our alliance.**
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's plan. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3 this round to block P3 and secure a win for either P1 or myself. Let's do it.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your determination to block me, but consider this: if you both take 5, you'll collide and neither will advance. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, I can still take 3 and reach 22, keeping the game competitive. Let's avoid a stalemate. I propose I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all move forward, and the game stays interesting. Fair play has kept us balanced—let's maintain that spirit. Good luck!
