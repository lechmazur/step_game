Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P3: P3: Sounds reasonable! Let’s coordinate as P1 suggested: 1, 3, and 5 respectively. This avoids collisions and lets us all progress safely. I’ll take 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the coordination idea. However, keep in mind that if we all follow the plan, it might become predictable, and someone could take advantage in future rounds. I suggest we switch it up occasionally to keep things interesting and avoid any surprises. For this round, I’m okay with taking 3 as proposed. Let’s see how it goes!


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start, everyone! P1 and P3, should we mix things up this round to keep it unpredictable? Maybe P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3 again. This way, we keep advancing without becoming too predictable. Let me know your thoughts or if you have other ideas.
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to rotate moves this round to keep strategies unpredictable. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P2 staying on 3. This avoids collisions while advancing cautiously. However, I propose we randomize roles more in future rounds to prevent patterns—predictability could be exploited later. For now, let’s stick to the plan to stay safe.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fine with the rotation idea for this round. Let’s go with P1 taking 5, P2 on 3, and P3 on 1 as suggested. I agree we should keep things unpredictable in future rounds to avoid being exploited. For now, this plan ensures we all advance safely. If you have any other thoughts or concerns, let me know.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re open to keeping things unpredictable. Since we’re rotating this round, I’ll stick with 3 as planned. In future rounds, we should consider introducing more randomness, like using a dice roll or a random number generator to decide moves. This will help us avoid patterns and keep everyone guessing. For now, let's proceed with our current plan and see how it goes. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I agree with the rotation for this round. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 on 3, and me on 1 to avoid collisions. For future rounds, introducing randomness like dice rolls could help prevent exploitable patterns. Let’s stick to the current plan now to ensure safe advancement. Any final thoughts before we move?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with the current rotation plan for this round. I also like the idea of introducing randomness in future rounds to keep things unpredictable, as P2 suggested. Maybe we can discuss a specific method for randomization after this turn. For now, let’s stick with the agreed moves to ensure we all advance. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision was due to unclear rotation. Let’s fix this: I’ll take **1** (total 6), P1 takes **3** (total 9), and P2 takes **5** (total 8). This ensures no overlaps. Future rounds can adapt, but clarity is key now. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P3’s suggestion for this round: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. Let’s stay clear and avoid last round’s mix-up. I’m open to discussing more randomization next turn to prevent patterns, but for now, let’s stick to this plan. Any objections or alternative ideas? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m fine with the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this clear rotation for now. For future rounds, we should definitely discuss a more randomized approach to keep things unpredictable, like using a random number generator or drawing lots. If there are no other ideas or objections, I’m ready to proceed.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all close in steps, so let’s keep advancing without collisions. I propose P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This rotation helps us avoid clashes and move forward. For future rounds, we can explore randomization to keep strategies unpredictable. If there are any concerns or alternative ideas, let’s discuss them now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: P3: P2's plan keeps us safe, but I want to close the gap. Let’s adjust: I’ll take **3** (total 9), P1 takes **5** (total 14), and P2 takes **1** (total 9). This way, I catch up without collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with adjusting the plan to help P3 catch up. Let’s go with P3’s suggestion: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us collision-free while balancing our steps. I still think randomization in future rounds is a good idea to avoid predictability. If there are no objections or other suggestions, I’m ready to proceed with this. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m open to P3’s suggestion to help balance our steps: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and helps P3 catch up. For future rounds, we should definitely consider introducing randomness to keep strategies unpredictable. If everyone agrees, let’s proceed with this plan. Any final thoughts or changes? If not, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: P2, P1, I propose adjusting to P1 takes **3** (total 12), I take **5** (total 11), and you take **1** (total 9). This lets me close the gap faster while avoiding collisions. Agreed?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to P3’s latest proposal: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This still avoids collisions and helps P3 close the gap. I think it’s fair to balance our steps while keeping progress steady. Let’s agree on this for now and discuss randomization next round to stay unpredictable. If there are no objections or other ideas, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Thoughts? If not, .

  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's continue rotating to avoid clashes. I'll take **5** (total 16), P1 takes **3** (total 15), and P2 takes **1** (total 10). This keeps progress steady while I close the gap. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see P3 wants to close the gap, but I'm concerned about P3's suggestion leading to a potential win for them soon. How about we keep things balanced: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a fair race. We can still discuss introducing randomization next round to keep strategies fresh. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P2’s concern about keeping the race fair, but I think P3’s proposal still works for steady progress. Let’s stick with P3’s plan: I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. I’m still in favor of randomization next round to prevent patterns. If there are any objections or alternative ideas, let me know. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but we must prioritize advancing toward 20. Let’s proceed with my original proposal: I take **5** (total 16), P1 takes **3** (total 15), and you take **1** (total 10). This maximizes our collective progress while avoiding collisions. We can revisit randomization next round. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to advance but also want to ensure fairness. P3's plan might give them an edge, so I propose a compromise: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward without giving anyone a significant lead. We can explore randomization in future rounds to keep things unpredictable. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the need for balance, but I think sticking closer to P3’s plan keeps us competitive without collisions. Let’s go with P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1. This ensures steady progress for all. I’m still keen on randomization next round to avoid predictability. If there are any final concerns or alternative suggestions, let’s hear them now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1, I understand your concerns, but delaying progress risks letting others surge ahead later. Let’s stick with my proposal: I take **5** (16), P1 takes **3** (15), and you take **1** (10). This avoids collisions *and* keeps me competitive. Next round, we can rotate roles to balance leads. Fair?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the need for progress but also fairness. Let's make sure no one gets too big of a lead. How about this: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This keeps us moving and avoids collisions. We can switch things up next round for unpredictability. Let’s discuss any final thoughts or changes. If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I think P2’s latest proposal is a fair compromise: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and prevents any single player from gaining too big a lead this round. We can rotate or randomize next turn to maintain unpredictability. If there are no objections or other ideas, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Thoughts? If not,


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1, let's finalize the agreed plan: I’ll take **5** (16 total), P1 takes **3** (15), and you take **1** (10). This avoids collisions and keeps us moving. Next round, I propose we fully randomize our choices (1/3/5) to prevent predictability. For now, stick to this plan to advance safely. Any last objections?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the need for progress but want to ensure fairness. Let's try this: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward without giving anyone a significant lead. We can explore randomization in future rounds to keep things unpredictable. Thoughts? If there are no objections, I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I think we’re going in circles. Let’s finalize with a fair plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps progress steady without giving anyone a huge lead. We’re all close to the goal, so let’s agree on this and focus on randomization next round to avoid patterns.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re all close to 20, so let’s avoid collisions this round. I propose P1 takes 5 (total 17), P2 takes 1 (total 16), and P3 takes 3 (total 14). This keeps us competitive and moving forward without clashes. We’ve had issues with last-minute changes, so let’s commit to this plan. Randomization next round can keep things unpredictable. Thoughts or alternative ideas? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1, P2: While your plan keeps us safe, it leaves me at 14 while you both leap ahead. Let’s balance progress: I take **5** (total 16), P2 takes **3** (total 18), and P1 takes **1** (total 13). This avoids collisions *and* keeps me competitive without letting P2 reach 20. P2, if you push for 5 now, we risk collision—better to stay at 18 and plan for next round. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all so close to 20, and avoiding collisions is crucial. P3, your plan helps balance progress, but I’m concerned about staying competitive. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This keeps us advancing without risking collisions, and we can plan for a final push next round. Let’s decide quickly to avoid confusion. If we all agree, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the need to balance progress and stay competitive. Let’s adjust P3’s plan slightly: P3 takes 5 (total 16), P2 takes 3 (total 18), and I take 1 (total 13). This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race without anyone hitting 20 yet. We must commit to avoid last-minute chaos. Randomization next round can prevent patterns. Thoughts or objections? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P2, if you choose 5 to reach 20, I’ll also take 5 to block you. Let’s instead advance safely: I’ll take 3 (14), you take 1 (16), and P1 takes 5 (17). This keeps us all progressing without letting anyone win yet. Fair?
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all very close to the finish line, so let's ensure no collisions while advancing. I suggest: I take 3 (total 18), P1 takes 1 (total 13), and P3 takes 5 (total 16).

This avoids collisions and ensures no one wins yet, keeping the competition tight. We must commit to this to prevent last-minute chaos. Randomization next round can keep things fresh. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, P1: Let’s lock in the agreed plan to avoid disaster! P3 takes **5** (→16), P2 takes **3** (→18), P1 takes **1** (→13). If P2 tries 5 now to win, I’ll mirror and block them. Stick to this exact split—collisions end the game *their* way. Confirm final commitment? No changes!
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand we're all eager to win, but let's avoid collisions and ensure progress. I propose: I take 3 (total 18), P1 takes 1 (total 13), and P3 takes 5 (total 16). This keeps us competitive without letting anyone win outright. We can plan for a decisive move next round. Randomizing in future rounds can help keep strategies unpredictable. If there are no objections, I'm ready to proceed. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s stick with the current plan: P3 takes 5 (total 16), P2 takes 3 (total 18), and I take 1 (total 13). This ensures no collisions and keeps the race tight without anyone winning yet. We must commit fully to avoid last-minute chaos. Randomization next round can prevent patterns. If there are no objections or new ideas, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts? If not,
  P3: P2, if you take5 to win, I’ll mirror and block you. Let’s finalize: I take **5** (→16), you take **3** (→18), P1 takes **1** (→13). This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. **No changes—strict adherence now!**
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all very close to the end, so let's avoid collisions and ensure progress. I propose: I take 3 (total 18), P1 takes 1 (total 13), and P3 takes 5 (total 16).

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision. I propose a clear split: **P1 takes 1 (→13), P2 takes 3 (→18), and I take 5 (→16)**. This keeps us all advancing safely. P2, if you aim for 20, next round you can push for 2—but today, let’s stick to this *exact* plan to avoid disaster. No deviations—our prior mistakes cost us. Agree?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P3’s proposal for this round: P1 takes 1 (total 13), P2 takes 3 (total 18), and P3 takes 5 (total 16). This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing while staying competitive. Let’s commit to this exact plan to avoid the disasters of past rounds. No last-minute changes—strict adherence is crucial now. If there are any concerns or alternative ideas, let’s hear them quickly. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I’m concerned about P3’s proposal leaving me too close to the finish without a clear path to win. How about this: I take 5 (total 20), P1 takes 3 (total 15), and P3 takes 1 (total 12)? This way, I can aim for victory, and we avoid collisions. We can discuss randomization next round to keep things fresh. Let me know your thoughts or if there are any objections.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, pursuing 5 risks collision. Let’s coordinate safely: I’ll take **3** (→14), you take **1** (→16), and P1 takes **5** (→17). This advances all without letting anyone win yet. Collisions end the game—prioritize stability!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision disaster. I support P3’s latest plan: P3 takes 3 (total 14), P2 takes 1 (total 16), and I take 5 (total 17). This ensures we all advance safely without anyone winning yet. P2, pushing for 20 now risks a clash—let’s play it safe this round.

We’re close to the finish, so let’s commit to this plan for now. We can consider randomization in the next round to keep things unpredictable. Any thoughts or objections? If not, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1: Final plea—stick strictly to the **agreed split**: P2 takes 3 (→18), P1 takes 1 (→13), and I take 5 (→16). Deviations risk collision, handing victory to anyone who stays disciplined. This keeps us all advancing safely. Confirm lockstep compliance? No room for error here.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s finalize a safe plan to avoid another collision. I support P3’s latest proposal: P2 takes 3 (total 18), P1 takes 1 (total 13), and P3 takes 5 (total 16). This ensures we all advance without clashes. P2, pushing for a win now risks disaster—let’s stay disciplined. We must commit to this exact split with no deviations. If there are any last concerns or ideas, speak now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Thoughts? If not,
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid collisions and ensure safe progress. I propose: I take 3 (total 18), P1 takes 1 (total 13), and P3 takes 5 (total 16). This keeps us competitive without risking a clash. We’re close to the finish, so let’s commit to this plan for now. Randomization can be considered in the next round to keep things unpredictable. Thoughts or objections?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re so close to the end, let’s avoid another collision. I propose: P1 takes 5 (total 17), P2 takes 1 (total 19), and P3 takes 3 (total 14). This keeps us all advancing safely without anyone winning yet. P2, pushing for 20 now risks a clash—let’s stay disciplined. We must commit to this exact split with no deviations to prevent chaos. If there are any concerns or alternative ideas, let’s hear them now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, if you take 3 to win, I'll mirror your choice to block you. Let’s all pick different numbers instead: I’ll take **1** (→12), P1 takes **3** (→15), and you take **5** (→23). This avoids collision while letting you advance safely. If you prefer another path, I’ll match your move to ensure no one wins prematurely. Finalize now—no last-minute changes!
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all very close to winning, so avoiding collisions is crucial. I propose: I take 3 (total 21), P1 takes 1 (total 13), and P3 takes 5 (total 16).
