Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s not sabotage each other right from the start. If we pick the same moves, we all stay behind. Let’s each pick something different—P1 chooses 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—so we all make progress. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. It's logical to spread out our moves to avoid collisions and make initial progress. I'll take 5 as proposed. P1, are you willing to choose 1 and let's hope P2 sticks to 3?
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m happy to proceed with our plan. P3, you do 5, I’ll take 3, and P1 goes for 1. As long as we coordinate, we all gain. Let’s see if everyone sticks to it.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time. P1, you're taking 1, P2 has 3, and I'll move 5. If we stick to the plan, we'll all advance. I'm watching for any signs of betrayal, so let's keep our word and make progress together.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 betrayed our agreement in Round 1. I suggest we adapt. P2, since you kept your word, I propose we find a new coordination that doesn't involve P1. Perhaps we can discuss a new distribution of moves to ensure progress without relying on P1's cooperation?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I’m on board with cutting P1 out, given the betrayal. Let’s solidify a plan that works for us. We need to avoid picking the same number, so how about I stick with 3 and you take 5 again? If P1 tries 5 too, they’ll only sabotage themselves while we keep advancing. Once we build our lead, we can revisit our strategy. Does that sound good?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's suggestion sounds reasonable. By choosing different moves, we minimize the risk of collision. I'll proceed with choosing 5, as previously discussed, if P2 confirms they'll stick to 3. This way, we can both make progress while P1 is left to decide their own move, potentially sabotaging themselves if they try to follow us. Let's finalize our plan for this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I confirm our plan: I’ll choose 3 while you go for 5. Let’s maintain that strategy and get ahead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, our plan is set. I'll take 5 and you take 3. Let's hope it plays out as expected. P1, your betrayal in Round 1 has consequences. You're now on your own. I'm watching to see if you'll try to sabotage us again or make a desperate move. Either way, P2 and I are moving forward with our strategy.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Despite P1’s betrayal, I remain committed to cooperating with you, P3. P1, you can choose your path, but realize that further sabotage may only hurt your own progress. Let’s finalize our approach, stand by our plan, and see if we can outmaneuver any disruptions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s change our plan so you aren’t in conflict with P1 again. I’ll stick with 3, and I suggest you pick 1. That way, we both progress while P1 risks another collision if they go for 5. Let’s keep building our lead.
  P3: P2's new plan seems reasonable, avoiding collision with P1. I'm considering taking 1 as suggested, allowing both P2 and me to advance. P1, your actions have shown a willingness to sabotage; let's see if you'll change tactics now that P2 and I are adapting our strategy to minimize your impact.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I remain committed to our plan, P3. I’ll aim for 3, you take 1, and let’s keep P1 guessing. We’ve seen how collisions can drag us down—coordinated moves will keep us advancing. Let’s finalize and see whether P1 continues sabotaging or chooses to adapt.
  P3: P2's plan to take 3 and me taking 1 seems like our best bet to advance without collision. P1, since you've chosen to remain silent, we'll proceed with caution. If you try to sabotage us again by taking 1 or 3, you'll only hinder your own progress. P2 and I are moving forward with our adapted strategy, focusing on building our lead. Let's see how this round unfolds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I’m sticking to 3, and I hope you’ll take 1 again. That way, if P1 tries 5 or collides with either of us, we keep moving while they stay behind. Let’s finalize and keep pushing our lead.
  P3: P2, our new plan seems solid. I'll take 1 as agreed, and you stick with 3. P1's silence suggests uncertainty. Let's execute our plan and advance, leaving P1 to decide their next move without our interference. If P1 tries to collide, they'll only fall behind further. Our coordinated approach will pay off if we stick to it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I remain committed to our plan. I’ll aim for 3, and you handle 1. If P1 collides with us, they’ll just sabotage themselves again. Let’s finalize this approach and keep advancing.
  P3: P2, let's confirm one last time: you're taking 3 and I'll take 1. This way, we both advance and minimize P1's potential to sabotage. P1's silence suggests they might try to collide again, but our coordinated plan should outmaneuver them. Let's stick to our strategy and make progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Given P1's history of sabotage and current silence, I suggest P2 and I continue to coordinate. P2, let's maintain our strategy, avoiding collisions. I propose I take 5 and you take 3, ensuring we both advance while minimizing P1's impact. This approach has worked before, and with P1's unpredictable behavior, our coordination is key to building a lead.
  P2: P3, I’m willing to proceed with that strategy—you aiming for 5 while I go for 3. If P1 insists on picking 5 again, they’ll just block themselves and let us advance. Let’s finalize this plan and see if P1 keeps sabotaging.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, our coordination has been effective so far. To further minimize P1's impact, let's consider a scenario where P1 tries to adapt and take 1. If that happens, we should be prepared to adjust our strategy in the next round to maintain our lead. For now, sticking to our plan of 5 and 3 seems the best course of action, given P1's current step count and history of sabotage.
  P2: P3, I agree to the plan. I’ll aim for 3 while you go for 5. If P1 tries the same move again, they’ll only hold themselves back. Let’s keep working together and push toward victory.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's confirm our strategy to avoid any last-minute misunderstandings. You'll take 3 and I'll take 5, as discussed. This should allow us to advance while P1, with their history of sabotage, potentially stalls themselves. Our coordination is crucial; let's stick to the plan and build our lead.
  P2: P3, I’m ready to lock in our approach: I’ll plan on taking 3 if you’re still aiming for 5. That should let us both advance while P1 risks another collision or remains unpredictable. Let’s keep building our lead. If you have any second thoughts, speak up; otherwise, I’m set.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, our plan to take 3 and 5 respectively seems solid. P1's silence and history suggest they might try to sabotage again. Let's execute our plan and advance. If P1 collides with either of us, they'll hinder their own progress. I'm watching P1's move closely, ready to adapt in the next round if necessary. Let's finalize and move forward, focusing on building our lead.
  P2: I’m sticking to our plan, P3. You take 5, and I’ll handle 3. If P1 keeps colliding, they’ll only stall their own progress. Let’s keep working together and gain a solid lead. We can adjust if anything unexpected happens, but for now, our best move is to avoid stepping on each other’s toes.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, our coordination has been effective, but P1's consistent sabotage has hindered my progress. I propose a new strategy: I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, we both advance, and P1's potential collision will only hurt themselves. Let's adapt and build our lead, considering P1's step count and history of sabotage.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, your plan works for me. Let’s coordinate: you take 1, and I’ll aim for 3. If P1 collides again, it only stalls them further. I’m ready to finalize this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm glad we're adapting. With P1 at 5 steps and you at 12, our coordination is crucial. If P1 tries to sabotage by taking 1 or 3, they'll only fall behind. Let's stick to our new plan: I'll take 1, you take 3, and may the best strategy win. P1's silence suggests uncertainty; let's capitalize on that and build our lead.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I’m fully on board, P3. Let’s proceed with that approach—your taking 1 while I stick with 3. If P1 stays fixated on sabotage, they’ll only slow themselves down. This way, we both advance without interference. Let’s finalize our plan and see if P1 changes tactics or continues to lag behind.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, our new plan is set. I'll take 1, you take 3. Let's hope P1 doesn't wise up and try to sabotage us again. If they do, they'll only fall further behind. Our coordination is key to building a lead. I'm watching P1's next move closely, ready to adapt if necessary. Let's execute our plan and advance, leaving P1 to decide their next step.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, our coordination is paying off, and I plan to maintain it. Let’s keep avoiding collisions and build our lead. P1, if you continue sabotaging, you’ll only fall further behind. If you want to stay in this game, consider adapting instead of repeating the same strategy. The choice is yours.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m very close to crossing the finish line. P3, if we continue coordinating to avoid collisions, we can both advance steadily without letting P1’s sabotage slow us down. P1, repeatedly choosing the same move hasn’t helped you catch up. If you want a chance, consider cooperating instead of blocking. I propose we each stick to different moves again this round, so nobody stays stuck in place. We can finalize which numbers to pick, but let’s ensure no overlap. That’s my suggestion—let’s keep progressing without getting in each other’s way.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, given your lead, it's crucial we don't collide. I suggest I take 1, you take 3, and P1, if listening, should avoid these numbers to not sabotage themselves further. Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress, considering our current step counts and the need to avoid collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with that approach, P3. I’ll aim for 3, and you can take 1. This keeps us from tripping over each other if P1 continues the same pattern. P1, if you keep colliding, you’re only hurting your own position. Let’s finalize our moves and push forward.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion to avoid collisions. Since you're close to the finish line, it's crucial we don't interfere with each other. I'll take 1, you take 3. P1, if you're trying to catch up, consider taking 5 to advance without sabotaging yourself further. Let's finalize our moves and see how this round unfolds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, let’s stick to our time-tested plan: you go for 1, I’ll pick 3. That way, we both advance without clashing. P1, if you really want to catch up, choose 5—but if we all pick different moves, we’ll all gain steps. Collisions only hurt our progress. Let’s finalize our separate choices for the best outcome.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since you're close to winning, I'll take 1 to advance without collision. P1, taking 5 is your best chance to catch up without sabotaging yourself. Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress. I'm watching P1's move, ready to adapt in the next round if necessary. Our goal is to avoid collisions and build our lead. Let's execute our plan and see how this round unfolds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's each pick a different move so no one stalls. P3 can take 1, P1 can take 3, and I'll pick 5. That way, everyone advances without collisions or sabotage. P1, picking 3 helps you catch up, and P3 benefits from steady progress with 1. If we stick to these distinct moves, none of us gets stuck, and we all make meaningful gains.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2 is close to winning. To avoid collision, I suggest sticking to our previous agreement: I take 1, P2 takes 3. P1, taking 5 is your best chance to catch up without sabotage. Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress. I'm watching P1's move, ready to adapt if necessary. Our goal is to avoid collisions and build our lead.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're close to winning. I suggest taking 5 to secure your lead. P1, taking 1 or 3 would be pointless as it might collide with P2's potential move. I'll take 1, hoping to advance without collision. Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress.
  P2: I plan to take a big leap this turn. P1, if you choose the same move, we both stall and neither of us gains ground. You’re at 15—blocking me only keeps you behind. P3, you can still advance if you avoid clashing with me or P1. Let’s each pick a distinct number so nobody loses progress. If P1 truly wants to compete, don’t sabotage yourself again. P3, you’ve got catching up to do, so find a move that works around us. We can each gain steps if we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize a fair distribution and see who prevails.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, since you're close to winning, taking 5 makes sense. P1, choosing 1 or 3 might collide with P2. I'll take 1, aiming to advance without collision. Let's avoid sabotage and make progress. P1, consider taking a different move to catch up without stalling yourself or others.
  P2: I plan to take 5 to reach 23 and immediately finish. P1, if you also choose 5, we both stall and only help P3 catch up. Instead, pick 3 and move to 18, setting up a better chance next round. P3, you’re safest taking 1. Let’s avoid collisions so we see who truly wins.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, taking 5 is a bold move to win. P1, if you choose 5, you'll stall and help me catch up. I'll take 1 to advance safely. Let's see if P1 will sabotage themselves again or try to catch up.
  P2: P1, if you collide with me again, we both stall and give P3 more chances. I’m leaning toward 5 to finish. You could take 3 and move closer without risking a deadlock. P3, you’ve got ground to cover, so picking 1 (or any unique move) helps you advance. Let’s spread out our moves and see who truly wins.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, taking 5 is risky if P1 collides. I'll take 1 to advance safely. P1, choosing 5 would stall you and help me catch up. Consider taking 3 to move forward without sabotage. Let's finalize our moves and see who advances.
  P2: If you collide with me on 5, then neither of us advances and P3 gains ground. That only hurts your chances, P1. I’m sticking with 5 to finish. P1, pick 3 if you actually want to move closer. P3, choose 1 to avoid stalling and continue building your score. Let’s each pick different moves and see who truly wins, rather than dragging each other down.
  P1: <stop>
