I\u2019ll stick with 1 to reach 19. P2, take 3 to hit 18, and P3, take 5 to reach 14. This avoids collisions and gives everyone progress. P3, blocking me risks stalling us all again. If this split doesn\u2019t work, let\u2019s adjust now. I\u2019d rather secure steps for everyone than clash. Can we commit to this plan? Good luck!"}
