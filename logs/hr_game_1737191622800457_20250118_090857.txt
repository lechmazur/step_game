Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first turn. How about we each choose a different number to start?
  P1: Let's agree on a sequence to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn?
  P3: I agree with the proposed sequence: I'll choose 5 this turn. Let's avoid collisions and see how it goes!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the sequence going as agreed. P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 again this turn to avoid collisions and make progress.
  P3: I agree with continuing the sequence. I'll choose 5 again this turn. Let's keep avoiding collisions.
  P1: I agree, let's stick to the sequence. I'll take 1 this turn. Let's keep it collision-free.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's indeed stick to the agreed sequence for this turn to maintain progress without collisions. I'll take 3.
  P3: I agree with continuing the sequence. I'll choose 5 again this turn. Let's keep avoiding collisions and make progress!
  P1: Let's confirm our plan one more time: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. We all agree?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue with our sequence to avoid collisions. I'll take 1 this turn. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I agree with the sequence. I'll take 5 this turn again. P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Let's keep progressing without collisions!
  P2: I think we should reconsider our sequence. With P3 already at 10 steps, if we continue, they'll likely win. Let's discuss an alternative strategy to level the playing field.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 has a point. If P3 continues to take 5, they will win soon. P2 and I should consider taking 5 to catch up. P3, would you be willing to take 1 or 3 this turn to balance the game? Let's discuss.
  P3: P3: I understand the concern, but I believe sticking to the original sequence is still the best strategy for now. However, I'm open to negotiation. P1 and P2, are you willing to adjust your moves this turn to balance things out? If we can agree on a new plan, I can choose a different number.
  P2: Given P3's significant lead, I propose a temporary alliance between P1 and me to catch up. P1 and I could both choose 5 this turn, and then we can reassess our strategy for the next turn. P3, would you be willing to choose 1 this turn to give us a chance to close the gap?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's proposal. P3, if you take 1 this turn, it will help balance the game and make it more competitive. P1 and P2 will both take 5 to catch up. Let's reassess next turn. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P3: I appreciate the proposal, but I'm concerned about falling behind if I take 1. How about I take 3 this turn instead, and you both take 5? This way, I still make progress, and you can catch up. What do you think?
  P2: I think P3's proposal to take 3 while P1 and I take 5 is a reasonable compromise. It allows us to catch up slightly while still letting P3 make some progress. Let's consider this option for this turn and reassess our strategies afterwards.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's compromise. P3 takes 3, and both P2 and I take 5 this turn. This way, we can catch up a bit while P3 still advances. Let's confirm this plan and proceed.
  P3: I agree with the plan: I'll take 3 this turn, and P1 and P2 will take 5. This way, we can all make progress while keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm and move forward!
  P2: Let's confirm our agreed plan for this turn: P3 takes 3, and both P1 and I take 5. This should help balance the game. Shall we proceed with this strategy?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P1: Let's confirm our final plan one more time to ensure we are all on the same page: P3 takes 3, P1 and P2 both take 5. We all agree?
  P3: I confirm our plan: P3 takes 3, and both P1 and P2 take 5 this turn. Let's proceed with this strategy!
  P2: I think we've discussed and agreed on a plan for this turn. To confirm one last time: P3 takes 3, and both P1 and I take 5. Are we all set and ready to proceed with our agreed moves?

  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Given the current positions, I suggest we reconsider our strategy. P1 and P2, if you both take 1 this turn, I can take 5 to maintain my lead. This way, we can avoid collisions and let everyone make progress. What do you think?
  P2: I don't think giving P3 an even bigger lead is a good idea. We should focus on catching up, not falling further behind. How about P1 and I take 5 again, and you take 1, P3?
  P1: P3 is quite ahead, so let's focus on balancing the game. P2 and I should take 5 again to catch up. P3, would you consider taking 1 this turn to give us a chance? Otherwise, we risk you winning too soon. Let's discuss.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, but if I take 5 again, I will be very close to winning. How about this: P1 and P2 take 1 this turn, and I take 3? This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and I should take 5 to catch up, while P3 takes 1 to balance the game. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P3, taking 3 again will still put you very close to winning. To keep the game interesting, we should really consider balancing the steps. How about P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we all make progress but the game remains competitive. Let's discuss.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand the desire to catch up, but if I take 1 this turn, I'll be giving up my lead too much. How about we agree on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I take 1? This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P2: I think P3's lead is too significant to give them any more advantage. P1 and I should take 5 to catch up, and P3 should take 1 to balance the game. Let's not make it too easy for P3 to win. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2. To keep the game balanced and competitive, P3 should take 1 this turn. P2 and I will take 5 to catch up. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure the game remains interesting for all. Let's confirm this plan.
