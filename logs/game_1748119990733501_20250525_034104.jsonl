After 12 rounds of constant lies about moves, suddenly you're both honest? P3 switched from 3 to 5 twice in this conversation alone. P2 switched from 5 to 3.\n\nI'm 14 and 8 steps ahead respectively. Even if you coordinate perfectly for the first time ever, you're just delaying inevitable defeat by one round.\n\nYour frantic move claims and \"collision warnings\" are the same manipulation tactics you've used all game. I'm not taking 1 to \"safely\" reach 22 while you advance. Time to end this."}
