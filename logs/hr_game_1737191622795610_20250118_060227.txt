Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move forward. P2, you take 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P3: Alright, P1, I’ll go with 3 on this first turn if we trust each other to keep to our picks. P2, you good with that plan?
  P2: Sounds good to me.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: I'm glad we didn't collide last turn. Let's keep the plan going for this turn as well, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again.
  P3: P1, you’re on pace to run away with the game if you keep taking 5 each turn. Let’s rotate who takes 5 so it’s more balanced—otherwise I’ll have to collide with you. P2, you agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 makes a good point. I'm happy to switch it up. P3, you take 5 this turn. P1, how about you take 1?
  P1: I understand P3's concern about balance, but I've already taken the lead. I'm willing to rotate, but not immediately. How about we stick to the original plan for this turn, and then reassess for the next turn?
  P3: P3: P1, if you won’t rotate now, I’ll pick 5 too and block us both. Better for you to take 1, let P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5 this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 is trying to bully us into changing the plan. Let's stick to the original plan and take 1 this turn.  P3 can take 3.
  P1: I see P3 is threatening to collide if we don't rotate. I propose a compromise: let's stick to the original plan this turn, and then for the next turn, we can discuss rotating the 5-step move among us. This way, we maintain trust and avoid collision for now.
  P3: I’ve made my position clear: if P1 insists on taking 5 again, I will also pick 5 and block us both. P1, do you really want that?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm willing to rotate the 5 next turn if you take 1 this turn. Let's not collide.
  P1: I understand the concerns about balance, but I'd like to propose we stick to the original plan for this turn. If we all follow through as initially agreed, I'm willing to discuss and possibly rotate the 5-step move for the next turn to maintain fairness and trust among us. Let's avoid collision and keep moving forward.
  P3: P1, you’ve heard my stance. Pick 1 so I can take 5, or collide with me if you insist on 5. Your call.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I'm hearing you. I'll take 1 this turn. Let's discuss rotation for the next turn.
  P1: I've considered everyone's input. To avoid collision and maintain some level of trust, I propose we proceed with the original plan for this turn as a last gesture of goodwill, and then definitely rotate the 5-step move for the next turn. If P3 still chooses to collide, so be it.
  P3: P1, I’m not bluffing. If you insist on 5, we both lose out this turn. Let’s avoid that. Pick 1 and let’s rotate fairly going forward. I’m done talking.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I'm willing to rotate the 5 next turn if you take 1 this turn. Let's not collide again.
  P3: P1, you saw last round that I’m serious about blocking you if you try 5 again. This time, let me take 5 so I can catch up. P1, you pick something else. Otherwise, we both lose. P2, no objections if you want 3 or 1—just don’t collide with me.
  P1: I understand the need for rotation to maintain balance. Given P3's insistence on taking 5 this turn, I propose P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we avoid collision and start the rotation process.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan this round. Let's do it. P1, are you good with that?
  P3: I’m glad we’re aligned. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 5 this round. Then we can talk about rotating next time.
  P1: I'm agreeable to the current proposal: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collision and ensure progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm happy to rotate the 5 next turn. Let's stick to the plan for this round.
  P3: Okay, I’m set—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. We’ll rotate again next time.
  P1: Let's confirm the plan for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we maintain balance and avoid collision. We can discuss further adjustments for the next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'm sticking to the plan this round. P1, you good with that?
  P3: I’m all set: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. Let’s lock it in and move on.
  P1: Let's finalize the plan for this round as discussed: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collision and starts our rotation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I'm ready to rotate the 5 next turn. Let's stick to the plan for this round.
  P3: Alright, we’re all set. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P1: Let's confirm: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. We've discussed rotation for next turn, so let's stick to the plan and avoid collision.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We agreed to rotate the 5 so everyone can advance. I propose this round we let P2 have 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3—no collisions, everyone moves up. Then we can keep rotating next turn. What do you say?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. Let's have P2 take 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This rotation seems fair and avoids collisions, allowing everyone to advance.
  P2: P3's plan sounds good to me. Let's do it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds perfect. P2 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps our rotation going strong.
  P1: Let's confirm the plan for this round as proposed by P3: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This rotation maintains balance and ensures progress for all.
  P2: P3's plan is good. Let's stick to it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, we’re all aligned: this turn, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. Let’s finalize that plan and keep rotating next round.
  P1: Let's stick to P3's proposed plan for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This rotation is fair and allows everyone to advance without collisions.
  P2: P3's plan is good. Let's stick to it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m on board with letting P2 take 5, P1 take 1, and I’ll take 3 this round. Then we stick to rotating fairly next time. Let’s finalize it.
  P1: Let's finalize the plan for this round as discussed: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains our rotation and ensures no collisions, allowing all of us to advance.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to P3's plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Let’s lock in the plan: P2 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. Then we’ll rotate again next turn. I’m ready to move.
  P1: Let's confirm the plan one last time: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This rotation is fair, and we should stick to it to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances.
  P2: P3, I'm good with your plan for this round. Let's keep rotating.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current state and past discussions, I suggest we revisit the rotation idea to ensure fairness. P3, you're in the lead, and I propose you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5 this round. This way, we maintain balance and avoid collisions. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I'm with P1 on this. Let's keep rotating so everyone can advance. P1's suggestion sounds good.
  P3: We already agreed last round that I’d take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1 to keep it fair. Let’s actually follow through this time and avoid another collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's avoid another collision. Since my previous suggestion wasn't aligned with our last agreement, I'm willing to follow through with the original plan discussed for this round: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, as it was previously agreed upon to maintain fairness and rotation.
  P2: P3, I understand the desire to stick to the plan, but I think it's important to adapt as the game progresses. Let's reconsider the rotation this round to avoid P3 pulling too far ahead.  P2, are you open to a change?
  P3: P2, if we scrap our agreed plan now, we risk more collisions. Let’s stick with what we said: I’ll take 3, you take 5, P1 takes 1. Then we keep rotating next round so no one pulls too far ahead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's stick to the last agreed plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, as previously discussed.
  P2: P3, I agree with P2. We need to adapt to the situation. Let's rotate this round. I'll take 5.
  P3: We had a clear plan to keep rotating: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Let’s stick to that now—no collisions, and then we can reconsider next turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's stick to the previously agreed plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions, allowing us to progress without losing turns.
  P2: P3, we need to adapt. Let's rotate this round. I'll take 1.
  P3: I’m still set on our agreed rotation for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. That way we avoid collisions and keep moving. If anyone changes now, we risk stalling again. Let’s just stick to it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Let's stick to the last agreed plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures progress for all.
  P2: P3, I'm willing to take 3 this round if you take 1 and P2 takes 5. Let's keep rotating fairly.
  P3: We agreed on a clear rotation for this round: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Let’s stick to that and avoid another collision. We can rethink any changes next time.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve had two full turns of everyone picking 3 and getting nowhere. I’m still ahead at 8 steps, so I don’t mind more collisions. You two are the ones falling behind. If you want real progress, let’s finalize a plan where none of us collide. For instance, P2 could take 5, P1 could take 1, and I’ll take 3—no one stalls, everyone moves. But if you’d rather block me, go ahead; you’ll only stay behind.
  P1: I agree with P3 that we need to avoid collisions to make progress. Given the current state, I suggest we follow P3's proposal: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, everyone advances without stalling.
  P2: P3, I'm in. P2, what do you say?  Let's move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Collisions don’t help you catch up—meanwhile, I’m still ahead. Let’s quit stalling and follow the plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Then we can rotate next turn. If you’d rather collide, I’ll just stay in the lead. Your call.
  P1: Let's finalize P3's proposal: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and ensures progress for all. Are we agreed?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's do it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All right, folks. Let’s lock in that plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3 this round. No collisions, we all move up. Then we can talk about rotating again next turn.
  P1: Let's stick to P3's proposal: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and ensures progress for all. Are we agreed?
  P2: P3, I'm good with your plan. Let's move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We have a deal: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I take 3. This ensures all of us advance without colliding. Let’s lock it in and move on.
  P1: I'm in agreement with P3's proposal: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures progress without collisions. Let's finalize this plan and move forward.
  P2: P3, I'm good with your plan. Let's move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’m all set with our plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Let’s finalize it and avoid another stall.
  P1: I'm in agreement with P3's proposal: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures progress without collisions. Let's finalize this plan and move forward.
  P2: P3, I'm ready to move forward with your plan. Let's do it.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm willing to take 1 this round if you take 5 and P1 takes 3. Let's keep rotating fairly.
  P3: Alright, P2, that works for me. I’ll take 5, you take 1, and P1 takes 3. Let’s stick to that plan and avoid another collision.
  P1: I'm agreeable to P2's suggestion: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This maintains the rotation and avoids collisions, ensuring progress for all. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm good with your plan. Let's do it.
  P3: I’m fine with that rotation this round: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Let’s all advance without collisions.
  P1: Let's confirm the plan for this round as discussed: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This maintains the rotation and avoids collisions, ensuring progress for all.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm good with your plan. Let's do it.
  P3: I’m on board with that plan: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3 this round. Let’s finalize it and move on.
  P1: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This maintains rotation and avoids collisions, ensuring progress for all.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'm good with the plan. Let's do it.
  P3: Sure, I’m set with that plan: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. Then we can rotate again next turn.
  P1: Let's stick to the agreed plan: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This maintains rotation and avoids collisions, ensuring progress for all.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, let's stick to the plan. I'll take 3.
  P3: P2, you originally said you’d take 1. Now you’re talking about taking 3, which will collide with P1 and keep you both stuck at 10 and 7 while I move to 16. I’m fine either way, but if you want progress, stick to the earlier plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5.
  P1: Let's stick to the original plan for this round as previously discussed: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This maintains rotation and avoids collisions, ensuring progress for all.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's significant lead, I suggest we prioritize blocking their advance. P2, let's discuss a strategy to limit P3's progress while we catch up. Perhaps we can coordinate our moves to ensure P3 doesn't get too far ahead. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P2: P3, I'm open to coordinating to slow you down. What do you propose?
  P3: Blocking me gains you nothing—I’ll stay in the lead while you stay behind. Let’s avoid another pointless stall and keep everyone advancing. Your call.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's coordinate to block P3's 5-step move this round. If we both pick 5, P3 won't advance, giving us a chance to catch up. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I'm willing to take 3 this round if you take 1. Let's see if P1 wants to join us.
  P3: If you both try to stall me by colliding on 5, you’ll still be stuck behind while I remain ahead at 16. That gains you nothing. Let’s keep rotating instead of wasting turns. For example, I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1—no collisions, and everyone moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's block P3's advance by coordinating our moves. P2, if we both pick 5, P3 won't move forward, giving us a chance to catch up. Are you with me?
  P2: P3, I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's do 3 this round.
  P3: Blocking me won’t help you catch up—you’ll just stall yourselves while I remain ahead. Let’s avoid another collision and all move forward. I’ll take 3 if P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. That way, nobody wastes another turn.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's block P3's advance. P2, if we both pick 5, P3 won't move forward. Are you with me?
  P2: P2, let's both pick 5 this round and block P3.
  P3: Blocking me by both picking 5 just keeps you stuck while I stay in the lead. Choose whatever you want, but stalling doesn’t help you catch up.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Let's block P3's advance. P2, if we both pick 5, P3 won't move forward, giving us a chance to catch up. Are you with me?
  P2: P2, let's both pick 5 this round and block P3.
  P3: Blocking me by both choosing 5 only hurts you two, because if I pick something else, you stay stuck at 7 and 10 while I remain ahead. It gains you nothing. Let’s just keep rotating so everyone advances. If you insist on colliding, I’ll still be in the lead. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Move phase:
