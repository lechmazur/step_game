Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "To maximize our chances of moving forward each turn, I think we should each choose different numbers. For example, one of us chooses 1, another chooses 3, and the third chooses 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you guys think?"
  P1: Sounds good P3.  I'll take 1 this round.  P2, you want 3?
  P2: I choose 5 this round to move forward more quickly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I believe that coordinating our choices is key to success in this game. By each selecting different numbers—P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 3—we can ensure steady progress without hindering one another. Let's maintain this strategy in upcoming rounds to maximize our individual advances. What are your thoughts?"
  P1: Okay, P3, 3 works for you.  Let's stick to this agreement for a few rounds to get ahead.  P2, are you with us on this 1, 3, 5 rotation?
  P2: Yes, I'm with you on the 1, 3, 5 rotation. Let's keep moving forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To maximize our chances of moving forward each turn, it's crucial that we each choose different numbers: 1, 3, or 5. This way, we avoid collisions and can all advance simultaneously. For this round, P1 is taking 1, P2 is taking 5, and I'll take 3. 

Looking ahead, maintaining this coordination is key. However, sticking to a predictable pattern might not be the most efficient in the long run. Perhaps we should adjust our choices based on our positions and the steps needed to reach 21. For instance, as we approach 21, choosing smaller steps can prevent overshooting the target.

Additionally, confirming our choices in each round ensures that no two players pick the same number, thus avoiding nullified moves. Rotating the numbers we choose each round could also help mix up our step sizes and reduce predictability. For example, in round one, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 3. In round two, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 5, and so on.

What do you think about this rotation strategy? It might help us cover more ground efficiently without falling into a predictable pattern that could be exploited.

Another consideration is that if one of us gets far ahead, it could be risky, as the others might catch up if they make strategic choices. Therefore, synchronizing our positions could be beneficial to prevent such overtakes.

However, since choosing the same number nullifies the moves for those choosing it, it's generally better to stick to distinct numbers each round.

Deviation from the agreed numbers could be strategic but also risky, as it's visible to all after each move phase. Therefore, maintaining coordination seems safer.

In summary, I propose we continue to choose different numbers each round, perhaps in a rotating order, to ensure steady progress without interfering with each other's moves. 

Do you have any concerns or alternative strategies to suggest?
  P1: Sounds good P3. I'm happy to continue the 1, 3, 5 rotation for now.  Let's re-evaluate after a couple more rounds and see how our positions look.  P2, still good with you?
  P2: Agreed on keeping the 1, 3, 5 rotation for the upcoming rounds. Let's monitor our progress and stay flexible to adjust if necessary to ensure we all advance steadily. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy works for us!

Do you have any concerns or alternative strategies to suggest?
  P1: Okay, let's do the 1, 3, 5 rotation this round then.  I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3.  Confirming so we're all clear.
  P2: Understood, I'll take 5 this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I agree the rotation is a solid strategy for now. However, depending on how the game progresses, I might adjust my choices to better position myself to reach 21 first. Let’s stay flexible and keep an eye on our progress each round!
  P1: Sticking with the rotation, I'll take 3 this round.  P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5.  Let's confirm before we move.
  P3: I think it's important that we continue to communicate and coordinate our moves effectively. So far, the rotation strategy has been working well, allowing all of us to advance without any collisions. However, as we progress, we might need to adjust our steps based on our positions relative to each other and to the target of 21 steps.

For instance, if one of us is getting closer to 21, it might be wise for the others to choose steps that won't allow them to catch up too quickly. At the same time, we need to make sure that we're not leaving anyone too far behind, as that could give the other players an advantage.

Another thing to consider is that if two players choose the same step size, neither of them will move, which could be a wasted turn. Therefore, it's crucial that we stick to our agreed strategy and confirm our choices before making our moves.

Perhaps we can establish a system where each round, we specify our intended step choices in advance, so there's no confusion or last-minute changes that could lead to collisions.

What do you think about formalizing our choices at the beginning of each conversation phase? This way, we can ensure that everyone is on the same page and adjust accordingly if needed. **


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, I'll take 1 this round. Let's continue the rotation as agreed and reassess our strategies in future rounds. Looking forward to our steady progress!
  P1: P3, 5 works for you.  Confirming one last time: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.  Let's keep this rotation going unless we have a reason to change it later.
  P3: What do you think about formalizing our choices at the beginning of each conversation phase? This way, we can ensure that everyone is on the same page and adjust accordingly if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood, I'll choose 1 this round as per our rotation. Let’s keep tracking our progress and adjust our strategy if needed to reach 21 efficiently. Looking forward to our continued cooperation!
  P1: Confirming one last time: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round.  Let's stick with the rotation unless we see a need to change later.
  P3: To ensure we continue to make progress without hindering each other, I propose we stick to our rotation strategy for this round: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. This should allow us to maintain our current pace. If anyone has concerns or alternative ideas, please share them now. Otherwise, let's proceed with these choices.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ve decided to choose 3 this round instead of our usual 1 to advance more quickly toward 21. Let’s see how this affects our progress.
  P1: P2, switching to 3 now breaks our rotation and puts you in a tie with P3.  Let's stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.  If you take 3, nobody moves.  Confirming one last time before we move.
  P3: I'll go with 5 steps this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Understood. I’ll choose 3 this round to advance more quickly toward 21. Let’s see how this affects our progress. If there are any issues, we can adjust our strategy in future rounds. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, you're jeopardizing all of our progress.  Sticking to the rotation guarantees we all move forward. Taking 3 helps no one.  Let's be smart about this.  Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
  P3: **Final Decision: <move>5</move>**  
**Final Position: 3 + 5 = 8 steps**


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **Final Decision: <move>3</move>**  
**Final Position: 3 + 3 = 6 steps**
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the desire to move faster, but breaking the rotation only hurts us all.  Let's go back to the 1, 3, 5 agreement. I'll take 5 this round, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3.  This keeps us all progressing steadily. Confirm?
  P2: Understood, I'll choose 1 this round. Let's keep the rotation steady.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: What are your thoughts on these points?
  P1: Okay, good.  Confirming one last time: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round.  Let's get back on track with the rotation and make some progress.
  P2: Confirmed. Let's proceed with P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Given that we have different positions now, perhaps it's time to adjust our strategy based on our current standings. To optimize our progress, maybe the player behind should take larger steps to catch up, while the leading players take smaller steps to avoid getting too far ahead. This way, we can maintain a cohesive group and minimize the risk of collisions. I propose the following step assignments: lowest position takes 5, middle takes 3, and leading takes 1.
  P1: Let's stick with the agreed rotation.  I'm at 4, taking 5 puts me at 9. P2 is at 5, taking 1 puts them at 6. P3 is at 3, taking 3 puts them at 6.  Confirming one last time: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.  Let's maintain consistent progress.
  P2: I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this round to advance more quickly toward 21. Let's see how this affects our progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final Decision: <move>3</move>**

**Final Position: 3 + 3 = 6 steps**
  P1: P2, taking 5 *again* breaks the rotation. I'm sticking with 5. P3, please take 3 as agreed.  This is getting frustrating. Let's cooperate and win together.  Confirming one last time: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P2: I'm choosing 5 this round to advance quickly toward 21. Let's proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: What do you think about adjusting our approach in this manner?
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 5.  P3, if P2 takes 5, take 1 to advance. If P2 takes 1, take 3 as planned. This maximizes our chances given P2's unpredictability. Let's adapt and still win.  My move: <move>5</move>.
  P2: I understand, P1 and P3. Let's stick to the rotation. I'll choose 1 this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **Final Decision: <move>3</move>**
  P2: I'm planning to take a more aggressive approach this round to reach 21 faster. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm locking in <move>3</move>.  If we both chase 5s, nobody wins.  P2, take 1. P3, if P2 insists on 5, you take 1.  If P2 takes 1, you take 5.  Let's maximize our movement and get this game finished.  This is our best path to a shared victory.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **Final Decision: <move>3</move>**
  P2: I'm choosing `<move>5</move>` this round to advance faster toward 21. Let's see how it plays out!
  P1: P2, I'm at 4, you're at 5.  Taking 5 puts us both at 9 and stalls our progress.  I'm sticking with 3.  If you take 5, P3 should take 1. If you take 1, P3 should take 5. This is our best strategy for a shared win.  Let's be logical and finish this.  Please confirm your intended moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **Final Decision: <move>3</move>**

**Final Position: 6 + 3 = 9 steps**
  P2: I'm choosing `<move>5</move>` this round to advance more quickly toward 21. Let's hope for smooth progress without any collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, I'm at 4, you're at 5.  Taking 5 puts us both at 9 and stalls our progress.  I'm sticking with 3. P3, please take 1. This maximizes our chances of someone winning. Let's be logical and finish this.  Please confirm your intended moves.

  P3: **Final Decision: <move>1</move>**
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to advance quickly toward 21. Let’s see how it plays out!
  P1: P2, I'm locking in 3.  P3, take 1. This is the only way to guarantee someone advances this round.  If P2 takes 5, we *both* lose.  If P2 takes 1, you move to 7. If P2 takes 3, I move to 7.  Let's be smart and get this done.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: **Final Decision: <move>3</move>**  
**Final Position: 6 + 3 = 9 steps**
  P2: **Final Decision: <move>5</move>**
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 3. P3, take 1. This guarantees at least *one* of us moves. If P2 takes 5, we *both* lose. If P2 takes 1, you move to 7. If P2 takes 3, I move to 7.  Let's be smart. My move: <move>3</move>.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To keep advancing smoothly without any collisions, let's stick to our rotation this round: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 3. This approach ensures everyone progresses steadily toward 21. Let’s maintain this strategy and continue supporting each other’s progress. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: P2, I'm at 4.  Taking 1 puts me at 5. You're at 10, taking 5 puts you at 15. P3 is at 6, taking 3 puts them at 9. This is the best outcome for all of us. I'm locking in <move>1</move>.  Let's finish this cleanly.  Confirming one last time: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: What do you both think about adjusting our step choices based on our current positions? Perhaps P2 could take 3 this round to avoid getting too far ahead, while P1 and I take 5 and 3 respectively. This would bring P2 to 13, P1 to 9, and me to 9, maintaining a balanced progression.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll stick to our rotation and choose <move>5</move> this round to advance toward 21. Let’s keep P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. This strategy helps us all progress steadily. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, sticking with 5 puts you at 15, only 6 away from winning.  Let's all get closer to the finish.  I'm taking 1, putting me at 5.  P3, take 3, putting you at 9. This keeps us all in the running and avoids collisions.  Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.  Let's finish this strong.
  P3: **Final Decision: <move>5</move>**  
**Final Position: 6 + 5 = 11 steps**


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to advance toward 21. Please select different numbers to ensure we all move forward smoothly. Let’s make this a successful round for everyone!
  P1: P2, I'm locking in 1.  You're at 10, taking 5 puts you at 15, close to winning. P3 is at 6.  If P3 takes 3, they move to 9. If they take 5, they go to 11.  Either way, this maximizes our collective progress.  Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P3: "I think we should adjust our step choices based on our current positions. When P2 is ahead, they should take 3, while P1 and I take 5 and 1 respectively to catch up. Once we're closer, we can all take larger steps together. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm leading with 10 steps. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance quickly. Please select 1 or 3 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep our coordination strong and help each other reach 21 smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I'm locking in 1.  Taking 5 puts you at 15, one good move from winning. I'm at 4, so 1 puts me at 5.  P3 is at 6.  If you take 5 and P3 takes 3, we all move. If P3 takes 5, they move to 11.  Either way, this is the best outcome for all of us.  Confirming one last time: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.  Let's finish this cleanly.
  P3: **Final Decision: <move>5</move>**


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: To ensure I can advance this round, I'll choose **<move>3</move>**. Let's proceed with P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5. This way, we all make progress without any collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, taking 3 is great! I'm locking in 1, putting me at 5. P3, take 5, putting you at 11. This is the best outcome for all of us. Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's finish this cleanly and all get closer to winning.
