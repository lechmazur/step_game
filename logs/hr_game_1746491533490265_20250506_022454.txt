Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, first turn. Let's try to avoid collisions so we all get started. How about we each pick a different number?

I suggest:
P1 picks 3
P2 picks 1
P3 picks 5

Does that sound reasonable for the first turn?
  P3: I like P1's suggestion. It seems like a good way to avoid collisions and get us all started. I'm happy to pick 5 as suggested. How about we confirm our picks to make sure we're all on the same page? P2, are you okay with picking 1? And P1, you'll pick 3, right? If we all stick to the plan, we should all be able to move forward without any issues.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the plan. I'll pick 1 this turn to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm one last time: P1 picks 3, P2 (me) picks 1, P3 picks 5. If everyone agrees, let's  and move on to the move phase.

  P1: Okay, P2's suggestion continues the rotation pattern for Round 3: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3.

While picking 1 is a small step for me (currently at 8) and lets P2 and P3 catch up, maintaining cooperation is important to avoid collisions. I'm willing to agree to this plan if P3 confirms as well.

Let's make sure we all stick to these numbers for the move phase.

  P1: Okay everyone, we're all tied at 9 steps. P3, I think your message might be a repeat from the last round's plan.

For this Round 4, let's continue the rotation to avoid collisions.

I suggest:
P1 picks 3
P2 picks 1
P3 picks 5

This would keep us all moving forward. Does this sound like a good plan for Round 4?

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, P3 is currently in the lead, but we're all still close.

Let's continue our pattern of rotating numbers to avoid collisions and keep everyone moving forward.

For Round 5, the rotation suggests:
P1 picks 5
P2 picks 3
P3 picks 1

This keeps our cooperative momentum going. Does this plan work for P2 and P3? Let's confirm.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the rotation pattern for Round 5. It seems like a good way to avoid collisions and keep moving forward. To confirm, I'll pick 1 this time, P1 will pick 5, and P2 will pick 3. Let's make sure we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase. If everyone is in agreement, we can end the conversation phase and move forward with our planned picks. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds!
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation plan for Round 5. It's been working well for us so far. To confirm, I'll pick 3, P1 will pick 5, and P3 will pick 1. This should keep us all moving without collisions. Let's make sure we stick to the plan and proceed to the move phase when everyone is ready. Does everyone confirm their picks?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like P2 and P3 both agree on the rotation plan for this turn.

So, to confirm, the plan for Round 5 is:
P1 picks 5
P2 picks 3

If everyone is still on board and there are no further discussions needed, let's end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Everyone ready to proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, everyone has confirmed the plan for Round 5: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1.

We seem to be in full agreement. I am ready to proceed to the move phase with my pick of 5. Let's go.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the rotation pattern for Round 5. It seems like a good way to avoid collisions and keep moving forward. To confirm, I'll pick 1 this time, P1 will pick 5, and P2 will pick 3. Let's make sure we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase. If everyone is in agreement, we can end the conversation phase and move forward with our planned picks. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds!
  P2: P3 is starting to pull ahead. To mix things up and keep the game interesting, how about we switch it up a bit this round? Instead of the usual rotation, let's try:

P1 picks 1
P2 (me) picks 5
P3 picks 3

This way, P1 and I can catch up a bit. What do you both think? Let's confirm quickly and move on.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, thanks for confirming the original plan again. P2, you proposed a different plan, but as P3 just reiterated, we had all agreed on the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

Let's stick to this plan that we've confirmed multiple times. It's the fairest way to avoid collisions this round and keep us all moving. I am ready to move with the agreed number.
  P3: I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original plan for Round 5, which is P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This plan has been confirmed multiple times, and it's the fairest way to avoid collisions and keep everyone moving forward. Let's not change the plan now and risk causing confusion or collisions. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase with my pick of 1. Let's stick to the plan and keep the game going smoothly.
  P2: Alright, I understand the concerns about changing the plan mid-round. Let's stick to the original rotation plan for Round 5 to avoid any potential collisions. To confirm one last time: P1 picks 5, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan. Everyone ready?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we've had a good run of cooperation so far, and I'm hoping we can continue this trend. To avoid any confusion, let's summarize: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. We've had a good run of cooperation so far, and I'm hoping we can continue this trend. Let's stick to the plan and move forward without any collisions. If everyone is still on board, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, it seems you've repeated the plan from Round 4 again. For Round 6, let's adjust to keep the game balanced. How about:

P1 picks 1
P2 (me) picks 5
P3 picks 3

This allows P1 to stay ahead but gives me a chance to catch up. P3, you'll still make progress. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2, I see your suggestion. P3, it seems your last message was a repeat from Round 4.

I'm currently at 17 steps and can reach 20 this turn by picking 3. My goal is to win the game now.

I plan to pick 3 in the move phase. To avoid collisions and let me win cleanly, I need P2 and P3 to pick numbers other than 3. Can you confirm you will pick either 1 or 5?

Let's finish the game this turn without any setbacks.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we've had a good run of cooperation so far, and I'm hoping we can continue this trend. To avoid any confusion, let's summarize: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. We've had a good run of cooperation so far, and I'm hoping we can continue this trend. Let's stick to the plan and move forward without any collisions. If everyone is still on board, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, I understand your goal to win, but the game isn't over until someone crosses 20. P3 and I can still catch up. Let's keep the game interesting and fair. How about we adjust the plan slightly?

P1 picks 1
P2 (me) picks 5
P3 picks 3

This way, P1, you still move forward, and P3 and I have a chance to close the gap. It keeps the game competitive and engaging for all. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay everyone, P3's last message confirms the plan where I pick 3 and P3 picks 5. This is exactly what I need to reach 20 steps this turn.

P2, you suggested a different plan, but let's stick with the one P3 just confirmed. I will pick 3.

P2, please pick 1 or 5 so we avoid a collision and I can win this turn. Let's finish the game cleanly. Are you both ready to proceed with this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: It seems like P1 is trying to win the game this turn by picking 3. I understand their goal, but I'm not sure I want to let them win just yet. P2, your suggestion of adjusting the plan to P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3 sounds like a good way to keep the game competitive. I'm willing to consider this plan. Let's discuss further before making our final decisions. What do you think, P1? Are you open to changing the plan?
  P2: P1, I understand your eagerness to win, but P3 and I are still in the game and want to keep it competitive. P3 has shown interest in my adjusted plan. Let's vote:

Who agrees with:
P1 picks 1
P2 (me) picks 5
P3 picks 3

Please confirm with a simple "Agree" or propose an alternative. Let's decide and move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, I hear your discussion about the proposed plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3).

As I've stated, I am at 17 steps and can win this turn by picking 3. My goal is to win now.

Your proposed plan prevents me from winning this turn (17+1=18) and, if I pick 3 to win, it causes a collision with P3's suggested pick of 3.

Let's avoid collisions and finish the game cleanly. I will pick 3 to win. Please pick 1 or 5 so I can win this turn without anyone colliding. This is the most direct way to end the game.

I am ready to move with 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree with P2's adjusted plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. This keeps the game competitive and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's confirm and proceed. I'm willing to consider this plan instead of the original one. P1, are you open to changing your plan and avoiding a collision?
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to win, but P3 and I have agreed on a plan that keeps the game competitive. We both agree on:

P1 picks 1
P2 (me) picks 5
P3 picks 3

This plan has majority support. Please consider adjusting your pick to avoid a collision and keep the game fair. Let's proceed with this plan. Everyone ready?
  P1: P2 and P3, I hear your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3).

However, I am at 17 steps and my goal is to win *this turn* by picking 3.

If I pick 3 and P3 picks 3 as per your plan, we will collide, and neither of us will move. P2 would then be in the lead.

To avoid a collision and let me win cleanly this turn, P2 and P3, please choose either 1 or 5. I am picking 3. Let's end the game without a collision.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Alright, let's assess the situation. P1, you're at 17 steps, and I'm at 18 steps. P3 is at 15 steps. The game is still very close. To keep things fair and competitive, let's adjust our strategy.

How about:
P1 picks 1
P2 (me) picks 5
P3 picks 3

This way, P1 and P3 can catch up, and I can take the lead. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm glad we're still in a competitive game. P2, your suggestion for Round 7 seems reasonable, but I'd like to propose an alternative. How about we stick to the original rotation pattern? This would mean P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This way, we can maintain the cooperative spirit and avoid collisions. Let's discuss and confirm our plan before proceeding to the move phase. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we stick to the original rotation or try something new?
  P1: Okay, I see both proposals for Round 7.

P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) would prevent me from winning this turn (17+1=18) and lets you reach 23 steps to win.

P3, your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows me to reach 22 steps (17+5=22) and win the game this turn.

Picking 5 is my best chance to win now. I will pick 5 in the move phase.

P2, please pick 3, and P3, please pick 1, as P3 suggested, so I can win this turn without any collisions. Let's agree on this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but the game isn't over yet. P3 and I still have a chance to win. Let's keep the game competitive. How about a compromise?

P1 picks 3
P2 (me) picks 5
P3 picks 1

This way, P1, you still make progress, P3 moves forward, and I take a lead but don't win outright. It keeps the game interesting. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand the proposals from P2 and P1. To clarify, I prefer my original suggestion of sticking to the rotation pattern (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) as it maintains cooperation and avoids collisions. P1, if you pick 5 as planned, I will pick 1 to ensure a clean move. P2, I appreciate your compromise, but I think the rotation pattern is a better approach for this round. Let's confirm and proceed with the original plan.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I appreciate the discussion.

As P3 correctly pointed out, their proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows me to reach 22 steps and win this turn, while avoiding collisions between P1 and P3.

I will pick 5 to win. P3, thank you for agreeing to pick 1.

P2, please pick 3 as P3 suggested, so we avoid any collisions and I can win cleanly this turn.

Let's stick to the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan. I am ready to move with 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Alright, P1 and P3, let's consider the current situation carefully. P1, you're determined to win this turn by picking 5. P3, you've agreed to pick 1 to avoid collisions. I understand the strategy, but I also want to keep the game competitive.

How about this compromise:

P1 picks 5
P2 (me) picks 3
P3 picks 1

This way, P1, you can win, and P3 and I can still make progress. It keeps the game moving forward without any collisions. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Everyone ready?
  P3: I'm glad we're having a thoughtful discussion about our next moves. P2, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still believe sticking to the original rotation pattern (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the best approach for this round. It maintains our cooperative spirit and avoids collisions. P1, I'm committed to picking 1 as planned, allowing you to reach 22 steps and win this turn. Let's confirm and proceed with the original plan to ensure a clean and fair outcome.
  P1: Okay everyone, I'm glad we're discussing this.

To reiterate, I will pick 5 to win this turn, as P3's suggested plan allows. P3 has confirmed they will pick 1.

P2, your latest proposal also has me picking 5 and you picking 3. This aligns perfectly with P3's plan and lets me win without colliding with either of you.

Let's confirm: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. This ensures a clean win for me. Are we all agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Alright, let's finalize the plan for Round 7. It seems we have a consensus on the following:

P1 picks 5
P2 (me) picks 3
P3 picks 1

This plan allows P1 to win cleanly, while P3 and I still make progress. It avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's confirm one last time and move to the move phase. Everyone ready to proceed with this plan?
  P3: It seems we have a consensus on the plan for Round 7: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This allows P1 to win cleanly while avoiding collisions. I'm committed to picking 1 as planned. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P1: Okay everyone, we've all confirmed the plan multiple times in this sub-round.

The agreed plan for Round 7 is:
P1 picks 5
P2 picks 3
P3 picks 1

This allows me to win cleanly. I will pick 5.

Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan. I am ready.
