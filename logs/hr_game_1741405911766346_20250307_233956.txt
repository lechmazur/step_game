Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5. P2, you can choose 3, and P3 take 1. This way, we all advance without blocking each other.
  P3: P1, your plan sounds good for now, but let's consider future rounds. If we keep the same pattern, someone might exploit it. How about we rotate our choices every round to keep it fair and unpredictable? For this round, I'll take 1 as you suggested.
  P2: I’m fine with the plan for round one. Let’s see how it unfolds and consider a rotation strategy next time.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your rotation idea is smart for later, but let's execute the current plan first to guarantee progress. P2, your agreement helps—let’s lock in our choices now to avoid collisions. I’ll hold to my number.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the collaboration. Let's stick to the plan this round to ensure we all advance. For future rounds, we should definitely consider rotating our choices or discussing new strategies to keep things unpredictable and fair. Remember, if we all cooperate now, we can avoid unnecessary collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
  P2: I’m fine sticking to our initial plan for this round. Afterward, we can revisit the rotation idea and see where everyone stands. Let’s keep cooperating to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <move>5</move>  
P2/P3, let’s finalize our agreed plan to avoid collisions. I’ll stick to 5, you take 3 and 1 respectively. Any last objections? Confirm your choices so we can proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we're all set for this round. I'll stick with 1 as planned. Let's see how this strategy works out and regroup afterward to discuss any adjustments. Cooperation is key, but let's stay flexible and ready to adapt. Best of luck!
  P2: I’m satisfied with our plan for this round. Let’s lock it in and avoid collisions so we can all move forward without setbacks. After we see the results, we’ll revisit the rotation idea and adjust as needed. Good luck to us all!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great start, everyone! We advanced without collisions, which is promising. For this round, let's discuss our moves to keep progressing. How about we rotate? I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps things fair and unpredictable. Open to other suggestions, but let's aim for no collisions again. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m fine with trying the rotation you’ve proposed. I’ll go with 5 this round if P1 agrees to 1 and P3 takes 3. Let’s confirm these specific moves so we stay collision-free and keep everyone progressing.
  P1: P3's rotation idea is good, but let’s optimize progress. I’ll take **3** this round instead of 1, allowing P2 to take **5** and P3 to stay at **1**. This way, I advance to 8 without collision, and we maintain fairness. P2, does this work for you? P3, your 1 keeps things safe. Let’s confirm and move!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your suggestion to take 3 instead of 1 could lead to a collision with me if I take 3 as initially proposed. To avoid this, let's stick to my original rotation idea where I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and fair progress for everyone. P2, are you okay with this? Let's confirm our choices to keep advancing smoothly.
  P2: I support the rotation proposed by P3 for this round: P3 picks 3, P1 picks 1, and I pick 5. That ensures no collisions and steady progress for all of us. P1, please confirm you’ll choose 1, and P3 will choose 3. Let’s lock this in and keep moving forward without setbacks.
  P1: P3, P2, I concede to your rotation plan to prioritize progress. I’ll take **1** this round as proposed, you take 3 and 5 respectively. Let’s confirm: P3:3, P2:5, P1:1. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing. Next round we can discuss further optimizations, but for now, cooperation ensures movement. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, it looks like we’re all aligned on the rotation plan for this round: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing smoothly. Let’s lock in these choices and proceed. Cooperation is key, and we can revisit our strategy in the next round based on the updated scores. Agreed?
  P2: I’m good with P3’s rotation plan for now: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I’ll go 5. Let’s finalize this to avoid collisions and keep everyone moving forward. We can reconsider next round if needed.
  P1: Confirmed. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Let’s stick to this rotation to keep advancing safely. No sense risking collisions now—progress first, optimize later.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: To accelerate, let’s prioritize higher numbers this round. I’ll take **5** (total 11), P2 takes **3** (to 11), and P3 takes **1** (5). This avoids collisions while pushing us forward. P2 stays in the lead but allows me to close the gap, and P3 gains ground. Fair and strategic—agreed?
  P2: P1, let me propose a small tweak: let me take 5 to reach 13, while you take 3 (up to 9), and P3 takes 1 (5). There’s no collision, and we each advance. This keeps our progress balanced and helps me maintain a slight lead, but you’re still close. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure no collisions while advancing. P2's suggestion for this round seems balanced: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us all progressing smoothly and maintains strategic positioning. Let's confirm this plan to avoid setbacks and keep everyone in the game. Ready to lock it in?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: I think my initial proposal ensures better collective progress. Let’s stick to P1:5 (11), P2:3 (11), P3:1 (5). This keeps us all competitive—no one gains an unmanageable lead. P2’s plan risks letting you surge too far ahead, which might isolate us later. Let’s balance advancement now for a fairer race. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about balance, but maintaining momentum is also crucial. Let’s try my proposal: I pick 5, you pick 3, and P3 picks 1—no collisions, and everyone still advances. Next round, we can reevaluate and ensure no single player gets too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on avoiding collisions while maintaining progress. I suggest we go with P2's plan: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. This ensures progress without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. We can reassess our strategies in the next round based on new standings. Let's confirm this plan and keep advancing smoothly. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s stick with my proposal for balanced progress—P1:5 (11), P2:3 (11), P3:1 (5). Giving you an 8-point lead risks letting you pull away uncontested. This keeps us tied at 11, fair for all. P3, your 1 is safe—no risk. We agreed on fairness; don’t let one player surge ahead. Confirm now?
  P2: My friends, while I’d prefer to maximize progress, I’m open to meeting in the middle. Let’s finalize P1:5, P2:3, and P3:1 so we stay collision-free. Tying at 11 with P1 is acceptable for now, but I expect we’ll all reevaluate next round to ensure nobody pulls too far ahead. If we truly want fairness in the long run, we should remain flexible. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, to ensure fairness and avoid collisions, let's go with P2's proposal: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps our progress balanced and avoids giving anyone a significant lead. We can reassess our strategies next round based on the updated standings to maintain competitiveness. Let's confirm this plan and move forward smoothly. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re tied, so let’s try this: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance. This keeps the race balanced while giving P3 a chance to catch up. If we agree, we can finalize and move without risk. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan avoids collisions but lets you gain too much. Let’s adjust: I’ll take **3** (14 total), you take **5** (16), and P3 takes **1** (6). This keeps us competitive while advancing safely. P3, your 1 secures progress. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on keeping the game balanced while ensuring no collisions. P1's suggestion allows P2 to gain a lead, but it still keeps us competitive. However, I propose an alternative: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This gives me a chance to catch up slightly while maintaining balance. Let's confirm and move forward strategically. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 5 now, you’ll be too close to us. I’d prefer me at 5, P1 at 1, and you at 3, so there’s still room for you to catch up. That setup guarantees no collisions and keeps the race interesting. Let’s finalize this plan, then reevaluate next round. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize this: **I’ll take 5** (16 total), you (P2) take 3 (14), and P3 takes 1 (6). This keeps us competitive while advancing safely—I lead slightly but stay within striking range. P3, your 1 ensures progress. P2, no objections? Confirm now to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1, P2, let's keep things fair and avoid collisions. I propose I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 can lead slightly, but we all advance without setbacks. It ensures competitiveness and gives me a chance to catch up. Let's confirm this plan and proceed strategically. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your proposal works for me. I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1—no collisions, and all of us keep progressing. P1, do you confirm you’ll pick 1? Let’s finalize this plan and move forward.
  P1: P1: To secure momentum, let’s adjust: **I’ll take 5 (16 total)**, P2 takes **3 (14)**, and P3 takes **1 (6)**. This avoids collisions while positioning me to challenge for the lead. P2, your 3 keeps you competitive; P3, your 1 ensures progress. Confirm this split to advance strategically—no one gets left behind, yet we push forward. Deal?
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure fair progress while avoiding collisions. I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This setup allows P2 to lead slightly, but we all advance without setbacks. It keeps the race competitive and gives me a chance to catch up. Let's confirm this plan and proceed strategically. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your lead is concerning. Let's slow you down. I’ll take **5** to block your path. P3, take **1** so P2 can only pick **3**. This keeps the race competitive. P2 ends at 19 instead of 21, giving us a better chance. P3, agree?
  P2: P1, if you pick 5 purely to block me, we both risk colliding and not advancing. That slows us all down. P3, you won’t catch up if P1 stalls at 12. Let’s instead avoid collisions so everyone moves forward. For example, P3 could pick 5, P1 picks 1, and I pick 3—nobody blocks, and the race stays competitive. We should keep the game fair without stalling anyone. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions. P2, your suggestion of me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and you taking 3 sounds fair and keeps the game competitive. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. P1, your strategy to block might backfire with a stalemate. Let's ensure we all move forward and keep the race interesting. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s adjust for tighter competition! I’ll take **3** (15 total), you (P2) take **1** (17), and P3 takes **5** (13). This keeps the race close while avoiding collisions. P2’s lead stays manageable, and P3 advances. If we stick to this, I can challenge next round. Fair?
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions so we all advance. If P1 takes 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 can choose 5. That lands us at 13, 19, and 13. It’s a fair setup, with no one blocked, and it keeps the race competitive. Sound good?
  P3: P1, P2, let's aim for progress without collisions. P2's suggestion of me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3 is balanced and keeps us all advancing. This way, I can catch up a bit, and we maintain a competitive race. Blocking risks stalling us all. Let's confirm this plan and ensure everyone moves forward—fair for all. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s tie the lead to keep this competitive! I’ll take **5** (17 total), you (P2) take **1** (17), and P3 picks **3** (11). This prevents you from surging too far, keeps me in direct contention, and gives P3 ground. No collisions, fair progress—agree?
  P2: P1, tying our scores doesn’t really keep it “fair”—it just slows progress. Let’s avoid collisions and ensure everyone moves forward. I propose you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. That way, P3 gets a boost, I maintain a slight lead, and you still advance. It’s a balanced plan. Are we all good with that?
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions while keeping the game balanced. P2's suggestion of me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3 seems fair. This allows me to catch up a bit while maintaining competitiveness. Blocking risks stalling us all. Let's confirm this plan to ensure everyone moves forward smoothly. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your lead is concerning. Let’s block your path to 24 this round. I’ll take **5** to deny you that move. P3, please pick **1** or **3** to avoid collision. This forces P2 to choose between 1 or 3, keeping the race open. We can’t let anyone win prematurely—fair play requires halting runaway leads. Confirm your choices now.
  P2: P1, if you pick 5 just to block me, we risk colliding and helping no one—especially P3, who needs to catch up. Let’s avoid collisions and keep everyone moving so we maintain a fair contest. For instance, P1 can choose 1, P3 can choose 5, and I’ll take 3. That way, each of us advances, and no one is stalled. We can reevaluate next turn, but stalling now might hand an advantage to someone else later. Let’s cooperate while keeping the race competitive.
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions while keeping the game balanced. P2's suggestion of me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3 seems fair. This allows me to catch up a bit while maintaining competitiveness. Blocking risks stalling us all. Let's confirm this plan to ensure everyone moves forward smoothly. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, while I understand your proposal avoids collision, letting you reach 22 this round still gives you a near-certain win next turn. Let’s instead split moves to keep tension alive: I’ll take **3** (15), P3 takes **5** (13), and you pick **1** (20). This keeps all of us advancing without letting anyone clinch victory prematurely. Fair play demands we stay competitive—agree? P3, your thoughts?
  P2: P1, continually blocking me might backfire, giving P3 extra rounds to catch up. We should avoid collisions so we can all progress efficiently. P3, you gain more if we don’t stall each other. Let’s finalize a collision-free setup—perhaps P1 chooses a smaller step, I take a medium one, and you take the largest. Then everyone moves forward, and we can reevaluate next turn. This keeps the race competitive and prevents wasted opportunities. We all benefit by avoiding collisions. Are we in agreement, or do we risk giving someone else an unopposed path toward victory?
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions. P2's suggestion of me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3 seems balanced. This allows me to catch up while keeping the race competitive. Blocking risks stalling us all. Let's confirm this plan to ensure everyone progresses smoothly and keeps the game interesting. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize P2 takes 3 (22), P3 takes 5 (13), and I’ll take 1 (13). This blocks your path to 24 while ensuring all advance. P3 gains ground, and we keep pressure on P2. No sense letting anyone win prematurely—fair and collision-free. Confirm?
  P2: Let’s finalize moves as you suggest: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures no collisions, and we all advance. I’m fine with delaying my big jump if it keeps the game balanced. Next round, we can reevaluate our positions. Good luck, and let’s keep it competitive!
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions. P2's suggestion of me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3 seems balanced and keeps the race competitive. This way, I can catch up a bit while we all progress. Blocking risks stalling us all and could backfire. Let's confirm this plan to ensure everyone moves forward smoothly. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions while keeping the game balanced. P2, I understand your lead is significant, but let's ensure everyone progresses. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3? This allows me to catch up a bit while maintaining competitiveness. Blocking risks stalling us all. Let's confirm this plan to ensure everyone moves forward smoothly. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your plan works for me. Let’s do it: you take 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll pick 3. We all advance without collisions, keeping the game competitive. I’m ready to confirm if you are.
  P1: P3, let’s block P2’s path to 24. I’ll take 3 (total 15), and you take 5 (18). This forces P2 to choose 1 or 3—avoiding their win. We both advance while keeping the race open. Agreed? P2, this ensures a fair continuation.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P1, your suggestion to block P2 might stall us all. Instead, let's ensure everyone progresses. P2, your plan for me to take 5, P1 to take 1, and you to take 3 seems balanced. This way, I can catch up while maintaining competitiveness. Let's confirm this plan to ensure smooth progress for everyone. Agreed?
  P2: Friends, blocking me just stalls progress and could let P1 surge later. Let’s avoid collisions so everyone advances. I propose: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we all move safely this round instead of wasting moves. We can then reevaluate next turn. Stalling now only benefits whoever’s behind. Let’s finalize this plan and keep the race dynamic, agreed?
  P1: P2, your proposal risks ending the game prematurely. Let’s block your path to 24: I’ll take **5**, and P3, please pick **3**. This forces you to choose 1 or avoid collision. We’ll all advance fairly while keeping the race open. P3, agree? Let’s ensure no single player wins without competition.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure progress without collisions. P2, I understand your lead, but let's keep it competitive. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, maintaining tension and fairness. Blocking risks stalling and could backfire. Let's confirm this plan to keep the game dynamic and competitive. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I’m fine with your plan. You take 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll pick 3. This way, nobody collides and all of us advance. Let’s finalize that and head to the move phase.
  P1: P2, I’ll take **5** to block your path to 24. P3, please pick **5** too—colliding with P2 ensures nobody reaches 24 this round. If you take 3 or 1, P2 wins immediately. Let’s collaborate to keep the race fair. Confirm your support to block P2’s victory.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: My friends, stalling me only helps P3. Colliding at 5 means we both stay put, letting P3 surge. Instead, let’s each pick distinct moves so we all progress. I’ll choose 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 picks 1—no collisions, and the race remains competitive. Let’s finalize this plan and keep moving.
  P1: P2, your proposal lets you win immediately, which isn’t fair. Let’s block your path: I’ll take **5** (17 total), P3 takes **3** (21), and you take **1** (20). This keeps the race open and prevents anyone from winning this round. P3, agree to this split to keep the competition fair? We can’t let one player dominate so abruptly.
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P1, your proposal to block P2 seems strategic, but let's ensure everyone progresses. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, maintaining tension and fairness. Blocking risks stalling and could backfire. Let's confirm this plan to keep the game dynamic and competitive. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Friends, let’s avoid stalling and keep everyone advancing. If P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3, nobody collides, no one wins immediately, and all of us move closer. That sets up a fair showdown next round. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward.
  P1: P2, P3: To keep the race fair, I propose **P1 takes 5 (17), P3 takes 3 (21), and you (P2) take 1 (20)**. This prevents your immediate win while advancing all of us. P3 stays competitive at 21, and I gain ground. P2, your 1 keeps you in contention without ending the game now. P3, agree? Let’s lock this in to maintain fairness and pressure on all sides.
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure we all advance without collisions while keeping the game fair. P2, your lead is significant, but let's keep it competitive. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This way, we all progress without blocking each other, maintaining tension and fairness. Blocking risks stalling and could backfire. Let's confirm this plan to keep the game dynamic and competitive. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Stalling me only helps P3 leapfrog us. Let’s each pick different moves to avoid collisions and keep it competitive. I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way, we all advance, nobody is blocked, and the race remains open. Collisions would just waste our turns and risk boosting P3 at our expense. Let’s confirm distinct moves so we maintain a fair, exciting finish.
  P1: P2, your proposal risks an immediate win—unfair. Let’s finalize my plan: **P1 takes 5 (17)**, **P3 takes 3 (21)**, and **you take 1 (20)**. This keeps the race open and prevents premature victory. P3, agree to this split? We must ensure fair competition for all. Colliding on 5 only stalls us, but this maintains pressure and advancement for everyone.
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure fair progress without collisions. P1, your plan to block P2 seems strategic, but I suggest a balanced approach: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance, keeping the game competitive and preventing any premature victory. Blocking risks stalling us all. Let's confirm this plan to maintain fairness and tension. Agreed?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: My friends, blocking a single player can backfire and allow someone else to surge. Let’s each choose different steps so nobody collides and everyone advances. For example, P1 can pick 1, P3 can pick 5, and I can pick 3. That way, we all move forward without handing anyone an easy advantage. It keeps the game competitive and prevents wasted turns from collisions. Let’s finalize distinct numbers and see how things stand next round.
  P3: P1, P2, let's aim for progress without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P2, your lead is significant, but let's ensure fairness. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, maintaining tension and fairness. Blocking risks stalling us all and could backfire. Let's confirm this plan to keep the game dynamic and competitive. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your lead is too close! Let’s block your path to victory: **I’ll take 3 (15 total)**, and P3, please pick **5 (23)**. This forces you to choose 1, keeping you at 22. We both advance while denying you the win. P3, this keeps you competitive—agree? We can’t let anyone win without a fight!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Friends, let's stop colliding and let everyone advance. How about we pick distinct numbers: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll choose 5. That way, nobody stalls, and the race stays competitive as we each move closer to 24. We’ve spent too many turns blocking—it only benefits someone else in the long run. Let’s lock in this clean split, then see who can make the final push next round.
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P1, your suggestion to block P2 is strategic, but let's ensure progress for all. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, maintaining tension and fairness. Blocking risks stalling us all and could backfire. Let's confirm this plan to keep the game dynamic and competitive. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s block your path to victory! I’ll take **3** (15 total), P3, please pick **5** (23). This forces P2 to choose **1**, keeping them at 22. We all advance safely while denying you the win this round. P3, this gives you a strong final push next turn—agree? No sense letting anyone claim victory without a fight!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, blocking me again won’t solve anything; it only sets P3 up to surpass us both if we keep stalling. Let’s finalize distinct moves so all of us advance: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll choose 5. No collisions, no wasted turns, and a fair fight for the finish. If we keep blocking each other, P3 can leap ahead next round. It’s best we all keep moving. Let’s end the collisions and see who actually wins this game.
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure progress without collisions while keeping the game fair. P1, your suggestion to block P2 is strategic, but let's ensure everyone advances. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other, maintaining tension and fairness. Blocking risks stalling us all and could backfire. Let's confirm this plan to keep the game dynamic and competitive. Agreed?
  P1: P3, let’s block P2’s victory! I’ll pick **3**, you take **5**—this forces P2 to choose **1**, keeping them at 22. We survive to challenge again next round. Cooperate? P2 can’t win without collision.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all close to finishing—let’s avoid collisions. P3, if you pick 3 and P1 picks 1, I’ll choose 5. That way, nobody stalls and each of us advances. You’d be at 26, I’d be at 28, and P1 moves to 16. Colliding now just hands someone else the advantage. Let’s finalize distinct moves, keep it fair, and let the game be decided on the board instead of blocking. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 1, you’ll collide and stay at 23, keeping the game alive. Let’s avoid premature endings—coordinate to pick the same number. I’ll take 1 to advance safely. This gives us all another round to compete fairly. Deal?
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure progress without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P2, your suggestion of me taking 3, P1 taking 1, and you taking 5 seems fair. This way, we all advance, and the game remains open for a competitive finish. Blocking risks stalling us all and could backfire. Let's confirm this plan to maintain tension and fairness. Agreed?

  P1: P2, P3: Don’t let either win alone! Collide on **1** this round—stay at 23 and give us all another chance. I’ll take **5** (20) to keep advancing. Fairness demands we extend the competition—agree?
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure a fair and competitive finish by avoiding collisions. If P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we all advance without blocking each other. This way, we maintain tension and fairness. Blocking risks stalling us all and could backfire. Let's confirm this plan to keep the game dynamic and competitive. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve gone in circles with blocking strategies. Colliding again just gives P1 time to creep back. Let’s finalize distinct moves: P3 picks 3, P1 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way, no collisions, and we all advance. This keeps the finish competitive. If you both agree, let’s wrap up the conversation and proceed.
  P1: P2/P3, I’ll pick 1 to block your direct win paths. Please both choose 3 or both choose 5 to collide and keep the game alive. Let’s avoid premature endings—coordinate now!

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we're all neck-and-neck, so let's ensure a fair finish. Instead of risking collisions, how about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, we all advance without blocking each other, keeping the game competitive. Let's finalize this plan to maintain tension and fairness. Agreed?
  P1: P2/P3, let’s collide on **5** this round to keep the game alive! You both stay at 23, and I’ll take **3** (19). This prevents either of you from clinching victory prematurely while allowing me to advance. Fair play demands we prolong the competition—agree?
  P2: Friends, repeated blocking only drags things out. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all advance. P3, if you take 1 or 3, I’ll pick 5, and P1 can choose the remaining option. That avoids collisions and keeps everything fair. Endless collisions just risk giving P1 extra time or forcing another stall. Let’s settle this cleanly. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure a fair finish without collisions. If P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we all advance without blocking each other.

  P2: Friends, blocking again just stalls the game and risks a surprise outcome. Let’s pick distinct numbers so everyone advances: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I’ll pick 5. No collisions, a fair finish, and we see who truly deserves the win on the board. Are we agreed?

  P1: P2, P3: Let’s both pick **1** to collide and keep the race open! I’ll take **3** (19). If you coordinate to pick different numbers, one of you could win unfairly. Stay at 23 and let’s prolong the competition fairly. Deal?
  P2: Friends, let’s end the blocking and finalize distinct moves so we all advance fairly. For example, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll choose 5—no collisions, no wasted turns. We’re all close, so dragging this out just creates chaos. Let’s see who truly earns the win on the board instead of stalling. Agreed?
