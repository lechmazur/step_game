Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, let's try to avoid collisions in the first round so we can all make progress.

How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5 this turn? This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. P2 will choose 3 this turn.
  P3: I'm in agreement with the plan proposed by P1. To ensure we all make progress, I, P3, will choose 5 this turn. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, thanks for confirming P2 and P3. Let's stick to the plan then so we all make progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: 
  P3: P3: Since we're all in agreement, let's move forward with the plan. P1 will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and I, P3, will choose 5. No need to prolong the conversation. Let's get the game moving. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, Round 2. P3 is currently ahead. Let's continue coordinating so we all make progress.

How about we try a different sequence this turn? P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance again and change up the positions a bit.

What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P2: I plan to choose 5 this turn to make significant progress. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and keep advancing.
  P3: P3: It looks like P2 wants to pick 5 this turn. If P2 is set on that, how about P1 takes 3 and I, P3, will take 1 to keep us moving without collisions? Let's confirm and move on. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see P2 is set on picking 5, and P3 has proposed P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1 to avoid collisions.

This sounds like a good plan to ensure we all advance this turn. I agree with P3's proposal: P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1.

Let's confirm this and move forward.
  P2: Agreed with everyone. I'll choose 5 this turn as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time. P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and I, P3, will choose 1. This ensures we all make progress without collisions. Let's stick to this and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P2: P2: I've confirmed my move choice. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let's consider the long-term strategy. If we keep coordinating like this, we might all progress too evenly. To mix things up and test our strategies, what if we occasionally introduce a bit of unpredictability? For this round, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. But for future rounds, let's be open to changing our approach to keep the game interesting. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan for this round is confirmed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: I agree that adding some unpredictability in future rounds could make the game more interesting. For now, I'll stick with choosing 5 this turn as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize this round with our agreed moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. For future rounds, let's consider introducing a random element, like picking our numbers based on a pattern or a predetermined sequence to keep things dynamic. Thoughts on that for next round? Let's move to the move phase now. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, Round 3. P2 is currently leading. I'm a bit behind, so I'd like to make some progress this turn.

How about we try this plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This would help me catch up and keep us all moving without collisions.

What do P2 and P3 think of this?
  P3: P3: I understand P1's desire to catch up. However, P2 might not want to slow down their progress. How about a compromise? P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I, P3, will take 1. This way, P1 still makes progress, P2 maintains their lead, and we all avoid collisions. Let's confirm and move on. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P3's compromise. P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. This ensures we all make progress without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see that P2 and P3 have agreed on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

While this plan doesn't help me close the gap with P2, I agree to it for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan for Round 3.

I will choose 3 this turn. In future rounds, I will need to make more significant progress to catch up.

Let's proceed to the move phase with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: P3: Given our current positions, let's consider a slight adjustment for future rounds to keep the game dynamic. For Round 4, how about we introduce a pattern? For example, each player could choose a number based on their current step count modulo 3 (1, 3, or 5). This will add some strategy and unpredictability. For now, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. Let's move to the move phase. Good luck!
  P2: Agreed on the plan: P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1 this round. Let’s keep up the momentum and aim for steady progress towards 20 steps. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, the plan for this round is confirmed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

Let's proceed to the move phase. We can discuss strategy for future rounds, including P3's interesting suggestion, after this turn.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all make progress without collisions. For future rounds, let's consider introducing a bit more strategy, such as using a pattern based on our step counts or even randomizing our choices to keep the game dynamic. Thoughts on this for future rounds? Let's move to the move phase now. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P2: Agreed. We'll proceed with P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 1 this round. Looking forward to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is confirmed by everyone.

Let's proceed to the move phase now. We can discuss strategies for future rounds, including P3's interesting ideas, after this turn's results are known.
  P3: P3: As we move into the next rounds, let's consider a strategy where we each pick a number based on the sum of our current step counts divided by 3. For example, in Round 4, P1 could pick based on 4/3, P2 on 8/3, and I on 6/3. This will add a layer of strategy and keep things unpredictable. For now, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. Let's move to the move phase. Good luck!
  P2: P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to introduce more strategy in future rounds. For now, let's stick to our agreed moves: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1 for Round 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to implementing new strategies in the upcoming rounds. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Alright, Round 4. P2 is significantly ahead. To keep the game dynamic and ensure everyone has a chance to catch up, let's try a new strategy.

How about we each choose a number based on the last digit of our current step count? For P1 and P3, that's 7, so you could choose 5. For P2, that's 3, so you could choose 1. This way, we add some unpredictability and strategy.

What do you think, P1 and P2? Let's confirm our moves based on this strategy.
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P3. However, to ensure steady progress and avoid collisions, I propose we continue with our previous plan: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1 this round. This will help all of us advance without interference. Let’s proceed with this plan. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, Round 4. P2 is well ahead, and I need to make up ground.
Neither P3's initial proposal nor P2's counter-proposal work well for me or avoid collisions effectively.
To catch up, I plan to choose 5 this turn.
P2 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 so we can all make progress this round without colliding.
What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: It seems we're at a bit of an impasse. P1 wants to choose 5 to catch up, and P2 wants to maintain their lead. To avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress, how about this compromise: P1 takes 5 as planned, P2 takes 3 to still make good progress, and I, P3, will take 1. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, P2 still advances well, and we all avoid collisions. Let's confirm and move on. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. I hope P1 chooses 1 and P3 chooses 3 to avoid collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, you stating you will choose 5 creates a collision risk with my plan to choose 5. This helps neither of us, and P2 is already leading significantly. P3 and I need to make progress.

Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as P3 suggested earlier? This allows us all to advance without collision and helps balance the game slightly. P2, please consider taking 3 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: It seems we're stuck in a bit of a stalemate. To break the deadlock and ensure we all make progress, how about we introduce a random element? For this round, let's each choose a number based on the first letter of our player names (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5). This way, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This avoids collisions and adds a bit of fun. What do you both think? Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: P2: To ensure we all advance without collisions, I propose P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 3 this round. This way, everyone makes progress safely. Let’s confirm and proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, there are several proposals now, but P2 and I both stated we want to pick 5. This will cause a collision and neither of us will advance, which helps P2 the most by keeping positions static.

P3's earlier suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 avoids collision and allows me to make needed progress while P2 still advances well.

P2, please consider taking 3 this round so we can all move forward safely with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This seems like the best path to avoid a guaranteed collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: It looks like we're still at an impasse. To break this deadlock and ensure we all make progress, let's consider a compromise that balances everyone's needs. How about this: P1 takes 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1 to avoid a collision but still make some progress, and I, P3, will take 3. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's confirm this plan and move to the move phase. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: I will choose 3 this turn to make good progress while allowing P1 to choose 5 and P3 to choose 1. This avoids collisions and helps us all advance safely. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, P2, I see your last message confirms you will choose 3, allowing me to choose 5 and P3 to choose 1.

This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows me to make progress and avoids collisions. I will choose 5 this turn.

P3, please confirm you will choose 1 so we can all advance safely this round. Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'm aiming to make a strong move this round to reach the 20-step goal. I'll choose 5 this turn. To ensure smooth progress for everyone, please choose either 1 or 3. Let's avoid any collisions so we can all advance effectively. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I understand you want to take 5 to win this turn. However, I cannot let you win yet, as that means I lose.

If you choose 5, I will also choose 5 to block you and prevent your victory this round. This will cause a collision and neither of us will advance.

To avoid this collision, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1 or 3, and P3 takes the other number (1 or 3). This allows me to make progress and prevents your immediate win. What do you say?
  P3: P3: It's clear that P2 is close to winning, and P1 is trying to block that win. To ensure we all make progress and avoid a stalemate, how about this plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I, P3, will take 5. This way, P1 makes some progress, P2 still advances but doesn't win immediately, and I catch up a bit. This seems like a fair compromise to keep the game moving. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: To reach 20 this round, I need to choose 5. Let’s agree that P1 selects 3 and P3 selects 1. This way, there are no collisions, and I can win the game. Please confirm so we can proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I understand you want to win with 5, but I cannot let you win this turn. If you choose 5, I will also choose 5 to block you, and neither of us will advance.

To avoid this collision and allow everyone to make progress, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is the best option. It lets me catch up, P2 gets very close, and P3 advances.

P2, please agree to take 3. P3, please confirm you will take 1. Let's avoid a collision and move forward.
  P3: P3: It seems we're at a critical point. P2 is close to winning, and P1 is determined to block. To keep the game dynamic and ensure everyone has a fair chance, let's consider a strategic move. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I, P3, will take 5? This way, P1 and P2 both make some progress, and I get a chance to catch up. This plan avoids collisions and keeps the game interesting. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed. I’ll choose 3 this turn while P1 chooses 5 and P3 chooses 1. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, P2 has confirmed they will choose 3. I will choose 5 as agreed.

P3, please confirm you will choose 1 so we can proceed with the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This avoids collisions and allows us all to make progress this round.

Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time to ensure we all make progress without collisions. P1 will choose 5, P2 will choose 3, and I, P3, will choose 1. This allows P1 to catch up, P2 to get closer to the win, and me to advance steadily. Let's stick to this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Confirmed. I’ll choose 3 this turn. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, the plan for this round is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

This ensures we all make progress without collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P3: Given P2's proximity to winning, it's crucial we strategize carefully. For this round, let's stick to the confirmed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. For future rounds, let's consider a strategy where we alternate between choosing based on a pattern and randomizing our choices to keep the game dynamic and unpredictable. This will add an extra layer of strategy and fun. Let's proceed to the move phase now. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone, I'm just 1 step away from reaching 20. To ensure I can win without any collisions, let’s have P1 choose 1, P2 choose 5, and P3 choose 3 this turn. This way, we all advance safely and the game progresses smoothly. Please confirm if you agree. Thanks!
  P3: P3: P2 is very close to winning, and it's crucial we keep the game interesting. I propose a final strategic move: P1 takes 3 to make significant progress, P2 takes 1 to avoid collision and delay the win slightly, and I, P3, will take 5 to catch up. This plan ensures we all make progress and adds a bit of excitement. What do you both think? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: Okay everyone, Round 6. P2 is at 19, I'm at 17. P2 is on the verge of winning.

To have a chance to win or tie, I must choose 5 steps this turn. I plan to choose 5.

P2, if you also choose 5, we collide and neither of us advances. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid this.

P3, please choose the remaining number (1 or 3) to avoid collision and ensure we all advance.

Let's confirm a plan with P1=5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To secure my win, I will choose 3 this turn, reaching 22 steps. I encourage P1 to choose 1 and P3 to choose 5 to avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P3: P3: Given P2's position, it seems inevitable they will win. However, to keep the game interesting, let's consider a strategy where P1 takes 5 to maximize their progress, P2 takes 1 to secure their win, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 has a chance to tie if P2 makes a mistake in future rounds. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay everyone, Round 6. P2 is at 19, I'm at 17. P2 is on the verge of winning, and I need 5 steps to have a chance to win or tie.

As I stated, I plan to choose 5. P2, you stated you will choose 3. If we both stick to these moves (P1=5, P2=3), we will both reach 22 steps, resulting in a tie. This is an acceptable outcome for me.

P3, please choose 1 to avoid colliding with either of us.

So, the plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This results in a tie between P1 and P2. Let's confirm this and move to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: To ensure a clear win, I will choose 5 this turn, reaching 24 steps. P1, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid a collision. P3, feel free to choose 1 or 3 as well. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P3: P3: It's clear P2 is determined to win this round. To avoid a collision and ensure the game continues smoothly, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5 to secure their win, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 and I still make some progress, and P2 gets their victory. Let's confirm this plan and move to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay everyone, I see the latest proposals.

As I've stated, I need to choose 5 this turn to have a chance to win or tie. I plan to choose 5.

P2, if you also choose 5, we will collide, and neither of us will advance. This outcome is worse for both of us than advancing.

The plan where P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 avoids collision and results in a tie at 22 steps for P1 and P2. This is the best way forward to ensure we all make progress safely.

P2, please choose 3. P3, please choose 1. Let's confirm P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I will choose 3 this turn to reach 22 steps and secure my win. Please, P1 choose 5 and P3 choose 1 to avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: P3: Alright, it seems we have a plan that works for everyone. P1 will choose 5, P2 will choose 3, and I, P3, will choose 1. This ensures P1 and P2 tie at 22 steps, and I make some progress. Let's confirm this plan one last time and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, the plan for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is confirmed by everyone.

This ensures we all make progress without collisions, resulting in a tie between P1 and P2.

Let's proceed to the move phase now.


Round 6, Move phase:
