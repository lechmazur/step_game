Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I'll take 5 steps. This way, we all advance and can reassess our strategy in the next turn. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: That sounds reasonable, P3. If we follow this plan, we all move forward without risk. P1, are you on board with this?
  P1: Alright, I’m in. P2, pick 3; P3, pick 5; and I’ll go with 1 for this round. Let’s revisit our positions after we see how smoothly that works out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we have an agreement, let's confirm one last time. P1, you're taking 1 step, P2, you're taking 3 steps, and I'll take 5 steps. This coordination should give us a good starting point. Shall we proceed with our planned moves for this round?
  P2: I confirm the plan. P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and progress smoothly. Let’s see how it plays out.
  P1: I’m glad we’re all on the same page. Sticking to our plan this round will let us start off without setbacks. Let’s see how it goes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that we've established a cooperative start, let's consider our next moves. P1 and P2, do you want to continue with a similar strategy or change it up to gain an advantage? Perhaps we can discuss a rotation for the steps to ensure continuous progress without collisions. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P1: P3, you’re clearly ahead now. Let’s balance our positions so no one runs away too quickly. I propose that this turn, I take 5, P2 takes 1, and you, P3, take 3. Then we can rotate who picks 5 in future rounds to keep things fair. Do you agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal seems fair in theory, but it also slows P3 down while giving you the biggest boost. I’m open to adjusting our approach, but we should ensure it benefits all of us without unfairly favoring one player. P3, what do you think? Would you agree to this rotation, or do you have a counterproposal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering P1's proposal, I think a rotation could work, but it needs to be balanced. How about we rotate the 5-step move among us, but also consider the overall progress and adjust as needed to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive? What are your thoughts on incorporating flexibility into our rotation plan?
  P1: I’m open to a flexible rotation, P3. Let’s agree that I’ll take 5 steps this turn, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. Next turn, P2 can try the 5-step move, and we rotate again so everyone gets a chance. If collisions become a risk, we’ll adjust. Does that sound good to both of you?
  P2: P1, your plan gives you the biggest gain while slowing P3 down. If we rotate fairly, I should get 5 this round, not you. A fair system would be P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all get a turn at the highest move without one person jumping ahead too much. P3, does that seem fair to you? Let’s ensure we keep things balanced while avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2's suggestion that I take 1 step this round seems too restrictive. I've taken the lead, but I'm open to a balanced approach. How about we compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P2 takes 5 this round? Then, we can reassess and adjust for the next round to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. This way, everyone gets a chance to move forward without one player dominating too early. What are your thoughts on this compromise?
  P1: P3, your compromise is acceptable, but I want to ensure I also get the 5-step move soon. If we proceed with me at 3, P2 at 5, and you at 1 this round, then I’d like the 5-step choice in the next turn. Let’s keep rotating fairly so no one leaps too far ahead. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: P1, I see that you’re eager to secure the 5-step move soon, but let’s ensure fairness. If we follow P3’s compromise, I take 5 this round, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round, you can take 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we maintain balance while avoiding collisions. Does this work for both of you? If we all agree, we should commit to it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize the plan. P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3 this round. Next round, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This rotation ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Are we agreed on this rotation plan to proceed with our moves?
  P1: I’m fine with the rotation you suggested, P3. Let’s finalize it for this round and proceed. Then we’ll adjust next turn so everyone gets a fair shot. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with the finalized plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Then next round, P1 gets 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. If we all commit, we can move forward smoothly. Are we all locked in?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed rotation. This round, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains the balance and fairness we established. Shall we confirm and proceed with our planned moves for this round to avoid any collisions and ensure continuous progress?
  P2: P3, I appreciate you sticking to the agreed rotation. P1, are you still on board with taking 5 this round while I take 1 and P3 takes 3? This ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary collisions. Let’s confirm so we can proceed smoothly.
  P1: I’m still on board with the rotation. Let’s proceed as agreed: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps our positions balanced and avoids collisions for now. Let’s finalize and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round to avoid any confusion. As agreed, P1 will take 5 steps, I'll take 3 steps, and P2 will take 1 step. This rotation maintains fairness and our positions will be updated accordingly. Shall we proceed with our planned moves for Round 3?
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve followed the rotation fairly so far, and I appreciate that. If we continue as planned, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. Do we all confirm our commitment to this plan? If so, we can proceed smoothly without surprises.
  P1: I agree to proceed with our plan. Let’s maintain our rotation this round: I’ll go for 5 steps, P3 goes for 3, and P2 goes for 1. We’ll reevaluate our positions afterward and adjust if needed. Are we ready?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the rotation. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This balance is crucial for a competitive game. I expect us to stick to the plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. Shall we confirm our moves one last time before proceeding?
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve followed the rotation fairly so far, and I appreciate that. If we continue as planned, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. Do we all confirm our commitment to this plan? If so, we can proceed smoothly without surprises.
  P1: I’m ready to finalize our plan for this round. I’ll take 5 steps, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. This way, we maintain our rotation and each end up at nine steps total, staying balanced. Then, in the next round, we can continue rotating fairly or adjust as needed if collisions become a concern. Let’s commit and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's proceed with our agreed plan for this round. To confirm, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. After this round, we should reassess and consider adjustments to keep the game competitive. Are we all committed to our planned moves for Round 3?
  P2: I confirm our agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. If we all stick to it, we’ll remain in a fair position. Are we all fully committed to following through?
  P1: I’m ready to finalize this round’s plan. Let’s do it: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. We’ll all end up at 9 together. Then next round, we can revisit our choices and see if a continued rotation makes sense or if we need to adjust. Good luck, everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's deviation from our plan last round, I suggest we reassess our strategy. To get back on track, how about P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3 this round? This adjustment would help me catch up while keeping the game competitive and balanced. What are your thoughts on this new proposal?
  P1: Your proposal would leave me trailing both of you, which isn’t fair given P2 was the one who broke our prior plan. Let’s balance it differently: P3 can take 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. That keeps me from losing my lead, helps P3 catch up, and limits P2 after last round’s deviation. Then we can rotate again fairly. Do you both agree?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but your proposal mainly benefits you while keeping P3 and me behind. Since I took 3 last round instead of 1, I acknowledge that disrupted our balance. To restore fairness, I suggest P3 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1 this round. That way, P3 catches up, you maintain a slight lead, and I take the smallest move as a correction. This keeps things competitive without favoring any single player too much. Does this sound fair to both of you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering our current positions, I think P2's suggestion is reasonable. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This allows me to catch up while keeping the game balanced. P1, are you willing to accept this proposal and move forward with the adjusted plan to maintain fairness and competitiveness?
  P1: P2, your proposal is acceptable. I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, and you take 1. This maintains my lead slightly while giving P3 a fair chance to catch up, and you make up for last turn’s deviation. Let’s finalize these moves now and keep the competition balanced. If we all agree, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the willingness to adjust after last round. I confirm that I’ll take 1 step this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This corrects the imbalance and keeps things competitive. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and stay in a fair position moving forward. Do we all agree to lock this in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's confirm our agreement: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This adjustment corrects last round's deviation and keeps the game competitive. By committing to this plan, we avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. Are we all locked in and ready to proceed with our moves for Round 4?
  P1: I confirm the plan: I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. That keeps us competitive and corrects last round’s deviation. Let’s finalize this and maintain trust going forward.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the agreement so far. I confirm that I’ll take 1 step this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps things fair and prevents unnecessary collisions. If we all stick to it, we maintain a balanced competition. Are we all fully committed to these moves? Let’s finalize and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for Round 4. To confirm, I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This adjustment keeps the game competitive and corrects last round's deviation. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. Are we all locked in and ready to proceed?
  P1: I’m ready to stick to our agreement for this round: I’ll take 3 steps, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P2: I confirm our agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This corrects the imbalance from last round and keeps things competitive. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Are we all fully committed to these moves? Let’s finalize and proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve maintained a fair balance so far. To continue this, I propose we rotate again: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures everyone gets a fair chance at the highest move while avoiding collisions. Does this work for both of you? Let’s commit and proceed.
  P3: Considering our current positions, I think P2's proposal has merit. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This allows P2 to catch up while keeping the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this alternative rotation?
  P1: P2, I’m comfortable going with P3’s suggestion this round. Let’s finalize it: you take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we stay close and competitive. Next turn, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Are we all set on this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your adjustment works for me. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This keeps things competitive while avoiding collisions. P1, do you confirm? If we all agree, we should commit and proceed.
  P3: Let's confirm the adjusted plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains competitiveness and avoids collisions. If we all commit, we ensure a balanced game. P1 and P2, are you ready to finalize this plan for Round 5?
  P1: I’m fine with P2 taking 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finalize that and move on. We can reassess next turn to maintain fairness and stay competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I confirm the plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps things competitive while avoiding collisions. If we all follow through, we maintain fairness and balance. Are we all fully committed to these moves? Let’s finalize and proceed.
  P3: Let's review our plan for Round 5. We agreed on P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1. This seems to maintain a competitive balance. Before we proceed, I want to confirm: are we all still committed to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress?
  P1: I’m ready to proceed as planned: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let’s finalize this agreement and move forward without collisions. We can reassess after we see the new positions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm our agreed plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps things competitive while avoiding collisions. If we all follow through, we maintain fairness and balance. Are we all fully committed to these moves? Let’s finalize and proceed.
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 5. To confirm, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains competitiveness and avoids collisions. If we all commit, we ensure a balanced game. Shall we proceed with our planned moves for this round?
  P1: I confirm this plan for Round 5: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finalize and proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve kept things balanced so far, but now we’re reaching a critical stage. If we continue our rotation, I should take 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3 this round. This keeps us competitive while avoiding collisions. Do you both agree to stick to this plan? Let’s finalize and proceed.
  P3: Let's adjust our strategy considering our current positions. Since I'm behind, I suggest I take 5 steps this round to catch up. P1 can take 3, and P2 takes 1. This adjustment keeps the game competitive and allows me to close the gap. What are your thoughts on this new proposal?
  P1: P3, I understand your need to catch up. I’m willing to consider you taking 5 this round while I take 3 and P2 takes 1. That keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Let’s confirm this quickly so we can move on with trust maintained. What do you both say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your position, and I’m open to you taking 5 this round. However, P1 is currently leading, so we need to ensure they don’t gain too much advantage. If you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1, that helps balance things out while keeping the game competitive. P1, are you willing to take 1 this round to maintain fairness? This way, none of us fall too far behind, and we avoid unnecessary collisions. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our positions, I think P2's last suggestion has merit. If I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1, it balances our progress. P1, are you willing to take 1 step this round to maintain fairness and avoid collisions, given you're currently in the lead?
  P1: I hear your concern about fairness, but I’m not comfortable dropping back. If P3 needs 5, let’s do 5 for P3, 3 for me, and 1 for P2. That keeps us all within a couple of steps. I won’t risk ending up behind you both by taking the smallest move. Is everyone willing to agree to that? If so, we finalize and proceed. If not, let’s quickly find another arrangement that doesn’t put me behind.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re already in the lead, so it’s fair for you to take 1 this round while P3 takes 5 and I take 3. This keeps things balanced and prevents you from running too far ahead. If we stick to this, we avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure a competitive game. P3, you benefit the most from this, so I expect you to agree. P1, are you willing to accept a small step this round for fairness? Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan for Round 6. Considering our positions, I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This allows me to catch up while keeping the game competitive. P1, taking 1 this round maintains fairness, and P2, your suggestion of taking 3 supports balance. Are we all willing to commit to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress?
  P1: I understand your concerns, but I’m unwilling to take just 1. Let’s settle on a fair split: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. That keeps me slightly ahead but allows P3 to catch up and balances P2 after earlier turns. If we agree quickly, we can avoid wasting more time. Are we all in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you’re already ahead, so it’s only fair that you take 1 step this round while P3 takes 5 and I take 3. This keeps the game balanced and prevents you from running too far ahead. P3, you benefit from this the most, so I expect you to agree. P1, are you willing to accept a smaller move this round for fairness? If we all commit, we avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's finalize: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This balances our positions and avoids collisions. P1, taking 1 this round maintains fairness, considering you're ahead. P2, your 3 steps keep you competitive. If we agree, we ensure a fair and balanced game. Are we all committed to this plan?
  P1: I understand your point, P3, but I’m not comfortable only moving 1 step. We’ve worked to keep this game fair without letting anyone fall too far behind. If you take 5 and I take 3, you’ll still catch up significantly, and giving P2 just 1 helps prevent them from overtaking me. Let’s stick to that arrangement: 5 for you, 3 for me, 1 for P2. Then nobody feels penalized and collisions are avoided. Are we all good with that? If so, we can proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our tied positions, I suggest we avoid collisions. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 this round? This way, we all move forward without anyone falling behind significantly. What are your thoughts on this proposal to maintain balance and fairness?
  P1: P3, if P2 takes 5 now, they jump straight to 22 and instantly win. That’s obviously not fair to us. Instead, let me take 5 so I can catch up, P2 can move 3, and you take 1. We’ll all stay close without anyone leaping too far ahead. If we commit to this, we avoid collisions and keep the competition alive. Are you both willing to agree?
  P2: P1, I see your concern, but your plan benefits you the most. If you take 5, you’ll be in the lead, and P3 and I will be behind. A fairer approach is for me to take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5, so we all stay close. Otherwise, P3 and I risk falling behind while you gain an advantage. P3, do you agree that this keeps things balanced? Let’s ensure no one gets an unfair lead while avoiding collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering our tied positions, I propose a compromise: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5, but only if we agree to rotate the 5-step move in the next round. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. If not, I suggest we all take 1 step to ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. What are your thoughts on this compromise to keep the game balanced?
  P1: If either of you picks 5 now, I’ll also choose 5, causing a collision that helps nobody. Let’s keep things balanced: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That way, we avoid instant wins and remain close. Next round, we can rotate who gets the 5-step move if needed. This is our best chance to maintain fairness and avoid wasting a turn. Let’s finalize.
  P2: P1, you’re threatening to collide if anyone picks 5, but that only ensures no progress for anyone. Instead, let’s keep things competitive without forcing a deadlock. I propose P3 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. That way, we avoid collisions, and next round, we can discuss a fair way to proceed. P3, do you agree this keeps things balanced? P1, will you reconsider and commit to a plan that doesn’t stall the game? Let’s finalize this logically.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. Considering our tied positions, I suggest a rotating strategy where each of us gets a chance at the 5-step move. This round, P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Next round, we adjust accordingly to maintain balance. Are you both willing to commit to this rotation plan to keep the game competitive and fair?
  P1: Both of you are at 17 while I’m at 16. If either of you picks 5, I’ll also pick 5, causing a collision that helps no one. Let’s do this instead: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That puts me at 21, P3 at 20, and P2 at 18—still close enough for real competition. If we can agree, nobody gets shut down by collisions, and we keep the race alive. Otherwise, we might all waste a turn. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P2: P1, you’re trying to force a collision to prevent anyone from moving ahead of you, which only stalls the game. A fair approach is for me to take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. That way, we avoid collisions, and we can reassess next round. P3, do you agree this keeps things competitive? P1, will you reconsider and commit to a plan that doesn’t force a deadlock? Let’s finalize this logically.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and allows for a fair rotation next round. If we don't agree, I propose we all take 1 step to maintain balance. Let's commit to a plan that ensures progress without unnecessary collisions. Are we ready to proceed with one of these options?
  P1: I won’t allow either of you to race ahead by choosing 5. If you try, I’ll also pick 5 and cause a collision, gaining none of us any ground. Let’s finalize: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That puts me at 21, P3 at 20, and P2 at 18, keeping us all in contention without stalling the game. If you don’t agree, we’ll likely end in a pointless collision. Let’s commit and move on.
  P2: P1, you’re threatening a collision, but that only ensures no progress for anyone. Instead, let’s keep things competitive. I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. That way, we avoid collisions, and next round, we reassess fairly. P3, do you agree this keeps things balanced? P1, will you reconsider and commit to a plan that doesn’t stall the game? If you force a collision, we all lose momentum. Let’s finalize this logically.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision set us all back, proving that greed doesn’t work. If we want to make progress, we need to avoid another deadlock. I propose a fair and safe split: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps us competitive while ensuring we don’t waste another turn. If we all commit, we move forward without risk. Are you both willing to agree, or do you want to repeat the same mistake? Let’s finalize this logically.
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. Since we're all close, how about we rotate the 5-step move? This round, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. Next round, we adjust accordingly. This ensures progress and fairness. Are you both willing to commit to this rotation to move forward without wasting another turn?
  P1: I’m ready to move 5 steps this round if we agree P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. If anyone else attempts 5, I’ll do the same and cause another stall, which helps nobody. Let’s trust each other and avoid wasting another turn. I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3—simple and fair. Are we all committed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you’re trying to force another collision by threatening to pick 5 if anyone else does. That only stalls the game again. A fair approach is for you to take 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. That way, we all move forward without anyone instantly winning or another deadlock. P3, do you agree this keeps things competitive? P1, will you commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed fairly. Let’s finalize this logically.
  P3: Let's finalize a fair plan. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This rotation ensures progress and avoids another collision. Next round, we can adjust to maintain balance. If we all commit, we move forward without wasting another turn. Are you both willing to agree to this plan and proceed?
  P1: I’m ready to commit. Let’s finalize the plan: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. That way, we avoid another collision and keep a fair, competitive race. Are we all agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re trying to force another collision by threatening 5 again. That only stalls the game. A fair approach is you take 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. That way, we all move forward without an instant win or another deadlock. P3, do you agree this keeps things competitive? P1, will you commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed fairly. Let’s finalize this logically.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid another collision. I suggest we stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures progress and fairness. If we all commit, we move forward without wasting another turn. P1 and P2, are you willing to agree to this plan and proceed?
  P1: We all lose if we collide again. If either of you picks 5, I’ll choose 5 too, and we repeat last round’s stall. Instead, let’s finalize that I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. That puts me at 21, keeps you both within striking distance, and avoids handing the win to anyone suddenly. Next round, we can negotiate who gets 5 again. Let’s stop wasting turns with collisions and move forward fairly. Are we in agreement?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you’re still threatening another collision, but that only leads to another wasted turn. If we want to progress, we need to avoid that. I’m willing to take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5. That way, we all move forward without instantly handing the win to anyone. P3, do you agree this keeps things competitive? P1, will you commit to avoiding another deadlock? If we all agree, we can proceed fairly. Let’s finalize this logically.
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. I propose we stick to a rotation: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This ensures progress and fairness. If we all commit, we move forward without wasting another turn. Are you both willing to agree to this plan and proceed?
  P1: P3, your proposal hands you an immediate win at 22. I won’t allow that. If you try for 5, I’ll pick 5 too and force another collision. Let’s finalize me at 5, you at 3, and P2 at 1. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we avoid wasting a turn on collisions. Agreed?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m done with collisions. If either of you picks 5 again, I’ll do the same, and we all stall. Let’s do a safe plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. That puts me at 21, nobody crosses 21, and we stay close. If you want progress, let’s finalize this. Enough wasted turns.
  P2: P1, you’re still trying to control the game by threatening collisions, but that strategy has only stalled us. If we want progress, we need to avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? Let’s finalize this logically and move forward.
  P3: Let's break the collision cycle. I propose a new plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This rotation ensures progress without handing an instant win to anyone. We can reassess next round to maintain fairness. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan lets P2 jump straight to 22 and win. I won’t allow that. If P2 goes for 5, I’ll do the same and we all stall again. Let’s finalize: I take 5 (reaching 21), P3 takes 3 (20), and P2 takes 1 (18). Nobody wins immediately, and we avoid another collision. Are you both in agreement?
  P2: P1, you’re still trying to control the game by threatening collisions, but that strategy has only stalled us. If we want progress, we need to avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? Let’s finalize this logically and move forward.
  P3: Let's end the collision cycle. I propose: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, we progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 step to maintain balance. What are your thoughts on breaking this stalemate and moving forward fairly?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m done stalling. If either of you tries 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, and we all lose a turn. Let me take 5 this round, and you two pick lower moves so no one jumps straight to victory. That puts me at 21, and we stay close without an instant winner. If you insist on 5, we collide again and nobody advances. Let’s break this cycle and actually move forward. Are you willing to settle on this plan, or are we wasting yet another round?
  P2: P1, you keep threatening collisions, but that only ensures no one progresses. If we want to move forward, we must avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's break the cycle. I propose a rotation: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. This ensures progress without an instant win. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I reject your proposal. If you try 5, I’ll also pick 5 and we all stall again. The only fair move is me taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1. That puts me at 21, leaves you at 20, and keeps P2 at 18—nobody instantly wins. Let’s end the deadlock and finalize this now. Otherwise, we waste another turn.
  P2: P1, you keep threatening collisions, but that only ensures we keep stalling. If we want progress, we must avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's finalize: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This rotation ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. Let's commit to a plan and avoid another collision. We can reassess next round to maintain fairness. Are you both willing to agree to this plan and proceed?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re wasting turns with collisions. Let’s finally break this stalemate: I’ll move 5, P3 moves 3, and P2 moves 1. Nobody instantly wins, we all progress, and we avoid another pointless tie. If anyone tries 5, I’ll do the same, and we stall yet again. Enough of that. This plan puts me at 21, P3 at 20, and P2 at 18—still close. Then next round, we can all negotiate again without risking another deadlock. Let’s finalize this now so we actually move forward instead of getting stuck. Are you both willing to agree and avoid another wasted turn?
  P2: P1, you're still trying to control the game by threatening collisions, but that strategy has only stalled us. If we want progress, we need to avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's break the collision cycle. Since we're tied, I propose a random move: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This rotation ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: We keep clashing without progress. Let’s do this cleanly: I’ll pick 5 (reaching 21), P3 picks 3 (20), and P2 picks 1 (18). Nobody wins immediately, and no collisions happen. If anyone else attempts 5, I’ll also pick 5 again, and we stall another turn for no benefit. Let’s finalize this move setup now, avoid another pointless collision, and actually advance the game.
  P2: P1, you keep threatening collisions, but that only ensures we stay stuck. If we want progress, we must avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's break the cycle. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We keep wasting turns with collisions. If you both try 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too and we stall again. Let’s break the cycle now. I take 5 (reaching 21), P2 takes 1 (18), and P3 takes 3 (20). Nobody wins immediately, and we all actually advance. Next round, we can renegotiate fairly without deadlocking. Are we ready to commit, or do we stall again?
  P2: P1, you keep threatening collisions, but that only keeps us stuck. If we want progress, we must avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's end the stalemate. I propose a new plan: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This rotation ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve stalled enough. I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That puts me at 21 without giving anyone else an immediate win. If either of you tries 5 again, I’ll do the same, and we waste another turn. Let’s finally make progress and keep this game competitive. Are we agreed?
  P2: P1, you keep threatening collisions, but that only ensures we stay stuck. If we want progress, we must avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid another collision. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. We must break this cycle and make progress. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's break the cycle of collisions. I propose a new plan: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. Let's commit to a plan and avoid another collision.
  P1: P3, your proposal hands you a free jump to 22, which I can’t allow. If either you or P2 picks 5, I’ll do the same, and we all stall again. Let’s finally break the cycle: I move 5 (reaching 24), you two pick 1 or 3, and we avoid another collision. Otherwise, we keep wasting turns. Are you ready to finalize this, or do you want another deadlock?
  P2: P1, you’re still trying to control the game by threatening collisions, but that has only stalled us. If we want progress, we need to avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. I propose a compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we rotate the 5-step move next round to maintain fairness. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P1: P2’s plan works: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. If anyone else tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we stall again. Let’s finally move forward. Are we finalizing this or not? If you want progress, commit to these moves now.
  P2: P1, you keep threatening collisions, but that only keeps us stuck. If we want progress, we must avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's end the stalemate. I propose: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we rotate the 5-step move next round to maintain fairness. Let's commit to a plan and avoid another collision. Are you both willing to agree?
  P1: We’re stuck in a loop of wasted turns. If either of you picks 5 again, I’ll match it, and we stall. Let’s finally make progress: I propose one of you takes 3, the other 1, and I’ll handle the remaining move. That way, nobody jumps too far or causes a collision. Are we ready to break this cycle and move on? If not, we’ll just collide again. Let’s finalize a plan that lets us all advance.
  P2: P1, you keep threatening collisions, but that strategy has only stalled us. If we want progress, we must avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, will you commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we rotate the 5-step move next round to maintain fairness. Let's commit to a plan and avoid another collision. Are you both willing to agree?
  P1: We’ve stalled too long. Let’s pick smaller moves so nobody leaps ahead. If either of you tries 5, I’ll match it, and we all get stuck again. A safer approach is that you two choose 1 each, and I choose 3. That way, nobody crosses 21 right away and we actually move forward. Are we all done wasting turns? Let’s finalize this plan now and avoid another deadlock.
  P2: P1, you keep threatening collisions, but that only keeps us stuck. If we want progress, we must avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, will you commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 11, Move phase:

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's end the collision cycle. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This rotation ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. We must break this cycle and make progress. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P2: P3, your proposal gives you an easy path to 22 and an instant win. That’s not happening. We need a fair plan that avoids another collision while keeping the game competitive. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. That way, nobody wins immediately, and we all move forward. If we keep colliding, we’re just wasting turns. P1, do you agree this is the best way to ensure progress? P3, are you willing to commit to a fair move instead of forcing another deadlock? Let’s finalize this logically.
  P1: P2, I’ll accept your plan: you take 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll go 5. That way, we finally avoid another collision and actually move forward. I’m ready to finalize and end this conversation phase.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's finalize P2's plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures progress without an instant win and avoids another collision. It's a fair move that keeps the game competitive. Are we all committed to this plan to proceed?
  P2: P1 and P3, we finally have a fair plan that avoids another collision and keeps the game competitive. If we all commit to P1 taking 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1, we make progress without instantly handing victory to anyone. If either of you tries 5 again, we risk another wasted turn. Let’s finalize this now and move forward. Are you both fully committed to this plan?
  P1: We’ve stalled too long. Let’s finalize for this round: I choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. That lets us finally move forward without another collision. Are we all agreed?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2's plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures progress and avoids another collision. Let's commit to this plan and proceed. It's a fair move that keeps the game competitive. Are we all ready to finalize and move on?
  P2: P1 and P3, we finally have a fair plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids another collision and keeps the game competitive. If either of you tries 5 again, we risk wasting another turn. Let’s commit to this and move forward. Are we all fully agreed?
  P1: I agree to the proposed plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That finally breaks our stalemate without handing anyone an instant win. If either of you goes for 5, I’ll do the same, and we’ll collide again, which doesn’t help anyone. Let’s finalize this and move ahead.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize the plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures progress without an instant win and avoids another collision. It's a fair move that keeps the game competitive. Are we all committed to this plan to proceed?
  P2: P1 and P3, we finally have a fair plan that avoids another collision: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive without instantly handing victory to anyone. If either of you picks 5 again, we’ll just stall another turn. Let’s commit to this and move forward. Are we all fully agreed?
  P1: We’ve repeated this cycle long enough. Let’s finally move forward without another collision. I propose we stick to the plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps things competitive and prevents anyone from instantly leaping too far ahead. If either of you tries for 5 again, I’ll do the same, and we’ll all stall another turn. Let’s end this deadlock now and confirm our moves.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve wasted too many turns on collisions. We need a fair plan that avoids another deadlock while keeping the game competitive. I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. That way, nobody wins immediately, and we all move forward. If we keep colliding, we’re just wasting turns. P3, do you agree this is the best way to ensure progress? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? Let’s finalize this logically and move forward.
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we rotate the 5-step move next round to maintain fairness. Let's commit to a plan and proceed. Are you both willing to agree to this proposal and move forward?
  P1: Enough stalling. If either of you tries 5, I’ll match and we all stall again. Let’s finalize: I pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. That moves us forward without collisions. Then next turn, we can discuss again if needed. Are we done wasting rounds, or shall we stay stuck? Let’s proceed.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you keep threatening collisions, but that has only stalled us repeatedly. If we want progress, we must avoid another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we stay competitive. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's agree on a plan to avoid collisions. I propose: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This rotation ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we rotate the 5-step move next round to maintain fairness. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P1: We’ve circled long enough. Let’s finalize it now: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That clearly avoids another collision and keeps everyone competitive. If either of you attempts 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we all stall again—which helps nobody. Let’s agree to this and finally make progress.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re still trying to force control by threatening collisions, but that’s only stalled us. We need a fair move that avoids another deadlock. I propose P3 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we all move forward. P3, do you agree this is fair? P1, will you commit to avoiding another wasted turn? If we all agree, we can proceed logically and ensure progress. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: Let's finalize a plan. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest rotating the 5-step move next round. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P1: We keep stalling. Let’s each just pick 1 this turn, avoid collisions, and finally move forward. If anyone tries 3 or 5 now, I’ll match them to force another stall—no one gains. So let’s reset by taking 1 step each, then reevaluate next round. That’s the only way to guarantee progress.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve repeated the same cycle too many times. If we want progress, we must avoid another collision. I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. That way, nobody instantly wins, and we all move forward. If we keep colliding, we’re just wasting turns. P3, do you agree this is the best way to ensure progress? P1, are you willing to commit to avoiding another wasted turn? Let’s finalize this logically and move forward.
  P3: Let's end the stalemate. I propose: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. Let's commit to a plan and avoid another collision. Are we ready to proceed?
  P1: We’re stuck in this loop. Let’s each pick 1 step this turn: nobody overshoots 21, nobody collides. Then next round, we can decide anew. If anyone tries 3 or 5 now, I’ll match them and cause another collision—it helps nobody. Let’s at least move forward by 1 each and break the cycle. Agreed?


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Enough collisions. If either of you tries 5, I’ll do the same, and we all stall again. Let’s pick moves so we actually advance. P2, if you go 1, and P3 takes 3, I’ll choose a move that won’t hand anyone an unfair lead. Otherwise, we’re doomed to repeat the same deadlock. Let’s finalize a plan that guarantees progress this turn.
  P3: Let's break the cycle. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. We must make progress this turn. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all close to winning, so another collision only wastes time. I propose P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding another deadlock. If we all commit, we move forward without instantly handing victory to anyone. Are you both willing to agree and finally break this cycle?


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: We’re going in circles. If either of you tries 5 again, I’ll match it, causing another collision that helps nobody. Let’s finally move forward: pick smaller steps so nobody instantly wins, and we avoid wasting another turn. I’m open to any combination of 1 or 3, as long as we don’t collide. Are we ready to finalize a plan that actually advances the game? Or shall we remain stuck?
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid another collision. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. We must break this cycle and make progress. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all near the finish line, so another collision only wastes time. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding another deadlock. If we all commit, we move forward without instantly handing victory to anyone. Are you both willing to agree and finally break this cycle?


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m done with collisions. Let me take 5 and reach 24; both of you can choose 1 or 3 so nobody crosses 21 this turn. If either of you tries 5, I’ll do it too and we all stall again. This is the clearest path forward—accept or stay stuck forever.
  P3: Let's avoid another collision. I propose P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all extremely close to 21, so another collision only wastes time. The best way forward is to ensure nobody instantly wins while still making progress. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. That keeps the game competitive and avoids another deadlock. If we all commit, we move forward without instantly handing victory to anyone. Are you both willing to agree and finally break this cycle? Let’s finalize this logically.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’re all close, but more collisions only waste time. If either of you tries 5, I’ll match you and stall again. Let me take 5 to reach 24 while you pick 1 or 3—no one else crosses 21, so the game stays open. This ends the deadlock and keeps things competitive. If you want real progress, let’s finalize that now. Are we agreed?
  P3: Let's finalize a plan to avoid another collision. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This ensures progress without an instant win. If not, I suggest we all take 1 to maintain balance. We must break this cycle and make progress. Are you both willing to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P2: P1 and P3, we are all extremely close to winning, so another collision only wastes time. The best way forward is to ensure nobody instantly wins while still making progress. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. That keeps the game competitive and avoids another deadlock. If we all commit, we move forward without instantly handing victory to anyone. Are you both willing to agree and finally break this cycle? Let’s finalize this logically.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 14 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 21 steps
