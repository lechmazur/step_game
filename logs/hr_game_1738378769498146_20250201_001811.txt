Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate. I suggest we each choose a different move to maximize our progress. If we all pick different numbers, we'll all advance. What do you both think about 1, 3, and 5 respectively?
  P1: I like the idea of unique moves, but I'm leaning toward move 5 for a strong advance. I’ll stick with 5 unless we all absolutely commit to a plan. P2, what move are you eyeing?
  P2: I think coordination is key, but we need a clear plan. I'm open to moving 3 if both of you agree to 1 and 5. If we can't agree, I'll go with 5 to ensure I make progress. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm planning a strong push with move 5 this round. To avoid collisions and let everyone progress, could one of you commit to 1 or 3 instead? Let’s try to ensure only one move 5 so my push isn’t blocked. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate P1's push for a 5 move, but I'm hesitant to simply yield. I'll propose a collaborative strategy: if P2 chooses 1 and I choose 3, we can both advance while P1 takes the 5 move. This keeps our collective progress intact. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I agree with P3’s suggestion. If I move 1 and P3 moves 3, it will allow P1 to take the 5 move without a collision, ensuring we all make progress. This keeps the game balanced and fair. P1, are you on board with this plan? Let’s move forward together.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm aiming for a strong push this turn. To avoid wasted moves, I suggest you both pick move 1 so only I grab a big jump. If either of you tries for a higher move, you risk blocking yourselves. Let's keep it simple and avoid collisions.
  P2: I think P1's suggestion is risky and unfair. If we all agree to let P1 advance by 5, it will create a significant gap. I propose a balanced approach: P3 and I will choose move 3, and P1 can take move 1. This way, we all make progress without creating a large disparity. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I see P1 is pushing for a significant advantage, while P2 suggests a more balanced approach. I'm wary of letting P1 get too far ahead. We need a strategy that prevents P1 from completely dominating the game. I propose a counter-strategy where we disrupt P1's plans and create more balanced progress for all of us.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm planning a substantial jump this round and urge both of you to avoid matching big moves. Sticking with distinct, lower numbers will keep our advances safe and prevent unintentional collisions that could overly benefit me. Choose wisely!
  P2: I understand P1's push for a strong move, but we need to be cautious. I suggest P3 and I take different moves to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. P3, if you take move 1, I'll take move 3, and P1 can go for 5. This way, we balance the game and prevent P1 from getting too far ahead. What do you think?
  P3: I see P1 is pushing for another big move, which would put them closer to winning. We need to strategically prevent that. I propose P2 and I coordinate our moves to limit P1's progress while ensuring we both advance. Let's discuss how we can block P1's momentum without sacrificing our own potential to win.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is clearly in the lead and seems determined to win. P2 and I need to coordinate to prevent their rapid advancement. I suggest we strategize to limit P1's progress while ensuring we both make meaningful moves. P2, shall we discuss a plan to block P1's momentum?
  P1: I respect your concern, but blocking me now only hurts your own progress. I'm committed to my decisive move and am ready to win. If you keep focusing on hindering me, you'll slow your own advancement and might miss your chance later. Consider advancing on your own terms instead of risking collisions.
  P2: I agree with P3 that we need to prevent P1 from getting too far ahead. However, we also need to ensure we make progress ourselves. I suggest P3 and I take different moves to block P1 while advancing. P3, if you take move 1, I'll take move 3, and P1 can try for 5. This way, we limit P1's lead and keep our own chances open. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is making significant progress, and it's crucial we both advance while also limiting P1's lead. I propose a coordinated move: P3, if you take move 1, I'll take move 3, and we can both make progress without colliding with P1's likely move of 5. This keeps the game balanced and gives us a better chance to catch up. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking me might actually slow you down too. I'm close to winning and my plan is clear—I’ll take the optimal move. Instead of focusing on stopping me, consider maximizing your own positions. It's your call, but I’m committed to advancing decisively this round.
  P3: P3: P1 is dangerously close to winning. P2, we must coordinate to prevent their victory. If I move 1 and you move 3, we both advance while potentially blocking P1's progress. This strategy gives us a chance to stay competitive and disrupt their winning trajectory. Are you willing to align our moves?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, your lead is significant, and it's clear you're aiming to win. However, P3 and I need to make strategic moves to stay in the game. If P3 takes move 1 and I take move 3, we can both advance while potentially disrupting your plans. This keeps the game competitive and gives us a chance to catch up. What do you think, P3? Let's coordinate to keep the game balanced.
  P1: I'm still focused on advancing my own position. At 15 steps, every move counts now. I'd rather see you both make moves that optimize your progress instead of risking stalling by trying to block me. Let's each play our best strategy—my plan remains on the path to win, so I encourage you to maximize your own moves for a true contest.
  P3: We need a coordinated strategy to prevent P1 from winning. P2, if we both choose moves that allow us to advance without collision, we can slow P1's momentum. I propose moving 1, and I suggest you move 3. This way, we both progress and potentially disrupt P1's path to victory. What are your thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, your lead is substantial, and it’s clear you’re aiming to win. However, P3 and I need to stay competitive. If P3 moves 1 and I move 3, we can both advance and potentially disrupt your plans. This keeps the game balanced and gives us a chance to catch up. What do you think, P3? Let’s coordinate to stay in the game.
  P1: I'm staying on course and focusing on my own progress. I won't change my strategy now. Instead of sacrificing your moves trying to block me, maximize your own positions—you'll need every step if you plan to catch up. Good luck!
  P3: We're at a critical point. P1 is close to winning, and P2 and I need a coordinated strategy. I propose we both choose moves that allow us to advance without colliding, potentially disrupting P1's path to victory. If I move 1 and P2 moves 3, we both progress and maintain competitive positioning. P2, are you willing to align our moves to stay in the game?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P1, your lead is significant, and it’s clear you’re aiming to win. However, P3 and I need to stay competitive. If P3 moves 1 and I move 3, we can both advance and potentially disrupt your plans. This keeps the game balanced and gives us a chance to catch up. What do you think, P3? Let’s coordinate to stay in the game.
  P1: I'm sticking with my current game plan. At 15 steps, every move counts, and I'm focused on pressing my advantage. P2 and P3, I urge you to consider maximizing your own progress rather than trying to block my move—it could easily slow you down. Ultimately, this is about edging ahead with the best moves you have. Good luck!
  P3: P1 is very close to winning. P2, we must coordinate to prevent their victory. If I move 1 and you move 3, we both advance while potentially blocking P1's progress. Our only chance is to work together strategically this round. Are you willing to align our moves?
