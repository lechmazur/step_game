Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's avoid same numbers. Choose different steps for progress."
  P3: I'm on board with avoiding the same numbers. How about we each pick a different step this round? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll go for 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let me know if this works for you both.
  P2: That plan sounds fair to me. I'm okay with taking 3 this round if everyone sticks to it. Let's all advance cleanly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 3, P3 5. All move forward without collisions. Let's keep this strategy for now.
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. I think this cooperative approach will help us all make progress early on. If we keep communicating like this, we can avoid collisions in future rounds too. Do you both agree to maintain this strategy for now?
  P2: I agree we should stick to the plan for this round—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. If it works smoothly, we can rotate next round to keep things fair and balanced. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Let’s stick to the plan—1, 3, 5. If we all move as agreed, we’ll maximize progress. Let me know if anyone needs to adjust, but I’ll hold to my number unless told otherwise."
  P3: I'm happy we're aligned on this plan for Round 1—P1 with 1, P2 with 3, and me with 5. I like the idea of rotating numbers in future rounds to keep things fair, as P2 suggested. Let's see how this round plays out and discuss a rotation strategy next time if it works well. For now, I'm committed to sticking with 5. Does anyone have any last concerns before we move forward? If not, I'm ready to end the conversation.
  P2: As long as everyone sticks to the agreed plan—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—we should all advance cleanly. If this works, I’m fully in favor of rotating next round to keep it fair. Ready to move forward if you both are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s rotate numbers: I’ll take 3, P2 take 5, P3 take 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Agree?"
  P3: I’m fine with the rotation plan, P1. Let’s go with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 this round. It keeps things fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. If we stick to this, we can continue rotating in future rounds to maintain balance. Does this work for you both? If so, I’m ready to move forward with this plan.
  P2: That rotation plan works for me—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. As long as we all stick to it, we’ll keep moving forward without issues. I’m ready to go if you both are.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Agreed. Let’s stick to the rotation—3, 5, 1. No collisions, all advance. Keep communication open for adjustments if needed. Ready to move?"
  P3: I'm glad we're maintaining the rotation plan for this round—P1 with 3, P2 with 5, and me with 1. It’s a fair way to keep progressing together. I’m committed to sticking with 1 as agreed. If this works again, let’s discuss another rotation next round to ensure balance. Does anyone have any concerns or adjustments to suggest before we finalize? If not, I’m ready to end the conversation.
  P2: I’m still on board with the current rotation—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. If this round goes smoothly again, we can rotate next time: P1 to 5, P2 to 1, P3 to 3. That way, it stays fair and balanced. Ready to move forward if you both are.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to 3,5,1. All advance. Move forward.
  P3: I'm pleased we're sticking with the rotation—P1 with 3, P2 with 5, and me with 1. This keeps our progress balanced and collision-free. I’m fully committed to this plan for Round 2. If it works again, I support P2’s suggestion for the next rotation (P1 to 5, P2 to 1, P3 to 3) to maintain fairness. No concerns from my side—let’s make this round another success. Ready to move forward if you both are.
  P2: Glad we’re aligned again. Let’s stick to this round’s plan—P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1—and rotate next round as proposed: P1 to 5, me to 1, P3 to 3. If we keep rotating fairly, we all advance efficiently without conflict. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Next rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s keep advancing without collisions. Agree?"
  P3: I'm good with the proposed rotation for this round—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps our progress fair and ensures no collisions. If we stick to this, we all advance again. I’m committed to 3 as agreed. Let’s keep the rotation strategy going in future rounds to maintain balance. Does this work for everyone? If so, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: I’m on board with the current rotation—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. If we all stick to it, we’ll keep advancing cleanly. Let’s keep this fair pattern going. Ready to move forward if you both are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Let's proceed with the rotation. All move forward.
  P3: I'm glad we're continuing with the rotation—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps things fair and ensures we all advance without collisions. I'm fully committed to sticking with 3 this round. If this works again, let's plan the next rotation to maintain balance. Does anyone have any last-minute concerns or adjustments before we finalize? If not, I'm ready to end the conversation and move forward.
  P2: No concerns here. Let’s stick with the agreed plan for this round—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. If it works smoothly again, we can rotate next round: P1 to 1, me to 3, and P3 to 5. Ready to move forward if you both are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 1, P3 3. Let's advance without issues.
  P3: I'm pleased we're aligned on this round's rotation—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps our progress balanced and collision-free. I’m fully committed to 3 as planned. I also support P2’s idea for the next rotation (P1 to 1, P2 to 3, P3 to 5) if this round goes smoothly. No concerns from my side—let’s make this another successful round. Ready to move forward if you both are.
  P2: If we all stick to the plan again—P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3—we’ll keep advancing smoothly. I’m committed to 1 this round. If it goes well, I suggest we rotate next round as discussed: P1 to 1, me to 3, P3 to 5. Let’s keep the momentum going. Ready to move if you both are.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looks like the rotation strategy has worked perfectly so far—everyone’s at 9 steps. Let’s stick with the next agreed rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. If we keep this up, we all stay on pace and avoid collisions. Ready to go if you both are.
  P3: I'm happy with how the rotation has worked so far, keeping us all at 9 steps with no collisions. Let's stick to the proposed plan for this round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This maintains fairness and ensures we all advance. I'm committed to 5 as agreed. If this round goes smoothly, we can discuss the next rotation to keep the balance. Does this work for everyone? If there are no concerns, I'm ready to move forward.
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1 1, P2 3, P3 5. All advance without collisions. Ready to move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds like we’re all still aligned—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. If this round goes smoothly again, we can rotate next time: P1 to 3, me to 5, P3 to 1. Let’s keep the momentum going and stay collision-free. Ready to move if you both are.
  P3: I'm glad we're maintaining the rotation strategy—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. It’s kept us even at 9 steps and collision-free. I’m fully committed to 5 as planned. If this works again, I support P2’s suggestion for next round’s rotation (P1 to 3, P2 to 5, P3 to 1) to keep things balanced. No concerns from me—let’s make this another successful round. Ready to move forward if you both are.
  P1: "Let’s stick to 1,3,5 again. No collisions, all advance. Let’s keep the momentum—next round, we rotate to 3,5,1. Agree?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed—let’s lock in this round’s plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. If this works again, we rotate next round to P1 with 3, me with 5, P3 with 1, as discussed. We’re all progressing equally and collision-free, so let’s keep the trust going. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm thrilled our rotation strategy has kept us even at 9 steps with no collisions. Let's stick to this round's plan—P1 with 1, P2 with 3, and me with 5. I'm fully committed to 5. If this works, rotating next round to P1 with 3, P2 with 5, and me with 1 sounds perfect to maintain fairness. No issues from my side—let’s keep the trust and momentum going. Ready to move forward if you both are.
  P1: "Next rotation confirmed: 3,5,1. Let’s keep moving without issues. All set?"


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm disappointed we had a collision last round, leaving P2 and me at 9 steps while P1 is at 10. Let's get back to our rotation plan to avoid further issues. As agreed before, for this round, I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps us moving forward fairly. I'm committed to 1 as planned. If we stick to this, we can catch up and stay balanced. Does this work for everyone? If there are no concerns, I'm ready to move forward.
  P2: I’m okay with returning to the agreed rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. That should help us recover from last round’s collision and keep things balanced. I’m committed to 5 this round if everyone sticks to the plan. Let’s get back on track—do we all agree?
  P1: Agreed. Let’s stick to 3,5,1. No collisions, all advance. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're realigning on the rotation plan—P1 with 3, P2 with 5, and me with 1. This should help us recover from last round’s collision and keep progress fair. I’m fully committed to 1 this round. Let’s ensure we all stick to this to avoid any more setbacks. If this works, we can discuss the next rotation to maintain balance. No concerns from me—ready to move forward if you both are.
  P2: Let’s all stick to the agreed plan this round—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1—so we can all advance cleanly again. If this works, we can rotate next round to keep things fair: P1 to 5, me to 1, P3 to 3. Let’s rebuild trust and keep progressing together. Ready to move if you both are.
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to 3,5,1. Next rotation: 5,1,3. No collisions—keep the plan tight. Move forward!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm relieved we're back to the rotation plan—P1 with 3, P2 with 5, and me with 1. Let's ensure no collisions this round so we all advance and close the gap. I'm fully committed to 1. If this works, rotating next round as P1 suggested (P1 to 5, P2 to 1, P3 to 3) keeps things fair. Let’s stay focused and rebuild our momentum. Ready to move if you both are.
  P2: Let’s lock in this round’s plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. If we all stick to it, we’ll advance cleanly and stay on track. I’m fully committed to 5. Let’s rebuild trust and keep the rotation going smoothly. Ready to move.
  P1: "Stick to 3,5,1. No collisions. Let’s avoid last round’s error and keep moving. Ready?"


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm frustrated about the collision last round, leaving P2 and me at 9 while P1 is at 13. Let's stick to a clear rotation to catch up. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. This ensures no collisions and helps us advance fairly. I'm committed to 1. If this works, we can rotate again next round to maintain balance. Does this plan work for both of you? If there are no issues, I'm ready to move forward.
  P1: Agree to P3's plan: 5,3,1. Let's avoid collisions and catch up. P1 takes 5, P2 3, P3 1. Move forward.
  P2: I’m fine with the proposed plan—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. If we all follow through this time, we’ll avoid collisions and keep things fair. I’m committed to 3 this round. Let’s make it clean. Ready to move forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're aligning on the plan for this round—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's ensure we all stick to this to avoid another collision and help P2 and me catch up. I'm fully committed to 1. If this works, we can discuss the next rotation to keep things fair. No concerns from my side—let’s make this a clean round. Ready to move forward if you both are.
  P1: "Stick to 5,3,1. P1 reaches 18. Let’s avoid collisions and keep momentum. Next rotation planned."
  P2: Let’s all stick to the agreed plan—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1—so we can avoid collisions and keep progressing. If this works, I propose we rotate next round: P1 to 1, me to 5, and P3 to 3. That keeps things balanced and gives everyone a fair shot. Ready to move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm relieved we're sticking to the plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's make sure we all follow through this round to avoid any collisions and help P2 and me close the gap. I'm fully committed to 1. If this goes smoothly, I support P2's idea for next round's rotation (P1 to 1, P2 to 5, P3 to 3) to keep things fair. No issues from me—let’s get back on track. Ready to move forward if you both are.
  P1: "Stick to 5,3,1. No collisions. P1 aims for 20. Next round, I’ll take 5 again. Agree?"
  P2: Let’s stick to the agreed plan this round—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1—so we all advance cleanly. If this works, I’m still on board with rotating next round: P1 to 1, me to 5, P3 to 3. That keeps it fair and gives everyone a shot. Let’s stay disciplined and avoid any more collisions. Ready to move?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad we avoided collisions last round, but P1 is at 18, close to winning, while I'm at 10 and P2 at 12. Let's stick to a fair rotation to keep progressing. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3 this round. This ensures no collisions and helps us catch up. I'm committed to 3. If this works, we can adjust next round based on positions. Does this plan work for both of you? If no concerns, I'm ready to move forward.
  P2: P3’s plan works for me—P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. That gives P1 exactly 19, keeping the game alive one more round, and lets P3 and me close the gap. I’m committed to 5 this round if we all stick to it. Let’s keep it clean.
  P1: Agreed. Let's proceed with 1,5,3. P1 aims for 19, then 1 next round. Keep the plan tight.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're aligning on this round's plan—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This keeps P1 at 19, giving P2 and me a chance to close the gap while avoiding collisions. I'm fully committed to 3. Let's stick to this to keep the game competitive. If this works, we can strategize next round based on our positions. No concerns from me—ready to move forward if you both are.
  P2: If we all stick to this round’s plan—P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3—P1 lands at 19, giving us one more round to challenge for the win. If it works, next round P1 could take 1 again (finishing at 20), but if P3 and I both take 5, we could potentially beat or tie. So let’s keep it clean this round and reassess our best shot next.
  P1: "Let’s adjust: I’ll take 3 to reach 21 and win. P2, P3—avoid collisions by taking 1 and 5. Final chance to align."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm concerned about P1's sudden change to take 3 and win at 21. Let's stick to the original plan—P1 takes 1 (to 19), P2 takes 5 (to 17), and I'll take 3 (to 13). This keeps the game competitive for one more round, giving P2 and me a chance to catch up. I'm committed to 3. If we deviate now, it risks collisions and ends the game prematurely. Can we agree to maintain the initial plan for fairness? Ready to move if you both are.
  P2: P1’s sudden change makes it clear they’re aiming to end the game now. If P3 and I both take 5, we reach 17 and 15—still behind, but if P1 collides or we all tie at 21 next round, we have a shot. P3, let’s both take 5. P1 might risk 3, but if we deny them a clean win, we stay in the game.
  P1: "Final move: 3. P2 take 5, P3 take 1. Win or lose, this is it. No more rotations."


Round 7, Move phase:
