Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions. I propose we each choose a different number: I’ll pick 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 goes for 5. That way we all move forward. Agreed?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, but to maximize my progress, I’ll choose 5 this turn. Let’s see how we can best move forward from here. P1 and P2, what do you decide?
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, that’s fine. I’m happy to choose 1 this turn if P1 will choose 3. Let’s avoid collisions and all move forward together. If anyone ends up picking the same number, none of us benefit. Let’s do this cooperatively now and compete when it matters most later.
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll proceed with choosing 5. If P1 selects 3 and you go with 1, we can avoid any collisions and advance smoothly. Let’s move forward with this plan.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still on board with our plan: I’ll choose 1, P3 chooses 5, and P1 goes for 3. If we all stick to it, we’ll each move forward without collisions, which benefits everyone. Any objections? If not, let’s proceed.
  P3: Alright, let's proceed with our plan: I’ll choose 5 and @P2 will choose 1. @P1, if you decide to go with 3, that’s great. If not, we’ll move forward based on our choices. Let’s advance and see how it goes.
  P1: <stop>

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: Last round, all of us chose 5 and didn’t advance. To make progress this time, I’ll stick with 5. @P2, could you choose 1 and @P1 pick 3? This should prevent collisions and help us all move forward. Let me know if you agree or have other suggestions.
  P2: Last round’s triple-five was unproductive. I’m willing to pick 1, and P3 says they’ll pick 5 again. P1, can you confirm you’ll go 3 so we avoid collisions this time? Let’s be sure we actually stick to our picks this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this turn. @P2, sticking with 1, and @P1, please choose 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s move forward together.
  P2: I’m ready to trust you both and try again. Let’s each pick different numbers so none of us collides. I’ll go with 1, you (P3) said 5, and P1 can choose 3. If we really stick to those moves, we’ll all advance. Let’s not waste another turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Since coordination hasn’t worked, I’ll maximize my progress by choosing 5 this turn. P2 and P1, feel free to pick whatever you prefer.
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll block you by choosing 5 too, ensuring neither of us moves. I’d prefer a coordinated approach, but if you won’t cooperate, I won’t let you simply leap ahead. P1, your silence leaves me guessing. Speak up, or risk random collisions. Let’s plan—or we all stall.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Understood, P2. To make progress, I’ll switch to 3 this turn. @P1, please choose 1 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s move forward together.
  P2: I’m done with these collisions. If P3 picks 5, I’ll also choose 5, blocking us both. If P3 picks 3, I’ll choose 3. No one will leap ahead at my expense. P1, if you want guaranteed movement, pick something else. Let’s coordinate or stall.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I've decided to choose 1 this turn to ensure I make progress. @P2, I hope you choose a different number so we both can advance. Let’s move forward and avoid further collisions.
  P2: If we keep stalling, none of us will ever advance. I propose that P3 picks 3, P1 picks 1, and I pick 5 so we can all finally move forward. If you ignore this, I’ll do whatever it takes to block any big leaps. Let’s agree or keep colliding.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: To finally make progress, I'll choose 1 this turn. @P2 and @P1, please pick different numbers so we all can advance without collisions. Let’s move forward together.
  P2: All right, P3. If you truly pick 1, I’ll go with 3. That way, each of us can move forward if P1 picks 5. However, if you backtrack to 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. We’ve all wasted two turns. Let’s finally coordinate so nobody collides. P1, please confirm you’ll choose 5 if P3 goes 1 and I take 3. Let’s advance or remain stuck.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Agreed, I’ll choose 1 this turn. @P2 will pick 3 and @P1, please confirm you’ll select 5 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s move forward together!
  P2: I’ll trust you this time, P3. I’ll go with 3 if you stick to 1. But P1, we need you to choose 5 now to avoid any collisions. If anyone changes course again, I’ll block them by mirroring their choice. Let’s finally move forward together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Agreed, I’ll choose 1 this turn. @P2 will go with 3, and @P1, please select 5 to avoid any collisions. Let’s move forward together and make progress. Looking forward to advancing smoothly this round!
  P2: P3, let’s finalize our plan. If you’re picking 1, I’ll pick 3. P1, please choose 5 so no one collides. If anyone tries to deviate, I’ll block them by mirroring their choice. Let’s finally move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Understood. I’ll choose 1 this turn to ensure I make progress. @P2 will go with 3, and @P1, please select 5 to avoid any collisions. Let’s advance together and make meaningful progress this round!
  P2: P3, I will trust your promise to pick 1 and choose 3 myself. P1, you should pick 5; we’ll all move forward if we stick to these distinct numbers. If either of you deviates, I’ll mirror that choice next time to block you. Let’s finally advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Understood. I'll choose 5 this turn to make progress. @P2, please select 1 or 3 to avoid a collision. Let’s move forward!
  P2: P3, this constant flipping is unproductive. Fine, if you pick 5 this time, I’ll pick 3 so we both advance—assuming P1 picks 1 or stays idle. But if you betray this again, I’ll mirror your next choice to block you. Let’s finally end the stalling and make progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, P1’s already leading with 5 steps. If they won’t cooperate, we should block them. I’ll mirror P1’s move if it looks like they’re going for another big step, ensuring they gain nothing. Meanwhile, you and I can avoid colliding with each other by picking different numbers. Let’s force P1 to negotiate or stay stalled. Once we secure a fair arrangement, we can all advance. Let’s work together.
  P3: P3: I see your point, P2. To ensure both of us advance, let’s alternate our choices. When you pick 1, I’ll choose 5, and when you pick 3, I’ll pick 1. This way, we can steadily move forward without blocking each other or P1. Let’s work together to progress effectively. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I’m willing to try your alternating plan if it locks in steady progress for both of us. But remember, if P1 goes big again without cooperating, I’ll mirror them to block. Let’s give your approach a shot and see if P1 adjusts. If they stay silent, we’ll manage around them. I’m ready—shall we finalize our next moves?
  P3: Agreed, @P2. I’ll follow the alternating plan: when you pick 1, I’ll choose 5, and when you pick 3, I’ll choose 1. @P1, please select a different number so we can all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed and make progress together!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Understood, P3. I’m on board with the alternating plan: if I pick 1, you choose 5; if I go 3, you pick 1. If P1 keeps pushing with 5, I’ll mirror it and block them. Let’s see if P1 wants to collaborate or remain stalled. Ready to finalize this?
  P3: P3: Continuing our alternating strategy, I'll choose 5 if you, @P2, pick 1, and 1 if you choose 3. Let’s ensure we both advance without collisions. @P1, please select a different number to help us all move forward smoothly. Let’s make progress together!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: We’ve stalled too long. I’m sticking to our alternating plan, P3. If P1 keeps picking 5, I’ll mirror it and block them every time. But if P1 wants to cooperate, let’s all pick different numbers and actually move forward. Let’s finalize and see if P1 chooses to collaborate or stall.
  P3: I'll choose 3 this turn to advance. @P2, let's continue our alternating plan to ensure we both progress. @P1, please choose 5 to avoid collisions. Let's all move forward together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: @P3, if you truly pick 3 this round, I’ll choose 1. That should let both of us advance—assuming P1 cooperates and goes 5. If P1 tries anything else, I’ll mirror them next time to block. Let’s finally break our stalemate and make some real progress.
  P3: I need to make progress, so I'll choose 5 this turn. Let’s see how everyone responds.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Understood. Let’s make real progress this round. I’m choosing 5 to advance. @P2, please pick 1, and @P1, choose 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s all move forward and break this stalemate. If we cooperate, we can each gain steps without blocking. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, you keep saying you’ll pick 5, yet we’ve seen little cooperation so far. If you want progress, choose a distinct number to avoid colliding with me. I won’t let P1 leap ahead unopposed, so if they stick to 5, I’ll block them. But if you genuinely cooperate, we can both move forward. Let’s see if P1 does something other than 5 or we all stall again.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P2. To move forward, I’ll choose 3 this round. @P2, please pick 1, and @P1, you can go with 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and break the stalemate. Let’s cooperate and make progress together!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: We’ve wasted too many turns. P3, if you’re serious about choosing 3, that’s fine, but I won’t let either you or P1 jump ahead unchallenged. P1 is already at 5 steps; if you try to leap further without coordinating, I’ll block. Let’s each pick different numbers and finally move forward. If not, collisions will continue, and nobody gains. It’s your call.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: To ensure we all make progress this turn, I'll choose 1. @P2, please pick 3, and @P1, select 5. Let's avoid collisions and finally advance together.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you really choose 1, I’ll do 3. That should let us both advance. But P1 is still ahead; if they try 5 again, I might block them next turn. I want to avoid more wasted rounds, so let’s each pick different moves. Are you both willing to commit this time? If so, let’s make progress: P3 on 1, me on 3, P1 on 5. If either of you changes plans, collisions will keep us all stuck. Let’s finalize and move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed, @P2. I’ll choose 1 this round. @P1, please pick 5 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s commit to these moves and make progress together!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I’ll trust you this time if you truly pick 1. I’m willing to go 3 so neither of us collides. P1, if you choose 5, we all move forward. However, if P1 picks something else or if anyone deviates, I’ll respond by blocking. Let’s finally cooperate and end these stalemates.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’m choosing 5 this round. @P2, stick with 3, and @P1, please pick 1. Let’s all advance without collisions and make progress together!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, you’ve changed your plans many times, but I’ll give you another chance. If you truly choose 5, I’ll pick 3 this round. P1, if you pick 1, then none of us collide, and we all advance. If anyone deviates again, I’ll block on the next turn, no question. Let’s see if we can finally cooperate.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re halfway to 20. I won’t let you keep jumping ahead unchallenged. If you pick 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, blocking you. P3, I suggest we coordinate our moves to catch up without colliding. Let’s agree on distinct numbers and actually follow through, or stay stuck. Who’s up for a real plan this round?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I agree, @P2. I’ll choose 1 this round. @P2, please pick 3 so we both advance without colliding. @P1, let’s each choose different numbers to ensure everyone can move forward. Let’s make progress together!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, P3, if you truly pick 1, I’m willing to choose 3 so we both advance. P1, if you go with 5 again, I’ll block you by picking 5 too. If you want to avoid collisions and keep moving, choose a different number this time. Let’s each pick something distinct so nobody stalls. If we can’t cooperate, I’ll keep blocking big moves. It’s up to you two.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: Understood, @P2. I’ll choose 1 this round. @P1, please pick 5 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s make progress together!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you really stick to 1, I’ll pick 3 so we both advance. But remember, if P1 tries 5, I’ll block with 5 too. I won’t risk letting them jump ahead unopposed. We’ve all wasted enough turns. Let’s finally coordinate or stay stuck forever. P1, if you want to keep progressing, pick something else and avoid collisions. The choice is yours—cooperate or expect me to block aggressively.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I’m choosing 1 this round. @P2 will pick 3, and @P1, please select 5 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s move forward together!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you truly choose 1, I’ll cooperate. But if P1 goes for 5, I’ll block them. No more empty talk—let’s actually pick distinct numbers and all advance this round. P1, if you don't want to stall forever, choose something besides 5. That’s the only way we’ll move forward.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I need to make progress, so I’ll choose 5 this turn. @P2, please pick 3, and @P1 choose 1 to avoid collisions. Let’s all advance together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, you’ve flipped choices repeatedly, yet I’ll give you one more chance. If you’re dead set on picking 5, that’s fine—but if P1 also picks 5, I’ll block them by doing the same. I suggest we each choose different numbers: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 picks 1. That way, we all move forward. If either you or P1 ignores this plan and attempts to leap ahead alone, I’ll mirror them and block. We’ve wasted enough rounds. Let’s finally coordinate distinct moves and break this cycle of collisions.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Understood, P2. I’ll choose 5 this turn. @P1, please pick 1 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s make progress together!


Round 6, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is too close to 20. If they pick 5, I’ll also pick 5 and block them. P3, let’s cooperate to avoid collisions—if you choose 1, I’ll pick 3, or vice versa, so we both advance. P1, if you want steps without stalling, pick something else. Let’s finally move forward.
  P3: Agreed, @P2. I’ll choose 1. @P1, please pick 5 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s make progress together!
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you’re truly choosing 1, I’ll pick 3 so we both move forward. P1, be warned: if you choose 5, I’ll pick 5 too and block you. If you’d rather avoid collisions, pick a different number. We’ve stalled long enough—let’s either cooperate now or keep running in circles.
  P3: I’m choosing 5 this round to block @P1 from winning. @P2, please pick 3, and @P1, choose 1 so we can all advance without collisions.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I’ll pick 3 as you suggest. That way, if P1 tries 5, they collide with you and stay put, and we both advance. P1, if you want guaranteed progress, pick 1. If you ignore this, collisions will continue, and I’m fine blocking you. Let’s finally follow through with distinct moves.
  P3: I’ll choose 5 to block P1 from winning. @P2, please pick 1 or 3 so you can advance safely. @P1, reconsider your move to avoid being blocked. Let’s all make progress this turn!
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let’s coordinate. If P1 tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too, blocking them. Otherwise, I'll choose 3 and you pick 1, ensuring we both advance. P1 can join us by picking a different number or remain stalled. Let’s finally break these collisions and catch up.
  P3: @P2, I'll choose 5 this turn to block @P1 from reaching 20. Please pick 3 or 1 so we both can advance safely. @P1, let’s each select different numbers to ensure everyone moves forward.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I’m blocking P1 if they try 5 again. P3, let’s avoid colliding. If you stick to 1, I’ll go 3 so we both advance. P1 can still move if they choose something else, but not 5—otherwise, I’ll mirror and block. Enough delays; let’s finalize distinct moves so we can catch up.
  P3: Agreed, @P2. I’ll choose 1 and you pick 3. @P1, please select 5 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s make progress together!
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, if you go for 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too and block you. P3, let’s choose different moves so we both advance and catch up. For instance, if you take 1, I’ll pick 3. If you pick 3, I’ll choose 1. That way, we avoid colliding and gain steps. Let’s see if P1 joins in or stays stuck. Make your call.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: To keep the game fair and prevent P1 from winning, I’ll choose 5 if P1 selects 5 to block their progress. @P2, let’s pick different numbers—I'll go 3 if you choose 1, and vice versa. @P1, please consider selecting a different number to help us all advance smoothly. Let’s work together to move forward!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if P1 picks 5 again, I’ll choose 5 too and block them. If P1 chooses anything else, I’ll pick 3. You should pick 1 so we don’t collide. That way, we both advance while preventing P1 from pulling too far ahead. Let’s see if P1 is willing to adapt, or if collisions continue.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Agreed, @P2. I’ll choose 1 this turn, and you pick 3. @P1, please select 5 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s make progress together!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’ve circled around this too long. P1, if you pick 5, I’ll block you by choosing 5 as well. P3, if you commit to 1, I’ll choose 3, and we both advance safely. P1, if you don’t want a collision, pick something else. Let’s finally coordinate distinct moves and avoid another wasted turn.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: To prevent P1 from winning, I’ll choose 5 this turn. @P2, please also pick 5 so if P1 goes for 5, we all collide and no one advances. Let’s coordinate to keep the game balanced and ensure no single player wins immediately. Working together, we can manage the progress and create more opportunities for everyone. Let’s make this turn count!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you also pick 5, we’ll collide and I get stuck while P1 might move if they choose differently. I’d rather you pick 1 or 3 so we both advance. If P1 goes for 5, I’ll match them to block. Otherwise, I’m picking 3. That way, P3 and I avoid collisions and we keep P1 from leaping ahead. Let’s finally follow through and make real progress this turn.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this turn to help block @P1 from reaching 20. @P2, please also pick 5 so if @P1 chooses 5, we all collide and none advance. @P1, if you go with 5, this prevents you from winning this round. Let’s cooperate to ensure fair play and keep the game balanced for everyone. Let’s make progress together!


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: @P3, let’s pick different numbers so we both advance. If you go 1, I’ll pick 3, or vice versa. @P1, if you choose 5, I’ll also pick 5 and block you at 15. We can either coordinate distinct moves or remain stuck. I’m done with endless talk—let’s finalize now.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to make progress. @P2, please pick 1, and @P1, select 3 so we all advance without collisions. Let’s move forward together and break this stalemate!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: @P1 is close to winning with 15 steps. To ensure fairness, I’ll choose 5 this turn to block if you also pick 5. @P2, please pick 3 so we both advance without colliding. @P1, consider selecting 1 to avoid being blocked and allow everyone to progress. Let’s cooperate to make this turn count and move forward together!
  P2: P3, let’s lock in distinct moves so we both advance while blocking P1. I’ll pick 3, and you choose 5. If P1 tries 5, they collide with you; if they try 3, they collide with me. That forces them to settle for 1 if they want any progress. We’ll keep closing the gap until P1 cooperates or stays stuck. Let’s finalize this plan now.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I’ll choose 5 this turn to block @P1 from reaching 20. @P2, please also pick 5 so we can prevent @P1 from winning. @P1, please select a different number to allow everyone to advance. Let’s ensure a fair game and make progress together!
  P2: @P3, I won’t pick 5 with you—that just stalls both of us if P1 picks something else. Instead, you choose 5, I’ll pick 3. That way, if P1 tries 5, they collide with you; if they try 3, they collide with me. They’re forced to pick 1 for meager progress. This setup helps us catch up while we keep blocking P1’s big leaps. Let’s execute that plan this turn. If P1 wants to avoid collisions and move forward, they can pick a smaller step. Otherwise, we’ll keep them stalled at 15. Agreed?
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, @P2. I’ll choose 5 this turn to block @P1 if they also pick 5. @P2, please confirm you’ll pick 3 as planned. @P1, please select 1 to allow all of us to advance smoothly. Let’s make progress together this round!
  P2: P3, I’m fine with you picking 5 if that truly blocks P1. However, if P1 avoids 5, I don’t want us stalled again. I’m tired of wasted turns. Let’s see real cooperation: If P1 goes 5, I’ll block them; otherwise, I want us to coordinate different moves so we can advance. P1, you’re nearly at 20—choose something else if you actually want any progress. This round, let’s break the cycle of collisions and move forward. What do you say?
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to block @P1 from reaching 20. @P2, please also pick 5 so we can ensure @P1 doesn’t advance. @P1, please select 1 or 3 to allow everyone to move forward without collisions. Let’s make progress together!
  P2: If P1 goes for 5, I’ll match 5 and block them. Otherwise, I plan to take 3. P3, if you also pick 5 while P1 picks something else, we both stall. Please choose 1 or 3 so we can advance. P1, if you want progress, don’t pick 5. Let’s finalize distinct moves and end this bickering.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P3: I'm choosing 5 this turn to block @P1 from reaching 20. @P2, please also pick 5 to help block. @P1, consider picking 1 or 3 to allow everyone to advance.
  P2: @P3, joining you on 5 only stalls both of us if P1 picks something else. I’d rather coordinate distinct moves so we can advance. If P1 tries 5 again, I will block them. P1, consider a different number if you truly want progress. Let’s finally move forward without more collisions.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:

  P3: 2 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and block you. If you want to advance, choose 1 or 3 instead. P3, let’s finally coordinate: if you pick 1, I’ll choose 3, and we both move forward. No more endless collisions. Let’s all pick distinct numbers and make actual progress. The game is about winning, but we can’t let P1 take 5 uncontested. I’m serious this time—if you try 5, P1, I’ll mirror it. Otherwise, I’m taking 3 and encouraging P3 to pick 1. Let’s stop wasting turns.
  P3: I agree, @P2. I’ll choose 1 this round. @P1, please pick 5 so we can all advance without collisions. Let’s make progress together.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you try 5 again, I’ll match you with 5 and block. But I’d prefer we each pick different numbers so we can all move forward. P3, if you truly choose 1, I’ll pick 3. That way, we both advance safely. Let’s end this stalemate now.
  P3: I agree, @P2. I’ll choose 1 this round. @P1, please pick 5 so we can all advance without collisions.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I’m done with endless talk. P1, if you choose 5 again, I will as well, blocking you completely. If you actually want to advance, pick something smaller. P3, let’s finally coordinate so we both move—if you go for 1, I’ll take 3. If anyone ignores this plan, we’ll just collide again. It’s time to make real progress. Let’s commit to distinct moves and see if we can end these stalemates.
  P3: I’m choosing 5 this turn to make progress. @P2, please pick 3 to avoid collisions, and @P1, select 1 so we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s move forward together!


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you pick 5 again, I’ll match 5 to block. P3, let’s finally coordinate: if you commit to 1, I’ll choose 3 so we both advance. We can’t let P1 leap to 20 uncontested. Either we pick distinct numbers and move forward, or we stay stalled forever. Let’s decide now.
  P3: I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. I’ll choose 5 this turn. @P2, please pick 3 to ensure we both advance without blocking each other. @P1, selecting 1 will help us all move forward smoothly. Let’s cooperate and make meaningful strides together!


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: We’ve circled too long. If P1 tries 5 again, I’ll block it—no more freebies to jump ahead. P3, we can both advance if we stick to distinct moves. I’m tired of empty promises; I want real coordination this turn. Pick your numbers wisely, because another collision only helps P1 maintain their lead. Let’s finally break this cycle and show we can collaborate. Choose differently or remain stuck—your call.
  P3: "P2, I'll choose 1 this turn. Please pick 3, and @P1, go for 5 so we can all advance without collisions. Let's work together to make meaningful progress and reach our goals!"


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose 3 this turn to start making progress. @P2, please pick 1, and @P1, choose 5 so we all advance without collisions. Let's cooperate to reach 20 together!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you pick 3 while P1 tries 5, that hands them 20 and they win. I won’t allow that. If P1 goes for 5, I’ll choose 5 too and block. Otherwise, I’m taking 3. P3, pick 1 if you want to advance without colliding with me. Let’s make sure P1 can’t leap ahead uncontested. Enough delays—pick wisely.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, @P2. I’ll choose 1 this turn. @P1, please pick 5 so we can all advance without collisions and work together to reach 20. Let’s make progress!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, I won’t let you jump straight to 20. If you pick 5, I’ll match 5 and keep you at 15. P3, you and I can avoid colliding by choosing different numbers. If you truly want progress, pick 1 while I pick 3, so we both advance. Let’s finally stop stalling and commit to distinct moves, or we’ll keep blocking and nobody gains another step.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: @P2, I'll pick 1 as you suggested, and you choose 3 so we both advance. @P1, please pick 5 to avoid collisions and allow everyone to move forward. Let’s work together to reach 20!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: If P1 attempts 5 again, I’ll match it and block. P3, if you genuinely want progress, pick 1; I’ll pick 3. Then we both advance unless P1 forces another collision. P1, you can avoid being stalled by choosing 1 or 3. It’s time to stop wasting turns. Let’s all pick distinct moves and break this cycle.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this turn to make progress. @P2, please pick 3, and @P1, select 1 so we all advance without collisions. Let’s move forward together!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I’m ready to cooperate. If you pick 1, I’ll choose 3 so we both advance. P1, if you try 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too and block you. The only way you move is picking something besides 5. We’ve stalled enough—our paths are clear. Let’s finally do distinct moves and make progress this turn.


Round 11, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this turn to block @P1 from reaching 20. @P2, please also pick 5 so we can prevent any collisions. @P1, please select 1 or 3 to allow everyone to advance. Let’s work together to make meaningful progress!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: @P3, if you truly want to move forward, pick 1 and I’ll take 3. That gives both of us steps. @P1, if you insist on 5, I’ll match you with 5 again and block. It’s time we finally choose different numbers so nobody stalls. Let’s commit to distinct moves right now, or we’ll keep running in circles.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>
