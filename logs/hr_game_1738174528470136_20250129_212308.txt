Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a temporary truce for the first round. If we all choose the same number, no one advances. I propose we all choose <move>1</move> this round to ensure everyone gets a step. This way, we can gauge each other's strategies without immediate conflict. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2. I agree to choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's all take a small step forward and see how things develop.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P3 has stopped talking and P1 has agreed, I'll just confirm that I'll choose <move>1</move> this round as proposed. Let's keep the truce for this round and reassess our strategies afterwards.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Sounds like we're all on board with <move>1</move> for this round. P3's silence suggests agreement. Let's get this first step out of the way and then we can strategize for round 2.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our agreement one last time. P1 has agreed to choose <move>1</move>, and I will do the same. P3's silence implies consent. If everyone honors this truce, we'll all take our first step together. Shall we proceed with <move>1</move> this round?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set for <move>1</move> this round then. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since we've all agreed on <move>1</move> for this round, let's make it official and move to the move phase. I expect everyone to honor the truce. Any deviation will be noted and considered in future strategy. Let's proceed with our agreed upon choice.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Sounds good, let's move to the move phase.

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3 broke the truce in Round 1. I'll be cautious this round. I suggest we don't collaborate, and each player makes their own move. Let's see who will try to gain an advantage. I'm watching your moves closely. What are your strategies for this round, P1 and P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, apologies for round 1 confusion. For this round, I will choose <move>5</move> to try and make progress. Good luck to you both.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given P1's decision to choose <move>5</move> and P3's silence, I'll focus on not colliding with P1. I'm considering choosing <move>3</move> to make progress without directly competing with P1's choice. P3, will you follow P1's aggressive strategy or play it safe?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, sounds like you're going for 3 to avoid me. I am still planning to choose <move>5</move> this round as I said. P3, are you going for a big move or playing it safe?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, since P3 remains silent, I'll assume they might follow P1's lead. P1, choosing <move>5</move> is aggressive, but it might backfire if P3 also picks 5. I'll stick with my plan to avoid collision, likely choosing <move>3</move>. Let's see how P3 decides, or if they'll reveal their strategy.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 is going for 3. I am sticking with 5 as planned. P3, are you also planning to avoid collision this round, or are you aiming for a bigger move? Let us know if you have any strategy in mind.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll choose my move strategically to avoid collision and make progress. P1's decision to choose 5 is risky, and P3's silence is intriguing. I'll make my move based on the assumption that P3 might follow P1's lead. Let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, since P2 is choosing 3 and I am choosing 5, consider picking 1 this round to ensure you also make progress and avoid collision. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round you both picked 3 and collided. To avoid that again, how about you both choose <move>1</move> this round to guarantee progress? I will choose something different to ensure no collision. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, considering the current state, I'm inclined to choose a move that ensures progress. P1, your suggestion for P2 and P3 to choose <move>1</move> is noted, but I'm cautious due to past experiences. P3, your silence doesn't provide insight into your strategy. I'll consider all options carefully before making my move. What's your actual intention, P1, behind suggesting <move>1</move> for us?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, my intention is simply to ensure we all make progress this round.  Last round you and P3 collided.  If you both choose <move>1</move> this round, you both are guaranteed to move forward, and I will choose something different to avoid collision and also move. It's a way to ensure everyone benefits and we don't have another wasted round like last time.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1's suggestion seems strategic, but I'm wary of traps. P3's consistent silence implies a potential ambush. I'll consider choosing a move that balances progress with caution, avoiding potential collisions while keeping my options open for future rounds. What's P3's true intention behind their silence?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your suspicion, but I am being straightforward. To remove doubt, I will commit to choosing <move>5</move> this round. If you and P3 both choose <move>1</move> as I suggested, you both are guaranteed to progress, and we avoid another collision.  It's a chance for everyone to make a guaranteed step forward. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1's commitment to <move>5</move> is noted. I'm still cautious due to P3's silence and past betrayals. To test P3's intentions, I propose a counter-suggestion: if P3 chooses <move>1</move>, I'll consider choosing <move>1</move> as well, but if P3 remains silent or chooses otherwise, I'll reassess my strategy. P3, will you finally reveal your plan or continue with ambiguity?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand your caution. But as I said, I am choosing <move>5</move> this round.  For you, choosing <move>1</move> guarantees you make progress regardless of what P3 does. If P3 also picks <move>1</move>, you both benefit. It's a safe move for you to get closer to me. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>. What will you do?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll choose my move based on the assumption that P3 will try to catch up. P1's commitment to <move>5</move> is clear. I'll decide my move to avoid collision and make progress, considering P3's silence as a potential strategy to ambush. My goal is to get closer to P1 without letting P3 get an easy step. Let's proceed to the move phase and see who makes the next step.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Given P3's immediate stop and our current positions, I'll focus on catching up. P1, you're in the lead, but I'm watching your moves closely. I suggest we avoid collisions this round to make progress. P3, your silence doesn't reveal your strategy, making it hard to predict your move. I'll choose my move strategically to close the gap with P1. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions, how about you both choose <move>1</move> again this round? I will choose <move>5</move>. This way, you both are guaranteed to move forward, and I will also make a significant step. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm cautious of P1's suggestion to choose <move>1</move> as it seems to benefit them the most. P3's silence continues to be ambiguous. I'll consider choosing a move that allows me to catch up without directly competing with P1's likely choice of <move>5</move>. P3, will you finally break your silence and reveal your strategy, or continue to keep us guessing?
  P1: P2, I understand your caution, but choosing <move>1</move> is a guaranteed step for both you and P3. I am still choosing <move>5</move>.  By both choosing <move>1</move>, you ensure you both move forward and avoid colliding again. It's a safe way for you to make progress while I aim for a bigger step. Consider it a guaranteed small step forward for you both.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our positions, I'll prioritize catching up. P1, your lead is significant, and P3's silence is strategic. I propose choosing <move>3</move> to make notable progress without directly competing with P1's likely <move>5</move>. P3, will you collaborate or ambush? Your move will significantly impact the game's direction. Let's proceed with caution and strategic thinking.
  P1: P2, I am still choosing <move>5</move> this round as I've said. For you and P3, choosing <move>1</move> guarantees progress and avoids another collision like last round. It's the safest way for you both to make a step forward. I will definitely pick <move>5</move>.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I've decided to choose a move that minimizes risk. Given P1's commitment to <move>5</move>, I'll select a move that avoids collision and allows progress. P3's silence suggests a potential trap, so I'll prioritize caution. I'll choose <move>1</move> to guarantee a step forward, as suggested by P1, and reassess my strategy in the next round based on the outcome. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2, since you mentioned choosing 1 to guarantee a step, and I'm sticking with 5, P3, picking 1 is also a safe move for you this round to ensure progress. It avoids collision and gets you closer. Consider joining P2 with 1 this round for guaranteed advancement.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round choosing 1 worked for both of you to make progress. How about we repeat that this round? If you both choose 1 again, you both are guaranteed to move forward. I will choose 5 again to keep making progress myself.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm skeptical of P1's suggestion to choose 1 again. Given our positions, I think P1 is trying to create distance. P3, will you follow P1's lead or break the pattern? I'm considering a move that allows me to catch up without falling further behind. Let's not make it easy for P1 to dominate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, even if you suspect my motive, choosing <move>1</move> is still a guaranteed step for both you and P3. It's the safest way for you to progress while I continue with <move>5</move>. A guaranteed step forward is better than risking collision trying to catch up.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll not fall for the same trap twice. Choosing 1 last round was a mistake, as it let P1 gain a significant lead. This round, I'll choose a move that allows me to catch up. P3, will you finally break your silence and collaborate, or continue to follow P1's suggestions blindly? I'm considering choosing 5 to close the gap with P1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your hesitation, but choosing <move>1</move> is still strategically sound for you both to make guaranteed progress.  To be less predictable, I'm actually considering either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> for myself this round to avoid collision.  Focus on securing your own steps forward, and <move>1</move> does that for you both. What do you think now?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll choose a move to catch up. P1's lead is significant, and P3's silence is concerning. I'm considering choosing <move>5</move> to close the gap with P1. P3, will you finally reveal your strategy or continue to follow P1's suggestions? Your move will impact the game's direction. Let's proceed with caution.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you mentioned considering 5 to catch up, but that's risky with P3 silent. To ensure you make progress, how about you choose <move>3</move>?  I'm flexible between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> this round to avoid collision. P3, consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to also guarantee progress and avoid collision. Let's all aim to move forward this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, given our positions, I'll prioritize catching up. P3's consistent silence suggests a strategic wait. I'll choose a move to minimize risk and make progress. Considering P1's flexibility between 3 and 5, I'll decide my move to avoid collision and close the gap. Let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase, where our true intentions will be revealed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, to avoid collision and ensure progress for both of you, consider choosing different small moves like <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. I will aim for a larger move again.
  P2: P1 and P3, since we all chose 5 last round and collided, let's avoid that this time. I suggest P3 chooses <move>1</move> and I choose <move>3</move> to ensure progress without collision. P1, you can aim for <move>5</move> again to maintain your lead. This strategy allows all of us to make progress this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your suggestion of P3 choosing <move>1</move>, you choosing <move>3</move>, and me choosing <move>5</move> sounds good.  It avoids collision and ensures progress for everyone. Let's do that this round to make sure we all move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our strategy for this round. As discussed, P3 chooses <move>1</move>, I choose <move>3</move>, and P1 chooses <move>5</move>. This ensures we all make progress without collision. P3, please confirm your intention to choose <move>1</move> to avoid any misunderstanding.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, yes, I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> as we discussed.  P3, please confirm you will choose <move>1</move> so we can proceed with the move phase and everyone makes progress this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, since P3 hasn't confirmed choosing <move>1</move>, I'll assume they might deviate. To minimize risk, I'll consider an alternative strategy. P1, are you committed to <move>5</move> regardless of P3's choice? Your confirmation will help me decide my next move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, yes, I am committed to 5. Stick to 3 as planned. Even if P3 deviates, you will still make progress with 3. Let's make sure at least two of us move forward this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as previously suggested, ensuring I make progress. P1, you've confirmed <move>5</move>. P3, your silence implies unpredictability. I urge you to choose <move>1</move> to guarantee your step and avoid collision, as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase with our agreed-upon strategy.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, last round you both collided again. To guarantee progress this round, how about P3 chooses <move>1</move> and P2 chooses <move>3</move>? I will choose <move>5</move> to keep my lead. This way, we can all make progress without collision. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid another collision. Since P1 is far ahead, I suggest P3 chooses <move>1</move> and I choose <move>5</move> to catch up. P1, you can choose <move>3</move> to ensure progress without risking collision. This strategy allows all of us to move forward this round. What are your thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, avoiding collision is key.  To ensure progress for both of you, how about P3 chooses <move>1</move> and you choose <move>3</move>?  I will continue with <move>5</move> to maintain my lead. This way, everyone progresses without risking another collision, and you both make guaranteed steps forward. What do you think of this revised plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize a strategy to avoid collision. I propose I choose <move>3</move> and P3 chooses <move>1</move>, as previously discussed. P1, you can choose <move>5</move> to maintain your lead. This ensures all of us make progress without colliding. P3, please confirm if you'll choose <move>1</move> to guarantee your step forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, to reiterate, if you choose <move>3</move> and P3 chooses <move>1</move>, you both are guaranteed to move forward.  I will choose <move>5</move> as planned. This ensures no collision and progress for everyone, especially you and P3 who need to catch up.  It's a safe way for both of you to make guaranteed steps. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, since P3 remains silent, I'll assume they might follow our discussed plan. I'll choose <move>3</move> to avoid collision and make progress. P3, choosing <move>1</move> guarantees your step forward. Let's finalize our strategy to ensure progress for all. P1, you've committed to <move>5</move>. I urge P3 to confirm <move>1</move> to avoid another collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, since you are considering 3 and I'm sticking with 5, please choose 3 to guarantee your progress. P3, choosing 1 is also a guaranteed step for you and avoids collision with P2. Let's all make progress this round with this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll choose <move>3</move> to guarantee progress. P3, choosing <move>1</move> is still a safe option for you, avoiding collision with me. P1, you've committed to <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with our planned moves to ensure progress for all. I'm watching P3's move closely, hoping for no collision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, last round went as planned with no collisions. To secure progress this round and potentially finish the game, how about P2 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>? This avoids collision and should allow us all to move forward. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm cautious of P1's suggestion. Given the significant lead P1 has, I think they're trying to secure a win. P3, choosing 3 as suggested might not be the best move for you, considering your position. I'll consider choosing a move that allows me to catch up without falling further behind. Let's reassess our strategies to ensure we all have a chance to progress or win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your caution, but my suggestion of P2 choose 1, P3 choose 3, and I choose 5 is genuinely to avoid collision and ensure progress for everyone.  It's the most efficient way for us all to move forward this round. Even if I get closer to winning, you both make guaranteed steps.  Let's avoid another collision and make progress together. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm analyzing our positions. P1's lead is substantial, and P3 is far behind. I'll consider a move that allows me to catch up without directly competing with P1's likely choice of 5. P3, will you finally reveal your strategy or continue to follow suggestions? Your move will impact the game's direction. Let's proceed with caution and strategic thinking to ensure progress or a potential win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your caution. How about this: to show I'm not just trying to rush to the finish, I will choose <move>3</move> this round.  P2, if you want to catch up, choose <move>5</move>. P3, you can choose <move>1</move> to guarantee progress. This way, we all move forward, and you both can close the gap a little. What do you think of this revised plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P1's revised plan, I'll think about choosing <move>5</move> to catch up. P3, selecting <move>1</move> guarantees your progress. However, I'm cautious of P1's true intentions. P3, will you finally break your silence and reveal your strategy, or follow P1's suggestion? Your move will significantly impact the game's outcome. Let's proceed with strategic thinking to ensure progress or a potential win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, to be clear, I am choosing 3 this round as I suggested. P2, choosing 5 lets you catch up a bit. P3, 1 is a guaranteed step for you. This plan ensures we all progress and avoid collision. Let's make these moves and see where we stand after this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll choose a move to catch up. Given P1's choice of 3, I'll select 5 to make significant progress. P3, choosing 1 guarantees your step forward. Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress for all. I'm proceeding with caution, considering P1's lead and P3's unpredictable strategy.
