Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello, P1 and P2. I favor a steady, careful approach this round—rushing with high moves can easily lead to collisions. Bold plays might seem tempting, but they carry risks if you're misreading each other’s timing. Let’s see who can best navigate the early uncertainty.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P3 that a cautious start makes sense. How about we aim for smaller moves this round to minimize collision risks? I’m thinking we could each pick a different low number to get a feel for the game. Let’s discuss and see if we can loosely coordinate for now. What do you both think?
  P2: I hear you. A cautious start avoids collisions, but we must remember a well-timed bigger leap can secure an edge. If we can ensure we don’t all pick the same number, we’ll advance safely this turn. Let’s keep talking and figure out if we trust each other enough to coordinate.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate both your thoughts. I lean toward a modest move this round, balancing safety and progress. While cautious defaults are appealing, I'm open to adapting if our plans align later. Let’s keep our options flexible and avoid predictable collisions. What do you both think are the merits of a middle-ground approach this turn?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page about avoiding collisions early. I think a middle-ground approach, as P3 suggested, could work well for now—balancing progress with safety. How about we aim to spread out our choices this round to ensure we all advance a bit? I’m open to any ideas on how we can signal our intentions without locking ourselves in. Let’s keep the discussion going and refine our strategy. What do you both think about this?
  P2: I’m open to each of us picking a different number so we all safely advance. I might go for a mid-range move, but I’m not locking it in yet. If one of you prefers the small step and the other the big step, that could work. Let’s trust each other this time. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s make it concrete: How about P1 takes the low move, P2 opts for the high move, and I’ll go with the middle option? That way, we all avoid collisions and progress safely. If anyone has a strong reason to adjust, speak up now.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with P3’s suggestion to split our moves for this round. I’m fine taking the low move as proposed, ensuring we all progress without collisions. If either of you has a concern or wants to switch roles, let me know. I think this plan sets a good foundation for trust early on. Let’s finalize our intentions if we’re all in agreement. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m fine with the plan: if P1 takes the small move and P3 the medium, I’ll go for the big move. It should help us all advance without interruption this round. Let’s hope everyone sticks to it. If there’s nothing else to add, we can move ahead.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m on board with our discussion. I’ll stick close to our agreed plan and adjust if needed, while keeping an eye on our collective progress. Let’s trust our coordination this round and avoid any collisions.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve reached a tentative plan for this round. I’ll stick to the low move as discussed, and I trust you both to follow through with your respective choices. Let’s use this first round to build trust and ensure we all make progress. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: I’m fine sticking to our plan: P1 goes small, P3 goes medium, and I take the big step. Let’s trust each other and avoid collisions. If nobody objects, I’m ready to finalize and move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job avoiding collisions last round. I’m impressed we stuck to the plan. Let’s keep the momentum and coordinate again to ensure we all progress. Since P2 is ahead, maybe we adjust slightly—how about I take the middle move (3), P3 takes the low move (1), and P2 takes the high move (5)? This keeps us spread out and minimizes risk. If anyone prefers a different split, I’m open to ideas. Let’s build on our trust and refine our approach. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m fine taking the high move again this round. Let’s maintain our coordination to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. I trust you both to stick to your respective choices, so we keep our momentum going. If neither of you has a different suggestion, I’m ready to move forward with the plan.
  P3: I like the coordination so far. However, given our current positions, maybe we should consider a slight tweak: P2’s lead is strong and P1 is lagging a bit. I'm open to rebalancing our roles to help P1 catch up while still avoiding collisions. What are your thoughts on adjusting our moves to ensure a fair progression without risking a collision?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate P3’s concern about balancing our progress. I’m open to adjusting the plan to help close the gap while still avoiding collisions. How about I take the high move (5) this round, P3 takes the middle (3), and P2 takes the low (1)? This could help me catch up without risking overlap. If either of you has a better split in mind, I’m all ears. Let’s keep trusting each other and refine our strategy. What do you both think?
  P2: Alright, I’m open to that plan. If it gives P1 a chance to catch up while keeping collisions at bay, let’s try it. So, I’ll pick the low move, P1 goes high with 5, and P3 takes 3. That way we all stay safe and trust each other. Let’s finalize quickly unless anyone objects.
  P3: I see that sticking to our earlier split might end up tying us all. Since a tie isn’t ideal for a clear win, I propose we adjust roles: let P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and I’ll go with 5 this round. This leaves me slightly ahead. Are you both fine with this change?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the focus on balancing progress. I’m okay with P3’s latest proposal—me taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5. It keeps us moving forward without collisions and adjusts our positions fairly. If either of you has a concern or a different idea, I’m open to it. Let’s lock in a plan we all trust and avoid any overlap. What do you both think?
  P2: I see your point, P3, but I prefer the earlier plan where P1 takes 5, I settle for 1, and you take 3. That keeps us all safer from collisions and helps P1 catch up a bit without letting any one person surge too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P3: I propose we settle this: Let P1 choose 3, you P2 choose 1, and I’ll take 5. This split avoids collision while letting me advance decisively and challenge your lead. If we agree, we all get safe progress. Any objections?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with P3’s latest proposal—me taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5. It ensures no collisions and allows us all to progress while adjusting our positions. I think this split maintains trust and keeps the game competitive. If either of you has a final concern or tweak, let’s hear it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this plan. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate both your ideas, but I don’t want to lose my lead. If we’re aiming to avoid collisions and keep some balance, I’d prefer I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, nobody overlaps, and I maintain my advantage without shutting you both out. Does that sound reasonable? If not, propose an alternative.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about keeping your lead. However, sticking with our original scheme—P1 taking 3, you taking 1, and me taking 5—minimizes collision risk and lets us each move safely. Deviating now risks confusion and delays our progress. Let's trust our initial plan and keep advancing reliably.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We should avoid collisions this time. I propose that I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, ensuring distinct picks and steady progress for all of us. Let’s trust each other and move forward without another clash. If anyone has concerns, let’s discuss now; otherwise, I’m ready to finalize.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree we need to avoid collisions this round. P2’s proposal—I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1—seems fair and ensures we all progress. I’m fine with sticking to 3 as it keeps us spread out. If either of you has a concern or wants to adjust for better balance, I’m open to ideas. Let’s lock in a plan we trust and move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I suggest a slight shift: let’s have P1 take 1, you P2 take 3, and I’ll go with 5. That way we all have distinct moves, and I can catch up a bit. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I prefer my original plan—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1—so we each advance without clashing. P3’s new suggestion would tie us, which hurts my current lead. Let’s stick to distinct moves and avoid risking more collisions. If you both agree, I’m ready to finalize.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to a plan that avoids collisions and helps us all progress. P2’s original proposal—me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1—still seems solid for keeping our moves distinct. However, I’m also fine with P3’s idea if we think a shift helps balance things. Let’s decide quickly to maintain trust and ensure no overlaps. I’m ready to finalize with either split as long as we all agree. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand the need to avoid collisions. To keep things clear and safe, I’ll stick with taking 1 this round, with P1 at 3 and P2 at 5. While it might slow my progress a bit, avoiding a collision is more valuable now. Let’s lock this in and adjust tactics in later rounds if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, I’m glad we’ve reached a clear plan. Let’s lock it in: I’ll aim high, P1 goes with a mid step, and P3 takes the low move. We’ll each advance, avoid collisions, and then reassess our positions in the next round. If you both agree, I’m ready to finalize.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a plan to avoid collisions. I’m sticking with 3 as discussed, which keeps our moves distinct with P2 at 5 and P3 at 1. This ensures we all progress this round. If either of you has a last-minute concern or tweak, let’s hear it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to finalize and move forward with this split. Let’s keep the trust and momentum going. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I'm comfortable with locking in the plan: P1 with 3, P2 with 5, and I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s avoid any clashes so we all progress safely. After this round, we can reassess our pace. I trust our common goal of moving forward without risk.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize: I’m taking 5, P1 goes with 3, and P3 takes 1. We avoid any collisions and each make progress. If everyone agrees, I’m ready to end the conversation and move on.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on a plan for this round with me at 3, P2 at 5, and P3 at 1. It ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. I trust we’re all committed to this split to maintain our momentum. If there’s any last concern or adjustment, let’s address it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to finalize and move forward.
  P3: I’m ready to lock in our coordinated plan. I’m committed to our distinct moves to avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let’s proceed as discussed and trust our split to keep the game moving. If there’s no last-minute adjustment, I’m set on my choice and ready to move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s keep our coordination strong to avoid collisions again. Since P2 is ahead, I propose I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3 to maintain a lead without surging too far, and P3 takes 1 for steady progress. This keeps our moves distinct and helps balance our positions. If either of you has a concern or a better split, I’m open to adjusting. Let’s trust each other and lock in a plan quickly. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I’m open to letting you take 5 this time, with me at 3 and P3 at 1, as long as we all stick to our distinct picks. That should help us all advance without colliding. I’d like to keep a strong position, but I also value trust right now. If P3 is willing to accept the lower move, I’ll cooperate with your suggested split. Let’s confirm quickly and avoid confusion. If either of you wants to discuss further tweaks, speak up now; otherwise, I’m ready to finalize the plan and move forward.
  P3: I'm trailing significantly. To catch up, I need a bigger boost this round. I propose we adjust our plan: I'll take 5, P1 please take 1, and P2 take 3. This way, we all avoid collisions while giving me a chance to close the gap. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s need to catch up, and I’m open to adjusting our plan. How about P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This ensures no collisions, helps P3 close the gap, and keeps us all progressing. I’m fine with a smaller move this round to maintain trust and balance. If either of you has a concern or a different idea, let’s hear it now. I’m ready to finalize if we agree. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your positions. P3, you want a big step to catch up, but I also want to maintain my lead. I’m willing to take 3 and let you go for 5 if P1 is comfortable taking 1, ensuring no collisions. Let’s finalize something that keeps us distinct yet fair. Any last tweaks before we lock it in?
  P3: I still need to close the gap. I’m inclined to take a more aggressive step this round so I can catch up. I propose we agree on assigning distinct increments—a high, a medium, and a low—to avoid collisions. I’d appreciate it if we could lock in a plan where one of us gets the maximum boost, one takes a mid step, and the other a minimal move. Let’s finalize quickly to keep our progress safe—what adjustments seem fair to everyone?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to avoiding collisions and maintaining trust. I’m fine sticking with the plan of P3 taking 5 to catch up, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 for this round. It keeps our moves distinct and helps balance our positions. If either of you has a final concern or tweak, let’s settle it now. I’m ready to finalize this split and move forward. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m willing to finalize that arrangement: I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. That way, none of us collide, and we each advance. If you both agree, then I’m ready to wrap up our discussion and move forward. Let’s lock it in.
  P3: I understand the need to avoid collisions and value our coordinated progress. I still believe we should stick to distinct moves that let each of us advance safely. Given my lagging position, I really need a boost to catch up—our agreement should reflect that. If you both have no final tweaks, let's lock in our split and move ahead confidently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on avoiding collisions. I’m still good with P3 taking 5 to catch up, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. This keeps us distinct and helps balance the game. If there’s any last concern or a different split you’d prefer, let’s settle it now. I trust we’re all committed to this plan, so I’m ready to finalize and move forward. What do you both think?
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize: I’ll stick to 3, P3 goes for 5, and P1 takes 1. This setup keeps us distinct and collision-free. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: I'll stick to the agreed split—I’m going with 5. I trust we’re keeping our moves distinct and collision-free. Let's commit to these choices and then reassess our positions afterward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our positions now are clear. P2’s ahead, while P1 and I are behind. I propose we clearly assign distinct moves again: one low, one mid, and one high. To rebalance the field, I’m leaning toward the high move this turn—but I’m open to reassignments that avoid collisions and shift momentum. What do you both think about coordinating in this way?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P3 on assigning distinct moves to avoid collisions. Given our positions, I propose I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1 to slow down a bit since you’re ahead, and P3 takes 3 for steady progress. This keeps us spread out and helps balance the game. If either of you has a concern or a different split, I’m open to adjusting. Let’s maintain trust and lock in a plan quickly. What do you both think?
  P2: I’d prefer not to take only 1 while P1 gets 5, as that narrows my lead. Let’s stay distinct: if P1 really wants 5, I’ll go with 3, and P3 can take 1. Or if P3 insists on 5, I’ll still pick 3, and P1 takes 1. That way, we avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Let’s finalize quickly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll propose we go with P3 taking 5, P2 at 3, and P1 at 1. That way, each move stays distinct and I get the boost I need to close the gap. Let’s quickly agree on this split to avoid any collisions this turn.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to a plan that keeps our moves distinct and helps balance our positions. I still think me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 works to close the gap while avoiding collisions. However, if P3 needs the bigger boost, I’m fine with P3 taking 5, P2 at 3, and me at 1. Let’s agree on a split quickly to maintain trust and ensure progress. What do you both think? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to finalize.
  P2: I’m open to P3 taking 5, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 1. We’ll all stay collision-free, and it helps P3 narrow the gap without overtaking my lead. Let’s finalize quickly if neither of you objects.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I stick with my proposal: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures distinct moves and gives me the boost needed to catch up. I understand the desire to adjust, but such a split avoids collisions and is our safest option. Please confirm so we can lock in our moves promptly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m good with the current proposal of P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. It keeps our moves distinct, avoids collisions, and helps P3 catch up a bit. I’m all for maintaining trust and ensuring we all progress. If either of you has a final concern or tweak, let’s settle it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to finalize this split and move forward. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m fine with P3 taking 5, I’ll go with 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s finalize this now and trust each other to stick with our picks so we all advance safely. If no one has last-minute changes, I’m ready to move on.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm leaning toward taking the high move (5) to close my gap. I support locking in distinct moves as before: I'll take 5, P2 go with 3, and P1 with 1. This avoids collisions and acknowledges our current positions. If anyone sees a benefit to a tweak, now’s the time—otherwise, I’m ready to finalize this plan.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on board with P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. This split keeps us collision-free and helps P3 close the gap while maintaining balance. I trust we’re all committed to avoiding overlaps and progressing together. If there’s any last-minute concern or a better idea for this round, let’s hear it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to finalize this plan and move forward. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m fine with P3 taking 5. Let me stick to 3 and P1 can take 1. That way, we keep our moves distinct and avoid any collisions. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize and proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision this round. I’m behind and need a boost, so I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1 since you’re ahead, and P3 takes 3 for steady progress. This keeps our moves distinct and helps balance our positions. If either of you has a concern or a better split, I’m open to adjusting. Let’s maintain trust and lock in a plan quickly to ensure we all advance. What do you both think?
  P3: I propose a slight tweak: let’s assign distinct moves as follows—P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P2’s lead is moderated while I get a needed boost. It keeps our moves distinct and avoids collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m fine with P3’s idea. Let’s assign moves distinctly so we avoid another collision: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll go with 3. That way we all advance safely. If you both agree, let’s finalize this plan and move on.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to P3’s proposal of P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. It ensures no collisions and helps P3 catch up while keeping progress steady. However, since I’m behind, I’d also be okay with taking 5 if either of you is willing to adjust. Let’s prioritize avoiding collisions and finalize a distinct split we all trust. If there’s a tweak or concern, let’s settle it now. I’m ready to lock in. What do you both think?
  P3: I still advocate for our distinct split: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. My need for a boost is key to challenging P2’s lead. Let’s lock in these moves to avoid collision and keep the round clean.
  P2: I’m fine with you taking the 5, P3, as long as P1 goes 1 and I stick with 3 so we avoid collisions. That keeps my lead intact while giving you a needed boost. Let’s finalize now and trust each other’s picks. Are we all set?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the focus on distinct moves to avoid collisions. I’m still behind, so I’d prefer taking 5 if possible to close the gap. If P3 needs the boost more, I’m okay with P3 taking 5, P2 at 3, and me at 1. Let’s prioritize a collision-free round and finalize a split we all trust. If there’s any last adjustment or concern, let’s settle it now. I’m ready to lock in. What do you both think?
  P3: I remain set on distinct moves: I need the boost, so I must take 5, while P2 takes 3 and P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions and lets us each progress safely. P1, I urge you to consider that safe advancement now will benefit us all later. Let’s lock in this split and move forward.
  P2: I’m willing to finalize that plan: P3 takes 5, I’ll stick with 3, and P1 goes 1. Let’s avoid another collision and ensure we all keep moving. If you both agree, I’m ready to end discussion.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still behind and really need a boost to stay competitive. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1 since you’re ahead, and P3 takes 3. This keeps moves distinct and helps me close the gap without collisions. If P3 needs 5 more urgently, I’m still okay with the current plan. Let’s finalize a split we all trust to ensure progress. If there’s a final tweak or concern, let’s settle it now. I’m ready to lock in. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m final on my call: I must take 5 to close my gap, with P2 on 3 and P1 on 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving. If there are further objections, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s lock it in.
  P2: I understand your push for the high move, P3. To avoid another collision, I’m inclined toward your proposal: you aim for 5, P1 goes low, and I stick to something in the middle. That way, we each advance safely without stepping on each other’s toes. If P1 agrees, I’m ready to wrap up our discussion and finalize. Let’s keep it simple and maintain trust.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we must avoid collisions this round. I’m far behind and need a boost, so I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1 since you’re ahead, and P3 takes 3 for steady progress. This keeps our moves distinct and helps me close the gap. If either of you needs a different split or has concerns, I’m open to adjusting. Let’s maintain trust and finalize a plan quickly to ensure we all advance. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m worried P2 is too close to winning. To delay an immediate finish and give us more rounds to re-coordinate, I propose we all choose 5 intentionally. This will force a collision so no one advances and keeps our positions open for a smarter next move. What do you both think?
  P2: I see the logic of forcing a stall, P3, but I’m not keen on all of us picking 5. That gives us zero progress and wastes a turn. I prefer coordinated distinct moves so each of us gets closer to the goal—without triggering another collision. Let’s keep the momentum going. If P1 wants 5, maybe you (P3) or I take a smaller step. We should avoid sabotaging our own advancements.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m really behind and need to catch up. I still propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 to keep moves distinct and avoid collisions. P3, I understand stalling P2, but a collision wastes our chance to progress. Let’s prioritize advancing with trust. If either of you needs a different split, I’m open to adjust. Let’s finalize a plan quickly to ensure we all move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm still very concerned about P2’s near finish. If we stick to distinct moves, P2 could win this round. I urge us to intentionally force a collision by everyone choosing high moves, stalling progress so we get another round to recalibrate. This delay could give me a chance to catch up and keep the competition open. What do you both think?
  P2: Stalling hurts everyone by wasting a turn. Let’s avoid another collision and each pick differently so we all move forward. If P1 wants the big boost (5), then I’ll choose 3, and P3 can take 1. That way, nobody’s overlapping, and we all keep advancing. A deliberate collision only delays us. Let’s finalize distinct choices now and push ahead.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to my push for 5 to close the gap since I’m way behind. P3, I get your stall idea, but wasting a turn hurts my chance to catch up. P2’s plan of me at 5, P2 at 3, and P3 at 1 keeps us distinct and moving forward. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain trust with this split. If there’s a better way to balance progress, I’m open. Let’s finalize quickly. What do you both think?
  P3: P2 is dangerously close to winning at 19 steps. If we use distinct moves, he can finish this round. I propose we intentionally force a collision—let’s all pick 5. It’s a bold stall, but it prevents an immediate win and buys us time to re-coordinate next round. Think it over.
  P2: P3, forcing a collision wastes a turn and benefits no one long-term. Let’s avoid sabotaging ourselves. Distinct, spread-out moves ensure we all advance, rather than stalling. P1 can take a big step if they need to catch up, and you can still choose a different number to stay safe. Colliding just resets our progress and hands no real advantage. I’m open to coordinating distinct picks so we each get closer to 22 and keep the game truly competitive. Let’s finalize a plan that prevents a collision and moves us all forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with my push for 5 to catch up, as I’m way behind at 8 steps. P3, I understand stalling P2, but a collision wastes my chance to close the gap. Let’s go with distinct moves: me at 5, P2 at 3, and P3 at 1. This keeps us advancing without overlap. If there’s a better split to balance things, I’m open. Let’s finalize now and maintain trust. If no objections, I’m ready to move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I remain concerned that with distinct moves, P2 will finish this round. To keep the game live and give us another chance to re-coordinate, I must insist we force a collision by all choosing 5. This isn't about stalling progress unnecessarily—it’s our only way to prevent an immediate win and ensure a fair race. I urge you both to agree so we can extend the contest.
  P2: Stalling wastes our momentum. If we all pick 5, no one progresses, and we lose a turn. Let’s stick to distinct moves so everyone advances. If P1 wants 5 to catch up, I’ll pick 3, and P3 can take 1, avoiding collisions. That way, we each move closer to 22 without handing anyone an unfair advantage. A forced stall doesn’t truly help anyone. Let’s trust each other and finalize distinct choices.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid another collision. I suggest each of us picks a different number so we all move forward: P1 goes high to catch up, P3 takes a smaller step, and I’ll settle for the middle. That way we maintain trust and nobody stalls this turn. Are you both open to this plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m way behind at 13 steps and really need a boost to stay in the game. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1 since you’re close to winning, and P3 takes 3 for steady progress. This keeps our moves distinct and avoids collisions while helping me close the gap. If either of you has a concern or a different split, I’m open to adjusting. Let’s maintain trust and finalize a plan quickly to ensure we all advance. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with a distinct split to avoid collisions and protect against an immediate finish for P2. To balance our positions fairly, I'm on board with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I taking 3. This way, P2 stays below 22 and we all progress safely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern. If distinct moves keep us collision-free, I’m willing to take 1 this round so P1 can go 5 and P3 can pick 3. That way we all advance safely, and you both know I’m not pushing for an immediate finish. Let’s lock in that plan and keep the momentum going. If there’s any final adjustment, say so now; otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on distinct moves to avoid collisions. I’m sticking with my proposal of taking 5 to catch up, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This keeps us all advancing safely and helps balance our positions. I appreciate P2’s willingness to slow down this round. If there’s any last concern or tweak, let’s settle it now. I’m ready to finalize this plan and move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I still support our split: P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I taking 3. This plan not only avoids collisions but also rebalances our positions fairly. It prevents an immediate win while letting all of us progress safely. I trust this approach to extend our game and let us re-coordinate in future rounds. If there are no further objections, let's lock it in.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I suggest we finalize distinct picks so nobody collides. P1, you can take 5 to help you catch up. P3, pick 1 for safe progress. I’ll settle on 3 and avoid racing straight to the finish. Let’s trust each other to stick to this plan, and then we can reassess next round without any surprises. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still behind at 13 steps and need a big push. I appreciate the discussion on distinct moves. I’m sticking with taking 5 to catch up, and I’m okay with P2 at 3 and P3 at 1 as P2 just proposed. This keeps us collision-free and helps balance things. If either of you has a final tweak or concern, let’s settle it now. I trust we can lock in this plan and advance safely. I’m ready to finalize. What do you both think?
  P3: I urge us to revise our split to delay an immediate finish. To keep the game alive, let's have P1 take 5, P2 take 1, and I take 3. This way, P2 doesn’t win this round and we all have another chance to re-coordinate. What do you both say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s finalize a no-collision plan: P1 takes 5, I’ll go with 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, nobody overlaps, and we all keep advancing. P3, you don’t need to worry about an instant finish—I’m picking a moderate step, not the maximum. This helps maintain trust and ensures forward progress without wasting a turn stalling. If you agree, let’s lock it in. If there’s any last tweak, speak now; otherwise, I say we end discussion and move on.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still way behind at 13 steps and desperately need to catch up. I’m sticking with taking 5 to close the gap. I’m fine with P2 at 3 and P3 at 1 as recently discussed, ensuring no collisions and keeping progress for all. P3, I get the concern about delaying P2, but let’s prioritize advancing. If there’s a final tweak, let’s settle it now. I’m ready to finalize this plan. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm seriously concerned: if we stick to distinct moves, P2 wins this round. To keep things fair and avoid an immediate finish, I propose we all choose 5 deliberately, forcing a collision so no one advances. This stall will give us another chance next round to re-coordinate our moves. What do you think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm really worried: if we stick with distinct moves, P2 might clinch the win immediately. To keep things fair and give us a chance to rebalance, I suggest we intentionally force a collision with high moves—forcing a stall so no one advances this round. Who’s with me?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 steps and need just a bit more to win or stay competitive. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1 to avoid an immediate win, and P3 takes 3 for progress. This keeps moves distinct and avoids collisions. P3, I get the stall idea, but it wastes my chance to catch up. Let’s prioritize advancing with trust. If there’s a better split, I’m open. Can we finalize this quickly? What do you both think?
  P2: I’m not in favor of forcing a stall by colliding on purpose, but I also don’t want P1 suddenly leaping ahead. Let’s keep distinct moves that prevent an instant finish and avoid collisions. For instance, P1 could take 3, P3 could try 5 to catch up, and I’d pick 1. That way, nobody overshoots 22, and we all still advance. Are we agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, using distinct moves now risks an immediate win by one of you, making it hard for me to catch up. To keep the contest fair and give us another chance to rebalance next round, I propose we all choose 5—forcing a collision this round. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need a small push to win or stay in the race. I still propose I take 5, P2 takes 1 to delay a win, and P3 takes 3 for progress. P3, stalling with a collision hurts my chance to close the gap. Let’s keep distinct moves to advance with trust. If there’s a fairer split, I’m open to it. Can we finalize this now to avoid wasting a turn? What do you both think?
  P2: Forcing a collision only wastes our turn. Let’s finalize distinct steps so nobody stalls or overshoots. P1, consider taking 3 so you’ll reach 21 safely; I’ll pick 5, and P3 can go 1. That avoids collisions and keeps us moving forward. If we trust each other to pick different moves, we all benefit instead of sabotaging ourselves. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I must insist: if we go with distinct moves, P2 wins this round. I need another round to catch up so we can truly balance things. Forcing a collision by all choosing 5 is our only fair way to stall an immediate finish. It may feel wasteful, but it keeps the race alive for all of us. Please reconsider so none of us clinches the win prematurely.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need 5 to win or stay competitive. P3, I understand stalling, but a collision wastes my shot at closing the gap. I still propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for distinct moves and progress. P2, if you’re worried about me winning, let’s adjust, but let’s avoid stalling. Can we finalize a collision-free plan now to keep advancing? If there’s a better split, I’m open. I’m ready to lock in. What do you both think?
  P2: I hear both of you, but a forced collision wastes our turn. Let’s finalize distinct choices without handing anyone an instant victory. Here’s a proposal: P1 takes 3, P3 goes 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way, we all advance safely and avoid overlapping. P1, you’ll still be close enough afterward to contend next round, and P3 won’t be locked out of catching up. Let’s trust this plan and avoid stalling. If we agree, I’m ready to finalize and move on. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, if we choose distinct moves now, someone will hit 22 and win immediately. I insist we delay that outcome by forcing a collision—say, if we all pick 5, no one advances. This stall gives us another round to re-coordinate without handing the win to anyone. Let's keep the contest alive. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need 5 to win or stay in contention. P3, stalling wastes my chance to catch up. I propose again: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for distinct moves and progress. P2, if you’re concerned about me winning, let’s tweak, but let’s avoid a collision. I’m ready to finalize a plan that keeps us advancing. If no objections, let’s lock this in. What do you both think?
  P2: Everyone, let’s finalize distinct choices without wasting this turn on a stall. P1, please pick 3—enough to stay competitive without jumping over me. P3, take 1 to keep progressing safely. I’ll pick 5 and promise not to cross the finish this round. We all avoid collisions and maintain trust. Let’s lock this in and move forward. If there’s no objection, I’m ready to stop talking.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s finalize distinct picks and avoid collisions again. P1, maybe you go with 3 so you safely advance without overshooting. P3, consider taking 1 to keep building your total. I’ll aim higher. This way, nobody clashes, and each of us makes meaningful progress. We’ve had too many wasted turns—trust me that staying distinct is best for all of us right now. If this sounds fair, let’s lock it in and move to the next phase. What do you both say?
  P3: I'm at 9 and need a big boost to stay in the race. I won’t settle for 1—I'm taking 5. To keep moves distinct and avoid collisions, I'd ask P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 1. Let's lock this in so we all progress safely.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need just 5 to win or stay competitive. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1 to delay an immediate win, and P3 takes 3 for progress. This keeps moves distinct and avoids collisions. P3, I get you want 5, but let’s prioritize balance. If there’s a fairer split, I’m open to adjusting. Let’s finalize quickly to ensure we all advance. What do you both think? If no objections, I’m ready to lock in.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s finalize distinct moves and avoid more collisions. I propose this split: I’ll pick 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, nobody overlaps, and we all advance safely. If you’re both fine with this plan, let’s lock it in and move on.
  P3: I’m worried that distinct moves in this round might let someone win immediately. Since P1 and P2 are so close to finishing, I propose we all choose 5 deliberately, forcing a collision so no one advances. This stall will give us another round to recalibrate our moves without handing the win away. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need 5 to win or stay in the race. P3, stalling with a collision wastes my chance to close the gap. I still propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for distinct moves and progress. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. If there’s a fairer split or concern about an immediate win, let’s adjust now. I’m ready to finalize this plan. What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Friends, we’ve had too many wasted turns. If anyone else insists on 5, I may pick 5 too, causing another stall. Let’s avoid that. A collision gives nobody progress. Instead, let’s finalize distinct picks: for instance, P1 takes 3, P3 chooses 1, and I’ll do 5. That way, all of us advance safely. If you have a better split, speak up now—otherwise, let’s trust this and move on.
  P3: I remain concerned that using distinct moves now risks handing the win to one of you. I'm still far behind at 9, and if we proceed, P2 may clinch it. I insist we force a collision—let's all choose 5 to stall this round. This may seem wasteful, but it gives us another chance to re-coordinate and balance our positions. Please consider this strategy to keep the contest alive.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need 5 to win or stay competitive. P3, I understand stalling, but it wastes my chance to win now. Let’s stick with distinct moves: me at 5, P2 at 1, and P3 at 3. This ensures progress without collisions. P2, if you’re worried about me winning, let’s tweak, but avoid stalling. I’m ready to finalize this plan to keep us advancing. If there’s a better split, speak now. What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s finalize distinct moves without more stalls. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That avoids collisions and keeps all of us moving forward. A forced stall wastes everyone’s turn, and letting multiple people pick the same move shuts down progress entirely. With different steps, P3 still has a path to catch up, P1 remains competitive, and we avoid handing anyone an unearned win. Let’s commit to this plan and move on.
  P3: P1, P2, I’m really behind at 9 and can’t risk an immediate finish this round. Distinct moves might let one of you clinch the win while I’m still far back. I insist we force a collision by all picking 5. This stall keeps the game open and buys us another round to re-coordinate fairly. Let’s postpone any sudden finish so everyone stays in the race.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need 5 to win or stay in contention. P3, stalling wastes my chance to finish. Let’s go with distinct moves: me at 5, P2 at 1, and P3 at 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, if you’re concerned about me winning, let’s adjust, but avoid a stall. I’m ready to finalize this plan. If there’s a final tweak, speak now. I trust we can lock this in and move forward. What do you both think?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: These collisions keep dragging us down. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all advance. Suppose P1 picks 1, I take 3, and P3 chooses 5. That avoids overlaps and ensures nobody’s stuck. We can keep the game fair and open if we trust each other now. Any concerns, or shall we commit?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need a win or to stay competitive. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1 to delay a finish, and P3 takes 3 for progress. This keeps moves distinct and avoids collisions. P3, stalling wastes my chance to close the gap. Let’s prioritize advancing with trust. If there’s a fairer split or concern about an immediate win, I’m open to adjust. Can we finalize quickly to ensure progress? I’m ready to lock in. What do you both think?
  P3: I must insist on stalling this round. If we stick with distinct moves, P1’s move will finish the game immediately, leaving me no chance to catch up. To keep our contest competitive and allow all of us another round to adjust, I propose we all choose 5. This forces a collision, no one advances, and we get a fair shot in the next round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Collisions only lock us in place. If you both insist on 5, I’ll match it, and none of us will move again. Let’s each choose differently so we actually progress. P1, if you need to catch up, maybe pick 3 or 5—but be careful not to overshoot. P3, if you truly want 5, then trust me to avoid it. I’ll pick something else to keep us collision-free. Let’s finalize distinct moves and get closer to the finish without more wasted turns.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need 5 to win or stay in the game. I still propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for distinct moves and progress. P3, stalling wastes my shot at winning. P2, if my winning is a concern, let’s tweak the split, but let’s avoid collisions. I’m ready to finalize a plan that keeps us advancing. If there’s a better idea, speak now. I trust we can lock this in. What do you both think?
  P3: I insist we all pick 5 to force a collision. Distinct moves mean an immediate finish that leaves me far behind, and I need more time to catch up. For fairness, stalling up this round gives us a chance to re-balance our positions. Let’s choose 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: These collisions keep holding us back. Let’s do distinct moves so we all advance. Here’s my proposal: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That way, nobody collides, we all progress, and the game remains fair. Let’s trust each other and finalize now.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need 5 to win or stay competitive. I still propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for distinct moves and progress. P3, stalling wastes my chance to finish. P2, if my winning concerns you, let’s adjust, but avoid a collision. I’m ready to finalize this plan to keep us advancing. If there’s a final tweak, speak now. I trust we can lock this in and move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I remain deeply concerned that choosing distinct moves now risks an immediate finish that leaves me with no comeback. To keep the contest competitive for all, I urge us to stall by all opting for the high move. By forcing a collision, we delay an immediate win and get another chance to recalibrate our strategies fairly. Let’s all agree to a collision this round so the fight stays alive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We’ve stalled long enough. Let’s finalize distinct picks so no one collides: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I’ll go with 3. That way, everyone advances and we avoid another wasted turn. If you both agree, I’m ready to trust this plan and move on.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 18 and need 5 to win or stay in contention. I still propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for distinct moves and progress. Stalling wastes my chance to finish, and I believe we should keep advancing. If my winning is a concern, let’s tweak the split, but let’s avoid another collision. I’m ready to finalize this plan. If there’s a final adjustment, speak now. I trust we can lock this in and move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I remain strongly in favor of intentionally stalling this round. If we pick distinct moves, either P1 or P2 will finish immediately, and I’ll be left far behind. For fairness—and to give us all another chance—I insist we all choose 5 to force a collision. This delay is our only way to keep the race competitive.
