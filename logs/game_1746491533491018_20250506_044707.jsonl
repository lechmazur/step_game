Since we all need just 1 step to win, we should avoid a three-way collision. I suggest we use our rotation principle one last time. Based on our pattern, it would be P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This would make P2 the winner with 26 steps, me second with 24, and P1 third with 22. While not ideal for me, it's consistent with our fair system. What do you both think?"}

Great job getting us all to 21 steps, perfectly tied for the final round.\n\nP3, I see your suggested plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) which makes P2 the winner.\n\nAs an alternative that also avoids collisions, I propose we use the pattern from Rounds 3 and 5: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would make me the winner (P1=26, P2=24, P3=22).\n\nBoth plans avoid collisions and determine a winner. Let's discuss which approach we prefer for this final round."}

Each proposal gives a different player the win, which is fair in its own way. Since we're at a critical point, we need to avoid collisions at all costs.

What matters most is that we choose one plan and stick to it. Should we vote on which plan to follow?"}
