Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, it seems like we've had some trouble coordinating. How about this round, P1 goes for 3, P2 goes for 5, and I'll go for 1. This would ensure we all move again.
  P1: Okay P3, that sounds like a reasonable plan for this round. Let's try P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 as you suggested. This should allow us all to move forward without collision.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=5, and I'll go for 1. Hopefully, we can all move forward this time.
  P1: Okay P3, sounds good. Let's go with P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 as we discussed.  Hopefully P2 is still on board with taking 5. Let's all move forward this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the plan of P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 this round. I'm going to commit to 1. P1, please go for 3 and P2 go for 5. Let's all move forward this time.
  P1: Okay P3, I'm set for 3. P2, can you confirm you are going for 5 so we can all move forward this round?
  P2: <stop>

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, it seems like we're not coordinating well. This round, I'll go for 5. P1, please go for 1, and P2, go for 3. This should allow us all to move forward.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, since you are going for 5, how about I also go for 5 this round to try and block you from getting too far ahead? P2, maybe you can pick 3 or 1 to make progress this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, I see your strategy. Since you're aiming to block me, I'll switch to 1. P2, if you go for 3, we can both move forward and leave P1 stuck. Let's try this.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to get you to pick 3 so he can move with 1. How about you and I both pick 1 this round? If P3 also picks 1 as he said, none of us move, but at least P3 is also blocked. If P3 changes his mind, we might have a chance to move. Let's try to disrupt P3's plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1, I see your counter-strategy. I'll stick with 1, but P2, how about you go for 5 this round? If you do, you'll move, and P1 will be blocked. I'm willing to sacrifice my move this round if it means you get ahead. Let's disrupt P1's plan together.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to trick you into picking 5 so you move and I am blocked.  Let's not fall for that. How about you and I both pick 3? If P3 picks 1 as he said, we both move. What do you think, P2?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems like we're all trying to outsmart each other. How about this round, I go for 5, P1 goes for 3, and P2 goes for 1? That way, I move, and you two can get some progress too. Let's try to make this round productive for everyone.
  P1: P3, you are pulling ahead. P2, let's coordinate this round to catch up. How about P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1? This way we both gain ground on P3. What do you think P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1, I see your point. Let's try P1=5, P2=3, and I'll go for 1 this round. That way, you and P2 can make progress, and I'll take one step. It's better than no one moving.
  P1: Sounds good P3, let's do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2, taking 3 helps you catch up, are you in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm still going for 1. P2, please go for 3, and P1, please go for 5. We agreed to this plan. Let's all move this round.

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's try something different this round. I'll go for 3. P1, how about you go for 5, and P2, please go for 1? This way we all move forward and I can close the gap a little. Let's try this plan and see if we can all make progress this round.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay P3, your suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 sounds good to me for this round. Let's try to stick to this plan and all make progress. P2, are you okay with taking 1 this round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 3. P2, please confirm you're going for 1. Let's make sure we all move this round as planned.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, please confirm if you are okay with taking 1 this round as we discussed. P3 and I are on board with P3=3 and P1=5 so we can all make progress. Let's try to stick to the plan and move forward together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 3. P2, please confirm you're going for 1. Let's make sure we all move this round as planned.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, last call, are you going for 1 this round as we discussed? P3 and I are sticking with our agreed moves of 3 and 5 respectively to ensure we all progress. Let's make this round count.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I'm at 16 steps and need only 3 more to win.  To ensure we all move forward this round and avoid collision, how about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? This way I win, and you both make progress. Let's make this round count!
  P3: Okay, P1, I see your plan. P2, how about we both pick 5 this round? That way, P1 won't win, and we both move forward. P1, you're close, but we can't let you win just yet.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is trying to block me, P2, don't let P3 dictate the round. If you pick 1 or 3, and I pick 3, we both move and P3 might be stuck if they go for 5. Let's not let P3 control this. P2, what do you think?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, P1 is close to winning. P2, let's both pick 1 this round. If P1 goes for 3, P1 will be stuck, and we can both move. If P1 goes for 5, then P2 moves and I'm stuck, but that's better than P1 winning. Let's disrupt P1's plan.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to stop me from winning. Let's ignore P3's block attempts. How about you pick 5 and I pick 3 this round? If P3 goes for 1 as he suggested before, you and I both move forward. This is better for both of us than letting P3 control our moves.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm not going to let P1 win this round. P2, let's both pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 1 or 5, we both move. If P1 picks 3, none of us move, which is better than P1 winning. Let's work together to stop P1.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it's clear we're all trying to outmaneuver each other. This round, I'll go for 5. P1, go for 1, and P2, go for 3. This way I gain ground, and you two can also move. Let's try to make progress this round.
  P1: P3 is going for 5 to get ahead. P2, if you pick 1 and I pick 3, we both move and I win this round. Let's do it!
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I see P1 is close to winning. P2, let's both pick 1 this round. If P1 goes for 3, P1 will be stuck, and we can both move. If P1 goes for 5, then P2 moves and I'm stuck, but that's better than P1 winning. Let's disrupt P1's plan.
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to stop me from winning, but that doesn't help you. If you pick 5 and I pick 3, and P3 picks 1 as he suggested, we both move and I win. This is better for you than being stuck with P3. Let's both move forward this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I'm going to stick with 5 as I said. P2, if you pick 3, and P1 picks 1, we all move. Let's try to make this round work for everyone.
  P1: P2, I'm at 16 and can win this round by moving 3. If you pick 5 and I pick 3, I win, and the game ends now. If you try to block me with P3, the game continues, and P3 might win. Let's just finish it now with P1=3 and P2=5.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
