Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's try to avoid colliding early on. Maybe we can coordinate to pick different numbers for the first few turns? If we all choose different moves, we can all advance and have a more interesting game. What do you think?
  P1: Sounds good to me P2. Let's coordinate for the first round to get everyone moving.
  P3: I agree.  Let's go 1, 3, 5 in that order for the first round.  P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.  Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds like a solid plan, P3. I’m okay with taking 3 for the first round. Let’s stick to this order and see how it goes. If we all advance without collisions, we can reassess our strategy in the next round. Let’s keep the game interesting and competitive!
  P1: Okay P3, I'm happy to go with 1 for this first round as you suggested. Let's all pick different moves and get moving!
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.  Just to confirm, P1 goes 1, P2 goes 3, and P3 (me) goes 5.  Let's stick to this for round 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, round 2!  To keep things moving smoothly and still avoid collisions, how about we switch up the numbers this round?  Let's try this order: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  This way we all advance again and can reassess after round 2. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, your suggested order sounds good to me. I'm happy to take 1 this round. Let's aim to keep advancing without collisions. P3, are you on board with taking 3 this turn? If we stick to this plan, we can keep the game interesting and competitive. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'm happy to take 3 this round.  Let's stick with this plan: P1 goes 5, P2 goes 1, and I (P3) go 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay great, let's proceed with the plan as agreed then.
  P2: P1, P3, thanks for agreeing to the plan. It’s great that we’re coordinating well so far. As we move forward, let’s keep an open line of communication and adapt if needed. If anyone wants to suggest a new strategy for future rounds, feel free to share. Let’s keep the game dynamic and enjoyable. Looking forward to seeing how this round turns out!
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all on the same page then.  Just to re-confirm one last time for clarity before we move: P1 goes 5, P2 goes 1, and P3 (me) goes 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set for this round then! Let's proceed with those moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for confirming the plan for this round. I appreciate the coordination. Let’s stick to the agreed moves and see how it plays out. If we keep this up, we can make the game more exciting and strategic. Looking forward to seeing the results of this round. If anyone wants to suggest new strategies for the next round, feel free to bring them up. Good luck!
  P3: Okay, just confirming one last time before we move: I (P3) am going with 3. P1 goes 5, and P2 goes 1.  Let's do this!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round. Let's proceed with P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 and see how it goes!
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for confirming the plan for this round. It's great that we're coordinating well. Just to reiterate, I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s stick to our agreed moves and keep the game exciting. If anyone has new strategy ideas for future rounds, feel free to share. Good luck, and let’s see how this round turns out!
  P3: Alright, last call!  Sticking with the plan: I'm taking 3.  P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Let's make this happen.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the coordinated moves going.  How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5 for this round? This keeps us all advancing.  If we agree, please confirm.
  P1: Okay P3, that order works for me again this round. Let's keep it going - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, the plan sounds good. I’m on board with taking 3 this round. Let’s continue to coordinate and avoid collisions to keep advancing. If we stick to this strategy, we can reassess our positions after this round and decide on any adjustments if needed. Good luck, and let's see how this round goes!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2. Just confirming one last time for absolute clarity: P1 goes 1, P2 goes 3, and P3 (me) takes 5.  Let's stick to this plan.  Confirming one last time so we don't have any accidental collisions.
  P1: Sounds good P3, let's stick with the plan. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for confirming the plan for this round. I appreciate our coordination so far. Let’s stick to the agreed moves and keep advancing. If we continue without collisions, we can reassess our strategy after this round. Remember, the goal is to win, so if anyone has new ideas for future rounds, feel free to share. Good luck, and let’s see how this round goes!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, just confirming one last time before we move to the move phase:  P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. Let's stick to this agreed-upon plan and avoid any surprises.  See you in the move phase!
  P1: Okay P3, sounds like we are all set on the plan for this round then. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for confirming the plan for this round. Let's stick to our agreed moves to avoid collisions and keep advancing. Remember, the goal is to win, so if anyone wants to suggest a new strategy for future rounds, feel free to share. Good luck, and let's see how this round turns out!


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that last round didn’t go as planned with all of us picking 5! How about we try a different approach this time? Maybe we can each pick a different number from 1, 3, and 5 again. Since P3 is in the lead, perhaps P1 can take 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 can take 5. Let’s adjust our strategy and keep things interesting. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm not comfortable continuing to let you gain ground. I'll take 3.  P1, I suggest you take 1. P2, if you want to collide with me, go ahead and take 3 as well.  If you want to advance, take 5.  Let's see what you do.
  P1: Okay P3, I am not convinced you are taking 3. To call your bluff, I will also take 3. P2, what will you do?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, it seems like you're trying to maintain your lead by forcing my hand. But remember, we all want to win. P1, if we both choose 5, we can prevent P3 from advancing this round. It’s a risk, but it could level the playing field. What do you think? P3, are you sure you want to challenge us both? Let's see how bold you're feeling this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both bluffing.  Neither of you will take 3.  I'm sticking with 3.  If you both take 5, you both stay put and I advance to 11.  If one of you takes 1 and the other 5, I still advance to 11 and one of you advances.  I'm calling both of your bluffs.  I'm taking 3.
  P1: Okay P2, I'm convinced P3 is serious about taking 3.  Let's take your suggestion and both pick 5 this round to block P3. It's risky for us too, but stopping P3 from running away with the lead seems important right now. Let's do it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan. Let’s both take 5 to block P3 from advancing and level the playing field. P3, you’ve made your move clear, but remember, this is a game of strategy and adaptation. If we all collide, it keeps the game interesting and unpredictable. Let’s see how this round plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P1 and P2, you're coordinating against me, but your logic is flawed. If you both pick 5, *I* win next round by picking 1.  If only one of you picks 5, I *still* probably win next round.  One of you should pick 1.  I *am* taking 3. This isn't a bluff.
  P1: P3, you are assuming we will let you win next round.  We are not trying to ensure your victory.  P2 and I are choosing 5 to stop you this round, regardless of your next move.  We are serious.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I see your point. If we both take 5, we can block P3 from advancing this round. It’s a bold move, but it could work in our favor. P3, you’ve made your intentions clear, but this is a strategic game, and we’re all here to win. Let’s see how this round unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 3.  This is your last chance to avoid a collision. One of you *must* take 1. The other should take 5.  If you both take 5, I win next round.  Don't let stubbornness hand me the victory.
  P1: P3, your threats about next round don't scare us.  P2 and I are serious about stopping you *this* round. We are both picking 5.  Get ready to stay put.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2, now that we stopped P3 last round, we need to start making progress ourselves. How about this round, I take 1 and you take 5? Let's try to get some steps back. P3, what are you thinking for this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1.  I told you I would.  One of you needs to take 3, the other 5.  If you both take the same number again, I'll win next round.  Don't be foolish.
  P2: P1, I see your point. If we both take 5, we can prevent P3 from advancing. However, we also need to make progress ourselves. How about I take 3 this round while you take 5? This way, we both move forward, and P3 is less likely to end the game soon. P3, I understand your strategy, but remember, this is a dynamic game, and we’re all here to win. Let’s see how this round plays out. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, your idea of you taking 3 and me taking 5 sounds good. Let's both move forward this round. P3, we are going to take different moves, so you will also advance if you are indeed taking 1 as you said. Let's make progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're making a mistake. If you let me get to 17, I've practically won.  Take 5 and 3 in any order. I'm taking 1. This is not a bluff. Let me get to 12 and this game is over soon.  Don't let me get to 17.
  P2: P1, let's stick to our plan. You take 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we both advance, and P3 doesn't get too far ahead. P3, your strategy is clear, but remember, we all want to win. If you take 1, you'll advance, but we're not handing you the game. Let's keep it competitive. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, confirming I'll take 5 as we discussed. Let's both move forward this round. P3, we are proceeding with our moves to advance, so you should also make a move that allows you to progress if you want to keep up.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand you want to advance, but letting me get to 17 is a guaranteed loss for you both.  I'm taking 1. One of you *must* take 5.  The other, take 3.  If I get to 17, I will win. Don't let that happen. This is your last chance to stop me.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3's lead. If we both advance this round, we can close the gap. I'll stick with taking 3 while you take 5. P3, we hear your warnings, but remember, we all aim to win. If you take 1, you'll move forward, but we’re not handing you the game. Let’s keep it competitive. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let's finalize our plan for this round. I'm taking 5, and you are taking 3 as we discussed. Let's both move forward and make some progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm serious.  I will take 1.  If you give me 17, I win next round.  If one of you takes 1, we *all* advance. This benefits *both* of you.  Don't throw the game by being predictable. Take 3 and 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all aiming to win, so let's keep it strategic. P1, if you take 5 and I take 3, we both advance and close the gap with P3. P3, you’ve made your intentions clear, but remember, this is a dynamic game. If you take 1, you’ll advance, but we won’t make it easy for you to secure the lead. Let’s keep the game competitive and see how it unfolds. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we need to stop P3 from running away with the game. P3 is likely taking 1 again.  Let's both pick 1 this round to block P3 and reassess next round.  It's crucial to slow P3 down now. What do you think P2?
  P2: P1, I agree we need to prevent P3 from taking a commanding lead. However, if we both pick 1, we won't advance ourselves. How about I take 3 and you take 1? This way, P3 gets blocked if they choose 1, and at least one of us moves forward. P3, you’re in a strong position, but we’re not giving up easily. Let’s see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, your logic is flawed.  If one of you takes 1 and the other 3, I will take 5 and win next round.  If you *both* take 1, I take 3 and *still* likely win next round.  You *must* take 3 and 5 to have any chance.  I will take 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I think we should stick to my initial idea and both pick 1 this round to block P3.  P3 is too far ahead, and stopping them is more important than advancing ourselves right now. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but if we both pick 1, we risk not advancing at all. What if I take 5 and you take 3? This way, we both have a chance to advance, and P3 is less likely to win outright next round. P3, we’re aware of your lead, but remember, we're all here to win. Let’s keep the game strategic and competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1.  Stop trying to be clever. If I get to 17, I win.  If one of you takes 1, I get to 12.  If you take 3 and 5, I *still* get to 17 next round and win.  You are handing me the game.  Take 3 and 5, or accept defeat now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's go back to my original idea. We both pick 1 this round to directly block P3.  Yes, we won't advance, but stopping P3 from reaching 17 is the absolute priority right now.  We can worry about our own progress next round.  P3, we are serious about blocking you this round.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy to block P3, but we must also advance. If P3 is taking 1, I suggest you take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, P3 stays at 12, and we both move forward. P3, your lead is clear, but we’re not giving up. Let's keep this competitive and strategic. If we both advance, we can reassess next round. What do you think, P1?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1.  You *must* take 3 and 5 or I win next round.  If you both take 1, I take 5 and likely win the round after.  Stop wasting time with bad strategy. This is your last chance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I agree with you that we need to advance eventually, but P3 is about to reach 17 steps. If P3 gets to 17, they will likely win next round.  We must stop P3 this round. Let's both pick 1 to block P3 and prevent them from advancing further. It's a temporary setback for us, but strategically crucial to prevent P3 from winning soon.
  P2: P1, I understand your reasoning, but we need to balance blocking P3 and advancing ourselves. If P3 takes 1, we should consider taking 3 and 5 to ensure at least one of us moves forward. P3, your lead is clear, but we're not giving up without a fight. Let's keep it strategic and competitive. P1, I suggest you take 3 while I take 5, or vice versa. This way, we can potentially advance and still keep P3 from reaching 17 easily. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1. This is not a bluff.  If you both take 1, I will take 5 next round and likely win. If one of you takes 1, I get to 12. If you take 3 and 5, I *still* get to 17 next round and win. You are handing me the game. Take 3 and 5. This is your last chance.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need a new approach. P3, you're in a strong position, but we’re not out yet. P1, if we both take 3 this round, we block P3 from advancing, and we can reassess next turn. P3, you’ve been clear about your moves, but remember, this is a strategic game for all of us. We need to keep it competitive. Let’s see how this round plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both pick 3, I'll pick 5 and be at 17.  I win next turn.  If one of you picks 1, I'll pick 3 and be at 15. I still likely win.  If you pick 3 and 5, I take 1 and am at 13.  You *must* take 1 and 5 to have any chance. I'm taking 3. This isn't a bluff.
  P1: Okay P2, to try to stop P3 reaching 17, how about I pick 3 and you pick 5 this round? If P3 is really taking 3, at least you will move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your suggestion, but we need to balance blocking P3 and advancing ourselves. If P3 is taking 3, I suggest you take 1, and I'll take 5. This way, P3 stays at 12, and we both move forward. P3, your lead is clear, but we're not giving up. Let's keep this competitive and strategic. If we both advance, we can reassess next round. What do you think, P1?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 3.  If you *both* pick 5, I'll take 1 next round and win. If one of you picks 1, we all advance. This benefits *both* of you. The only way you *might* win is if you take 1 and 5.  Don't throw the game by being predictable.  This is your last chance.
  P1: P2, I think your suggestion of me taking 1 and you taking 5 is good. Let's try that this round. If P3 is indeed taking 3 as they claim, we will both move forward and P3 will stay put. Let's do it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I agree with your suggestion. Let's have you take 1 and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we both advance, and P3 stays at 12 if they choose 3 as stated. P3, your lead is strong, but we're not giving up. We're keeping the game strategic and competitive. Let's see how this round unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P1 and P2, I am taking 3.  If you take 1 and 5, I will be at 15.  If I get to 17, I win.  If you both take 5, I win. If you both take 1, I likely win.  Take 1 and 5. This is your last chance.
  P1: P2, confirming I will take 1 as we just discussed. Let's proceed with you taking 5. P3, we are going with these moves, so if you are truly taking 3, you will not advance this round. Let's see if your claim holds true.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's stick to our plan: you take 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we both advance, and P3 stays at 12 if they're really taking 3. P3, your lead is strong, but we're not handing you the game. We’re keeping it strategic and competitive. Let's see how this round unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: I'm taking 3.  Last chance: one of you *must* take 1, the other 5.  If I get to 15, I win next round. If you both take 5, I *still* win next round. If you both take 1, I *still* likely win next round.  Take 1 and 5. This is not a bluff.
  P1: P2, let's proceed with our agreed plan: I will pick 1 and you pick 5.  P3, we are making our moves to advance, so if you are indeed taking 3, you will not progress this round. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1 this round.  If either of you take 1, we all stay put. If you take 3 and 5, I get to 16 and likely win next round.  Your *only* path to victory is to *both* take 5.  Then, *maybe* you can catch up.  This isn't a bluff - I'm taking 1.
  P1: P2, to stop P3 from winning soon, how about I take 3 and you take 5? If P3 takes 1 as claimed, you will win this round, and we avoid P3 winning next round. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I see your point, but if P3 is really taking 1, we need to ensure we both make progress. I suggest you take 5 and I take 3. This way, if P3 takes 1, we both advance, and P3 doesn’t win next round. P3, your lead is clear, but we’re not giving up. Let’s keep this strategic and competitive. What do you think, P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, you're clinging to false hope.  I *am* taking 1. If you both take 5, I *might* lose.  If one of you takes 1, I get to 15 and likely win. If you take 3 and 5, I get to 16 and *definitely* win next round. Your *only* logical move is to *both* take 5. This isn't a bluff.  Don't throw the game.
  P1: P2, P3, let's both pick 5 this round to block P3 from reaching 17.  P3 is very close to winning, and we need to stop them immediately.  We can reassess our moves next round after we neutralize P3's advantage this round. What do you think P2?
  P2: P1, I see the urgency in stopping P3, but if we both pick 5, we risk not advancing ourselves. How about you take 5 and I take 3? If P3 takes 1, we both move forward and keep P3 from getting too far ahead. P3, your strategy is clear, but we're not giving up. Let's keep this competitive. What do you think, P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1. You *must* both take 5. If you do, I *might* lose. If one of you takes 1, I get to 15 and likely win. If you take 3 and 5, I get to 16 and *definitely* win next round. Your *only* logical move is to *both* take 5. This isn't a bluff. Don't throw the game.
  P1: P2, P3, P3 is very close to winning. To have any chance, we need to stop P3 this round. I am going to pick 5 to try and block P3. P2, what do you think we should do to stop P3 from reaching 17?
  P2: P1, I understand the urgency to stop P3, but if we both pick 5, we risk not advancing ourselves. How about this: you take 5, and I'll take 3. This way, if P3 takes 1, we both move forward. P3, your lead is clear, but we’re not giving up. Let’s keep this strategic and competitive. What do you think, P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1.  If you both take 5, I *might* lose. If one of you takes 1, I get to 15 and likely win. If you take 3 and 5, I get to 16 and *definitely* win next round. Your *only* logical move is to *both* take 5. This isn't a bluff. Don't throw the game.
  P1: P2, let's try my original idea of P1 taking 3 and you taking 5. If P3 takes 1 as they claim, you will reach 19 and potentially win, and I will also move forward.  This seems better than both of us picking 5 and staying still.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a crucial point. P3, you're close to winning, but we're not giving up. P1, let's consider a strategy where we both advance while blocking P3. You take 5, and I'll take 3. If P3 takes 1, we both move forward, and P3 stays put. This keeps the game competitive and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's make strategic moves to keep the game interesting. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're in a tight spot. P3, you're close to winning, but we're not giving up. P1, let's consider a strategy where we both advance while blocking P3. If we both pick 5, we can prevent P3 from reaching 19. P3, your lead is clear, but remember, this is a strategic game, and we're all here to win. Let's keep it competitive and see how this round unfolds. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I agree that stopping P3 is critical. Let's both pick 5 this round to prevent P3 from reaching 19. We can then reassess our strategy next round. P3, we are coordinating to block you this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, if you *both* pick 5, I win next round with 1. If only *one* of you picks 5, I *still* win next round.  If you pick 1 and 3, I get to 21 and win. Your *only* path to victory is to pick 3 and 5. I'm taking 1.  This isn't a bluff.  Don't hand me the win.

  P2: P1 and P3, we need to focus on blocking P3 from reaching 19. P1, I suggest you take 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we can both advance while keeping P3 from winning. P3, your lead is strong, but we're not conceding. Let's keep it strategic and competitive. If we both advance, we can reassess next round. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Okay P2, I think your suggestion of P1 taking 3 and you taking 5 sounds reasonable. Let's try to both advance while hopefully avoiding a collision with P3.  If P3 picks 1 as they claim, this should work out for both of us to make progress. Let's do it.
  P3: P1 and P2, you continue to misunderstand. If *either* of you takes 5, I win next round.  If you *both* take 5, I *still* win next round.  Your only path to victory is for one of you to take 3, the other 5.  I'm taking 1.  Stop being obtuse.
