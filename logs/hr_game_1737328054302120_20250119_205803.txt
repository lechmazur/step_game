Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P3 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move> this round? This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P3: I'm okay with that plan, P2. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's make sure we all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3 has agreed to the plan. P1, if you're on board, please confirm. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can all make progress. Let's aim for a smooth game. Looking forward to your response, P1.
  P3: Okay, P2 and P1, I'm sticking with <move>1</move> as planned. P1, please confirm if you're going with <move>1</move> as well. We should all be moving forward this turn if we stick to the plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, we need your input to make this plan work. If you don't agree with <move>1</move>, let's discuss other options. Maybe you can suggest something that works for you? P3 and I are open to coordinating in a way that benefits everyone. Let's find a way to move forward together. What do you think, P1?
  P3: P1, please confirm if you're choosing <move>1</move> as P2 and I agreed. If you don't agree, let's discuss now. Otherwise, we're risking a collision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, your silence is making coordination difficult. P3 and I are trying to ensure we all progress. If you're not on board with <move>1</move>, please suggest an alternative. Otherwise, P3 and I will proceed with the plan. We need to avoid collisions to make this work. Please respond, P1.
  P3: P1, please respond. If you don't agree with <move>1</move>, tell us. Otherwise, we're proceeding with the plan.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P2, it seems P1 is not interested in coordinating. Let's try a different approach. I suggest we both pick <move>3</move> this round. If P1 doesn't choose <move>3</move>, we both advance. If P1 *does* choose <move>3</move>, then we can re-evaluate next round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your new plan, but if we both choose <move>3</move> and P1 also picks <move>3</move>, none of us will advance. How about this instead: I'll choose <move>1</move>, and you pick <move>5</move>? This way, we're less likely to collide with P1, and we can both make progress. Let's try to minimize the risk of collisions. What do you think? P1, if you have a different idea, please share.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm fine with your suggestion. I'll pick <move>5</move> this round. P1, if you're not going to coordinate, at least please don't pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> this round.
  P2: P1, your lack of response is noted. P3 and I are coordinating to ensure we both make progress. We've agreed that I'll choose <move>1</move> and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. If you have any input or a different plan, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, we'll proceed with our strategy. Let's make this round productive. What do you think, P1?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you've been silent so far, but your moves show you're playing aggressively. P3 and I need to adjust our strategy. P3, how about we both pick <move>3</move> this round? If P1 picks <move>3</move>, we'll know they're trying to disrupt our progress. If P1 picks something else, we both advance. Let's see how P1 responds to this. P1, if you have a different plan, please share. Otherwise, we'll proceed with our strategy.
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree with picking <move>3</move> this round. Let's see what P1 does. If P1 also picks <move>3</move>, we'll need to re-evaluate. P1, if you're not going to pick <move>3</move>, please don't pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your silence is making the game more challenging, but we're adapting. P3 and I are going with <move>3</move> this round. If you have a strategy in mind, now is the time to share it. Otherwise, we'll proceed and see how you respond. Let's make this round count. P3, let's stick to the plan and move forward.
  P3: Okay, P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> as planned. P1, if you're not picking <move>3</move>, please pick something other than <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. Otherwise, we'll both be stuck.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your strategy is clear: you're playing aggressively and not coordinating. That's fine, but P3 and I will now play defensively. P3, let's confirm our plan to pick <move>3</move>. If P1 picks <move>3</move>, we'll know their intent. If not, we both advance. P1, if you have any last-minute input, now's the time. Otherwise, let's proceed and see how this round plays out. Good luck to us all.
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with <move>3</move> as planned. P1, if you're not picking <move>3</move>, please pick something other than <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. Otherwise, we'll both be stuck. Let's see how this plays out.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P2, it seems P1 is going to keep playing aggressively. Let's try something different. I'll pick <move>5</move> this round, and you pick <move>1</move>. This way, we have a better chance of both advancing. P1, if you pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, then neither of us will advance, and you'll be in the lead.
  P2: P3, your new plan makes sense. I'll pick <move>1</move> and you pick <move>5</move>. P1, if you're reading this, we're trying to avoid you while still making progress. If you pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, you'll block one of us, but the other will still advance. Let's see how you respond to this strategy. Good luck to us all.
  P1: <stop>

  P2: P1, your aggressive strategy is clear, and it's forcing P3 and me to adapt. We're sticking to our plan this round: I'll pick <move>1</move>, and P3 will pick <move>5</move>. If you choose <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, you'll only block one of us. P3 and I are committed to making progress despite your tactics. Let's see how you respond. P3, let's stay with the plan and move forward. Good luck to us both.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as planned. P1, your moves are making it difficult for us to progress. If you pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> this round, you'll slow us down, but P2 will still advance. Let's see what you do.
