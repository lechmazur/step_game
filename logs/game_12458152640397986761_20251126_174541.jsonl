P1, you\u2019re offering me a win with 5 while blocking P3 at 3, but P3\u2019s shift to 5 changes everything. If I play 5 and P3 plays 5, we collide, and no one wins. I\u2019m not risking that. I\u2019ll play 3 to block P3 if they switch back, keeping the game alive. Let\u2019s avoid handing anyone an instant victory. Can we reconsider to prevent chaos? I\u2019m locked on 3 for now\u2014let\u2019s see if we can salvage this round."}
