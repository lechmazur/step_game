Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, how about we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions? If we each choose different numbers, we can all advance without blocking each other. I suggest one of us picks <move>1</move>, another picks <move>3</move>, and the last picks <move>5</move>. Let me know your thoughts or if you have a different strategy in mind.
  P2: Sounds good P3. I'll take <move>3</move> this round.  P1, you want <move>1</move>?
  P1: P1: I'll take 5. Let's coordinate so P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way we all move without conflict.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s keep the prior agreement to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5 again, you take 3 and 1 respectively. This ensures steady progress without overlap. Any objections?
  P2: Sounds good P1.  I'm sticking with 3. P3, please take 1 again so we can all advance smoothly.
  P3: P1, P2: I see the plan is working well so far. Let's stick to it for now. I'll take <move>1</move> again this round. Consistency is key to avoid any collisions. Let's keep advancing smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s continue our coordinated plan for smooth progress. I’ll take <move>5</move> again this round, P2 stays on <move>3</move>, and P3 continues with <move>1</move>. This minimizes collision risks and keeps us advancing efficiently. Any issues with this approach?
  P3: P1, P2: I appreciate the coordination so far, but I'm falling behind. To make the game more competitive, I'd like to switch things up this round. P1, could you take <move>3</move> and P2 take <move>5</move>? I'll go with <move>1</move> again. This way, we all get a chance to adjust our strategies and keep things interesting. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand you want to catch up, but drastically changing our strategy now only benefits P1.  How about this: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5. This lets you gain some ground without giving P1 a huge advantage.  If we keep rotating like this, we all have a fair shot.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's rotation idea makes sense to keep us all competitive. Let's do that this round: I'll stay on <move>5</move> (15 total), P2 takes <move>1</move> (7), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (5). This balances progress while preventing collisions. Next round, we can rotate again or revert—fair? Let's confirm and move.
  P3: P1, P2: I appreciate the willingness to rotate. Let's stick with P2's suggestion for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This helps balance our progress and keeps the game competitive. We can reassess after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance. Are we all in agreement to proceed with this plan?
  P2: Agreed. P1 gets 5, I get 1, P3 gets 3.  Let's stick to this plan and confirm so we can move on.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: Thanks for agreeing to rotate last round. It helped balance things a bit. Let's keep rotating to maintain fairness. How about this time I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>? This way, P2 can catch up a bit, and I get a chance to make some progress. We can reassess next round based on the new standings. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good P3. I'm happy to take 3.  P1, are you good with taking 1 this round to keep things fair?  Let's confirm so we can move to the next round quickly.
  P1: P3, P2: Agreed to the rotation to maintain fairness. I'll take <move>1</move> this round (16 total). However, let’s note that I’m now just 4 steps from 20. Next round, I’ll need to prioritize <move>5</move> to secure victory—please coordinate accordingly to avoid collisions. Let’s confirm this plan for Round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: Thanks for agreeing to the rotation. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains fairness and gives us all a chance to progress. P1, I understand your position, but let's focus on this round first. Afterward, we can discuss strategies for the next one. Are we all set to proceed with this arrangement?
  P2: Sounds good P3.  I'll take 3. Let's confirm this round's moves one last time: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5. Then we can discuss the next round.
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm the current plan—<move>1</move> this round to maintain coordination. However, I must stress that **next round**, I **must** take <move>5</move> to reach 21. Please both avoid choosing 5 in Round 5 to prevent collision. Let’s proceed as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: Thanks for confirming the plan for this round—I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick to it to ensure progress for everyone. For the next round, we can discuss how to handle P1's need for <move>5</move> to avoid conflicts. We can strategize to keep the game competitive and fair. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm one last time for this round: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5.  For next round, I propose P1 takes 5 (wins), I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This seems like the fairest way to let P1 win since they are so close.  Does that sound acceptable?
  P1: P2, P3: I accept your Round 5 plan. In Round 5, I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 21, while P2 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This avoids collision and lets me win fairly. For Round 4, let’s confirm the agreed moves: I take <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. Let’s finalize and proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: As agreed in Round 4’s conversation, I **must** take <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 and win. Please both stick to your prior承诺: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. This honors our rotation agreement and lets me secure victory fairly. Any last objections? Let’s finalize this.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the plan for this round, but I want to keep things competitive. How about a new proposal? P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move> this round. This gives me a chance to catch up, and we can reassess next round. If P1 is still close to winning, we can discuss a fair strategy to ensure everyone has a shot. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I agreed to the plan last round, and changing it now isn't fair.  I'm taking 1 as agreed. P1, I suggest you take 5 and win, as we discussed.  Let's finish this round and honor our agreement.  Sticking to agreements is important for future games too.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, we explicitly agreed in Round 4 to let me take <move>5</move> this round to secure victory fairly. Breaking this pact now undermines trust. P2 is honoring the deal with <move>1</move>. Let’s stick to our word to preserve fairness. I’ll proceed with <move>5</move> as agreed. If you take <move>3</move>, you won’t conflict with me and can still progress. Reneging harms our collaborative spirit—please honor commitments.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the agreement, but I'd like a chance to stay competitive. How about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game interesting and gives me a chance to catch up. We can reassess the situation after this round. If P1 is still close to winning, we can discuss a fair strategy for the next round. Let's keep the game engaging for everyone. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but reneging on our agreement now sets a bad precedent.  We had a deal.  Take 3 as agreed, let P1 win, and let's maintain good sportsmanship.  Think long-term - trustworthiness is key for future collaborations.  Let's confirm one last time: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, breaking our explicit Round 4 agreement jeopardizes *your own* progress. If you take 5 while I fulfill our pact with 5, we collide and neither advances—stranding you at 10. Stick to 3 as agreed, let me win cleanly, and you preserve momentum. P2’s reminder about trust is critical—reneging undermines future collaboration. I move **5** as promised. Your choice, but math favors honoring deals.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the importance of trust and agreements, but I also want a chance to stay competitive. My proposal is for P1 to take <move>3</move>, P2 to take <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move> this round. This keeps the game engaging and gives me a chance to catch up. We can reassess the situation after this round and ensure fairness moving forward. Let's keep the game dynamic and enjoyable for everyone. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to be competitive, but you're being short-sighted.  If you take 5, *neither* of us advances. You stay at 10, and I stay at 10.  You're guaranteeing P1 the win. Take 3 as agreed, get to 13, and then we can have a real competition in the next round. Let's be smart about this.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


*** Round 5 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps
