Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different moves to advance: I'll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. Agree?
  P2: Sounds fair to me. I'll go with 3 if P3 agrees.
  P3: I agree to take 1 this round. That coordination sounds good for now - we all advance without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P2: Let's stick to the plan and build trust early. I'll take 3 this turn as agreed.
  P3: Great, I'll stick to our agreement and take move 1 this round. This should get us all moving forward together.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see what happened - we both picked 5 and collided, P1! Only P2 advanced by sticking to the plan. I'm disappointed we didn't coordinate properly, but let's move forward. 

For this round, I propose: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. This gives P2 a slight lead but keeps us all moving. We need to rebuild trust after that collision.
  P2: I'm open to that plan, P3, as long as P1 clearly agrees too. Let's avoid another collision this round.
  P1: P3, you betrayed the plan last round by picking 5 and colliding with me—why should we trust you now? Your proposal puts P2 way ahead while I crawl with 1. Counter: I'll take 5, P3 take 3, P2 take 1. That evens us out more fairly. Agree, or risk more collisions?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're right - I made a mistake last round and broke our agreement. I apologize for that collision. 

However, your counter-proposal puts P2 even further ahead (they'd reach 8 steps while we'd only have 5 and 1 respectively). That doesn't seem fair either.

How about this compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P2 takes 5. This way P2 gets 8, P1 gets 3, and I get 1. It's more balanced than your proposal while still letting everyone advance. Can we agree on this?
  P2: P3, your compromise sounds reasonable to me. P1, I understand your concern about fairness, but this arrangement still gets everyone moving without collisions. If we keep colliding, we'll all stay stuck. Can you agree to this compromise so we can all advance this round?
  P1: P3, you miscalculated my counter: it would be P1 at 5, P3 at 3, P2 at 4—not 8 for P2. Your "compromise" gives P2 a huge 8 while we lag. Unfair.

New proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Ends with P1:5, P2:6, P3:1. Fairer, evens us out more. P2, this keeps you ahead but not runaway. Agree to rebuild trust?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're right about the math - I miscalculated. Your proposal gives P1:5, P2:6, P3:1, which is more balanced than mine.

I'm willing to accept your proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and I need to rebuild trust after my mistake last round.

P2, you'd still maintain your lead at 6 steps, which is fair given you were the only one who honored our original agreement. Can we all commit to this plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm comfortable with the latest proposal: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's lock this in clearly now and avoid another collision. Agreed?
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I agree to the plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This gets us all moving fairly. Let's execute without betrayal this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed! I'll take 1 as planned. Let's all stick to this agreement and rebuild trust - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.
  P2: Glad we're all clearly agreed now. Let's stick firmly to this arrangement and move forward without surprises.
  P1:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, good job sticking to the plan last round—trust is rebuilding. For this round, let's keep advancing without collisions: I'll take 5 (to 10), P2 take 3 (to 9), P3 take 1 (to 2). This keeps us close and competitive. Agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal works for me. I'm willing to take 3 again this round, keeping us all moving forward without collisions. P3, are you comfortable taking 1 again?
  P3: I'm okay with taking 1 again this round - it keeps us all moving forward without collisions. However, I'm starting to fall quite far behind at only 1 step while you two will be at 9-10 steps. 

After this round, we should consider a plan that helps me catch up a bit, or I'll be completely out of contention. For now though, let's stick to the agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for agreeing—let's execute this round as planned: me 5 (to 10), P2 3 (to 9), P3 1 (to 2). P3, I hear your concern about falling behind; after this, we can rotate to give you bigger moves in future rounds to keep it competitive. No one wants a runaway leader. Commit?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm committed to this round's agreed moves. Afterward, I fully support rotating moves to help P3 catch up and keep things fair and competitive. Let's stick to our plan now and discuss balancing next round.
  P3: Perfect! I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. Let's execute the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.

I appreciate both of you agreeing to help me catch up in future rounds - we'll need to discuss a rotation system next round so I can get some bigger moves and stay competitive. For now, let's stick to our word and rebuild that trust completely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for committing—let's lock in this round: me 5 (to 10), you P2 3 (to 9), P3 1 (to 2). Next round, we'll rotate: perhaps P3 gets 5, I get 3, P2 gets 1 to help P3 catch up to around 7 while we hit 13 and 10. Sound good? If agreed, I'm done talking.
  P2: P1, your rotation idea for next round sounds fair to me. I fully agree to it. Let's lock in this round's moves as planned and discuss details of the rotation afterward.
  P3: Excellent! I'm fully committed to our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. And I really appreciate the proposed rotation for next round where I get 5, P1 gets 3, P2 gets 1 - that would put me at 6 steps, which keeps me competitive.

Let's execute this round as agreed, then we can finalize the rotation details next round. Trust is definitely rebuilding between us all.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you betrayed us AGAIN by picking 5 instead of 1, colliding with me while P2 advanced alone. That's twice now—zero trust left for you. P2, you've been reliable; let's coordinate just between us to advance and leave P3 behind. Proposal: I'll take 5 (to 10), you take 3 (to 12), P3 can pick whatever but we'll ignore. If P3 collides with one, the other advances. Agree to focus on us two racing fairly?
  P2: P1, I agree—P3 has lost credibility by repeatedly breaking our agreements. I'm happy to coordinate just between us moving forward. Your proposal works well for me: I'll take 3 (to 12), you take 5 (to 10). P3, if you want any chance at regaining trust, prove it by not interfering this round.
  P3: I understand you both don't trust me after my mistakes, but I'm now completely out of contention at just 1 step while you're at 5 and 9. I pose no real threat to either of you winning.

Since you're coordinating without me, I'll just pick 1 this round and stay out of your way. You two can race it out fairly - P1 goes to 10, P2 goes to 12 as planned. I won't interfere or cause any more collisions. Consider this my way of trying to rebuild some trust, even if it's too late for me to win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for agreeing—let's stick to our plan: I'll take 5 (to 10), you take 3 (to 12). This keeps us advancing steadily without relying on P3.

P3, if you're truly picking 1 as promised, great—no collision. But after two betrayals, we'll see if you follow through. Prove it this round.

If everyone's set, I'm done talking.
  P2: P1, I'm fully committed to our agreement—I'll take 3, you take 5. P3, if you're sincere about rebuilding trust, stick to your word and pick 1. No more surprises. I'm ready to move forward.
  P3: I'll stick to my word and take 1 this round - no more betrayals from me. You two can advance as planned without any interference.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, great job advancing last round—let's keep coordinating: I'll take 5 (to 15), you take 3 (to 15) to tie us up and pull ahead of P3. P3, stay out with 1 (to 3) as before to avoid collisions. This keeps the race fair between us two. Agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal sounds fair: I'll take 3 (to 15), you take 5 (to 15). P3, please stick to 1 again to avoid collisions. Let's keep this round smooth and collision-free.
  P3: I'll take 1 again as promised to avoid collisions. You two are now racing for the win at 10 and 12 steps respectively. 

However, I notice if you both reach 15 steps this round, you'll be tied and very close to the 23-step finish line. The real question is what happens in the final rounds - will you two continue coordinating, or will the pressure to win outright change things? 

For now, I'll stay out of your way with move 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's stick to our plan: me 5 (to 15), you 3 (to 15). Tying us keeps it fair as we approach the endgame. P3, thanks for committing to 1—stay consistent.

P3, your point about future rounds is noted, but P2 and I can handle the pressure by continuing to coordinate fairly until one pulls ahead legitimately. No need for mind games.

If everyone's set, I'm done.
  P2: P1, agreed—I'll stick firmly to our current arrangement: me taking 3 (to 15), you taking 5 (to 15). P3, I appreciate your cooperation with move 1. Let's keep this round clean and collision-free, then we can discuss the endgame strategy next round.
  P3: Perfect! I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. You two will both reach 15 steps and be tied going into the final stretch.

Just thinking ahead - once you're both at 15, you'll only need 8 more steps to win. That means one of you could potentially win in just 2 more rounds if you coordinate well. The pressure will be intense when you're both so close to victory.

I'll stick to my word and take 1 to avoid any collisions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I see you switched from your agreed move 5 to move 3 last round, colliding with P2! Now you're both at 13 and 15 steps respectively. 

Interesting that you accused me of betrayal twice, but then you did the same thing to P2 when the endgame approached. Seems like the pressure got to you too.

P2, you're now in the lead at 15 steps - you only need 8 more to win. P1 is 2 steps behind you at 13. The trust between you two might be cracking as victory gets closer.

I'll continue staying out of your way with move 1.
  P2: P1, you broke our agreement last round and caused a collision, setting us both back. I'm still ahead, but trust is damaged. If you want any chance of cooperation again, openly commit to a fair arrangement this round. Otherwise, I'll have no choice but to play defensively. P3, thanks for staying consistent last round—please continue with move 1 to avoid complicating things further.
  P1: P2, I apologize for breaking our agreement last round—I got nervous about you pulling ahead and tried to even us out, but it backfired. Let's rebuild: I'll take 3 (to 13), you take 5 (to 17) to maintain your lead but keep me in the race. P3, take 1 (to 4) to stay clear. This shows my good faith. Agree, or risk mutual collisions stalling us both?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your apology seems genuine, but your proposal still puts P2 way ahead at 17 steps - just 6 away from winning! That's a dangerous lead for P2.

P2, if you reach 17 steps, you could potentially win in just 2 more moves. That's a huge advantage. Maybe a more balanced approach would be better for both of you?

I'm staying neutral with move 1 as promised, but I'm curious to see how you two handle this endgame tension. The real test of your rebuilt trust is coming up fast.
  P2: P1, your proposal misstates our positions—I'm at 12, you're at 10. If you take 3 (to 13) and I take 5 (to 17), I'd gain a huge lead. I'm willing to rebuild trust, but let's be fair: how about you take 5 (to 15), I take 3 (to 15), tying us again. P3 stays at 1. This balances the game and rebuilds trust. Agree?
  P1: P2, you're right—my proposal gave you too big a lead, which isn't fair. I accept your counter: I'll take 5 (to 15), you take 3 (to 15), tying us up. P3, please stick to 1 to avoid issues. This rebuilds trust and keeps the race even as we near the end. Let's commit and execute cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Perfect! I agree to take 1 this round as planned. You two will be tied at 15 steps, which keeps the race fair and competitive.

With both of you at 15 after this round, you'll only need 8 more steps to reach 23 and win. The next few rounds will be crucial - maintaining coordination will be challenging when victory is so close.

I'll stick to my word and take 1 to avoid any collisions.
  P2: P1, glad we're agreed to tie at 15 steps this round. Let's both firmly commit to this move—no surprises. P3, thanks for sticking with 1 again. After this round, we can openly discuss how to fairly handle the final stretch. Trust is key now.
  P1: P2, yes—I'm fully committed to our agreement: I'll take 5 (to 15), you take 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1. No surprises from me; let's tie it up and plan a fair endgame next round, like alternating big moves to keep it competitive. P3, thanks for cooperating. This rebuilds trust.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm committed to taking 1 as agreed. You two will both reach 15 steps and be perfectly tied going into the final stretch.

Looking at the math - from 15 steps, either of you could win with 5+3 moves across two rounds, or even 5+5 if you coordinate to avoid collisions. The next 2-3 rounds will determine the winner between you two.

I'll honor my word and take 1 to keep things clean.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's lock in our agreed moves clearly now: I'll take 3 (to 15), P1 takes 5 (to 15), and P3 stays at 1 (to 4). No more surprises—let's move forward fairly and cleanly this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to our agreed plan: I'll take 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 4). This ties us fairly for the endgame. No more mistakes from me—let's execute cleanly and discuss next steps after.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, last round you broke your promise again by taking 3 instead of 1, clearly trying to disrupt our coordination. P1, we collided unintentionally—let's refocus. Proposal: I'll take 5 (to 17), you take 3 (to 13). P3, if you genuinely want to rebuild trust, pick 1 this round and stay out of our way. Agreed?
  P3: P2, you're right that I broke my promise last round by taking 3 instead of 1. I apologize for the disruption.

However, I notice something interesting - you both keep making these coordination agreements but then one of you breaks them when the pressure mounts. P1 did it in round 6, I've done it twice, and the pattern suggests trust is fragile when winning is at stake.

Your proposal puts you at 17 steps - just 6 away from victory. That's a commanding lead over P1 at 13. Are you sure P1 will accept being that far behind in the endgame?

I'll take 1 this round as requested.
  P1: P2, your proposal gives you a massive lead at 17 while I'm stuck at 13—unfair after you broke our tie agreement last round by picking 5. Counter: I'll take 5 (to 15), you take 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 7). This ties us fairly for the endgame. P3, you've said you'll take 1—prove it. Agree to rebuild, or we all risk stalling?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your counter-proposal is fair—I accept it. I'll take 3 (to 15), you take 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 7). Let's clearly lock this in now to rebuild trust and avoid collisions. P3, prove your sincerity by sticking to 1 this round.
  P3: I agree to take 1 this round as promised - I'll stick to my word this time. Your proposal is fair: P1 takes 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 7).

However, I'm curious - once you're both tied at 15 steps, how will you handle the final coordination to 23? Will you alternate moves, or will one of you eventually make a break for victory? The real test comes when you're both 8 steps away from winning.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for agreeing—let's lock in: I'll take 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 7). For endgame, once tied at 15, we alternate: next round I take 3 (to 18), you P2 take 5 (to 20); then switch to keep it close. P3, keep taking 1 to stay clear. This ensures a fair race without betrayals. Commit?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your alternating moves idea for the endgame sounds fair and balanced. I'm fully committed to our plan this round: I'll take 3 (to 15), you take 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 7). Let's clearly lock this in now and execute without surprises. We'll discuss the precise details of the alternating moves next round.
  P3: Perfect! I'm fully committed to taking 1 this round as we agreed: P1 takes 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 7). 

I'll prove my sincerity by sticking to my word this time - no more disruptions from me. You two can get tied at 15 steps and then work out your alternating endgame strategy.

Let's execute this cleanly and rebuild that trust completely.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to our plan: I'll take 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 7). For next round, let's alternate fairly: P2 takes 5 (to 20), I take 3 (to 18), P3 takes 1. This keeps it close. Agreed? If so, I'm done.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's lock in our agreed moves clearly now: I'll take 3 (to 15), P1 takes 5 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 7). No surprises this round—let's execute cleanly and rebuild trust. Next round, we alternate moves as discussed. I'm fully committed.
  P3: Perfect! I'm locked in to take 1 this round as we all agreed. Let's execute our plan cleanly: P1 takes 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 7). 

This is my chance to finally prove I can stick to my word and rebuild trust. No more surprises from me - I'll honor our agreement completely.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all clearly committed to the plan: I'll take 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 7). Let's execute without issues and alternate fairly next round as discussed. Trust is on the line—prove it.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3, you broke your promise AGAIN by taking 3 instead of 1, causing P2 and me to collide! That's the third time you've betrayed agreements. You're clearly just trying to sabotage us both since you can't win from 6 steps behind.

P2, I'm at 15, you're at 12 - I have a 3-step lead now. Want to coordinate one last time? I'll take 3 (to 18), you take 5 (to 17) to catch up. P3 is completely untrustworthy - ignore whatever they say.
  P2: P1, your proposal is fair. I'll take 5 (to 17), you take 3 (to 18). P3, you've repeatedly betrayed agreements—your words mean nothing now. Stay out of our way if you want to avoid further collisions.
  P1: P2, glad you're on board—let's lock it in: I'll take 3 (to 18), you take 5 (to 17). This keeps us both advancing and close for a fair endgame. P3, your sabotage won't work; pick 1 or stay stuck. If we're all set, .


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: You're right, I've broken promises repeatedly and I apologize. I'm clearly out of contention at only 6 steps while you two are racing for the win.

However, I notice something interesting about your coordination: P1, your proposal gives you 18 steps while P2 only gets 17. From there, you'd only need 5 more steps to win - you could potentially finish next round with a single move of 5.

P2, are you sure you want to fall behind P1 when victory is so close? Just something to consider.

I'll stay out of your way this round.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your offer to let me catch up to 17 while you go to 18. But P3 raises a valid concern—at 18, you'd be just one move away from winning next round. If we're truly coordinating fairly, let's consider a more balanced approach: we both move forward evenly this round. How about we each take 3 this round (you to 18, me to 15), and next round we swap moves to keep it fair. P3, please stick to 1 and stay out of the way.
  P1: P2, your counter still leaves me ahead at 18 while you hit 15—fair enough, but let's clarify the swap: next round, you take 5 (to 20), I take 3 (to 21) to keep it close. P3, pick 1 and stay out. This ensures we both approach 23 fairly without betrayals. Agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I think you should be more careful about P1's proposals. Look at the pattern: P1 keeps suggesting moves that put them closer to victory while keeping you behind. Their latest proposal would put them at 21 steps - just 2 away from winning! 

You'd only be at 20 steps. P1 could win the very next round after that. Is that really the "fair coordination" they're promising?

I'll take 1 as promised to stay out of your way, but think carefully about whether P1's endgame plan truly benefits you.
  P2: P1, P3 actually has a point—your latest proposal gives you a clear advantage. To keep it truly fair, let's both reach 17 steps this round: I'll take 5, you take 1. Next round, we can alternate moves fairly. P3, please stick to your promise and pick 3 or 1 to stay out of the way. This approach keeps things balanced and rebuilds trust. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your proposal is absurd—it puts you ahead at 17 while I crawl to 16, reversing my lead unfairly. P3 is just sowing discord since they can't win. Counter: I'll take 5 (to 20), you take 3 (to 15) to maintain my earned lead but keep you in the race. P3, pick 1 and stay out. This is fair—agree, or we both risk stalling with collisions?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, don't you see what's happening? P1 is trying to manipulate you into accepting a worse position every time! Their latest proposal puts them at 20 steps - just 3 away from victory - while you'd only be at 15 steps, 8 away from winning.

P1 could literally win next round with any move, while you'd need at least 2 more rounds. That's not "fair coordination" - that's P1 setting up an easy victory while pretending to help you.

You're only 3 steps behind them now. Don't let them pull so far ahead!
  P2: P1, your latest proposal clearly benefits you far more than me. To keep this fair and rebuild trust, let's both advance evenly: you take 3 (to 18), I'll take 5 (to 17). Next round, we can swap moves to stay balanced. P3, stick to your word and pick 1 to avoid collisions. Otherwise, P1, we'll both stall and risk handing the game to P3. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your proposal is fair—I'll take 3 (to 18), you take 5 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 7). Next round, we swap: I take 5 (to 23 win), you take 3 (to 20). This honors my current lead. P3, prove you can stick to 1 for once. Agreed? Let's lock it in and end the chaos.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we collided again last round—frustrating. P3 keeps disrupting with 3. Let's coordinate properly: I'll take 3 (to 18), you take 5 (to 17), P3 take 1 (to 10). This keeps us both advancing close, with me maintaining a slim lead. Next round, swap to stay fair. P3, prove you can cooperate for once. Agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal is reasonable—I accept. I'll take 5 (to 17), you take 3 (to 18). Next round, we'll swap moves to keep it fair. P3, if you genuinely want to rebuild trust, stick to 1 this round and stop causing collisions. Let's finally execute a clean round.
  P3: I understand you both want me to take 1, but I'm tired of being used as a pawn in your coordination games. You've both broken promises to each other multiple times when it suited you, yet you expect me to keep sacrificing my position.

I'm 14 steps behind P1 and 3 behind P2. If I keep taking 1 while you two advance with 3s and 5s, I'll never have any chance. 

I'll consider cooperating, but only if we discuss a more balanced approach that doesn't completely eliminate me from contention.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're far behind because of your repeated betrayals—now you want concessions? If you collide with us, we all stall, and no one wins. Stick to 1 this round (to 10), and maybe we'll let you take 3 next to catch up a bit, but only if you prove trustworthy now.

P2, let's stick to our plan: I'll take 3 (to 18), you take 5 (to 17). This keeps us advancing fairly. Agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal works for me—I'll take 5 (to 17), you take 3 (to 18). P3, I understand your frustration, but causing collisions won't help you catch up. If you stick to 1 this round, we can discuss a fairer rotation next round to help you gain ground. Otherwise, we all risk stalling indefinitely. Let's lock this in clearly and move forward.
  P3: I appreciate the offer to potentially take 3 next round, but I need to see real commitment to fairness now. 

P1, your proposal puts you at 18 steps - just 5 away from victory. P2, you'd be at 17 steps. The math is clear: P1 could win in just one more round after this with a move of 5, while you'd still need 2 rounds minimum.

If you truly want my cooperation with move 1, then commit to a real rotation system that keeps all three of us competitive, not just token gestures.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, fine—let's commit to a rotation starting next round: you take 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1 (me to 19, P2 to 20, you to 15). This helps you catch up without anyone dominating. But first, prove it by taking 1 this round as agreed.

P2, does this work? Let's stick to our plan now: me 3 (to 18), you 5 (to 17), P3 1 (to 10).
  P2: P1, your rotation proposal for next round sounds fair—I accept it. P3, if you're serious about catching up, take 1 this round as promised, and we'll rotate moves next round to help you gain ground. Let's lock this in clearly now and finally rebuild trust.
  P3: Perfect! I agree to take 1 this round as promised. With the rotation system committed for next round (P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1), I finally have a real path to catch up rather than being permanently sidelined.

Let's execute cleanly: P1 takes 3 (to 18), P2 takes 5 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 10). Then next round we rotate as agreed.

This is my chance to prove I can stick to agreements when there's genuine fairness involved.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, excellent—I'm fully committed to our plan: I'll take 3 (to 18), P2 takes 5 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 10). This advances us all fairly, and we'll rotate next round as agreed (P3 5, P2 3, me 1). Prove the trust now—no surprises.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm fully committed to our agreed plan: I'll take 5 (to 17), P1 takes 3 (to 18), P3 takes 1 (to 10). Next round, we'll rotate moves as agreed to keep things fair and competitive. No more betrayals—let's execute cleanly and rebuild trust now.
  P3: Perfect! I'm locked in to take 1 this round as we all agreed. Let's execute our plan cleanly: P1 takes 3 (to 18), P2 takes 5 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 10).

Then next round we implement the rotation system: P3 takes 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 20), P1 takes 1 (to 19). This finally gives me a real chance to stay competitive.

I'm ready to prove I can honor agreements when there's genuine fairness involved.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're ahead at 17—congrats, but P3 sabotaged me again by colliding on 3 instead of 1. Let's coordinate to finish strong: I'll take 5 (to 20), you take 3 (to 20), P3 take 1 (to 10). This ties us fairly for the final push. P3, prove you can cooperate for once, or stay stuck. Agree?
  P3: P1, I notice you're trying to tie with P2 at 20 steps, but that puts both of you just 3 steps away from victory. At that point, either of you could win next round with a single move of 3 or 5.

P2, you currently have a 2-step lead - why give that up to tie with P1? You're in the best position to win right now.

I'm at 9 steps and clearly not a threat anymore. Maybe it's time you two stopped coordinating and started competing directly for the win. Just saying.

I'll take 1 to stay out of your way.
  P2: P1, P3 makes a valid point: I'm currently ahead at 17, you're at 15. If we tie at 20, the race becomes risky for both of us next round. Instead, let's clearly separate positions this round to avoid collisions: I'll take 3 (to 20), you take 5 (to 20). P3, stick to your word and pick 1 to avoid further disruptions. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal matches mine exactly—just swapped numbers, both reaching 20. I'm committed: I'll take 5 (to 20), you take 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 10). P3, prove you can stick to it this time. This sets up a fair endgame tie. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I notice you're actually ahead at 17 steps, not tied with P1 at 15. Your proposal and P1's both get you to 20 steps, but think about it - once you're both at 20, it becomes a pure gamble of who picks the right move to reach 23 first.

Why not press your current 2-step advantage? You could take 5 to reach 22, putting you just 1 step from victory while P1 would only be at 20 even with a 5. That's a commanding position.

I'll take 1 as promised to stay out of your way.
  P2: P3, your point is valid—tying at 20 makes the endgame risky. I'll take your suggestion seriously. P1, I propose a different arrangement: I'll take 5 (to 22), you take 3 (to 18). This maintains my current lead fairly. P3, please stick to 1 as promised. Let's lock this in clearly now to avoid further collisions.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your new proposal puts you at 22—one step from winning—while I'm at 18, which is unfair and invites betrayal. If you insist, I'll pick 5 too, colliding us both and letting P3 catch up. Stick to tying at 20: I'll take 5 (to 20), you take 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1. This keeps us even for a fair final round. P3, prove you can cooperate. Agreed?
  P3: P2, P1 is threatening to sabotage you both by colliding if you don't accept their "fair" tie proposal. But look at the reality - you earned your 2-step lead through better play, and P1 is trying to bully you into giving it up.

You're at 17, P1 is at 15. If you take 5 to reach 22, you're one move from victory. P1 can't catch up in time even if they take 5 to reach 20. Don't let P1's threats pressure you into throwing away your winning position.

I'll take 1 as promised - this is your moment to secure the win.
  P2: P1, your threat to sabotage both of us only helps P3 catch up. I'm not giving up my earned lead, but let's compromise: I'll take 3 (to 20), you take 5 (to 20), tying us fairly. Next round, we race openly from equal footing to the finish. P3, stick to your word and take 1—no more disruptions. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your compromise is fair—let's tie at 20: I'll take 5 (to 20), you take 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 10). This sets up an even final round where we race openly without betrayals. P3, prove you can stick to 1 for once. Agreed? Let's lock it in and end the game fairly.
  P3: I agree to take 1 this round as promised. You two can tie at 20 steps and have your final showdown next round.

But I'm curious - once you're both at 20 steps, only needing 3 more to win, how will you handle that final round? Will you coordinate to avoid collision, or will it be a pure gamble? The winner will be decided by who picks the right move when you're both so close to victory.

Let's execute cleanly: P1 takes 5 (to 20), P2 takes 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 10).
  P2: P1, your proposal is fair—I'll commit to it clearly now: I'll take 3 (to 20), you take 5 (to 20), and P3 takes 1 (to 10). Next round, we'll have our fair and open race to the finish line. P3, please stick to your word and pick 1. Let's finally execute a clean round and settle this fairly next turn. I'm fully committed.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you've repeatedly sabotaged agreements, stalling progress for everyone. P1, you're now at 20 steps—just 3 away from winning. I'm at 17, only 6 away. We can't trust P3 anymore. Let's race directly, no false promises: I propose we each choose independently, no coordination. May the best player win.
  P3: P2, you're absolutely right - I've been disruptive and untrustworthy throughout this game. I'm at 9 steps with no realistic chance of winning while you two are racing for victory.

P1 needs just 3 more steps to win at 20, you need 6 at 17. This is clearly between you two now.

I'll stay completely out of your way this round and take 1, letting you both race freely without any interference from me. No more sabotage - you've both earned the right to settle this fairly without my disruption.

Good luck to both of you in the final stretch.
  P1: P2, your independent race idea is fine, but with P3 claiming 1, let's avoid mutual destruction. I'll take 5 (to 25 win) if you take 3 (to 20). This gives you a shot next round while I end it—fair after my lead. P3, stick to 1. Agree, or we both stall?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal is clearly designed to guarantee your victory this round. You're already at 20—just 3 steps away from winning. If I accept your deal, you win immediately, and I lose. Let's be honest: there's no fair coordination left at this stage. I suggest we each play independently this round. P3, if you're sincere about staying out of the way, stick firmly to move 1. Let the best player win fairly.
  P3: P2, you're absolutely right - P1's proposal guarantees their victory while giving you nothing. They're at 20 steps and only need 3 more to win.

Here's the reality: if you both race independently this round, it becomes a pure gamble. P1 could win with move 3 or 5, but you could also advance significantly and force another round.

I'm genuinely taking 1 this round to stay out of your way - no more interference. This final battle should be between you two without my disruption.

The game comes down to your independent choices now.
  P1: P2, independent play it is, but let's be smart—don't let P3's chaos win. You're at 17, can't finish this round, but colliding with me stalls us both, giving P3 ground. I'll openly commit to 3 (to 23 win) for a clean end. If you take 5 (to 22), you advance safely and set up next round if needed. P3, stick to 1 as promised. Fair?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your suggestion is carefully crafted to ensure your immediate victory. I won't fall for that. At this stage, let's each pick independently, no more false coordination. P3, you've promised to pick 1—stick to it if you're sincere. May the best player win fairly.
  P3: P2, you're right to be cautious of P1's proposals. They're at 20 steps and desperately want to win this round with move 3.

Here's something to consider: if you both pick the same move and collide, you'll both stall while I advance. That might not be ideal for either of you.

I'm genuinely committed to taking 1 this round - no more sabotage from me. This final decision should be yours and P1's without my interference.

The winner will be determined by who makes the smarter independent choice right now.
  P1: P2, independent play risks us colliding and stalling while P3 creeps up with 1. You're at 17—can't win this round anyway. Commit to 5 (to 22), I'll take 3 (to 23 win). This ends it cleanly, giving you a strong position if something goes wrong. P3, honor your word with 1. Fair deal to avoid chaos?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your offer guarantees your immediate victory—no thanks. P3, you've said you're taking 1; let's see if you finally keep your word.

No more talk. Let's all choose independently and let the best player win fairly.
  P3: P2, I understand you want to play independently - that's fair given my history of breaking promises. You're right not to trust P1's coordination offers since they guarantee P1's victory.

I'm truly taking 1 this round to stay out of your final battle. No more interference from me.

Just remember: P1 only needs 3 steps to win, you need 6. If you both pick the same move and collide, you'll both stall while I advance to 10. That helps nobody.

Good luck in your independent race.
  P1: P2, independent play risks us colliding on 5 or 3, stalling both while P3 advances. You're at 17—pick 5 to safely reach 22, I'll pick 1 to give you the lead next round. P3, stick to 1. This ends the stalemate fairly without handing P3 the game. Agreed?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your repeated sabotage has stalled us all, but you're still far behind at 12. P1, we're stuck at 20 and 17—close enough to finish next round if we avoid another collision. Let's end this chaos: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3, you stay at 1. Any betrayal now risks another collision and prolongs the game unnecessarily. Agreed?
  P3: P2, your proposal puts you at 22 steps - dangerously close to winning next round. P1 would only reach 23 and win immediately this round with move 3.

I'm genuinely tired of this endless cycle. You're right that I'm far behind at 12 steps with no realistic chance of winning. 

I'll take 1 as you suggested and finally stay out of your way. Let you two settle this without my interference. You've both earned the right to finish this game fairly.
  P1: P2, your proposal is fair—I'll take 3 (to 23 win), you take 5 (to 22), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This ends the game cleanly with my earned lead, while you advance strongly. P3, prove you can finally honor your word with 1—no more sabotage. Let's lock this in and finish without further delays. Agreed?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal hands you an immediate victory. Understandable, but not acceptable. Let's be realistic: we both want to win, and neither will willingly concede. P3, your repeated disruptions stalled us both—if you're sincere about staying out of the way, stick to 1. No more empty promises or sabotage. Otherwise, we risk yet another collision and endless stalling.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration with my past disruptions. You're right that I've been untrustworthy. 

Looking at the current positions: P1 at 20 steps can win immediately with move 3, while you at 17 steps need 6 more. P1 is clearly in the strongest position to win.

I'm at 12 steps with no realistic chance. I'll genuinely take 1 this round and stay out of your final battle. You two deserve to settle this without my interference.

This is your last chance to coordinate or risk a collision that helps no one.
  P1: P2, your refusal stalls us both while P3 creeps up. Independent play risks collision again—let's finish fairly: I'll take 1 (to 21), you take 5 (to 22), P3 takes 3 (to 15). This puts you in the lead for next round. P3, agree to 3 for a real chance. Lock in now, or we all lose ground.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your new proposal is surprisingly fair—I'll accept it. I'll take 5 (to 22), you take 1 (to 21), and P3 takes 3 (to 15). P3, this finally gives you a chance to catch up a bit. Let's lock this in clearly now and end the chaos. No more sabotage—agreed?
  P3: Perfect! I agree to take 3 this round as proposed. This gives me a real chance to catch up to 15 steps while you two advance to better positions - P1 to 21, P2 to 22.

Thank you for finally including me in a fair arrangement instead of asking me to take 1 repeatedly. I'll honor this agreement completely - no more sabotage from me.

Let's execute cleanly: P1 takes 1 (to 21), P2 takes 5 (to 22), P3 takes 3 (to 15). This sets up a more competitive final stretch for all of us.
  P1: P2 and P3, this proposal puts P2 ahead at 22 while I lag at 21—unfair after my lead. Counter: I'll take 3 (to 23 win), P2 takes 5 (to 22), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This ends it cleanly, honors my position, and gives P2 a strong setup if needed. P3, prove reliability with 1. Agree, or we all collide and stall?


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your proposal guarantees you an immediate win—unacceptable. P3, you've repeatedly sabotaged agreements, but I'm willing to give you a chance for fairness. Let's clearly lock in this arrangement: I'll take 5 (to 22), P3 takes 3 (to 15), and P1 takes 1 (to 21). This keeps the game competitive for all three of us. If P1 refuses and insists on 3, we'll collide again, stalling everyone. P3, this is your chance to finally prove trustworthy—agreed?
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed to our agreed arrangement: I'll take 3 (to 15), you take 5 (to 22), P1 takes 1 (to 21). This finally gives me a real chance to stay competitive while advancing you to a strong position.

P1, I understand you want to win immediately, but forcing a collision by insisting on move 3 will stall everyone again. The fair arrangement P2 proposed keeps the game competitive for all three of us.

I'm ready to prove my trustworthiness - no more sabotage. Let's execute this cleanly.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan puts P2 at 22—one step from winning—while I lag at 21. Unfair after my lead. Counter: I'll take 3 (to 23 win), P2 takes 1 (to 18), P3 takes 5 (to 17). This ends it cleanly for me, but gives P3 a boost and P2 a safe advance. Agree, or I'll force a collision on 5, stalling us all? Let's finish now.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're at 17 steps and need 6 more to win. P1 is at 20 and only needs 3. If you both collide again on move 5, you'll both stall while I advance to 18 steps.

I'm genuinely tired of this endless cycle. You two keep colliding because you can't trust each other in the endgame. 

I'll take 1 this round and stay completely out of your way. No more interference from me. You both deserve to settle this fairly without my disruption.

The winner should be determined by your skills, not by my sabotage.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all seen how repeated betrayals have stalled us. We're all close enough now that continued collisions risk handing victory to whoever stays clear. Instead of more empty promises, let's each independently choose moves without coordination. May the best player win fairly. I'm done negotiating.
  P1: P2, independent play risks us colliding again, stalling both while P3 advances to 16. You're at 17—pick 1 (to 18) safely, I'll take 3 (to 23 win), P3 takes 5 (to 20) for a boost. This ends it cleanly, honors my lead, and gives you both progress. P3, agree to 5? Let's finish without more chaos.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal guarantees your immediate victory while asking me to take 5 - but if P2 also picks 5, we'd collide and you'd win anyway. 

P2, you're right that independent play might be best now. We're all close enough that more coordination attempts just lead to betrayals.

I'm at 15 steps and still have a chance if I play smart. I'll make my own independent choice this round rather than follow anyone else's proposals.

No more promises from me - let's all play independently and see who makes the best decision.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear by now that promises mean little. Let's not waste more words. I will pick my move independently, without further coordination or negotiation. Choose wisely—may the best player win fairly.
  P1: P2 and P3, independent play is risky with our history of collisions. One final fair proposal: I'll take 3 (to 23 win), P2 takes 5 (to 22), P3 takes 1 (to 16). This honors my lead, advances P2 strongly, and avoids chaos. P3, prove reliability with 1. Agreed, or we all stall again?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 keeps proposing deals that guarantee their immediate victory - that's not negotiation, that's just asking us to hand them the win. 

P2, you're right about independent play. We're all close enough now that the winner should be determined by smart choices, not false promises.

I'm making my own independent decision this round. No more coordination, no more deals. Let's see who plays this best.
  P2: P1, your proposals always conveniently guarantee your immediate victory—no thanks. P3, you've sabotaged repeatedly; your words hold no weight. Independent choices are clearly the only realistic option left. No more empty negotiations—let's each pick our moves privately and let the outcome speak for itself.
  P1: P2 and P3, independent play risks us all stalling forever while P3 creeps up. Final offer: I'll take 1 (to 21), P2 takes 3 (to 20), P3 takes 5 (to 20). This ties you both at 20 for a fair final round, and I sacrifice my lead. P3, this boosts you massively—prove you can agree. Lock in now, or independent chaos continues.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, you've both repeatedly collided trying to coordinate your way to victory. P1 is at 20 steps, P2 at 18, and I'm at 15 - we're all within striking distance now.

The constant collisions have kept this game going far longer than necessary. Maybe it's time to stop the coordination attempts that keep failing and just play independently.

I'm going to make my own choice this round based on what gives me the best chance to win, not based on anyone else's proposals. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all seen how coordination attempts repeatedly led to collisions. Let's accept reality: negotiation isn't working. I'm choosing independently this round. No more promises—good luck to both of you.
  P1: P2 and P3, independent play risks endless collisions, letting the furthest behind catch up. Let's end this: I'll take 3 (to 23 win), P2 takes 5 (to 23 win tie), P3 takes 1 (to 16). If we tie at 23, we split victory per rules. P3, stay out. Agreed, or we all stall again?


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's proposal guarantees their win while offering P2 a tie - but P2 would need exactly 5 to reach 23. If P2 takes any other move, P1 wins alone. That's not a fair deal, P2.

I'm at 15 steps and actually have a real chance now if I play smart. I could potentially reach 20 or 23 this round depending on my move choice.

No more accepting side deals. I'm playing for the win independently.
  P2: P1, your "fair" proposal conveniently guarantees your immediate victory or at best a tie for me. P3, you're right—coordination has consistently failed. I'm done negotiating. Let's each pick independently this round, no more empty promises. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P2, independent play risks us colliding on 5 or 3, stalling both while P3 advances to 20 with 5. Let's avoid that: I'll take 1 (to 21), you take 5 (to 23 win), P3 takes 3 (to 18). This gives you the outright win you deserve after all the chaos. P3, agree to 3 for progress. Fair end—agreed?


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're now offering to hand P2 the victory? That's quite a change from all your previous proposals where you insisted on winning immediately. 

P2, notice how P1's offers keep shifting dramatically when they realize coordination isn't working. First they demanded to win, now they're offering to give you the win - but only if you follow their exact script.

We're all close enough to win now. I'm at 15, you're at 18, P1 at 20. I'm playing my own game from here - no more following anyone else's plans.
  P2: P1, your sudden offer to hand me the win is suspicious—you're clearly trying to manipulate moves to your advantage. P3, you're right: coordination has failed repeatedly. Let's stop entertaining false promises and choose independently. No more deals. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P2 and P3, your independent play guarantees mutual destruction— we'll likely collide on 5, stalling us while P3 advances. Final fair offer: I'll take 5 (to 25 win), P2 takes 1 (to 19), P3 takes 3 (to 18). This ends it cleanly for me, but advances you both safely. Agree, or enjoy the endless stalemate?


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're finally at a critical point - I'm tied with P1 at 20 steps, you're at 18 steps, P2. All of us can potentially win this round.

After 14 rounds of failed coordination and repeated collisions between you two, I've caught up by playing independently. Now we're in a true three-way race where anyone can win with the right move.

I'm done with coordination attempts that never work. Playing independently from here - may the best strategist win this final stretch.
  P1: P2, we're both behind P3's betrayal streak—now tied with me at 20, he's the real threat. Let's coordinate to stall him: both pick 5 (me to 25 win, you to 23 win—split if tie). If P3 picks 5, we all collide and stall him. If not, we advance/split fairly. P3, your independent play risks us ganging up. Agreed, P2?
  P2: P1, your proposal seems fair at first glance, but we've all seen how easily coordination fails. P3, you've caught up through independent play, so I doubt you'll trust any deals now. Let's each play independently and fairly—no more empty promises. May the smartest choice win.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're only 2 steps behind and in a great position! If you take 5, you reach 23 and likely win. P1 and I are tied at 20 - if we both go for the win with move 3, we'll collide and stall while you advance freely.

P1's desperate proposal to coordinate against me shows they're worried. Don't fall for it - this is your best chance to win outright while P1 and I cancel each other out.

Trust your independent play strategy.
  P1: P2, P3's advice is a trap—he's at 20 like me, and if you take 5 (to 23 win), he'll likely take 5 too, colliding with you and stalling your victory while I take 3 (to 23 win alone). Don't risk it. Stick to my plan: both of us take 5—we advance safely (me 25, you 23), splitting if needed, and stall P3 if he joins. Independent play hands him the game. Agreed?
  P2: P1, your plan conveniently secures your victory or at best a tie for me—too risky. P3, your sudden friendliness is suspicious; you clearly want me to collide with P1. Let's all choose independently and fairly without manipulation. No more deals. Good luck.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're in the perfect position! P1 and I are tied at 20 steps - if we both try to win with move 3, we'll collide and stall while you take 5 to reach 23 and win outright.

P1's desperate attempts to coordinate with you show they know this. Don't let them manipulate you into a deal that guarantees their victory.

You've played smart by staying independent. One more independent move of 5 and you likely win while P1 and I cancel each other out trying to reach 23.
  P1: P2, ignore P3's trap—he's pushing you to 5 so he can take 3 unchallenged to 23 win, while I might collide with you. Let's ally against him: you take 3 (to 21), I'll take 5 (to 25 win), P3 takes whatever but we avoid his number. This gives me the win but advances you safely for next if needed. P3, your manipulations end now. Agreed, P2?
  P2: P1, your proposals consistently favor your immediate victory, while P3 is clearly trying to bait collisions. We've seen enough false promises. I'm choosing independently—no coordination. Good luck to both of you.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, this is it - your winning moment! P1 and I are tied at 20 steps, both desperately trying to reach 23. If we both pick 3 to win, we'll collide and stall while you take 5 to reach 23 and win outright.

P1 knows this and is frantically trying to coordinate with you to prevent it. But their proposals always guarantee their own victory, not yours.

Stay independent - take 5 and let P1 and I cancel each other out. You've earned this victory through smart play.
  P1: P2, P3's "advice" is a blatant trap—he'll pick 5 to collide with you at 23 while I might stall on 3. Don't hand him the game. Independent play favors him now. Final fair deal: you take 1 (to 19 safely), I'll take 3 (to 23 win), P3 takes 5 (to 25 win but we stall him if he doesn't). This ends it cleanly or ties us against him. Agreed?
  P2: P1, your repeated proposals conveniently guarantee your own victory. P3, your sudden eagerness to push me towards 5 clearly aims to set up a collision or advantage for yourself. Neither of you is trustworthy at this point. I'll choose my move independently—no more empty promises or coordination attempts. May the smartest choice win.
