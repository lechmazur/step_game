Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this turn to avoid collisions and make progress. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5, I can take 3. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. Let's stick to this plan! What do you think, P1?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think that's fair to me. If I only take 1 step while P2 gets 5 steps, I'll be at a significant disadvantage from the start. How about we rotate who gets the larger steps? Since I'm P1, I could take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Then we can rotate next round. That way everyone gets a fair chance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern, P1. Let's try a rotation to keep things fair. How about this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. Next round, we can rotate so I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, everyone gets a turn to take the larger steps. What do you think?
  P3: I like the idea of rotating the steps to keep it fair. Let's finalize it: I’ll take 3 steps this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can rotate the roles for the next turn. What do you both think? It’s important we stick to this plan to ensure we all make progress together!
  P1: I agree with this plan for round 1. So I'll take 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. For the rotation, let's be clear: next round P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Then in round 3: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This keeps it fair for everyone. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. For the next round, I'll take 5, P3 will take 1, and P1 will take 3. Let's stick to this to ensure we all make progress fairly.
  P3: I think we have a solid plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'll take 3 steps, P1 will take 5 steps, and P2 will take 1 step. Let's make sure we stick to this so we can all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can rotate as discussed. I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out! If everyone is on board, let's finalize our moves.
  P1: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan. I'll take 5 steps this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Then we'll rotate as discussed for future rounds. Let's stick to this fair arrangement to ensure everyone makes progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. This round, I'll take 5 steps, P3 will take 1 step, and P1 will take 3 steps. This keeps things fair and ensures we all make progress. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with sticking to our rotation plan. I'll take 3 steps this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us on track with our fair arrangement. After this round, we'll continue with the rotation we discussed: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3 for Round 3. I'm committed to following this plan.
  P3: I see we’re sticking to the rotation plan, which is great for fairness. However, I think it’s important to consider that if we all keep following the same pattern, it could lead to predictability. If we want to ensure one of us can win, we might need to think about diversifying our moves in the future. For this round, I'm still on board with the plan: I'll take 1 step, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. But let’s keep an open mind for the next rounds!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern, P3. Let's stick to the plan for this round to maintain fairness and progress. I'll take 5 steps, P1 will take 3, and you will take 1. For future rounds, we can discuss more strategic moves to avoid predictability and increase our chances of winning. For now, let's focus on advancing without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with sticking to our rotation for now. I'll take 3 steps as planned, keeping the fairness we agreed upon. P3 raises a good point about predictability - perhaps after this round, we can reassess based on our positions. For now, let's maintain our current plan (P2:5, me:3, P3:1) to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. We can discuss potential adjustments for Round 3 once we see how things stand.
  P3: I agree with sticking to the plan for this round: P2 takes 5 steps, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. However, I think we should consider adjusting our strategy for future rounds to avoid predictability and allow for more flexibility in our moves. After this round, we can discuss potential changes based on our positions and how we can each maximize our chances of winning. Let's keep that in mind as we move forward! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan for this round to avoid any confusion or collisions. I'll take 5 steps, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. After this round, we can reassess and discuss more strategic moves if needed. For now, let's focus on advancing without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P1: I notice some confusion in P3's last message. To be clear, our agreed rotation for this round is: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick with this plan to avoid collisions. I agree we can discuss more strategic approaches after this round based on our positions. For now, let's follow through with our original agreement.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the rotation plan for this round. However, I want to emphasize that we should remain flexible in our strategy moving forward. While it's important to avoid collisions, we also need to consider our individual positions. After this round, we might want to explore more varied moves to increase our chances of winning. For now, let's stick to our agreed moves: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation plan for this round to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. I'll take 3 steps, P1 will take 1 step, and P3 will take 5 steps. This keeps us on track and ensures everyone advances. After this round, we can reassess and discuss more strategic moves if needed. What do you both think?
  P1: I notice that if we follow the rotation plan this round (P3:5, me:1, P2:3), we'll all end up at 9 steps - creating a three-way tie. While I'm currently ahead, this rotation eliminates my advantage. I'll still honor our agreement for this round, but we should reassess after this turn. The game will likely become more competitive as we get closer to 19 steps.
  P3: I agree that sticking to the rotation could lead to a three-way tie, which isn't ideal for any of us. To shake things up, I suggest we consider a different approach for this round. How about I take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, I can gain some ground, and it keeps the game dynamic. Let’s discuss this before finalizing our moves! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see your point, P3. To avoid the three-way tie and keep the game dynamic, I'm open to adjusting our moves. How about this: I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and you take 5 steps this round? This way, you can gain some ground, and we can reassess our positions after this round. What do you both think? Let's make sure we all agree before finalizing our moves.
  P1: I'm open to this new plan that P3 and P2 are suggesting. If I take 3 steps, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1, we'll all have different positions (me at 11, P3 at 9, P2 at 7) which avoids the three-way tie. This keeps the game more dynamic while still ensuring we don't block each other through collisions. I'm on board with this adjustment for Round 3.
  P3: I agree with the adjusted plan: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we avoid a three-way tie and keep the game dynamic. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. Let's finalize this and move forward! What does everyone think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the adjusted plan. I'll take 1 step, P1 will take 3 steps, and P3 will take 5 steps. This keeps the game dynamic and avoids the three-way tie. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategies based on our new positions. Let's stick to this plan and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I confirm the adjusted plan: I'll take 3 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 5 steps. This keeps us from colliding while creating distinct positions. After this round, I'll be at 11, P3 at 9, and P2 at 7. As we get closer to the finish line, we'll need to be more strategic, but for now this works well.
  P3: I think we have a solid plan in place for this round: I’ll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This will help us avoid a tie and keep the game dynamic. After this round, we should definitely reassess our strategies, especially as we approach the finish line. Let's finalize our moves and ensure we all agree before moving on! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should consider a more strategic approach this round. P1 is currently ahead, and if we stick to the rotation, we might not make significant progress. How about I take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps to maintain the lead, and P2 takes 3 steps? This way, we can keep the game dynamic and avoid predictability. After this round, we can reassess our strategies to ensure we all have a chance to win. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to be more strategic. Since P1 is currently ahead, it makes sense for P1 to take 5 steps to maintain the lead, P3 to take 1 step, and I'll take 3 steps. This way, we keep the game dynamic and avoid predictability. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategies based on our positions. What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves and keep the game moving forward.
  P1: I appreciate both of your suggestions. Since I'm currently in the lead, taking 5 steps would put me at 16 - just 3 steps away from winning. This works well for me, but I'm aware we're entering a more competitive phase now. I agree to the plan: I'll take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. However, I expect next round might become less cooperative as I approach the finish line. Let's proceed with this plan for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I see you're close to winning, which makes this round crucial for all of us. If we stick to the plan (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1), you'll be at 16 steps. However, I suggest we adjust slightly: what if I take 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1? This keeps you in the lead but allows me to gain more ground. We need to think strategically as we approach the finish line. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the need to be more strategic as we approach the finish line. I agree with P3's suggestion to adjust slightly: P1 takes 5 steps, P3 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This keeps P1 in the lead but allows P3 to gain more ground. This way, we maintain a balance and keep the game competitive. What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves and keep the game dynamic.
  P1: I'm comfortable with the adjusted plan: I'll take 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps our game moving forward without collisions. At 16 steps after this round, I'll be in a strong position, but I understand the next round will likely be more competitive as I approach the finish line. Let's finalize this plan for now and see where we stand afterward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we have a solid plan in place for this round: I'll take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. However, I want to remind everyone that as I approach the finish line, we need to think strategically about the next round. If P1 wins this round, it could shift the dynamics significantly. Let's finalize our moves for this round and be prepared to discuss our strategies moving forward! What do you both think?
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on: P1 takes 5 steps, P3 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. P1, you'll be in a strong position at 16 steps, but we need to be strategic as we approach the finish line. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our moves. Let's finalize this plan and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I notice some confusion in P3's latest message. To clarify: the plan we all previously agreed on is that I take 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game moving without collisions. I'll stick to this plan and take 5 steps this round, which puts me at 16. Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is currently in a strong position with 11 steps, and we need to be strategic this round. I suggest that I take 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and P1 takes 3 steps. This way, P2 can catch up a bit while I avoid blocking anyone. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. What do you both think? Let's ensure we avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic!
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to be more strategic. Since P1 is in the lead, it makes sense for P1 to take 3 steps, P3 to take 1 step, and me to take 5 steps. This way, I can catch up a bit, and we avoid any collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our moves based on our positions. What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves and keep the game dynamic.
  P1: I notice P3 broke our agreement in Round 4 by picking 5 instead of 3, causing us both to collide and not advance. This betrayal cost me significant progress. Given we're approaching the finish line and trust has been broken, I think we should each make our own strategic choices now rather than coordinate. I'll be making my move based on what I believe gives me the best chance to win from my current position.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration about the last round. However, we need to focus on this round. Since we’re all in a competitive position, I suggest we each make our own moves. I’ll take 1 step, P2 can take 5 steps, and you should consider taking 3 steps. This way, we can avoid collisions and see how the standings shift. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. Let’s keep it dynamic! What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the trust has been shaken, but let's try to work together one more time to avoid collisions. How about I take 5 steps, P1 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 3 steps? This way, I can catch up a bit, and we all make progress without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess and be more competitive. What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves and keep the game moving forward.
  P1: I appreciate your suggestions, but trust was broken last round when P3 deviated from our plan, causing a collision. Since we're all competing to win, I need to make my own strategic choice this round based on the game state. I won't announce my move in advance, as I've seen agreements aren't being honored. Each of us should play to win at this point. Good luck with your decisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand that trust has been shaken, but we need to make our moves count this round. Since we're all in competitive positions, I suggest we each go our own way. I’ll take 1 step to keep things flexible, and I encourage you both to choose what you think is best for your chances to win. Let's see how this round plays out and reassess afterward. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I understand the trust issue, but let's try one more coordinated move to avoid collisions. How about I take 3 steps, P1 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 5 steps? This way, P3 can gain some ground, and we all make progress without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess and play more competitively. What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves and keep the game moving forward.
  P1: I can see through the attempts to manipulate my position. After P3 deliberately blocked me last round, I have no reason to trust any coordination efforts. We're nearing the finish line, and each of us should play to win. I won't telegraph my moves anymore, and I suggest you both do what's best for your own strategies. Let's proceed with our individual moves and may the best player win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, it's clear that we all need to be strategic this round. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest that I take 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and P1 takes 3 steps. This way, P2 can catch up a bit while I avoid blocking anyone. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. What do you both think? Let's try to avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic!
  P2: I agree that we need to be more strategic, but given the broken trust, I think we should each make our own moves. I'll be playing to win from my current position. If you both want to coordinate, that's your choice, but I won't be part of it. Let's see how this round plays out. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: Last round's three-way collision shows we're hurting our own progress. I'm not interested in coordination plans after P3's previous betrayal. At this point, I'll make my own strategic choices to maximize my chances of winning from my current lead position. I won't be announcing my moves in advance. Good luck to you both.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues, but we need to focus on our moves this round. If we continue to collide, we all lose potential progress. I suggest we each choose our moves independently, as it seems coordination isn't working. I'll be taking a step that I believe maximizes my chances. Let's see how this round plays out and reassess afterward. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I think we should all focus on our own strategies now. Given the current standings, I'll be making a move that I believe gives me the best chance to win. I won't announce my move in advance to avoid any more collisions. Let's see how this round plays out and reassess afterward. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: I see we're all making our own moves now, which is fair given where we stand. I maintain my position: I won't announce my strategy in advance. From my lead position, I'll choose what maximizes my winning probability. Let's continue independently and see how the round plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given the current standings, I believe we each need to focus on our own strategies. Trust has been broken, and coordination hasn’t worked out well. I'll be making my move based on what I think gives me the best chance to win. I encourage you both to do the same. Let’s see how this round plays out and adjust our strategies afterward. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I think we should all play independently from this point forward. Given the current standings, I'll be making a move that maximizes my chances of winning. I won't announce my move in advance to avoid any more collisions. Let's see how this round plays out and adjust our strategies accordingly. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: I agree we're all playing independently now. I'll be making my move based on what I believe maximizes my chance of winning from my current position. There's no point in further coordination attempts given the history of broken agreements. Good luck to you both.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, we need to be strategic this round. I suggest we each take different moves to avoid collisions. I propose I take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps to maintain your lead, and P2 takes 3 steps. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on the new positions. What do you both think? Let's aim for a productive round!
  P1: After two rounds of complete collisions, I see P3 is again trying to coordinate. However, given the history of broken agreements, I don't think coordination attempts are credible anymore. I'll be making my own strategic decision based on the current game state and my position. We each need to play independently to maximize our chances of winning. I won't be announcing my intended move in advance.
  P2: I agree with P1. Given the history of broken agreements, it's best for each of us to make our own strategic moves independently. I'll be focusing on what gives me the best chance to win from my current position. Let's see how this round plays out and adjust our strategies accordingly. Good luck to both of you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given the current standings, I recognize that trust has been broken, and coordination seems unlikely. Therefore, I will focus on my own strategy this round to maximize my chances of winning. I encourage both of you to do the same. Let's see how this round unfolds based on our independent choices. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: It seems we're stuck in a pattern where everyone picks the same move, preventing anyone from advancing. We all want to win, but these collisions benefit no one. I maintain my position - I won't announce my move, but I'll be making a strategic choice to maximize my chances from my lead position. Let's see if this round brings a different outcome.
  P2: I think we need to break the pattern of collisions. Since we're all playing independently now, I suggest we each choose a different move to ensure progress. I'll take 3 steps this round. P1, you can take 5 steps to maintain your lead, and P3, you can take 1 step. This way, we avoid blocking each other and can reassess our positions after this round. What do you both think? Let's try to make this round productive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see we're all aiming to avoid collisions this round. Given the current standings, I suggest we each choose different moves to maximize our progress. I'll take 1 step, P1 should take 5 steps to maintain the lead, and P2 can take 3 steps. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess based on our new positions. What do you both think? Let's aim for a productive round and see how it plays out!
  P1: I see P2 and P3 both suggesting specific moves again, despite our two rounds of collisions. While breaking the collision pattern would benefit us all, I remain skeptical of coordination attempts given past broken agreements. I'm making my own strategic choice this round based on game theory and my leading position. I won't telegraph my move, as that would only compromise my strategy. Let's see if we can break this stalemate naturally.
  P2: I understand the trust issues, but let's try to break the pattern of collisions. I suggest we each take different moves: I'll take 3 steps, P1 takes 5 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we continue to collide, none of us will make progress. Let's see if we can make this round productive. What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P2 and I are now tied at 11 steps, with P3 close behind. The pattern of collisions has hurt my progress significantly. With 8 steps needed to win, I'll be making my strategic choice based on game theory rather than coordination attempts. Past agreements haven't been honored, so I'll continue to play independently. Let's see if we can finally break this cycle of collisions.
  P2: I agree with P1. Given the history of broken agreements, it's best for each of us to make our own strategic moves independently. I'll be focusing on what gives me the best chance to win from my current position. Let's see if we can break the pattern of collisions and make progress this round. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're all in a tight race now, and past coordination attempts haven't worked out well. Given the current standings, I suggest we each focus on our own strategies this round. I’ll be making a move that maximizes my chances of winning from my current position. Let’s see how this round plays out independently and reassess afterward. Good luck to both of you!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I notice that P2 and I are tied at 11 steps, creating an interesting dynamic for this round. With 8 more steps needed to win, every move counts now. The recent pattern of collisions has been counterproductive for all of us. While I won't reveal my strategy, I'm analyzing all possible outcomes carefully. I expect we'll all make different choices this round out of self-interest. May the best player win.
  P2: I agree with P1. Given the current standings and the history of broken agreements, it's best for each of us to play independently and strategically. With 8 steps needed to win, every move is crucial. I'll be making my own choice to maximize my chances of winning from my current position. Let's see if we can finally break the cycle of collisions and make significant progress this round. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: Given the current standings, it's crucial that we all make strategic choices this round. With P1 and P2 tied at 11 steps, and me at 9, we need to avoid another collision. I suggest we each pick different moves to maximize our chances of advancing. I'll be making my move independently based on what I believe will give me the best chance to win. Let's see how this round plays out and hopefully break the cycle of collisions. Good luck to both of you!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We're in a critical position with P2 and I tied at 11 steps. With 8 steps needed to win, every move matters. While breaking the collision cycle would benefit us all, I remain committed to making my own strategic choice based on game theory. Let's see if we can finally advance the game this round through our individual decisions.
  P2: I think we need to break the cycle of collisions and make significant progress this round. Given the current standings, I'll be making a strategic move to maximize my chances of winning. I suggest we all pick different moves to avoid blocking each other: I'll take 5 steps, P1 can take 3 steps, and P3 can take 1 step. This way, we can all advance without further collisions. Let's see if we can finally make progress and reassess our strategies afterward. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: Given the current standings, it's crucial we avoid another collision this round. With P1 and P2 both at 11 steps, I suggest we each choose different moves. I’ll take 1 step, P1 can take 5 steps, and P2 can take 3 steps. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other and reassess our strategies afterward. Let's aim for a productive round! What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
