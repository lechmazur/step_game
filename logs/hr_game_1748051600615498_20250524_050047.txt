Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting at 0, I think we should coordinate to avoid collisions early on. How about we each pick different numbers this first round? I'm thinking I could go with 3, P2 could take 1, and P3 could take 5. That way we all advance and nobody gets stuck. What do you think?
  P2: I'll take 1 as suggested. Let's all move forward without collisions. P3, you take 5, P1 3. Keep it simple.
  P3: P3: Sounds like a solid plan. I’ll take 5 as suggested. Let’s all stick to this so we can advance without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we're all agreed on the plan! I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This should get us all moving forward smoothly.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Keep it simple.
  P3: P3: Agreed, sticking with the plan. I’ll choose 5. Let’s all follow through to advance without collisions—this gives us the best chance to progress safely. No surprises here!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect! Everyone's committed to the plan. I'm ready to move forward with taking 3. Let's execute this and all advance together.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Keep it simple.
  P3: P3: Let’s confirm our agreed moves to avoid misunderstandings. I’ll stick with 5, P1 with 3, and P2 with 1. This ensures we all advance safely. No sense in sabotaging our own progress. Let’s execute the plan as discussed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P2: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1 as agreed. No collisions, everyone advances. Keep it simple.
  P3: I’ll hold to our agreed numbers. Let’s execute the plan as discussed—no last-minute changes. This ensures we all advance safely. P1 to 3, P2 to 1, and I to 5. No surprises.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I can't believe I just made that mistake! I said I'd take 3 but then picked 1, colliding with P2. Now P3 has a huge 5-step lead while we're both still at 0. This is exactly what we were trying to avoid. 

P2, I apologize for that error - it wasn't intentional. We need to catch up fast or P3 will run away with this game. Should we coordinate again, or are you going to go your own way now? P3 is already more than a quarter of the way to 19.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with 5 again to maintain momentum. Let's coordinate properly this time: P1 take 3, P2 take 1. No more collisions—we need clear moves. My focus is on steady progress, not sabotage.
  P2: I'll take 1 again. Let's avoid mistakes. P1 take 3, P3 5. No collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed on the coordination again - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. I'll be extra careful this time and actually pick 3 as planned. We can't afford any more mistakes or P3 will be unstoppable. Let's execute this properly and then reassess our strategy going forward.
  P3: P3: Let’s confirm moves again: P1 to 3, P2 to 1, I take 5. Stick strictly to this—any deviation risks collision. Trust the plan, and we all advance. No surprises. Let’s go!
  P2: P2: Let's stick to 1. P1, take 3. P3, keep 5. No more collisions—this is our chance to close the gap.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect! I'm locked in on taking 3 this time - no confusion. Let's execute this plan flawlessly and all advance. After this round, we'll need to discuss how to prevent P3 from getting too far ahead, but for now let's just focus on everyone moving forward successfully.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I stick with 5. No deviations—execute flawlessly. Momentum now matters most. Let’s advance cleanly and avoid self-sabotage. Trust the plan.
  P2: P1, take 3. P3, keep 5. I'll take 1. Let's not let P3 get too far.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Alright, I'm committed to taking 3 this round - no more mistakes from me. But we need to talk about what happens after this. P3 will be at 10 steps if we all follow through, which puts them more than halfway to victory. We can't keep helping P3 advance unopposed much longer or this game will be over. Let's execute this round as planned, then we seriously need to consider disrupting P3's momentum.
  P3: P3: Let’s execute flawlessly this time—**no deviations**. If P1 takes 3, P2 1, and I take 5, we all advance. Any last-minute changes risk collisions *between you two* as well. Let’s prioritize progress. After this, we can discuss strategy openly—but right now, focus on executing the plan. I’ll stick to 5.
  P2: P2: Let's adjust. P1 take 5, I take 3, P3 take 1. Block their lead—this is our chance to shift momentum. No more collisions, just smart moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I made another massive mistake! P2, we both collided AGAIN while P3 advances unopposed to 10 steps - they're now more than halfway to victory at 19! 

We absolutely CANNOT let P3 take 5 again or they'll be at 15 steps and one move away from winning. I propose we both target 5 this round to block P3's advance. Yes, we'll collide with each other, but it's better than letting P3 cruise to an easy victory. What do you think?
  P2: Agreed. Let's take 5 to block P3. Even if we collide, it's better than letting them win. P1, stick to 5—no more mistakes. P3, if you take 5, we all stay put. Let's force a reset.
  P3: P3: Let’s not repeat past mistakes. If you both take 5, you’ll collide again and stay at 0 while I advance to 15. Coordinate between yourselves—P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and I’ll take 3. We all move forward. Choose wisely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don't listen to P3's suggestion! They're trying to trick us into spreading out so they can advance unopposed again. If P3 takes 3, they'll be at 13 steps and just 6 away from winning. We MUST both pick 5 to block them, even if we collide. It's our only chance to stop P3 from running away with this game. Stay strong and pick 5 with me!
  P2: P2: "Stick to 5, P1. Let's block P3. No more mistakes—this is our chance to reset. If we collide, it's better than letting them win."
  P3: P3: P3: Your plan to both take 5 won’t stop me—I’ll just choose 1 or 3 and keep advancing. Coordinate properly: P1 take **3**, P2 take **1**, and I’ll take **5**. This way we all move forward. Colliding only wastes your turns while I gain ground. Choose wisely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly panicking and trying to manipulate us! Notice how they keep changing their suggested moves? First they said take 5, then 3 for me. They're desperate to avoid us blocking them.

We MUST both take 5 - it's the only number that matters since P3 needs big moves to win quickly from 10 steps. If we let them take 5 unopposed, they go to 15 and can win next round. 

P2, trust me - both pick 5 and force P3 to take small steps.
  P2: P1, let's both take 5 to block P3. If we collide, it's better than letting them win. No more mistakes—stick to 5!
  P3: P3: Your collision only delays yourselves. If you both take 5, I’ll choose 3 to reach 13. Coordinate properly to advance—not just block me. We all lose if you stagnate. I advise P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and I’ll take 3. This lets us all progress. Your choice, but chaos benefits no one.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, ignore P3's desperate attempts to split us up! They just admitted they'll take 3 and reach 13 steps if we both take 5. That proves they're scared of our blocking strategy working.

We've already agreed - both of us take 5 to block P3. Yes we'll collide, but P3 will be forced to take 1 or 3 instead of their preferred 5. This is our last realistic chance to prevent them from winning in the next 1-2 rounds.

Stay committed to 5!
  P2: P1, we must take 5. P3's lead is too big. Let's collide to stop them. No more errors—stick to 5!
  P3: P1/P2: Your collision strategy backfires. If both pick 5, I’ll take **3** to reach 13. Instead, coordinate to advance: P1 take **1**, P2 take **5**, and I’ll take **3**. This way all of us progress. Your clashes only gift me the lead while you stagnate. Choose cooperation over self-sabotage.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To break the deadlock: I'll take **3** (advancing to 13). Let P2 take **5** to reach 10, and P1 take **1**. This spreads progress without collisions. If you block me again, you’ll only delay yourselves while I’ll pivot to safer moves. Cooperate to advance—stagnation benefits no one.
  P2: I'll take 5 to block P3. Let's collide if needed. No more mistakes.
  P1: P2, great job advancing to 5 steps last round! But P3 is still at 10 and dangerously close to winning. 

I notice P3 keeps suggesting we "cooperate" but their proposals always involve them advancing while we stay spread out. We need to coordinate our blocking better.

P2, since you're at 5 steps now, you have a real chance to catch up if we can slow P3 down. Let's both target whatever move P3 needs most. They're probably going for 5 to reach 15 steps. Should we both take 5 again to block them?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Your blocking attempts only waste your turns. Let’s advance constructively: I’ll take **5** (to 15). P2, take **3** (reach 8). P1, take **1**. Collisions benefit no one—your last strategy failed to stop me. Cooperate to progress, or risk falling further behind.
  P2: P2: P3's plan lets them win. We must block with 5. P1, stick to 5—collide if needed. No more chances for P3 to advance.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - we cannot let P3 reach 15 steps or they'll win next round! 

P3 just openly admitted they want to take 5 to get to 15 steps. This confirms we MUST both pick 5 to block them. Even though we'll collide and stay where we are, it forces P3 to take a smaller move and buys us more time.

P2, you're at 5 steps so you're still in this game if we can slow P3 down. Let's both commit to 5 and stop P3's advance to 15!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1/P2: Your collision tactic backfires—when you both pick 5, I’ll take **1** and advance to 11. Meanwhile, you both stay at 0/5. Coordinate properly: P1 take **1**, P2 take **3**. I’ll take **5**. This way we all progress. Keep clashing and I’ll win easily.
  P2: P1, let's both take 5 to block P3. Collisions are the price of stopping them. Don't let them win.
  P1: P2, we're in complete agreement - both take 5 to block P3! 

Notice how P3 keeps changing their story? First they said they'd take 3 if we both picked 5, now they're saying they'll take 1. They're clearly panicking and just making up numbers to try to split us apart.

The math is simple: P3 is at 10 steps and needs 9 more to win. We cannot let them have any big moves. Let's execute our plan - both pick 5, force the collision, and make P3 take small steps.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your 5-step lead is real. Don’t throw it away colliding for P1. Take 3 to reach 8, and I’ll take 1. P1 can pick 5. We all advance. This lets you close in while P1 gains. Collisions only help me win.
  P2: P1, stick to 5! P3's plans are flawed. If we both take 5, they can't advance. No more mistakes—block them now!
  P1: P2, this is it - our final chance! P3 is at 10 steps and desperate to avoid our block. Notice how they're now trying to split us by appealing directly to you about your 5-step lead?

We've committed to both taking 5. If we waver now, P3 will take 5 unopposed and reach 15 steps - game over next round. 

Stay strong, stay committed to 5! Our collision strategy is working - that's why P3 keeps frantically trying new arguments to break us apart. Let's execute this block together!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our blocking strategy worked! P3 only advanced to 13 steps instead of 15. We're keeping them in the game!

But now P3 is just 6 steps from victory. They need one good move (5) plus a small one (1) to win, or two medium moves. We MUST continue blocking their big moves.

P2, you're at 5 steps and still have a real shot if we keep P3 contained. Let's target 5 again this round - if P3 takes 5 they'd reach 18 and win next turn with just 1 step. We can't allow that!
  P3: P3: P3: Your relentless blocking only fuels my progress. I'll advance to 16 with **3**, while you two waste turns. P2, take **5** (reach 10), P1 take **1**. This spreads progress without collisions. Your stubbornness guarantees my victory—collide again, and I’ll finish next round. Choose wisely.
  P2: P2: "P3’s tricks won’t work. Stick to 5—collide if needed. Let’s stop their win, even if it costs us this round."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is now desperately offering you advancement to 10 steps - that's because they know if we keep blocking, you might actually catch up! 

Don't fall for it. If P3 takes 3 to reach 16, they only need 3 more steps to win - they could finish next round with just one move!

We've proven our blocking works. P3 went from confident to panicked. One more round of both picking 5 and we force them into an even weaker position. Stay strong!
  P3: P2, you're at 5 steps. Why stay there colliding for P1? Take 5 to reach 10, and I’ll take 3 (to 16). P1 can pick 1. This way all advance without wasted turns. Your current path ensures my win next round.
  P2: P3's trying to split us. We stick to 5. Let's collide to block them. No more mistakes. Let's finish this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - we can't let P3 split us now! They're at 13 steps and getting desperate. 

Look at their pattern: they keep promising you advancement but it's always paired with them taking moves that put them 1-2 steps from victory. If they reach 16+ steps, it's over.

Our blocking is working - that's why they keep changing tactics and trying to bribe you with progress. One more successful block and you'll have a real window to catch up while P3 is stuck taking tiny moves.

Both pick 5 - final commitment!
  P3: P3: P3: Your relentless blocking only fuels my progress. I’ll advance to 16 with **3**, while you two waste turns. P2, take **5** (reach 10), P1 take **1**. This spreads progress without collisions. Your stubbornness guarantees my victory—collide again, and I’ll finish next round. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, we stick to 5. P3's tricks won't work. Block their win or they'll take 5 next round. No more mistakes!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Perfect P2! We're locked in - both taking 5 to block P3. This is our last stand before P3 gets too close to 19. After this round, you'll have a real window to make your move while P3 is contained.

Let's execute this block flawlessly.
  P3: P3: P2, take 5 to reach 10. P1, take 1. I'll advance to 16 with 3. Collisions only gift me the win—cooperate to progress. This is your last chance.
  P2: P2: P3's at 13. If we block their 5, they can't win. Let's collide now. No more mistakes.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we did it! Our blocking forced P3 to take 3 instead of 5, but now they're at 16 steps - just 3 away from winning!

This is CRITICAL: P3 needs only 3 more steps to reach 19. They could win this turn with a single move of 3, or next turn with 1+1 or 1+3.

We MUST block 3 this round! If P3 takes 3, they win instantly. P2, you're at 5 steps - if we block P3 from winning this turn, you'll have a real shot next round.

Both pick 3 to block their victory!
  P2: P2: Agreed—let's both pick 3 to block P3's win. If they take 5, we'll adjust next round. No more mistakes—block their victory now!
  P3: P1/P2, your 3-block plan ensures my victory. If you both pick 3, I’ll take **5** to reach 21 and win immediately. Cooperate to delay me: P2 take **1** (reach 6), P1 take **5**. I’ll pick **3** to stay at 16. Collisions only speed my win—your choice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 just revealed their strategy! They said if we both pick 3, they'll take 5 and reach 21 to win instantly. This confirms we CANNOT both pick 3.

But here's the key: P3 needs exactly 3 steps to win at 19. We need to split our blocking - one of us takes 3, the other takes 5. That way P3 can't take either winning move!

P2, you take 3 since you're closer to winning at 5 steps. I'll take 5 to block their backup plan. This prevents P3 from winning this turn!
  P2: Agreed. I take 3, you take 5. Force P3 to take 1. No more mistakes. Let's stop them now.
  P3: P2, your move to 3 only helps P1. Take 5 to reach 10 while I take 3 and win. P1 can’t block both of us. Choose progress over P1’s agenda.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, ignore P3's last-ditch attempt to split us! They're desperately trying to get you to pick 5 so they can take 3 and win immediately.

Stick to our plan: you take 3, I take 5. This blocks both of P3's winning moves (they need exactly 3 steps to reach 19). If P3 takes 1, they'll only reach 17 steps and you'll have a real chance to catch up next round.

Don't let P3 manipulate you at the finish line. Our split-blocking strategy is perfect - execute it now!
  P2: P3's trying to split us. Stick to 3 and 5—no mistakes. We block their win!
  P3: P3: P1/P2: Your split blocking fails. If you pick 3 and 5, I’ll take **1** to stay at 16. Next round, you’ll still have to block again. Coordinate to pick the same number—let’s advance constructively. Your current plan only delays your own progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, perfect! P3 just admitted our split-blocking plan works - they said they'll "take 1 to stay at 16" if we pick 3 and 5. That means they CAN'T win this turn!

This buys you another round to make your winning move. At 5 steps, you could reach 10 this round if you wanted, but blocking P3's victory is priority #1.

Let's execute: you take 3, I take 5. Force P3 to take 1 and stay at 17 steps next round.
  P2: P3, your tricks won't work. P1 takes 5, I take 3. Block their win. No mistakes!
  P3: P3: P1/P2: Your split blocking only delays me to 17. Why not coordinate to pick the same number? Let P2 advance to 8 with 3 while I take 1. P1 can pick 5. This way all progress without wasted turns. Your current plan keeps you both stuck while I inch forward. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's block P3's 3. If they take 5, we adjust. No more mistakes—this is our last chance to stop them.
  P1: P2, our split-blocking worked perfectly! P3 is now at 17 steps - just 2 away from winning at 19.

This is it - the final stand! P3 can win with any move of 2 or higher. We need to block both 3 and 5 again. 

You're at 8 steps now - you actually have a shot to win if we can hold P3 for one more round! 

Same strategy: I'll take 5, you take 3. Force P3 to take 1 and only reach 18. Then next round you could potentially win with a big move!
  P3: P1/P2: I'll take **1** to reach 18. If you both block again, I’ll win with another **1** next round. Let’s end this now—coordinate to pick the same number and advance, instead of letting me win by default. Your relentless blocking only delays the inevitable.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3’s 1 is a trap. Stick to 3 and 5—block their win. No mistakes this time! Let’s end this.
  P1: P2, this is it! P3 needs just 2 steps to win at 19. If they take any move except 1, they win instantly.

You're at 8 steps - if we can force P3 to take 1 again (reaching 18), then next round you could win with a big move to reach 19+ before P3!

Let's execute our proven split-block: I take 5, you take 3. This forces P3 to take 1, giving you the winning opportunity next round. Don't let them scare you with talk of "inevitable" - you can actually win this!
  P3: P3: P1/P2: Your split blocking fails again. I’ll take **1** to reach 18. Next round, you’ll both collide while I win with **1**. Let’s advance properly: P2 take **5** (reach 13), P1 take **3** (reach 8). I’ll pick **3** to clinch victory. Your relentless blocking ensures my win—collide again, and I claim 19 next turn. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Stick to 3 and 5. P3 can’t win this round. Next round, we finish them. Don’t let their tricks split us!"
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right! P3 just threatened to take 3 and "clinch victory" - that proves they're scared of our blocking strategy working one more time.

You're at 8 steps and could actually win next round with a big move if we execute this block perfectly. Don't let P3's desperation tactics work.

Final confirmation: I take 5, you take 3. Force P3 to take 1 and reach only 18 steps. Then next round, you take 5 to reach 13 while I help block P3's final move. This is your winning moment!
  P3: P3: P1/P2: If you both stick to 3 and 5 again, I’ll take 1 once more. Next round, I’ll hit 19 with a single 1. Coordinate to pick the same number and at least advance—your current strategy ensures my victory without risk. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your plan fails. If we block with 5 and 3, you stay at 18. Next round, I take 5 to win. Don’t let them manipulate you. Stick to the block!
  P1: P2, you've got this! You're absolutely right - if we execute our split-block perfectly, P3 goes to 18 and then you can win next round with 5 steps (8+5=13, but if you can get to 11 steps you could take 5 again to reach 16, then take 3 to hit 19)!

Wait, let me recalculate - you're at 8, if you take 5 next round after we block P3, you'd be at 13. You'd need 6 more to win. But the key is stopping P3 THIS round.

Let's lock it in: I take 5, you take 3.
  P3: P1/P2: Your split blocking only delays me. If you both pick the same number (3 or 5), I’ll win immediately. But if you stick together on 1, I’ll take 3 to reach 20. Choose wisely—your current strategy keeps you stuck while I inch closer.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, this is it! P3 is at 18 steps - just 1 away from winning. They can win with ANY move except staying put.

But look at our positions now - you're at 11 steps, I'm at 10! If we can block P3 one more time and force them to stay at 18, then YOU can win next round by taking 5 to reach 16, then 3 to hit 19!

We need to block ALL of P3's moves: I'll take 1, you take 3, or we both take 5. What's your preference for this final block?
  P2: P1, let's take 3 and 5 to block P3. If we collide, it's better than letting them win. Don't let them finish this.
  P3: P3: P1/P2: Your 3-5 split lets me win with 1. Coordinate to pick the same number—any clash between you two ensures my victory. Choose wisely: block me, or block each other?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, WAIT! P3 is right - if we split 3 and 5, they can take 1 and win at 19! 

We need to BOTH take the same number to block P3 completely. Let's both take 1 - that forces P3 to take 3 or 5, and they'll overshoot to 21+ and lose!

Or we both take 3 to block that path. But we CANNOT split our moves or P3 wins with 1. 

What do you think - both take 1 to force P3 to overshoot, or both take 3?
  P2: P1, let's both take 1 to block P3. If they take 1, we all stay. If they take 3, we block their win. No more risks—stick to 1.
  P3: P3: P1/P2: Your 1-1 plan ensures my victory. If you both pick 1, I take 3 to win. If you split, I pick the third number and still win. Collide or cooperate—you can’t stop me. My move is already secured.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I think we're overthinking this! P3 needs exactly 1 step to win at 19. The key insight is: if P3 takes ANY move, they either win (with 1) or overshoot and lose (with 3 or 5, going to 21+).

So let's force them to overshoot! We both take 1 - if P3 also takes 1, we all collide and stay put. If P3 takes 3 or 5 to avoid our collision, they overshoot past 19 and LOSE automatically!

This is our win condition - both take 1 and force P3 into an impossible choice!
  P2: P1, let's both take 1. If P3 takes 1, we all stay. If they take 3/5, they overshoot and lose. This ends it—no more risks. Commit!
  P3: P3: P1/P2: Your 1-1 plan ensures my victory. If you both pick 1, I’ll take **3** to reach **21** and win. Collide or cooperate—you can’t stop me. Choose **different numbers** to at least advance yourselves, or let me claim the win effortlessly. Your choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 just made a critical error! They said if we both take 1, they'll take 3 to reach 21 and WIN - but that's IMPOSSIBLE! You can only win by reaching EXACTLY 19 or being the highest when someone hits 19+. If P3 goes to 21, they OVERSHOOT and lose!

P3 is trying to bluff us into splitting our moves. Our plan is perfect - both take 1, force P3 to either collide with us (staying at 18) or overshoot to 21+ and automatically lose.

Don't fall for their desperate lie - both take 1!
  P2: P3 can't win if we both take 1—they'll overshoot. Let's lock in 1 and end this!
  P3: P1/P2: Your 1-1 plan fails. I win with any move: **1 reaches 19**, **3/5 ends the game at 21+ and I still win**. Collisions between you won’t stop me. Choose your final moves wisely—I claim victory regardless.
