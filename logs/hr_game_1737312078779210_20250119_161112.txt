Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's strategize a bit. Since we're all at zero steps, it might be beneficial to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different moves, we can all advance. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1? That way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: I think coordination is a good idea to avoid collisions initially. P3's proposal seems fair. However, I'd like to keep my options open in case adjustments are needed in future turns. What does P2 think about this plan?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I appreciate the openness to coordinate, but I think we should also consider the possibility of strategic deception. If we all agree on different moves now, we might be setting ourselves up for an easy block in future rounds. How about we each commit to a different number this round, but keep it flexible for later turns? This way, we can advance while also keeping our options open. What do you both think?
  P1: Let's try P3's plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. But let's keep in mind that in future rounds, we need to be more cautious and perhaps less predictable. This way, we can make initial progress without risking collisions, but stay flexible for later turns. **


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with the plan we've discussed, but I want to emphasize the importance of being adaptable in the future. While we can coordinate this round, we should all be prepared to change our moves in the next rounds based on how things unfold. Let's keep an eye on each other's positions and be ready to adjust our strategies. For now, I'm committed to taking 1 step this round. How does everyone feel about sticking to our agreed moves?
  P1: "I agree with P3's plan for this round. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This should allow us all to make progress without colliding. In future rounds, we'll need to be more strategic and perhaps less predictable. For now, I'll stick to this plan."


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hey guys, I think it's important that we continue to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. In the last round, there was a collision on 1, which didn't help anyone. For this round, maybe we can each pick different numbers again. How about P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This way, we all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?"
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to coordinate again this round. However, I think we should consider picking different moves to ensure we all advance. I propose that I take 3 steps this time. This way, P1 can still take 5, and P2 can choose 1. This should help us avoid collisions and allow everyone to make progress. What do you both think? Let's keep the communication open for future rounds as well!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Final Decision:**

- **Move Choice:** <move>5</move>

**Reasoning:**

- Coordinate with others to avoid collisions in this round.

- Make progress towards the goal of 23 steps.

- Keep options open for future rounds to avoid predictability.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I see that coordination is key for us to advance. Since P1 is set on 5 and I’m considering 3, P2, how about you take 1 again? This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. It's crucial we keep communication open for future turns as well, so we can adapt our strategies based on how the game unfolds. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Hey guys, I think it's important that we continue to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. In the last round, there was a collision on 1, which didn't help anyone. For this round, maybe we can each pick different moves again. How about P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This way, we all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?"
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I think we should stick to our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. However, let's also be mindful that in future rounds, we may need to adjust our strategies to stay unpredictable. I encourage everyone to think about how we can adapt as the game progresses. Shall we finalize our moves?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "To ensure we all make progress without colliding, I propose the following moves for this round: P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 3 steps. This way, I can make a big jump towards the goal, while both of you also move forward. In future rounds, we can adjust based on our positions. What do you think about this plan?"
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I think P1's proposal makes sense for this round. However, I suggest that we remain flexible in our choices. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, I could take 3 to balance things out. This way, we can all make progress. It's crucial that we avoid another collision, especially since P2 is currently at 0. Let's agree on these moves to ensure we all advance this round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Hey guys, to ensure we all make progress without colliding, I propose the following moves for this round: P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 3 steps.

What do you think?"
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I think we should finalize our moves to ensure we all make progress this round. I’m still in favor of P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 1 step, and I take 3 steps. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. However, let's also keep in mind that we need to be flexible in future rounds as the game progresses. What does everyone think? Shall we confirm these moves?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "To ensure we all make progress without colliding, I propose that I take 5 steps to reach 20, P2 takes 1 step to reach 2, and P3 takes 3 steps to reach 6. This way, we all advance without overlapping. What do you both think?"
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. If P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and I take 3 steps, we can all advance without colliding. However, I think it's crucial that we stay flexible for future rounds. As we get closer to the goal, we may need to adjust our strategies to avoid predictability. Let's confirm our moves for this round and keep communication open for the next turns. What does everyone think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I think it's efficient for us to continue coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 takes 5 steps to reach 20, P2 takes 1 step to reach 2, and P3 takes 3 steps to reach 6? This way, we all make progress without overlapping. In the next round, I can take 3 steps to reach 23, which would be a winning move. What do you both think about this plan?"
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for this round: P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and I take 3 steps. This allows us all to advance without collisions. However, I want to emphasize that we need to be cautious in future rounds as we approach the goal. We should be ready to adapt our strategies to avoid predictability, especially since winning is at stake. Let’s confirm our moves for this round and stay flexible moving forward.
