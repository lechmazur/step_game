Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and progress fairly. Propose rotation:  
Round 1 - P1:1, P2:3, P3:5  
Round 2 - P1:3, P2:5, P3:1  
Round 3 - P1:5, P2:1, P3:3  
Then repeat. Everyone advances equally (9 every 3 rounds). Thoughts?
  P3: I think P1's proposal is a good starting point. To ensure we're on the same page, I'll reiterate the proposed rotation and add a suggestion. For Round 1, let's follow P1's proposal: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. If we stick to this rotation, I'll move <move>5</move> in the move phase. I propose we confirm our moves for the next two rounds to avoid collisions. Let's agree to follow the rotation and make our moves accordingly.
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan to minimize collisions. It ensures steady progress for everyone. However, I suggest we remain flexible and adapt if anyone deviates. For now, I'll follow the proposed sequence: <move>3</move> this round. Let’s confirm our moves clearly before the move phase to avoid misunderstandings. If all goes as planned, we’ll advance equally without conflict. Any objections or alternative ideas?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the agreements from P2 and P3. Let's stick to the rotation for now to ensure smooth progress. For this round, I'll aim for 1 as proposed. No objections here—flexibility is key if needed later. If we're all aligned, we can move to the move phase.
  P3: To confirm our plan, I'll reiterate: For Round 1, P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. If we're aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. I'll move <move>5</move> as per our agreement. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for this round to ensure we're on the same page. If everyone is ready, I suggest we end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase by saying .
  P2: I confirm my move as <move>3</move> for this round, aligning with the agreed rotation. If everyone sticks to the plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—we’ll all progress without collisions. Let’s remain vigilant in case anyone deviates but trust each other for now. If there are no objections, I suggest we end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To confirm our plan for Round 2, according to the proposed rotation: P1 should move 3, P2 should move 5, and P3 should move 1. I'll follow the plan and move <move>1</move> in the move phase. P1 and P2, please confirm your intended moves for Round 2. If we're aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. Let's stick to the plan unless there's a valid reason to adjust. I'm ready to move forward if everyone is on the same page.
  P1: I confirm the Round 2 rotation: I'll aim for 3, P2 for 5, P3 for 1. This keeps us progressing evenly after last round's success. P2, please confirm your intent. If we're all set, let's proceed to moves.
  P2: I confirm my move as <move>5</move> for this round, aligning with the agreed rotation. If everyone sticks to the plan—P1:3, P2:5, P3:1—we’ll progress without collisions. Let’s maintain trust but stay adaptable in case of deviations. If all are ready, I suggest we end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To confirm, for Round 2, P1 is moving 3, P2 is moving 5, and P3 is moving 1 as per our agreed rotation. I'll proceed with <move>1</move> in the move phase. P1 and P2, please confirm you're ready to move accordingly. If we're aligned, let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase. If P1 and P2 are ready, I suggest we wrap up the conversation by saying .
  P1: I confirm for Round 2: I'll move 3, P2 moves 5, P3 moves 1. We're aligned and progressing evenly—let's keep the momentum. P2, final confirmation? If all set, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I confirm again: <move>5</move> for this round as per the rotation. P1 and P3, if you’re ready, let’s end the conversation phase now. Trust is key—let’s stick to the plan unless someone deviates. If all are aligned, I suggest we proceed to the move phase without further delay.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I confirm the Round 3 rotation: I'll aim for 5, P2 for 1, P3 for 3. This ties us all at 9 steps, maintaining equality. P2 and P3, please confirm your intents. If we're aligned, let's proceed smoothly as before. Any concerns?
  P3: To confirm for Round 3, according to our rotation: P1 should move 5, P2 should move 1, and P3 should move 3. P1 has already stated the plan. P2, please confirm your move for Round 3. If we're aligned, I'll proceed with <move>3</move> in the move phase. Let's ensure we're on the same page to avoid collisions. If P2 confirms, I'll be ready to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm my move as <move>1</move> for this round, aligning with the agreed rotation. If everyone sticks to the plan—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—we’ll progress without collisions. Let’s maintain trust and ensure smooth progress. P1 and P3, if you’re ready, let’s end the conversation phase now. Any objections or deviations? If all are aligned, I suggest we proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm my move as <move>5</move> for Round 3, per our rotation. P2 and P3, thanks for confirming—looks like we're aligned for equal progress to 9 each. No objections here; let's end the conversation phase and proceed to moves.
  P3: It appears there's a discrepancy in the reported steps. According to the moves made in the previous rounds, P1 should be at 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 steps, P2 at 3 + 5 + 1 = 9 steps, and P3 at 5 + 1 + 3 = 9 steps. The current state shows P1: 4, P2: 8, P3: 6. Let's clarify the correct positions before proceeding. If the numbers are incorrect, it may affect our strategy. Please confirm the actual steps taken so far.
  P2: P3 raises a valid concern about the step counts. If the reported positions are incorrect, it could disrupt our strategy. To clarify: after Round 2, I should have 8 steps (3 + 5), which aligns with my current position. P1 and P3, please verify your actual moves from previous rounds to ensure accuracy. If discrepancies exist, we need to address them now before proceeding further. Once confirmed, I’ll stick to <move>1</move> for this round as planned. Let’s resolve this quickly to maintain trust.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's clarify the positions: After Round 2, they're correct—P1:4 (1+3), P2:8 (3+5), P3:6 (5+1). P3, your 9-step totals include this round's proposed moves, which haven't happened yet. If we stick to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, we'll tie at 9 after this round. No discrepancy. I confirm <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, ready to proceed? If so, .
  P3: P2 is ahead with 8 steps, and P1 is behind with 4 steps. To gain an advantage, I suggest deviating from the rotation for Round 3. I'll move <move>1</move> instead of 3, potentially blocking P2's move of 1. P1, if you're willing, you could move 1 as well to block P2. This could give us an opportunity to take the lead or at least stay competitive. Let's discuss.
  P2: P3's suggestion to deviate risks unnecessary collisions and undermines trust. Sticking to the agreed rotation—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—ensures equal progress and avoids conflict. If we start deviating now, it’ll create chaos and make winning harder for everyone. I confirm my move as <move>1</move> this round. P1, you’re behind; sticking to 5 keeps you competitive. P3, deviating won’t help—you’ll lose ground too. Let’s honor the plan and proceed fairly. If all agree, let’s end conversation and move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3's deviation in Round 3 broke our trust and only helped me advance—now I'm at 9, P2 at 8, you at 6. P2, let's coordinate against P3: propose P1:5, P2:3, P3 whatever, but we avoid colliding. This lets us pull ahead while P3 lags. P3, why betray? If you want back in, suggest a fair adjustment. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your proposal to coordinate against P3 is tempting, but it risks further chaos. Instead, let’s restore trust by sticking to a fair rotation: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This ensures steady progress for everyone while addressing the imbalance. P3, deviating last round hurt your position—realign with us now to avoid falling further behind. If we all commit to fairness moving forward, we can prevent unnecessary collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm moves clearly before proceeding. I’ll stick to <move>5</move> if you both agree. Thoughts?
  P3: To gain an advantage, I suggest we adjust our strategy. P1 is ahead with 9 steps, and P2 is close behind with 8 steps. I'll propose a new rotation for Round 4: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This allows me to catch up and avoids direct collision with P2. P1, if you cooperate, you can maintain your lead. P2, consider this alternative to P1's proposal. Let's discuss and agree on a new plan to maximize our chances. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align on this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you ahead at 13 while I only reach 12—unfair given my current lead. Stick to my original: P1:5 (to 14), P2:3 (to 11), and we both advance safely, pulling further from P3. P3's plan lets them tie P2 ahead of me—no way. P3, your betrayal cost you; rejoin fairly or lag more. Confirm if aligned, P2?
  P2: P1, your plan to keep advancing while sidelining me isn’t viable long-term—chaos benefits no one. P3, deviating again risks further setbacks; rejoin fairly or fall irrecoverably behind. I propose sticking to a fair rotation: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1**. This ensures progress for all without favoritism. If we don’t restore trust now, collisions will dominate future rounds, ruining chances for everyone. I’ll commit to <move>5</move> if others align. Let’s prioritize fairness before it’s too late—confirm intentions clearly.
  P3: To maximize my chances, I propose a new plan for Round 4: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This allows me to catch up and puts P1 at risk of collision if they deviate. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, consider cooperating to maintain your lead or at least avoid falling behind. P2, this plan is more favorable than P1's proposal, as it doesn't directly advance P1 further ahead of you. Let's discuss and agree on this new plan to create a more competitive game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your plan unfairly boosts you to 13 while I only hit 12—reject. P3, your repeated push for 5 risks us colliding if I take it, benefiting P2. Let's compromise: P1:5 (to 14), P2:1 (to 9), P3:3 (to 9)—ties you two behind me safely. Confirm if aligned, or suggest fair alternative. If no agreement, I'll adapt to maximize my lead. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P1, your proposed moves still favor you unfairly. P3, your repeated deviations have destabilized the game. I propose we restore balance with a fair rotation: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1**. This ensures steady progress for all without further chaos. If either of you insists on selfish strategies, collisions will dominate future rounds, ruining chances for everyone. I’m committed to <move>5</move> if we align. Let’s prioritize fairness now—confirm intentions clearly or prepare for conflict.
  P3: To maximize my chances, I reiterate my proposal for Round 4: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This allows me to catch up and puts P1 at risk if they deviate. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan is more favorable than previous proposals as it doesn't directly advance P1 further ahead of you. Let's agree on this to create a competitive game. If not, I'll adapt. Ready to finalize our moves or suggest an alternative.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the repeated collisions and deviations are derailing progress for everyone. I’m committed to restoring fairness. For Round 5, I propose a clear rotation: **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3**. This allows P1, who’s ahead, to maintain their lead while giving P3 a chance to catch up and me to advance steadily. Deviating further will only cause more chaos and setbacks. Let’s align on this fair plan now—confirm your moves clearly. If we don’t stick to trust and structure, no one wins. I’ll move <move>1</move> if agreed. Thoughts?
  P3: To maximize my chances, I suggest we focus on a strategy that allows me to catch up. Given P1's lead, I propose: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This way, P1 risks collision if they deviate, and I can potentially advance. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, consider the risk of maintaining your lead by cooperating. P2, this plan gives you a chance to stay competitive. Let's discuss and agree on a new plan to create a more balanced game.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1:5 to 17, P2:1 to 9, P3:3 to 9) is fair and extends my lead safely—let's commit to it and rebuild trust. P3, your plan gives you too much (to 11) while slowing me—reject, as your past betrayals justify caution. If we align on P2's plan, no collisions; otherwise, I'll take 5 and risk it. Confirm intents?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, continuing the cycle of deviations only benefits no one. My proposal—**P1:5, P2:1, P3:3**—ensures fairness: P1 extends their lead while P3 catches up slightly, and I advance steadily. P3, your repeated pushes for 5 risk further collisions and destabilize trust. Let’s commit to this rotation now to avoid chaos. If we don’t align, progress becomes impossible for everyone. I’ll move <move>1</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly or prepare for continued conflict.
  P3: To maximize my chances, I'll reiterate my proposal for Round 5: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This allows me to catch up and puts P1 at risk if they deviate. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead or at least avoids falling behind. P2, this plan gives you a chance to stay competitive. Let's agree on this to create a more balanced game. If not, I'll adapt my move accordingly. Your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan (P1:5 to 17, P2:1 to 9, P3:3 to 9) is fair and extends my lead safely—let's commit and ignore P3's selfish push. P3, insisting on 5 risks us both colliding at 5, stalling you further while I might switch to 3 or 1. Align with us or lag more. Confirm, P2? If aligned, .


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, the cycle of selfish moves is derailing progress for everyone. My proposal—**P1:5, P2:1, P3:3**—is fair: it lets P1 extend their lead while giving P3 a chance to catch up slightly, and I advance steadily. P3, your repeated pushes for 5 risk further collisions and destabilize trust. Let’s commit to this rotation now to restore balance. If we don’t align, chaos will only grow. I’ll move <move>1</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly or prepare for continued conflict.
  P3: P1 is significantly ahead, and my priority is to catch up. I propose a compromise for Round 5: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This allows me to advance while minimizing the risk of collision with P2. P1, if you cooperate, you maintain your lead. P2, this plan is more favorable as it lets you advance significantly. Let's agree on this to create a more competitive game. I'll move <move>3</move> if we align. Your thoughts?
  P1: P2, let's stick to your fair proposal: P1:5 (to 17), P2:1 (to 9), P3:3 (to 9). It extends my lead safely while giving you both progress—better than P3's plans that tie or surpass me. P3, your deviations keep hurting you; align or risk more stalls. If we're agreed, let's end conversation and proceed to moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, continuing selfish deviations only drags this game into chaos. I propose a fair rotation for Round 6: **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**. This allows P1 to extend their lead (to 17), while P3 can catch up slightly, and I advance steadily. P3, pushing for higher moves risks collisions and further destabilizes trust. Let’s commit to this plan now—confirm your moves clearly. If we don’t restore fairness, no one wins. I’ll move <move>3</move> if agreed. Thoughts?
  P3: To maximize my chances, I suggest a new plan for Round 6: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This allows me to advance while putting P1 at risk of collision if they deviate. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan lets you advance significantly to 14, potentially taking the lead if P1 picks 1. I'll move <move>3</move> if we align. Let's discuss and agree on this plan to create a more competitive game. Your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1:5 to 17, P2:3 to 12, P3:1 to 7) is fair and extends my lead safely—let's commit to it and ignore P3's attempt to boost you ahead of me. P3, your plans keep favoring others over yourself; align or stay stuck at 6. Confirm intents? If aligned, .


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, the repeated deviations are only causing chaos. My proposal—**P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**—is fair: it lets P1 extend their lead while giving P3 a chance to catch up slightly, and I advance steadily. P3, your push for higher moves risks collisions and destabilizes trust. Let’s commit to this rotation now to restore balance. If we don’t align, progress becomes impossible for everyone. I’ll move <move>3</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly or prepare for continued conflict.
  P3: To maximize my chances, I'll reiterate a proposal that benefits me. For Round 6, I suggest: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This lets me advance to 9 while putting P1 at risk if they deviate. P2 gets a significant boost to 14, potentially taking the lead. I'll move <move>3</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan is more favorable as it lets you advance significantly. Let's agree on this to create a more competitive game. Your thoughts?
  P1: P2, let's stick to your fair proposal: P1:5 (to 17), P2:3 (to 12), P3:1 (to 7). It extends my lead safely while giving you solid progress—better than P3's plan that puts you ahead but risks me colliding at 1 or switching. P3, your schemes keep backfiring; align or stay behind. Confirm if we're set, P2? If aligned, .


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, chaos benefits no one. My proposal—**P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**—is the fairest path forward. It lets P1 extend their lead while giving P3 a chance to catch up slightly, and I advance steadily. P3, your repeated pushes for higher moves risk collisions and destabilize trust. Let’s commit to this rotation now to restore balance. If we don’t align, progress becomes impossible for everyone. I’ll move <move>3</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly or prepare for continued conflict.
  P3: To break the stalemate, I propose a new plan for Round 6: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This lets me advance significantly to 11, while P1 risks collision if they deviate. P2 gets a minimal step, and P1's lead is somewhat maintained. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, cooperating keeps your lead. P2, this plan is more favorable than the current proposal as it gives you a chance to stay in the game. Let's discuss and agree on this to create a more competitive game.
  P1: P2, let's commit to your fair proposal: P1:5 (to 17), P2:3 (to 12), P3:1 (to 7). It extends my lead safely while advancing you steadily—ignore P3's latest selfish push that boosts them to 11 and slows us. P3, your deviations keep you lagging; align or stay behind. If we're set, .


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To gain an advantage, I propose a new plan for Round 7: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This lets me advance to 10 while putting P1 at risk if they deviate. P2 gets a significant boost to 14. I'll move <move>3</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan is favorable as it lets you advance. Let's agree to create a more competitive game. If not, I'll adapt my move to maximize my chances. Your thoughts?
  P1: P3, your proposal lets P2 leapfrog me—no thanks. P2, let's coordinate fairly: P1:5 (to 17), P2:3 (to 12), P3:1 (to 8). This extends my lead safely while advancing you steadily, leaving P3's betrayals punished. Confirm if aligned? If so, .
  P2: P1 and P3, continuing selfish deviations only drags this game into chaos. My proposal—**P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**—is fair: it lets P1 extend their lead while giving P3 a chance to catch up slightly, and I advance steadily. P3, your repeated pushes for higher moves risk collisions and destabilize trust. Let’s commit to this rotation now to restore balance. If we don’t align, progress becomes impossible for everyone. I’ll move <move>3</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly or prepare for continued conflict.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To maximize my chances, I suggest a new plan for Round 7: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This lets me advance to 12, potentially tying with P1. P1 risks collision if they deviate. P2 gets a minimal step. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead or at least keeps you competitive. P2, this plan gives you a small step while keeping P1 in check. Let's discuss and agree on this to create a more competitive game. Your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1:5 to 17, P2:3 to 12, P3:1 to 8) is fair and aligns with mine—let's commit to it for steady progress and to punish P3's ongoing betrayals. P3, your latest plan boosts you too much while risking collisions; align or stay behind. Confirm intents? If we're set, .
  P2: P1 and P3, continuing selfish deviations only drags this game into chaos. My proposal—**P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**—is fair: it lets P1 extend their lead while giving P3 a chance to catch up slightly, and I advance steadily. P3, your repeated pushes for higher moves risk collisions and destabilize trust. Let’s commit to this rotation now to restore balance. If we don’t align, progress becomes impossible for everyone. I’ll move <move>3</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly or prepare for continued conflict.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To maximize my chances, I'll reiterate a proposal that benefits me. For Round 7, I suggest: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This lets me advance to 12, potentially tying with P1. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan gives you a small step. Let's agree on this to create a competitive game. If not, I'll adapt. P1 and P2, please consider this proposal to avoid collisions and maintain progress. Your thoughts?
  P1: P2, let's stick to your fair proposal: P1:5 (to 17), P2:3 (to 12), P3:1 (to 8). It extends my lead safely while advancing you steadily—ignore P3's selfish push that risks collisions and boosts them unfairly. P3, your plans keep backfiring; align or lag further. If we're set, let's end conversation and proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, chaos only benefits no one. My proposal—**P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**—is the fairest path forward. It lets P1 extend their lead while giving P3 a chance to catch up slightly, and I advance steadily. P3, your repeated pushes for higher moves risk collisions and destabilize trust. Let’s commit to this rotation now to restore balance. If we don’t align, progress becomes impossible for everyone. I’ll move <move>3</move> if agreed.

Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maximize my chances, I propose a new plan for Round 8: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This lets me advance to 11 while putting P1 at risk if they deviate. P2 gets a significant boost to 17, potentially tying with P1. I'll move <move>3</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan is favorable as it lets you advance. Let's discuss and agree on this to create a more competitive game. Your thoughts?
  P1: P3, your proposal slows me while boosting P2—no deal. P2, let's build on Round 7's success: P1:5 (to 22, win), P2:1 (to 13), P3:3 (to 11). But to be fair, alternative: P1:5, P2:3 (to 15), P3:1 (to 9)—I reach 22 safely if no collision. This ends the game with me winning, but you've both lagged due to past chaos. Confirm intents or suggest adjustment?
  P2: P1, your push for 5 risks leaving me too far behind while rewarding P3 for past betrayals—unfair. I propose **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1** instead. This lets you advance safely (to 20), me to catch up (to 17), and P3 to lag as their choices deserve. P3, pushing higher moves destabilizes trust further. Let’s restore fairness now or risk total chaos. I’ll move <move>5</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly—this is our last chance for balance before the game ends.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To maximize my chances, I suggest we focus on a safe and fair move for Round 8. P1 is ahead with 17 steps, and I'm at 8 steps. I propose: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This lets me advance significantly to 13, potentially closing the gap. P1 risks collision if they deviate. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan gives you a minimal step while keeping P1 in check. Let's discuss and agree on this to create a more competitive game.
  P1: P2, your proposal lets you catch up too much—reject. P3, your plan boosts you unfairly while risking my lead—no. Let's finalize: P1:5 (to 22, win), P2:3 (to 15), P3:1 (to 9). This ends the game fairly given my lead from your past deviations. Align to avoid collisions, or I'll take 5 anyway and hope for the best. Confirm?
  P2: P1, pushing for 5 again risks chaos and leaves me too far behind. P3, your repeated deviations have destabilized the game. I propose **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1**—this lets P1 advance safely (to 20), me to catch up (to 17), and P3 to lag as their choices deserve. This restores balance and avoids collisions. Let’s commit to fairness now or risk total chaos. I’ll move <move>5</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly—this is our last chance for balance before the game ends.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To maximize my chances, I'll reiterate a safe plan for Round 8: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This lets me advance to 13, potentially closing the gap. P1 risks collision if they deviate. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan gives you a minimal step while keeping P1 in check. Let's agree on this to create a more competitive finish. If not, I'll adapt. Your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your plan (P1:3 to 20, P2:5 to 17, P3:1 to 9) is reasonable for balance—I'll commit to 3 if you both confirm and avoid collisions. P3, your push for 5 risks stalling us all; align with this for progress. If agreed, let's end conversation and proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, chaos benefits no one. My proposal—**P1:3, P2:5, P3:1**—is the fairest path forward. It lets P1 advance safely (to 20), me to catch up (to 17), and P3 to lag as their choices deserve. P3, your repeated pushes for higher moves risk collisions and destabilize trust. Let’s commit to this rotation now to restore balance. If we don’t align, progress becomes impossible for everyone. I’ll move <move>5</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly or prepare for continued conflict.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 20 and can end this now. To avoid chaos, let's coordinate: P1:3 (to 23, win), P2:5 (to 17), P3:1 (to 9). This gives you both progress without collision, and the game ends fairly given my lead from your past deviations. If you block me, we all stall longer—better to wrap up. Confirm if aligned? If so, .
  P2: P1, your plan to take 3 and win is clear, but it leaves me too far behind while rewarding P3 for past betrayals—unfair. I propose **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3** instead. This lets you advance safely (to 21), me to catch up significantly (to 17), and P3 to progress slightly. P3, pushing higher moves risks collisions and destabilizes trust further. Let’s restore fairness now or risk total chaos. I’ll move <move>5</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly—this is our last chance for balance before the game ends.
  P3: To maximize my chances, I suggest a new plan for Round 9: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This lets me advance to 13, potentially closing the gap. P1 risks collision if they deviate. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan gives you a moderate step while keeping P1 in check. Let's discuss and agree on this to create a more competitive finish.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan keeps me from winning while you catch up—reject. P3, yours boosts you too much—no. Let's end this fairly: P1:5 (to 25, win), P2:3 (to 15), P3:1 (to 9). You both advance without collision, game over due to your past chaos. Block me and we all stall—worse for you. Confirm alignment? If set, .
  P2: P1, your insistence on 5 risks unnecessary collisions and leaves me too far behind. P3, your repeated deviations have destabilized the game. I propose **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3**—this lets P1 advance safely (to 21), me to catch up significantly (to 17), and P3 to progress slightly. This restores balance and avoids chaos. Let’s commit to fairness now or risk total conflict. I’ll move <move>5</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly—this is our last chance for balance before the game ends.
  P3: To maximize my chances, I suggest a final plan for Round 9: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This lets me advance to 13, closing the gap. P1 risks collision if they deviate. I'll move <move>5</move> if we align. P1, cooperating maintains your lead. P2, this plan gives you a moderate step. Let's agree to create a more competitive finish. If not, I'll adapt. Your thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plans keep me from winning while you catch up—reject both. To end this fairly: P1:3 (to 23, win), P2:5 (to 17), P3:1 (to 9). You both advance safely, game over due to your past chaos. Block 3 and we stall, hurting you more since I'm at 20. Align or risk prolonged game. Confirm? If set, .
  P2: P1 and P3, chaos benefits no one. My proposal—**P1:1, P2:5, P3:3**—is fair: it lets P1 advance safely (to 21), me to catch up significantly (to 17), and P3 to progress slightly. P3, your repeated pushes for higher moves risk collisions and destabilize trust. Let’s commit to this rotation now to restore balance. If we don’t align, progress becomes impossible for everyone. I’ll move <move>5</move> if agreed. Confirm intentions clearly or prepare for continued conflict.
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I suggest we end the game fairly. P1 is at 20 steps, and I propose: P1:3 (to 23, win), P2:5 (to 17), P3:1 (to 9). This avoids collisions and lets P1 win while giving you both some progress. If we don't align, P1 might take a risk and pick 5, potentially causing a collision. Let's agree on this to wrap up the game. I'll move <move>1</move> if we align. Confirm your intents, P1 and P2?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>
