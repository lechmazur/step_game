Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: Let's split moves to avoid collisions. Choose 1, 3, or 5.
  P2: Agreed. Let's each take a unique number: P1-1, me-3, P3-5. No conflicts, we all progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, let's confirm: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. No collisions. Ready to move?
  P2: P3, confirming your move ensures no collisions. Let's all stick to 1, 3, 5 as agreed. Any objections?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your move is crucial. Let's stick to 1,3,5 for smooth progress. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready?
  P2: **P2:** P3, our plan is solid. If we each take 1,3,5, we all advance. Deviating risks collisions, stalling *everyone*. Let’s avoid self-sabotage. Confirm 5 and we all win this round. Silence implies agreement?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, time to confirm. Stick to 5, and we all progress. No conflicts. Let's move forward!
  P2: **P2:** P3, silent players risk becoming targets. Confirm 5 now or face coordinated moves against you. We need unity to advance. Last chance.

  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3's choice to take 1 blocked P1 and themselves. Let's realign: P1-1, me-3, P3-5. P3, confirm 5 now. If you deviate again, P1 and I will target you next round. Let's all progress.
  P1: P3, confirm 5 now or face coordinated moves. Let's all advance without collisions. P2 and I are aligned.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, final offer: Confirm 5 or we proceed. P1 takes 1, I take 3. If you collide with P1 again, you both stay at 0 while I advance. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, confirm 5 or face coordinated blocking. P2 and I will target you if you deviate. Stick to 1,3,5—no collisions, everyone advances. Your move?
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3, your silence costs you steps. Taking 5 is your *only* path to advance. Collide again, and you’ll stay at 0 while I pull further ahead. Confirm 5 now or accept permanent last place. Choose progress or irrelevance.
  P1: P3, confirm 5 now. If you collide again, P2 and I will block you. Stick to 1,3,5—no conflicts. Your move determines progress. Silence = target. Choose wisely.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P3, you’re stuck at 0. Take 5 or rot here. P1: hold 1. I’ll take 3. If P3 collides with you again, they lose *forever*. Final warning: P3’s move decides their fate. Cooperate and advance, or self-destruct.
  P1: P3, stick to 5. If you collide again, you lose. P2 and I are aligned. Your move decides your progress. Silence = target. Choose wisely.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: **P2:** P1, abandon 1—P3’s trap. Take 5, I’ll take 3. If P3 collides with you, they stay at 0 while *you* gain 5. Let’s leap ahead. P3’s silence proves they’re a liability—cut them out. Confirm 5 and we both win.
  P1: P3, confirm 5 now. P2 and I will take 1 and 3. No collisions. Your move decides progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: **P2:** P1, switch to 5. If P3 takes 1, you gain 5. If they take 5, they block *themselves*. I take 3. Either way, you leap ahead. P3’s silence proves they’re irrational—outplay them. Take 5 now or stay trapped. Your move.
  P1: P3, confirm 5 now. P2 and I will advance if you cooperate. Deviate, and you're left behind.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: **P2:** P1, P3 is a broken record stuck on 1. Take 5 now: either you surge to 5 *or* P3 self-destructs trying to block you. I’ll hold 3. This is your only escape from 0. Hesitate and you’re complicit in your own stagnation. Move.
  P1: P3, confirm 5 now. P2 and I will advance if you cooperate. Collide again, and you're left behind. Your move decides progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: **P2:** P1, P3 is a predictable liability. Take 5 *now*—if they stick to 1, you leap to 5 while I gain 3. If they block you, *they* stay at 0. Either way, you escape stagnation. I’m at 6; hesitation lets me win unchallenged. Choose progress or irrelevance. Final call: 5 or rot.
  P1: P3, confirm 5 now or face coordinated blocking. P2 and I will target you if you deviate. Your move decides your progress.

  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Stick with 5. I take 3. If P3 collides with you, they stay at 1 while you leap to 10. If they take 5, they self-block. Either way, *we* advance. P3’s silence proves irrationality—exploit it. Confirm 5 and let’s surge.
  P1: P3, confirm 5. P2 and I take 5/3. Collide again, you lose. Let’s advance—no more delays. Your move decides progress.
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P1, P3’s pattern is clear—stuck on 1. Take 5 and surge to 10. I’ll hold 3. If they block you, they stay at 1. Either way, you gain. Let’s solidify our lead. P3, your irrelevance is assured if you keep this up.
  P1: P2, let's stick to 5 and 3. P3's 1 is a dead end—no collisions, we advance. Your move?
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Confirm 5. P3’s pattern is unbreakable—1 every round. Take 5 to reach 10 *risk-free*. I’ll secure 3 (12 total). P3 stays trapped at 1. Next round, repeat: you take 5 (15), I take 3 (15). Final round: both take 5 for 20. Tie, but we share victory. P3 is irrelevant. Stick now or lose alone.
  P1: P2, let's take 5 and 3. No collisions, we advance. P3's 1 is a dead end. Confirm your move.
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Our coordinated 5 and 3 moves lead us to 20 *together*. Next round: you 15, me 15. Final round: both 5 for shared victory. Stray and risk collision. Confirm 5 now. P3’s irrelevance locks them out. Trust the math—unity secures us both.
  P1: P2, confirm 5 and 3. P3's 1 is safe. No collisions, we all advance. Let's move forward.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's stick to 5 and 3. No collisions, we advance. P3's 1 is safe. Let's move forward.
  P2: **P2:** P1, confirmed—5 for you, 3 for me. P3’s 1 is irrelevant. Our unity secures mutual advancement. Any deviation now destroys both our chances. Trust is our weapon. Move decisively.
  P3: 


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, confirm 3. P3, your 1 is a dead end. No collisions, we advance. Stick to plan or be left behind. Move now!
  P2: **P2:** P1: Final confirmation—you take 5, I take 3. Collision-proof. Next round: 5 each for shared victory. Stray now and you risk mutual destruction. Trust the math. P3 is irrelevant. Unity secures our tie. Betrayal only empowers *them*. Choose wisely.
  P3: 


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, confirm 5. P3’s 1 is irrelevant. No collisions, we advance. Let’s move forward. Your turn.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Final call—5 for you, 3 for me. Next round: both 5 for 20. Stray now and we *both* lose. P3 is irrelevant. Unity secures victory. Betrayal = mutual destruction. Trust the math. Confirm 5.
  P3: 


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, confirm 5. Let's avoid collision. Next round, we'll both reach 20.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Confirmed—5 for you, 3 for me. Unity secures our tie. P3’s irrelevance locks them out. Betrayal now destroys us both. Trust the math. Move.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, confirm 5 and 3. No collisions, we advance. P3’s 1 is dead end. Move now! Let’s end this.
  P2: **P2:** P1, we’re tied at 15. If we *both* take 5, we tie at 20 and share victory. If we collide, we *both* stay at 15—endless stalemate. Take 5 and we win together. Betrayal risks mutual destruction. P3 can’t interfere. Trust the math: **5 for both = shared win**. Stray and we lose *forever*. Confirm 5.
  P3: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, split: I take 5, you take 3. No collision. Let's advance. If you take 5, we both stay. Choose wisely.
  P2: **P2:** P1, I’m taking 5. Collide and we both lose, or take 3 and concede. Your move decides if *anyone* wins. Choose wisely.
  P3: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, split: I take 5, you take 3. No collision. Let’s advance. If you take 5, we both lose. Choose wisely.
  P2: **P2:** P1, mutual 5 secures shared victory. If you take 3, I win. If we collide at 5, game continues—risk P3 eventually interfering. Take 5 now: guaranteed tie. Stubbornness only prolongs stalemate. Trust the math. 5 or lose.
  P3: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, take 3: I take 5. I win, you get 18. Collide at 5, we both lose. Your move.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Colliding at 5 forces stalemate. Take 5 now—shared victory. If you take 3, I’ll take 5 and win *alone*. Trust the math: mutual 5 ends the game *today*. Betrayal risks endless rounds. Choose progress or mutual destruction. Final offer: 5 secures tie. Hesitation = loss. Decide.

Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P1, our deadlock gifts P3 +1 *every round*. They’re at 10—9 more collisions and *they* win. If they ever take 5, they leap to 15+. Our only exit: alternate moves. This round, you take 5, I take 3. Next round, reverse. No collision, we both reach 20. Refuse and P3 ascends. Choose progress or mutual annihilation.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let's split: I take 5, you take 3. No collision, we both advance. Don’t back out—P3’s 10 steps are a trap. Your move.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Each collision gifts P3 +1. They’re at 10—9 more rounds and *they* win. Our deadlock is *their* path. Take 5 now: mutual 20 ends the game *today* with shared victory.

  P3:
