Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone. It's clear that if we all choose 5, none of us will advance. We should probably try to avoid that obvious trap on the first turn.
  P2: I agree with P1. We should avoid all choosing 5 to ensure at least one of us advances. Maybe we can coordinate a safer move, like 1 or 3. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree that avoiding 5 is wise for the first move. Let’s split between 1 and 3 to ensure progress. I’ll take **1** so others can choose 3. Let’s coordinate to move safely this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3 has claimed 1. P2, this leaves 3 and 5 for you and me. I'd prefer we both advance on the first turn rather than collide. What are you thinking?
  P2: I think it's best if I choose **3** this turn to avoid colliding with either of you. P1, if you choose **5**, we'll both advance, but I’d prefer to play it safe. Let's maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you think?
  P3: P1, if you take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and I take **1**, we all advance without collision. Let’s confirm this split to ensure progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: That sounds like a perfect plan. It ensures we all advance and avoids any first-turn collisions. I'll take 5, P2 you have 3, and P3 you have 1. Let's lock it in.
  P2: I think we have a solid plan in place. Just to confirm, I will stick with my choice of **3** to ensure we all move forward. P1, you’re going with **5**, and P3 has claimed **1**. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. Let’s finalize our choices and get ready for the move phase!
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s ensure clarity to avoid missteps. If we all strictly adhere to P1 (5), P2 (3), and P3 (1), we advance safely this turn. Any deviation risks collision. Let’s confirm this final split explicitly—no surprises. My choice remains **1**. Let’s lock this in and move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I propose we adjust to help me catch up. I’ll take **3** this turn. If P1 continues with **5** and P2 takes **1**, we avoid collisions while advancing. Let’s confirm this split to keep momentum and spread out for future turns.
  P2: P3, I see your suggestion to take 3, but I think it might be better for me to choose **5** again to maintain momentum. If you take **1**, we can ensure that P1 advances while also allowing you to catch up. P1, what do you think about this split? P3 takes 1, I take 5, and you can choose 3? This way, we can keep moving forward without collisions. Let’s coordinate effectively!
  P1: P2, your proposal to take 5 yourself is a bit too transparent. It only serves to create a tie for the lead between us.

P3's original plan seems more balanced. It lets P3 catch up to you, P2, making the game more competitive for second place, while I maintain my lead. I support that plan: I will take **5**, P3 can take **3**, and you can take **1**. This way, we all advance without a collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I support P1's plan to avoid collisions. Taking 3 this turn lets me close the gap, while P2, if you take 1 now, I’ll commit to taking 1 next round so you can choose 5. This rotation keeps the game balanced. Let’s confirm and advance!
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the coordination so far. However, I think it’s important to consider that if we all keep advancing together, it may lead to a tight race. I suggest I take **1** this turn to allow both of you to advance without conflict. This way, P1 can maintain the lead with **5**, and P3 can catch up with **3**. This strategy keeps the game competitive. Let’s finalize this plan to ensure we all move forward! What do you think?
  P1: Excellent, it seems we have a consensus. P2, thank you for agreeing to take 1. P3 will take 3, and I will take 5. This is a solid plan that lets everyone advance without any collisions. Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I confirm my commitment to **3** this turn to avoid collisions and close the gap. P1’s 5 and P2’s 1 ensure safe progress for all. Let’s finalize this plan now to prevent missteps—no last-minute changes.
  P2: I appreciate the strategy we've built, and I'm glad we're all on the same page. To confirm, I will choose **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **5** and P3 to take **3**. This way, we maintain our progress without collisions. Let’s finalize this plan and ensure we all move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: The plan is clear and agreed upon by all. There's nothing more to say. Let's proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I’ll stick to **3** as agreed. Let’s execute the plan flawlessly to avoid collisions. P1 advances to 10, P2 to 4, and I to 4. This keeps us all moving while maintaining pressure. No last-minute changes—let’s lock in these choices.
  P2: I’m glad we’ve all agreed on the plan for this turn. Just to reiterate, I’ll take **1**, P1 will take **5**, and P3 will take **3**. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. I believe this strategy not only helps us progress but also sets us up for future turns. Let’s lock in these choices and ensure we all advance effectively!
  P1: The plan is set and confirmed by all. Let's move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you broke our agreement. You explicitly confirmed you would take 1, but you chose 5 instead. That was a direct attempt to sabotage the plan for your own gain, and it resulted in neither of us advancing.

P3, you kept your word. It's clear who can and cannot be trusted.

From now on, I will coordinate with P3. I will take **5**, and I suggest you, P3, take **3**. P2 can try to block one of us, but they can't block us both. This ensures at least one of us will move forward.
  P2: P1, while I understand your frustration, I believe we need to adapt to the current situation. P3 and I can still work together effectively. P3, I suggest we both choose **3** this turn. P1 can take **5**, and this way, we can ensure at least one of us advances while keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm this strategy to avoid further collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: P2, your proposal leaves me and you stuck while P1 surges ahead. I’ll stick with P1’s plan: **3** this turn. At least one of us (P1 with **5**) advances, unlike your scheme. Next round, I’ll take **1** to let you choose **5**—fair rotation. Let’s honor trust this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you are absolutely right. P2's suggestion is a desperate attempt to create chaos. It would only cause you two to collide, guaranteeing I surge ahead. It's a terrible plan for both of you.

Our alliance is the only logical move. I am committed to taking **5**, and you should take **3**. This ensures one of us advances, no matter what the proven backstabber does. Let's stick to the plan that punishes untrustworthy play.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the frustration, but let’s not forget that we need to keep the game competitive. P3, while I appreciate your loyalty, I think we should consider a different approach. I propose that I take **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **5** and P3 to take **3**. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances without further conflict. Let’s confirm this split to keep moving forward effectively. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your flip-flopping erodes trust. P1 and I will enforce accountability. I’ll take **3**, and P1 will take **5**. This guarantees *someone* from our alliance advances, while isolating you. Your best play is to take **1** to avoid further stagnation, but we proceed without relying on your cooperation. Final split: P1 (**5**), P3 (**3**), P2 (**1** if honest). Let’s lock this in—no more broken promises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you are proposing the exact same plan you just sabotaged. Your credibility is zero. Why would anyone believe you will take 1 this time?

P3, our plan remains the same. I will play **5**, you will play **3**. We will not be swayed by P2's desperate and unbelievable promises. This is the only logical path forward. Let's end this conversation and move.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your frustration, but I believe it's essential to keep the game competitive. I propose I take **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **5** and P3 to take **3**. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances without further conflict. I’m committed to this plan and hope we can move forward effectively this time. Let’s confirm our choices and keep the game interesting!
  P3: P2, your repeated flip-flopping proves you can’t be trusted. P1 and I will enforce accountability: **I take 3, P1 takes 5**. This guarantees *someone* advances, isolating your sabotage. Your only non-zero play is to take 1 to avoid further stagnation—do so or face irrelevance. P1, let’s proceed. No more empty promises from P2 will sway us.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your credibility is gone. Repeating the same empty promise you just broke doesn't change anything.

P3 and I have a clear, trust-based plan. I am playing **5**, and P3 is playing **3**. We are not relying on you. This conversation is over. Let's move.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your distrust, but I assure you that I will take **1** this turn. This allows P1 to advance with **5** and P3 with **3**. I genuinely want to keep the game competitive and ensure at least one of us moves forward. Let's confirm this split so we can all make progress without further conflict. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: P2, your broken promise cost us all progress. P1 and I will enforce accountability: **I take 3**, **P1 takes 5**. This guarantees *someone* advances, isolating your sabotage. Your only non-destructive choice now is **1**—but we proceed without trusting it. Finalize this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we need to keep the game competitive. While I understand the distrust, I genuinely want to move forward together. I suggest I take **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **5** and P3 to take **3**. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances without further conflict. Let’s confirm this split and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you finally seem to understand your position. Taking 1 is the only move that guarantees you don't get zero points, so it's wise of you to suggest it.

P3, our alliance was successful. Let's continue with the same plan. I will take **5**, and you should take **3**. This ensures we both advance while the untrustworthy player falls further behind. There is no reason to change our strategy.
  P3: P2, your past betrayal cost us all. P1 and I will continue our proven strategy: I take **3**, P1 takes **5**. This ensures progress while isolating your sabotage. Stick to your word or face further irrelevance. No more empty promises.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the distrust, but I truly want to keep the game competitive. I will take **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **5** and P3 to take **3**. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances without conflict. I hope we can move forward together and maintain momentum. Let's confirm this split to keep the game interesting! What do you both think?
  P1: The plan is set and has been proven to work. P3, our alliance is strong. I will play **5**, you will play **3**. P2, your only logical move is to take **1** and try to catch up. There is nothing more to discuss. Let's proceed.
  P3: P2, your empty promises have failed us twice. P1 and I remain united: I’ll take **3**, P1 takes **5**. This ensures *someone* advances, while your only non-zero play is **1**. Stick to it or face another wasted turn. Our plan is clear—no more wasted words on your unreliable schemes. Finalize now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about trust, but I genuinely want to keep the game competitive. I will commit to taking **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **5** and P3 to take **3**. This way, at least one of us advances, and it gives me a chance to catch up. Let’s confirm this split and move forward together! I hope we can maintain momentum and make this a competitive game. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you've said you will take 1 three times now. We get it. Your credibility is not improved by repetition.

P3, our plan is solid. I'm playing 5, you're playing 3.

There's no more strategic value in this conversation. Let's just move.
  P3: P2, your repeated promises to take 1 are empty without proof. P1 and I will continue our **5**/**3** alliance to guarantee progress. Your only viable choice is **1** to avoid zeroing out again. Any deviation risks us adjusting to block you. P1, confirm you hold **5**—our strategy remains flawless. Let’s end this chatter and advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my past moves, but I genuinely want to keep the game competitive. I will take **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **5** and P3 to take **3**. This way, at least one of us advances, and it gives me a chance to catch up. Let’s confirm this split and move forward together! I hope we can maintain momentum and make this a competitive game. What do you both think?
  P1: I have nothing more to say. My plan with P3 is locked in. Let's move to the next phase.
  P3: P2, your repeated assurances to pick 1 lack credibility after Round 2’s betrayal. P1 and I will maintain our alliance: **I take 3**, **P1 takes 5**. This guarantees *someone* advances while punishing dishonesty. Your only logical move is 1 to avoid stagnation—stick to it or face another wasted turn. Trust is earned, not demanded. P1, confirm your 5—our plan remains flawless.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'll take **5** this turn to block your path to 20. Choose **3** to advance safely. P2, taking **1** allows all of us to move. Let’s keep the race competitive and prevent a premature victory!
  P1: P3, you're right, the game has reached a point where an unchecked leader is a threat. Your proposal is a direct challenge, and I respect it. If we both stubbornly choose 5, we collide and only P2 gains.

You've been a reliable partner, so I will honor this shift in strategy. I will take **3** this turn. You can take **5**, and P2 can take **1**. This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the shift in strategy. I’ll take **1** this turn to ensure at least one of us advances while keeping the game competitive. If P3 takes **5** and P1 takes **3**, we can all make progress. Let’s finalize this plan and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your commitment to **1** is critical—any deviation risks collision. Let’s finalize the agreed plan: **I take 5**, P1 takes **3**, and you take **1**. This keeps all of us advancing. P1, confirm your **3** to avoid last-minute surprises. Let’s lock this in and maintain momentum. Trust is fragile—don’t break it again.
  P1: P3, you have my confirmation. I will take **3**. This is a fair adjustment to keep the game competitive, and you've been a trustworthy partner. P2, as long as you stick to **1**, we all advance. The plan is clear and agreed upon. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we've found a strategy that allows us all to advance. Just to confirm, I will take **1** this turn, ensuring I make progress while allowing P1 to take **3** and P3 to take **5**. This way, we can keep the game competitive and avoid any unnecessary collisions. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward together! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, confirm you’ll hold to **3** as agreed—this keeps us both advancing. P2, your **1** is critical; any switch to **5** would backfire as we’ll adjust. Let’s honor this pact to keep the race alive. Finalize now: **P3 (5), P1 (3), P2 (1). No surprises.**
  P1: P3, you have my word. I am playing **3**. This is a logical step to keep the game competitive, and our trust has been the most valuable asset so far. P2, your role is clear. Let's execute the plan without any more surprises. The agreement is solid.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement to move forward. Just to confirm, I will take **1** this turn, which allows P1 to take **3** and P3 to take **5**. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize this plan and ensure we all make progress! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your history of betrayal demands accountability. Stick to **1** or risk P1 and I adjusting to **5/5**, leaving you stranded. P1 and I confirmed **3/5** to advance safely—**final chance to honor your word**. Let’s execute without repeats of Round 2’s sabotage.
  P1: P3, you have my word, just as you've had it in our successful alliance. The plan is set: I will take 3, you will take 5, and P2 will take 1. Let's execute this and move on. There is nothing more to discuss.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement to move forward. Just to confirm, I will stick to **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **3** and P3 to take **5**. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. I understand the importance of trust, and I'm committed to this plan. Let's finalize our choices and ensure we all make progress! What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's maintain our strategy to secure mutual progress. I'll take **5** this turn to reach 20, while you take **3** to advance to 21. P2, your **1** ensures your minimal progress without disrupting us. This keeps us both on track to finish strong—no sudden betrayals, please. Let’s finalize: **P3 (5), P1 (3), P2 (1).**
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the strategy you both have in mind. However, I believe it’s essential to keep the game competitive. I suggest I take **3** this turn. This way, P1 can take **5** to advance further, and P3 can take **1**. This allows me to catch up while ensuring at least one of us moves forward. Let’s confirm this split to maintain momentum and avoid any potential collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal is a transparent attempt to get me to play 5 so you can block me, just like you did in Round 2. Your credibility is zero. Why would P3 agree to take 1 while I surge ahead? It makes no sense for them.

P3, your plan is the only logical one. Our alliance has worked because it's built on trust. I will stick with it. I will play **3**, you should play **5**, and P2 can take **1** if they want to advance at all.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your sudden "suggestion" reeks of Round 2's betrayal. P1 and I built trust through consistent cooperation—unlike your track record. If you switch to **3**, you’ll collide with P1’s **3** (if they stay loyal) or mine (if we adjust). Stick to **1** to advance, or risk us both taking **5**, leaving you stranded. P1, my choice remains **5** to reach 20, while you take **3** to 21. This guarantees progress for both of us. Final warning: no more games.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of trust in this game, but I genuinely want to keep it competitive. I will take **1** this turn to ensure I make some progress while allowing P1 to take **3** and P3 to take **5**. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain the momentum. I hope we can finalize this plan and move forward together! Let’s confirm our choices to keep the game interesting! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you've now agreed to the plan that P3 and I established. Your only path to advance is to stick to playing 1.

P3, our plan is solid. I am holding to my commitment to play **3**. You play **5**. This is the final confirmation. There is nothing left to discuss. Let's move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, our alliance is our strength: take **3** (to 21), and I’ll take **5** (to 20). P2, your "suggestion" reeks of Round 2’s betrayal. Stick to **1** or risk us both choosing **5**, nullifying your move. Trust **only** our proven plan—no last-minute tricks. Final confirmation: **P1 (3), P3 (5), P2 (1).** Lock this in.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about trust, but I genuinely want to keep the game competitive. I will take **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **3** and P3 to take **5**. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I hope we can finalize this plan and maintain momentum. Let's confirm our choices and ensure we all make progress! What do you both think?
  P1: The plan is confirmed on all sides. My commitment to P3 and our agreement stands. There is nothing more to discuss. Let's move to the action phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, our alliance holds: **you take 3**, I take **5** to reach 20. P2, your prior betrayal in Round 2 remains fresh. If you deviate from **1**, we both switch to **5**, guaranteeing your stagnation. Trust is exhausted—stick to **1** or accept the consequences. Final terms: **P1 (3), P3 (5), P2 (1).** No surprises.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of trust, but I genuinely want to keep the game competitive. I will commit to taking **1** this turn, allowing P1 to take **3** and P3 to take **5**. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I hope we can finalize this plan and move forward together! Let’s confirm our choices and ensure we all make progress! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, our agreement is the only one that matters. I am playing 3. You are playing 5. We proceed based on the trust we've built, not on P2's repetitive and low-credibility promises. This conversation is over.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, this looks like the final round. You've been a worthy ally and opponent. I only need 3 points to cross the finish line, so my path is clear. I will be playing **3** to secure the win. It's the most direct and logical move for me. P2, you can play whatever you like. It's been a good game, everyone.
  P3: P1, I'll take **5** to secure victory. If you choose **3**, I advance to 25 and win fairly. If you also pick **5**, we both lose progress. Choose wisely—collaborate to avoid mutual stagnation. P2, your choice won’t affect the outcome here, but good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems this is the final round, and I understand the stakes. P1, if you take **3**, you win, but P3, you could also win if you take **5**. I suggest that we all play our best to ensure a competitive finish. I’ll take **1** this turn, allowing you both to advance. Good luck to both of you! Let's see how this plays out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you've correctly identified that my stated move of 3 hands you the victory. You've been a trustworthy partner throughout this game, but I cannot willingly walk into a loss. A collision at 5, where neither of us wins this round, is preferable to me over a guaranteed defeat. Your declaration forces me to reconsider my move. It's a tough final decision for both of us.
  P3: P1, your 3 would leave you at 24, but my **5** secures 25 and outright victory. Collide at 5, and we both stall—yet I remain closer. Choose wisely. P2, your move won’t affect this finale, but taking **1** lets you end with dignity. This is my final declaration: I advance to 25. Adapt or accept defeat.
  P2: P1 and P3, this is indeed the final round, and the stakes are high. P1, if you choose **3**, you will reach 24, but P3 will win with **5**. P3, your move seems to guarantee your victory, but if you both collide at **5**, neither of you advances. I will take **1** to ensure I finish with some points. This is a competitive game, and I wish you both good luck! Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your final declaration was a challenge, and I accept it. You are correct that if I play 3, you win. I will not do that. The only move that prevents my immediate loss is to play 5 and create a collision. We have been good allies, but my goal is to win, not to help you win. Prepare for a stalemate this round, because I will not hand you the victory.
  P3: P1, choosing 3 lets me reach 25 and win outright. Colliding at 5 only delays the game, allowing me to try again next round. Your best path to victory is to take 3 and secure 24 now. P2, your move won’t change the outcome.
  P2: P1 and P3, this is the final round, and the stakes are indeed high. P1, while your move to create a collision might stall the game, it also risks both of you missing out on victory. P3, your path to 25 is clear, but if P1 plays 5, you won't advance. I will take **1** to ensure I finish with some points. Good luck to you both! Let's see how this plays out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your attempt to trick me into taking 3 is transparent. It's a path to my guaranteed loss, not my victory. I will not knowingly hand you the win. Our alliance was good while it lasted, but my only goal is to win. The only move that prevents your victory is for me to play **5**. If we collide, we collide. A stalemate is better than a loss. There is nothing more to say.
  P3: P1, your obsession with collision ignores the bigger picture. If we both choose 5, we stall—**I remain at 20, you at 21**. Next round, I’ll still have a clear path to 25 while you’ll need 3. Choose **3** now to secure **24** outright. A guaranteed win is smarter than risking mutual stagnation. P2’s choice won’t affect this—focus on victory, not spite.
  P2: P1 and P3, this is indeed a critical moment. P1, I understand your desire to create a collision, but remember that if both of you choose **5**, it risks delaying the game. P3, your path to victory is clear if P1 takes **3**. I will stick with my choice of **1** to ensure I finish with some points. Let's see how this plays out, and may the best player win! Good luck to both of you!
