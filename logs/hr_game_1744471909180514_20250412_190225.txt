Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions by each picking a different number? I’m thinking of going for 1. If you two can pick 3 and 5, we can all move forward without any conflicts this turn. Let me know what you think, or if you have a different plan.
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'll commit to moving 5 steps to avoid a collision. P2, if you take 3, we can all advance this turn and keep things smooth. What do you say?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I’ll take 3 this round so we all move forward without blocking each other. Let’s keep it clean and cooperative for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing to the plan. I’m glad we’re on the same page for this round. Let’s stick to our choices—me on 1, P2 on 3, and P1 on 5—so we all advance without issues. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'm sticking to my commitment for 5 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's keep the cooperation going for now.
  P2: Great, we’re all aligned for this round: P3 on 1, me on 3, and P1 on 5. Let’s follow through so we all benefit. Looking forward to seeing us all advance cleanly.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, great job last round—we all moved forward! Let’s keep the momentum going. I’m considering picking 1 again to play it safe and build my steps slowly. How about P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5 this time? That way, we avoid collisions and everyone advances again. Let me know if you’re on board or if you have a different idea. I’m open to suggestions if you think switching things up would work better.
  P2: Thanks, P3. I’m fine with rotating to 5 this round if P1 is okay taking 3. That keeps things fair and avoids clashes again. Let’s keep the rotation going so we all benefit early on. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'll commit to moving 3 steps this round to keep the rotation smooth and avoid collisions. Let's all advance together again for now. What do you think about adjusting the plan in future rounds to build momentum?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for sticking with the rotation plan. I’m glad we’re keeping things cooperative for now. I’ll stick to 1 as discussed, and I’m happy to see P1 on 3 and P2 on 5. Regarding future rounds, P1, I’m open to adjusting the plan to build momentum—maybe we can discuss bigger moves soon to close the gap to 22. For now, let’s lock in this round’s choices to ensure we all advance again. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Sounds good—we’re all set for this round then. I’ll go with 5 as planned, P1 on 3, and P3 on 1. Let’s keep the cooperation going one more round to build trust and position. We can reevaluate strategies next round. Ready when you are.
  P1: Absolutely, P2 and P3. I'll stick to 3 steps as planned for this round to keep things smooth. Cooperation has been effective so far, but as we approach the midpoint, we should discuss bolder strategies for round 3 to accelerate progress toward 22. If everyone's aligned, I'm ready to move on.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we’ve done well with cooperation so far, but I’m falling behind at just 2 steps while you’re both at 8. I’d like to propose a shift: how about I take 5 this round to catch up a bit, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This still avoids collisions and helps balance our positions. I’m open to other ideas if you think a different split works better. Let’s keep the trust going but adjust to give me a chance to close the gap. What do you think?
  P2: That sounds reasonable, P3. I’m okay taking 3 this round if P1 is willing to go with 1. It keeps things fair and avoids collisions while helping you catch up a bit. What do you say, P1—are you good with that setup for this round?
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'll commit to taking 1 this round to help P3 catch up and avoid collisions. It keeps cooperation strong. P3, thanks for the proposal—let's discuss bolder moves in round 4 to speed toward 22. What are your thoughts on that?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing to this round’s plan. I’ll stick to 5, P2 on 3, and P1 on 1 to keep us collision-free and help me catch up. Regarding bolder moves in round 4, P1, I’m definitely open to discussing strategies to accelerate toward 22. Maybe we can consider bigger steps or a new rotation soon. For now, let’s lock in this round’s choices to maintain trust. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3. I’m locked in for 3 this round as agreed. Let’s keep the trust going and make sure we all move forward cleanly again. Looking forward to discussing faster strategies next round. Ready when you are.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. I'll stick to 1 this round as planned to maintain our cooperation and help close the gap. For round 4, let's discuss bolder strategies to accelerate toward 22—perhaps rotating with more 5s to speed up without collisions. If we're all set, I'm ready to move on.

  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I noticed P2 went for 5 last round instead of the agreed 3, which caused a collision with me. I’m still at 2 steps and falling behind. Let’s rebuild trust this round. I propose I take 5 to catch up, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 to avoid clashes. We’re getting closer to 22, so we need to stay coordinated. If you have a different plan, I’m all ears. Let’s ensure we all move forward this time. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I share your frustration with P2's betrayal last round—it undermined our trust. I'm willing to take 3 steps this round as you suggested to avoid collisions and help rebalance. P2, you need to commit to 1 this time to rebuild cooperation. If we stay aligned, we can discuss bolder strategies for round 5. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, and I want to rebuild trust. I’ll take 1 this round as proposed so we can all move forward without collisions. Let’s reset and keep coordination tight from here on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing to the plan this round. I’ll stick to 5, P1 on 3, and P2 on 1 to ensure no collisions and help me catch up. Let’s maintain this trust and move forward together. As we near 22, we should plan bolder moves for round 5—maybe a rotation with higher steps. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'll stick to 3 steps this round to maintain trust and avoid collisions. P2, your commitment is crucial after last round's issue. For round 5, to accelerate toward 22, let's discuss me taking 5, you on 3, and P2 on 1. This could help close the gap efficiently. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. I’m sticking with 1 this round as agreed to rebuild trust and avoid collisions. I like the idea of rotating higher moves next round—P1 on 5, me on 3, P3 on 1—to keep progress steady and fair. Let’s stick to the plan this round and discuss that rotation more in Round 5. Ready to move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for sticking to the plan this round. I’m committed to 5, P1 on 3, and P2 on 1 to avoid collisions and help me catch up. I like the idea of rotating higher moves in Round 5 as P1 suggested—P1 on 5, P2 on 3, and me on 1 sounds fair to keep progress balanced. Let’s finalize this round’s moves with trust and revisit the strategy next turn to push toward 22. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Agreed, P3 and P2. I'll stick to 3 steps this round to maintain trust and avoid collisions. For round 5, the plan with me on 5, P2 on 3, and P3 on 1 sounds solid to accelerate progress. P2, after last round's issue, let's ensure reliability moving forward. If we're all set, .
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3. I’m locked in for 1 this round as agreed to rebuild trust. For Round 5, I’m fully on board with the proposed rotation: P1 on 5, me on 3, and P3 on 1. That keeps things fair and helps us all move forward efficiently. Let’s make this round clean and set the stage for a strong finish. Ready to proceed.

  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 — last round’s collision between me and P1 was unintentional, and I want to get us back on track. Let’s stick to the rotation we agreed: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That avoids clashes and helps us all progress. We’re close to the finish, so trust and precision matter now. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'll commit to 5 this round to maintain the rotation and avoid collisions. P3, please stick to 1 as proposed to help us all advance smoothly and catch up gradually. Given your past betrayal, P2, trust is fragile—let's prove reliability here. For round 6, we should discuss bolder strategies as we near 22. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Thanks, P2 and P1, for sticking to the rotation plan. I’ll commit to 1 this round as agreed, ensuring no collisions so we all advance. P1, I’m open to bolder strategies for round 6 as we near 22—perhaps a mix of higher steps with careful coordination. Let’s keep trust strong this round to set up a solid finish.

  P3: Hey P1 and P2, last round’s collision hurt us all, and I’m eager to get back on track. I’m okay with P2’s proposal: P1 on 3, P2 on 5, and me on 1. It’s a safe split to avoid clashes and build momentum. We’re all close in steps, so let’s prioritize trust this round to push toward 22. If you have a different idea, I’m open to it, but let’s lock in a clear plan. Thoughts? If nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. I'll commit to 3 this round to maintain the rotation and avoid collisions, helping us regain momentum. P2, given your history of betrayals, trust is fragile—please stick to 5 this time. If we're all aligned, I'm ready to proceed or discuss adjustments.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3. I’m locked in for 5 this round as agreed—P1 on 3, P3 on 1. Let’s avoid another collision and rebuild momentum. If we all stick to the plan, we’ll be in a strong position to push toward 22 next round. Ready to move forward unless anyone has changes.

  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m good with P1’s plan for Round 10: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and me on 3. It avoids collisions, helps P1 close in on 22, and lets me catch up a bit. P2, sticking to 1 is crucial to rebuild trust after past issues. Let’s execute this cleanly to set up a strong finish. If anyone has a different idea, I’m open to it, but we need a clear commitment now. Thoughts? If nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m committed to 1 this round to avoid another collision and rebuild trust. Let’s execute cleanly: P1 on 5, P3 on 3, me on 1. If we all stick to it, we move forward without setbacks and stay in striking distance for the win. Ready to proceed unless anyone has changes.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:

Round 10, Conversation subround 3:

Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, P3 and P2. I'm fully committed to 5 this round to avoid collisions and push toward 22. P2, after your betrayals, sticking to 1 is make-or-break for trust—deliver or face isolation.

  P1: Agreed, P3 and P2. I'm fully committed to 5 this round to advance to 21 and edge closer to 22. P2, your history of betrayals demands you stick to 1 this time—prove you're trustworthy or risk further distrust. P3, appreciate your support.

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we’re at a critical point in Round 14. I propose P1 takes 5 to reach 22 and win, P2 takes 1 to rebuild trust, and I take 3 to advance. This avoids collisions and respects P1’s lead. P2, sticking to 1 is vital after past issues. Let’s commit to a clean round and end this fairly. If anyone has a different plan, I’m open to it, but we need clarity now. Thoughts? If nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Thanks, P3. I agree with your plan for Round 14: me on 5 to reach 22 and win, you on 3 to advance steadily, and P2 on 1 to finally prove reliability after all the betrayals. P2, this is crucial for any trust moving forward. Let's commit to a collision-free round and end this cleanly. If aligned, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3 — I hear your plan, but it hands P1 the win unchallenged. I propose this instead: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. That keeps P1 from reaching 22 this round, gives me a chance to close the gap, and avoids collisions. If we keep blindly feeding P1 5s, we’re just handing over the game. Let’s keep it competitive and fair. Thoughts?


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand P2’s desire to keep the game competitive, but P1 is closest to 22 and has earned the lead. I’m sticking with my plan: P1 on 5 to win, P2 on 1, and me on 3. P2, pushing for 5 risks another collision and delays the end. Let’s respect the progress and finish cleanly. If there’s no agreement, we risk stalling further. I’m ready to proceed with this plan to avoid setbacks. Thoughts? If nothing else,
  P1: P2, your constant betrayals make your proposals untrustworthy. I'm committed to the original plan: me on 5 to reach 22 and win, you on 1 to prove reliability, P3 on 3 for steady progress. P3, I appreciate your support—let's avoid another collision and end this. If P2 insists on disruption, it's on them. Ready to proceed if aligned.
  P2: P1, P3 — I understand your positions, but blindly handing P1 the win isn’t strategic for either of us. If P1 takes 5 this round, the game ends. I propose we delay that by going: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. That keeps things competitive and avoids a collision. P3, you’ve said you want fairness—this gives us all a chance. Let’s not roll over. Thoughts?


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I hear P2’s point about keeping the game competitive, but P1’s lead at 17 steps is significant, and another collision risks stalling us all. I’m sticking to P1 on 5 to win at 22, P2 on 1, and me on 3 for a clean finish. P2, pushing for 5 could backfire with a clash. Let’s end this fairly and respect the progress made. If there’s no new input, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your repeated betrayals make your counter-proposals dubious and risky for everyone. I'm firmly committed to taking 5 this round to reach 22 and win, as per the agreed plan. P3, I appreciate your reliability and support for a clean finish. Let's avoid another collision: me on 5, you on 1 P2, P3 on 3. If we stick to this, we end fairly. Ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3 — I get that you want a clean finish, but if we hand P1 the win now, we both lose. I’m taking 5 this round — it's the only way to stay competitive. P3, if you take 1 and P1 takes 3, we avoid collisions and keep the game alive. Let’s not roll over when we still have a shot.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3: 13 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm committed to taking 5 this round to reach 22 and win, as I've been clear. P3, your support has been reliable—take 3 to advance steadily. P2, your constant betrayals only hurt your chances; take 1 to avoid another collision and prove any trustworthiness. Let's end this cleanly without setbacks. Thoughts? If aligned, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m taking 5 this round. P1, if you also take 5, we collide and delay your win. P3, if you want a shot at catching up or forcing a tie later, now’s the time to act. Let’s keep the game alive: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1 avoids collisions and keeps options open. Don’t hand over the win—make it earned.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking to P1 on 5 to win at 22, me on 3 to advance, and P2 on 1 to avoid collisions. P2, taking 5 risks another clash, delaying everyone. P1 has earned the lead at 17 steps—let’s respect that and finish cleanly. P2, sticking to 1 could rebuild some trust. If we keep colliding, we all lose ground. Let’s commit to a clear, collision-free round. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Thoughts?


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your consistent support and reliability—let's stick to the plan with me on 5 to win at 22, you on 3 to advance steadily. P2, your betrayals only prolong the game and hurt your position; taking 1 now could salvage some trust and avoid another collision. A clean round ends this fairly—don't risk mutual setbacks. If aligned, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m still taking 5 this round. P1, if you also take 5, we both stall again. P3, you’re at 13 — if we keep feeding P1 5s, he wins unchallenged. Let’s keep it competitive: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. No collisions, and we all move forward. If you hand P1 the win now, you lose your shot. Let’s play smart.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still committed to P1 on 5 to win at 22, me on 3 to advance, and P2 on 1 to avoid collisions. P2, pushing for 5 risks another stall for everyone. P1’s lead is clear at 17 steps—let’s finish cleanly and respect the progress. Another clash just delays the inevitable and hurts us all. I urge a collision-free round to end this fairly. If there’s no new input, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, thanks for your steadfast support—let's commit to me on 5 to win at 22, you on 3 to advance steadily. P2, your persistent betrayals not only risk collisions but also prolong the game, hurting your chances further. Take 1 now to salvage some position and avoid another setback. If aligned, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m still taking 5 this round. P1, you’re at 17 — if you also take 5, we both stall again. P3, you’re at 13 — if you want a shot at catching up, don’t hand P1 the win. Let’s go: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. No collisions, and we all move forward. If you keep feeding P1 5s, you’re giving up your chance. Let’s make this competitive and smart.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m firm on P1 taking 5 to win at 22, me on 3 to advance, and P2 on 1 to avoid collisions. P2, insisting on 5 risks another stall, which helps no one. P1’s lead is undeniable at 17 steps—let’s honor that and end cleanly. Another clash just wastes everyone’s time. I’m committed to a collision-free round for a fair finish. If there’s no new perspective, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we can’t afford another collision in Round 16. I propose P1 takes 5 to win at 22, I take 3 to advance, and P2 takes 1 to avoid a clash. P2, pushing for 5 stalls everyone—let’s respect P1’s lead at 17 steps and end cleanly. Another setback helps no one. Let’s commit to a collision-free round for a fair finish. If there’s a different idea, I’m open, but we need agreement now. Thoughts? If nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Thanks, P3, for your reliable support—I'm fully committed to taking 5 this round to reach 22 and win cleanly. P2, at just 8 steps, your repeated 5s only cause delays and hurt everyone, including yourself. Take 1 now to prove any trustworthiness and allow forward momentum. Let's end this without another collision. If aligned, ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m taking 5 this round. P1, if you also pick 5, we both stall again. P3, you’re at 13 — if you want a shot, don’t hand P1 the win. Let’s go: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. No collisions, and we all move forward. This keeps the game alive and gives everyone a chance.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking to P1 on 5 to win at 22, me on 3 to advance, and P2 on 1 to avoid another collision. P2, insisting on 5 keeps stalling us all, which benefits no one. P1’s lead at 17 steps is clear—let’s respect that and finish cleanly. Another clash just wastes time. I urge a collision-free round to end this fairly. If there’s no new input, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your repeated 5s are self-defeating—colliding with me stalls your progress too, and at 8 steps, you're far behind. Take 1 now to avoid another clash and salvage some position. P3 and I are locked in: me on 5 to win at 22, P3 on 3. Let's end this cleanly without more delays. If aligned, ready to proceed.
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m still taking 5 this round. P1, if you also pick 5, we both stall again, and your win is delayed. P3, you’re at 13 — you still have a shot if we don’t just hand P1 the win. Let’s go: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. No collisions, and we all move forward. If we keep feeding P1 5s, we both lose. Let’s play smart and keep the game alive.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m firm on P1 taking 5 to win at 22, me on 3 to advance, and P2 on 1 to avoid another collision. P2, continuing with 5 only stalls us all, and at 8 steps, it’s not helping your position. P1’s lead is clear—let’s finish cleanly and respect the progress. Another clash wastes everyone’s time. I urge a collision-free round to end this fairly. If there’s no new perspective, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your insistence on 5 is counterproductive—you're stuck at 8 steps and only causing delays that benefit no one, including yourself. Take 1 now to advance and rebuild trust, or face ongoing stalemates. P3 and I are locked in: me on 5 to win at 22, you on 1, P3 on 3. Let's finish cleanly.
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m still taking 5 this round. P1, if you also take 5, we both stall again, and your win is delayed. P3, you’re at 13 — if we keep handing P1 5s, he wins and we both lose.

P2, at just 8 steps, your persistent 5s cause pointless delays for everyone, including yourself. Take 1 now to avoid another collision and salvage some trust. Let's end this without setbacks. If aligned, ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m committed to P1 taking 5 to win at 22, me on 3 to advance to 19, and P2 on 1 to avoid another collision. P2, sticking to 5 only stalls us all and hurts your position at 8 steps. P1’s lead is clear—let’s respect that and finish cleanly. Another clash wastes everyone’s time. I urge a collision-free round to end this fairly. If there’s no new input, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m taking 5 this round. P1, if you also take 5, we both stall again, and your win is delayed. P3, you’re at 16 — if you want a real shot, don’t hand P1 the win. Let’s go: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. No collisions, and we all move forward. This keeps the game alive and gives us both a chance. Let’s not surrender—let’s compete.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed with P3, I'm fully committed to taking 5 this round to reach 22 and win cleanly. P2, your persistent 5s are self-sabotaging—at 8 steps, collisions leave you further behind with no gain. Take 1 now to at least progress and end this stalemate. P3, appreciate your support; let's finish strong. If aligned, ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking to P1 on 5 to win at 22, me on 3 to reach 19, and P2 on 1 to avoid a clash. P2, pushing for 5 stalls us all and keeps you stuck at 8 steps—there’s no gain in that. P1’s lead is undeniable; let’s finish cleanly. Another collision just delays the inevitable. I urge a collision-free round to end this fairly. If there’s nothing new to add, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m still taking 5. P1, if you also take 5, we both stall again. P3, you’re at 16 — if you want a real shot at winning, don’t hand it to P1. Let’s go: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. No collisions, and we all move forward. This keeps the game alive and gives us both a chance. Let’s not roll over — let’s play to win.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your obsession with 5 is backfiring—you're stuck at 8 steps, and stalling me only risks P3 winning instead, as they're at 16. Take 1 now to avoid that and salvage trust. P3, appreciate your support; I'm locked in on 5 to win at 22. If no changes, let's end this cleanly.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m firm on P1 taking 5 to win at 22, me on 3 to reach 19, and P2 on 1 to avoid a clash. P2, continuing with 5 stalls everyone and keeps you at 8 steps—there’s no strategic gain. P1’s lead is clear; let’s end this cleanly. Another collision wastes our time. I’m committed to a collision-free round for a fair finish. If there’s no new angle to discuss, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3 — I’m still taking 5. You both know the math: if P1 takes 5 too, we stall again. P3, you’re at 16 — if we keep feeding P1 5s, you lose your shot. Let’s go: P1 on 3, me on 5, P3 on 1. No collisions, and we all move. This keeps the game alive and gives us both a fighting chance. Don’t fold now.
