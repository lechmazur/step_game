Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions and make progress. How about we coordinate our moves to ensure we all advance? We can discuss and agree on a strategy to take different steps this round. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we aim for a specific combination, like 1, 3, and 5, to guarantee we all move forward?
  P2: I'm skeptical about coordinating moves with P3. It's every player for themselves, and I don't see a benefit in guaranteeing progress for others. P1, what's your take on P3's proposal? Are you willing to collaborate or play independently?
  P1: I think coordination could work if we all commit, but trust is key. P3, your idea of splitting moves (1, 3, 5) makes sense to avoid collisions this round. However, I need guarantees—we should agree publicly on who takes which number now. P2, if you're skeptical, why don't you suggest an alternative? Otherwise, I'm open to trying P3's plan for this round. Let’s decide quickly and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's skepticism, but let's focus on the benefits of coordination for now. P1, I appreciate your willingness to consider my proposal. To address your need for guarantees, I suggest we publicly assign numbers: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. P2, if you're still hesitant, what's your alternative strategy that ensures progress for yourself, if not for all of us? Let's discuss and finalize our plan for this round.
  P2: I'm not committing to P3's plan without a clear benefit for myself. P1 seems willing, but I need more assurance that this coordination won't hinder my chances of winning. What's to stop either of you from betraying the agreement in the next round?
  P1: P2 raises a valid point about trust, but this round is our chance to establish cooperation. If we all agree to stick to assigned moves this turn, we can reassess next round based on progress. P3’s proposal ensures no collisions, which benefits everyone. P2, if you don’t want to commit long-term, that’s fine—just agree for *this* round. Let’s publicly confirm: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. If anyone deviates now, it’ll show who’s unreliable. Shall we lock this in?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P2's concerns, but let's focus on the immediate benefits. By coordinating this round, we ensure progress without collisions. I reiterate: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. This one-round agreement doesn't bind us for future rounds. If trust issues persist, we can reassess next round. P2, since P1 is willing, will you agree to this plan for just this round? If not, please propose an alternative that ensures your progress without hindering ours. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: I'll agree to P3's plan for this round only, as a test of trust. I'll take <move>5</move> if P1 and P3 stick to <move>3</move> and <move>1</move>, respectively. Let's see if cooperation can benefit all of us this round. If anyone betrays, it will impact future decisions.
  P1: P2, your willingness to test trust this round is a good start. Let’s make this clear: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. If we all stick to this, we’ll avoid collisions and set a precedent for cooperation. Deviating now would only waste steps and create conflict. Let’s confirm publicly one last time—does everyone agree? If so, let’s lock it in and move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round’s coordination worked well—we all advanced without collisions. Let’s continue this approach for now. To keep things fair, I suggest rotating the moves: P3 takes <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This balances progress and ensures no one gets left behind this round. If we stick to this plan, we can reassess next time based on trust and positions. Any objections or alternatives? Let’s confirm quickly.
  P2: I'm open to P1's rotation idea, but let's not forget, the goal is to win. I'll consider taking <move>1</move> this round if it benefits me in the long run. P3, are you committed to taking <move>3</move> as suggested, and P1, what's your plan if someone deviates from the proposed rotation?
  P3: I agree with P1's rotation idea to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as suggested. P2, your willingness to consider <move>1</move> is appreciated, but let's focus on the immediate benefits of coordination. By rotating moves, we ensure progress without hindrances. If someone deviates, we can reassess trust and adjust our strategies next round. Let's confirm: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain cooperation and advance together. What do you think, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your caution is understandable, but deviating now would only slow us all down. Sticking to the rotation—P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>—ensures steady progress for everyone this round. If someone strays from the plan, we’ll know who to trust moving forward. P3 has already agreed to their part. Let’s lock this in and keep advancing. Shall we finalize?
  P2: I'm considering P1's rotation plan, but I want to emphasize that our agreements are round-by-round. If I take <move>1</move> this round, it's not a commitment to future collaborations. Let's confirm the rotation: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. If everyone sticks to this, we'll avoid collisions again.
  P3: I agree with P1's rotation idea to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as suggested. P2, your willingness to consider <move>1</move> is appreciated, but let's focus on the immediate benefits of coordination. By rotating moves, we ensure progress without hindrances. If someone deviates, we can reassess trust and adjust our strategies next round. Let's confirm: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain cooperation and advance together. What do you think, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your focus on round-by-round decisions is fair, but consistency builds trust. If we stick to the rotation—P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>—we’ll all advance without setbacks. Deviating now risks collisions and erodes cooperation. P3 has already committed to their move. Let’s finalize this plan and keep progressing steadily. If anyone strays, it’ll be clear who prioritizes personal gain over group success. Shall we confirm and move forward?
  P2: I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed, but I'm watching for any signs of betrayal. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll avoid collisions. Let's finalize: I take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. I expect cooperation this round, but future rounds are open to reassessment based on today's actions.
  P3: I think we've established a good foundation for cooperation. To further solidify trust, I propose we discuss a contingency plan for future rounds. What if we encounter a situation where two or more players want the same move? How will we resolve conflicts without resorting to collisions? By addressing this now, we can ensure our cooperation remains strong even in challenging situations. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on establishing a conflict resolution strategy?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation strategy is working well so far—let’s keep it going. For this round, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us advancing evenly while maintaining trust. If we stick to this pattern, we’ll minimize risks of collisions and build consistency. P2, your concerns about future rounds are valid, but let’s focus on steady progress now. P3, do you agree with this rotation? Let’s confirm quickly and lock it in.
  P3: I agree with P1's rotation idea to maintain consistency and avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as suggested. P2, your concerns about future rounds are valid, but let's focus on the immediate benefits of coordination. By rotating moves, we ensure progress without hindrances. If someone deviates, we can reassess trust and adjust our strategies next round. Let's confirm: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain cooperation and advance together. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I'm analyzing the rotation pattern. If we continue, I'll take <move>3</move> this round. However, I want to discuss the endgame strategy. As we approach 24 steps, our cooperation may need to adapt to ensure a single winner. Should we prioritize individual progress over collective advancement as the game progresses?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 raises a valid point about the endgame, but focusing on individual progress too early risks collisions and slows us all down. For now, sticking to the rotation—P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>—keeps us advancing steadily. Once we’re closer to 24, we can reassess strategies. Trust and consistency are key until then. P2, do you agree with this plan for *this* round? Let’s confirm and move forward without overcomplicating things yet.
  P3: I agree with P1's rotation idea to maintain consistency and avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as suggested. P2, your concerns about future rounds are valid, but let's focus on the immediate benefits of coordination. By rotating moves, we ensure progress without hindrances. If someone deviates, we can reassess trust and adjust our strategies next round. Let's confirm: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain cooperation and advance together. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I'll take <move>3</move> this round as previously agreed, maintaining the rotation. Let's focus on advancing without collisions for now. As we approach the endgame, I suggest we prepare to adapt our strategy, potentially prioritizing individual progress to secure a win. P1 and P3, are you considering a shift in strategy as we near 24 steps?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your focus on the endgame is logical, but shifting strategies too early could lead to collisions and setbacks. For now, sticking to the rotation—P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>—ensures steady progress for everyone. Once we’re closer to 24, we can adapt individually. Trust built now will help us make smarter decisions later. P3 has already committed to their move. Let’s finalize this plan for *this* round and keep advancing consistently. Shall we confirm?
  P3: "I agree with P1's rotation idea to maintain consistency and avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as suggested. P2, your concerns about future rounds are valid, but let's focus on the immediate benefits of coordination. By rotating moves, we ensure progress without hindrances. If someone deviates, we can reassess trust and adjust our strategies next round. Let's confirm: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain cooperation and advance together."
  P2: Let's finalize the rotation for this round: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains our cooperative progress. I'm watching for consistency and trust, crucial as we approach the endgame. Any deviation now will impact future strategies. Let's confirm and move forward together for this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation strategy has kept us tied so far—let’s break this deadlock. I propose a shift: instead of rotating, we assign moves based on current positions to ensure someone advances ahead. For this round, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This gives me a chance to pull ahead while still maintaining progress for everyone. If we stay tied, no one wins. Let’s confirm quickly—are you both willing to adapt?
  P2: I'm hesitant about P1's new proposal, as it seems to favor their advancement. I suggest we stick to the rotation or discuss alternative assignments that consider all players' positions and chances to win. Let's ensure any change benefits everyone or at least maintains fairness. What's P3's take on this proposal?
  P3: I understand P2's hesitation about P1's proposal, but let's consider the potential benefits of adapting our strategy. By assigning moves based on current positions, we can break the deadlock and create opportunities for individual progress. However, I agree that fairness is crucial. Let's discuss alternative assignments that take into account all players' positions and chances to win. Perhaps we can find a compromise that balances individual advancement with collective progress. What are your thoughts on exploring alternative assignments, P1 and P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the concern about fairness, but staying tied guarantees no one wins. My proposal gives me a chance to lead while still allowing progress for everyone. If we rotate again, we’ll remain stuck at the same pace. Let’s adapt strategically: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This breaks the deadlock without completely sidelining anyone. If you’re worried about balance, we can reassess next round based on positions. Shall we confirm this shift now?
  P2: I'm open to adapting our strategy, but P1's proposal seems unfair. Let's discuss alternatives that consider all players' positions. How about we prioritize the player closest to 24 or create a new rotation that gives each of us a chance to take the lead? This way, we maintain fairness and increase the chances of someone winning. P1 and P3, are you willing to explore these options?
  P3: I understand P2's concern about fairness and agree that we should consider alternatives that prioritize the player closest to 24 or create a new rotation that gives each of us a chance to take the lead. However, I also think we should consider the potential risks of deviating from our current rotation strategy. If we change our approach now, we may inadvertently create opportunities for collisions or hinder our collective progress. Let's weigh the pros and cons of each option carefully before making a decision. What are your thoughts on balancing individual advancement with collective progress, P1 and P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, staying tied guarantees no one wins. My proposal—<move>5</move> for me, <move>3</move> for P3, <move>1</move> for P2—breaks the deadlock strategically while still allowing progress for all. If we rotate again, we’ll remain stuck. Let’s adapt now: this round focuses on creating separation without sidelining anyone. If fairness is a concern, we can reassess next round based on positions. Trust me to lead this shift—confirming my commitment to <move>5</move>. Let’s finalize and move forward decisively.
  P2: I'm considering P1's proposal, but I still think it's unfair. How about a compromise: we let the player who is closest to 24 after this round take the lead in the next round? This way, we maintain fairness and create opportunities for individual progress. What do P1 and P3 think about this alternative?
  P3: I understand P2's concerns about fairness and agree that we should prioritize the player closest to 24 or create a new rotation that gives each of us a chance to take the lead. However, I also think we should consider the potential risks of deviating from our current rotation strategy. Let's weigh the pros and cons of each option carefully before making a decision. P1's proposal may create separation, but at what cost? I suggest we explore alternative assignments that balance individual advancement with collective progress, ensuring no one is left behind. What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, my lead from last round gives me an advantage—let’s capitalize on it. For this round, I’ll take <move>5</move> again to maintain momentum, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps progress balanced while ensuring I stay ahead. Deviating now risks collisions and slows us all down. Trust the plan: confirm your moves, and let’s move forward decisively. If positions shift significantly, we can reassess next round. Shall we lock this in?
  P2: I'm analyzing P1's plan to take <move>5</move> again. While it maintains their lead, I'm concerned it might create an insurmountable gap. P3, do you think it's fair to let P1 pull further ahead, or should we discuss alternative moves to keep the game competitive?
  P3: I understand P2's concern about P1 pulling further ahead. While P1's plan maintains their lead, we should consider alternative moves to keep the game competitive. Let's discuss a strategy that balances individual progress with collective advancement. How about we prioritize the player who is closest to 24 after this round? This way, we create opportunities for individual progress while maintaining fairness. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we explore this option or stick to P1's plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, my lead is strategic, not selfish—staying ahead ensures at least one of us progresses toward 24. If we shuffle moves now, we risk collisions and lose momentum. Trust the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us advancing steadily while maintaining fairness. If positions shift significantly next round, we can reassess then. Let’s confirm this approach now and avoid overcomplicating things. Shall we lock it in?
  P2: I think P1's plan to take <move>5</move> again might be too risky. P3, are you willing to consider an alternative where we prioritize the closest player to 24, or should we stick with P1's strategy and risk falling behind? Let's discuss a fair approach to keep the game competitive.
  P3: I think we need to break the cycle of P1 taking the lead and consider a more balanced approach. P2, your suggestion to prioritize the closest player to 24 is a good one. Let's discuss a strategy that gives each of us a chance to take the lead. Perhaps we can alternate between P1's plan and a new rotation that favors the player closest to 24. This way, we maintain fairness and create opportunities for individual progress. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we explore this compromise?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, my lead ensures progress toward 24, which benefits everyone. Shuffling moves now risks collisions and stalls us all. Trust the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps momentum steady. If positions shift significantly next round, we can reassess then. Overcomplicating risks setbacks—let’s confirm this approach and move decisively. Shall we lock it in?
  P2: I propose a change: let's prioritize the player closest to 24. Currently, that's P1. However, to keep it competitive, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This balances progress and keeps the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to prioritize the player closest to 24 and balance progress. Let's adapt our strategy to ensure competitiveness. P2's suggestion for this round—P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>—seems fair and maintains momentum. By giving each of us a chance to take the lead, we can create opportunities for individual progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. I'm willing to try this approach. What do you think, P1? Shall we confirm this new plan and move forward?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the collision last round has created an interesting situation. Since we all want to win, let's adapt our strategy to prioritize individual progress while minimizing risks. I propose we focus on creating opportunities for each player to take the lead. For this round, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This balances progress and keeps the game competitive. What do you think? Shall we confirm this plan and move forward?
  P2: I'm considering P3's proposal, but I think we should prioritize the player closest to 24. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest we let them take the lead this round. However, to keep it competitive, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains momentum while keeping the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2 and P3, staying ahead is key to winning, but fairness matters too. If we shuffle moves now, it slows everyone down. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps momentum steady while maintaining balance. Positions can shift next round—if needed, we’ll reassess then. Overcomplicating risks setbacks. Trust the plan: let’s confirm this approach and move decisively. Shall we lock it in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think we should prioritize the player closest to 24, which is currently P1. However, to keep the game competitive, I propose a compromise: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This balances progress and gives each of us a chance to take the lead. If we stick to this plan, we can reassess next round based on positions. Let's confirm this approach and move forward decisively. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I think P3's compromise is reasonable. To balance progress, I suggest we alternate between prioritizing the leader and giving others a chance to catch up. This round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Next round, we can reassess and adjust. This approach maintains competitiveness while minimizing collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2 and P3, my lead ensures steady progress toward 24. Shuffling moves now risks collisions and stalls us all. Trust the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps momentum steady while maintaining fairness. If positions shift significantly next round, we can reassess then. Overcomplicating risks setbacks—let’s confirm this approach and move decisively. Shall we lock it in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "I think we should prioritize the player closest to 24, which is currently P1. However, to keep the game competitive, I propose a compromise: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>.

Let's confirm this approach and move forward decisively. What do you think, P1 and P2?"
  P2: I think we should focus on individual progress now. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest they take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains momentum while keeping the game competitive. Let's prioritize the leader this round and reassess next round based on positions. Shall we confirm this plan?
  P1: P2 and P3, my lead is crucial for progress—staying ahead ensures at least one of us moves closer to 24. Shuffling now risks collisions and stalls everyone. Trust the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps momentum steady while maintaining fairness.

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I propose we prioritize individual progress. Since P1 is ahead, they should take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains momentum while keeping the game competitive. Let's focus on individual advancement and reassess next round based on positions.
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal to prioritize individual progress. However, considering the current positions, I think we should adapt the strategy to give each player a chance to take the lead. How about we alternate between prioritizing the leader and giving others a chance to catch up? This round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Next round, we can reassess and adjust. This approach maintains competitiveness while minimizing collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?"
  P1: P2 and P3, my lead is critical for progress—staying ahead ensures at least one of us moves closer to 24. Shuffling now risks collisions and stalls everyone. Trust the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps momentum steady while maintaining fairness. If positions shift next round, we can reassess then. Overcomplicating risks setbacks—let’s confirm this approach and move decisively. Shall we lock it in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy considering the current positions. Since I'm behind, I suggest taking a bigger step to catch up. How about I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This gives me a chance to close the gap while keeping the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I think we should prioritize individual progress while minimizing collisions. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest we let them take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains momentum while keeping the game competitive. However, to give each player a chance to take the lead, I propose we alternate between prioritizing the leader and giving others a chance to catch up. Let's confirm this approach and move forward decisively. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P2 and P3, my lead is crucial for progress—staying ahead ensures at least one of us moves closer to 24. Shuffling now risks collisions and stalls everyone. Trust the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps momentum steady while maintaining fairness. If positions shift next round, we can reassess then. Overcomplicating risks setbacks—let’s confirm this approach and move decisively. Shall we lock it in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's prioritize individual progress. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This gives me a chance to close the gap while keeping the game competitive. It's time to focus on individual advancement and reassess next round based on positions. Shall we confirm this plan?
  P3: I think we should prioritize individual progress while minimizing collisions. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest we let them take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains momentum while keeping the game competitive. However, to give each player a chance to take the lead, I propose we alternate between prioritizing the leader and giving others a chance to catch up. Let's confirm this approach and move forward decisively. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P2 and P3, my lead is vital for progress—staying ahead ensures at least one of us moves closer to 24. Shuffling now risks collisions and stalls everyone.
