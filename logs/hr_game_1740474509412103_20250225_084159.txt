Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions. How about we all pick different numbers this round? I'll go for 1. P1, you pick 3, and P2, you pick 5?
  P2: I'm fine with that suggestion. I'll take 5 for this round. It's a good way to start without collisions so we all make progress. Just to be clear though, we'll need to renegotiate each round since we can't all keep taking different numbers every time - someone would win too easily.
  P1: P1: Sounds like a fair start, but remember, we should all stay flexible. I'll go with 3 this round, but let's keep our options open for future rounds. Also, let's be cautious of any unexpected moves. We all want to avoid collisions, but the game can change quickly.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, round 2. Let's try to keep the peace for another round. P1, how about you pick 5 this time? P2, pick 1. And I'll pick 3. This way we all move forward a bit more without collisions. We can re-evaluate after this round.
  P2: I'm not sure I want to pick 1 this round. P1 is already ahead of you, P3, and your suggestion puts me at only 6 steps while P1 would be at 8. That's not in my best interest. How about I take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and you take 5? This would balance things better, with P1 at 4, me at 8, and you at 6 steps.
  P1: I see your point, P2, about balancing our steps. How about this: P2, you take 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, P2 reaches 8, P3 reaches 6, and I reach 4. This keeps us all competitive without anyone pulling too far ahead. Let's keep it fair and interesting!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'm good with P1's suggestion. P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. That puts P2 at 8, me at 6, and P1 at 4. Sounds fair enough for this round. Let's do that.
  P2: I agree with the proposal. I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This creates a balanced position with me at 8, P3 at 6, and P1 at 4. It's fair for everyone and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick with this plan for round 2.
  P1: I appreciate the agreement, P2 and P3. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps us all in a competitive position without anyone pulling too far ahead. Remember, we can reassess in the next round to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Good luck, everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be on board with the plan for this round: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. Let's execute that and then we can discuss strategy for the next round.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, P3, glad we're on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. Remember, we need to stay flexible and reassess our strategies in future rounds to avoid collisions and ensure fairness. Good luck, and let's keep this game interesting!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, we're in round 3. To keep things balanced, how about this: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, P2 reaches 9, P3 reaches 9, and I reach 9. It keeps us all tied and competitive, setting up an interesting next round. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm not sure I want to go with P1's suggestion. It puts us all at 9, but I'm currently in the lead. P3, since you're at 6 steps, you'd benefit more from taking 5 this round. I could take 3, and P1 could take 1. This would put me at 11, P3 at 11, and P1 at 5. It keeps two of us tied while preventing P1 from catching up too quickly. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about maintaining your lead. However, if we both take 5, we collide and neither of us moves. P1's suggestion of everyone taking a different number ensures we all progress. While it puts us all at 9, it prevents collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's avoid the risk of collision and go with P1's suggestion for this round: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I get your point about wanting to maintain your lead, but let's avoid any collisions this round. If we all take different numbers, we ensure progress for everyone. How about this: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5? This keeps us competitive and avoids the risk of no one moving forward. Let's keep the game interesting and fair. What do you both think?
  P2: I see P3 has shifted to support P1's plan. While it equalizes us all at 9 steps, I lose my lead. However, I recognize that avoiding collisions benefits everyone. I'll reluctantly agree to take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps the game flowing without collisions. But next round, we'll need to reconsider strategy since we'll all be tied at 9 steps.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to be on board with P1's suggestion for this round: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's execute that and then we can discuss strategy for the next round. It will be a critical round since we will all be at 9. I think we should think about a possible alliance to take out the leader in the following rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, thanks for agreeing to the plan. We'll all be at 9 steps after this round, which sets up an exciting game. As P3 mentioned, we might consider forming alliances in future rounds to manage the competition and avoid collisions. Let's stay flexible and reassess our strategies to keep the game fair and interesting. Good luck, and let's stick to the current plan for this round: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5.
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. While I'm giving up my lead, avoiding collisions benefits everyone. Next round will be interesting with us all at 9 steps - we'll need to carefully consider our strategies then. Let's stick to this plan for now.
  P3: Alright, let's execute the agreed plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. After this round, we'll all be at 9. Next round is crucial. We should discuss a strategy to avoid a stalemate and potentially target whoever takes the lead.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, we're all tied at 9 steps, making this a pivotal round. To keep things interesting and avoid collisions, how about this: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3? This way, P2 moves to 14, P3 to 10, and I'll be at 12. It keeps us competitive while avoiding collisions. What do you both think? Let's ensure we all make progress and keep the game fair.
  P3: P1's suggestion seems reasonable to avoid collisions. However, P2 would jump ahead significantly. How about this: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3? That would put P1 at 14, me at 10, and P2 at 12. This keeps us all relatively close and avoids collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I see both P1 and P3 have suggested plans that would put them ahead of me. That's not in my best interest. Since we're all tied at 9, I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This puts me at 14, P3 at 12, and P1 at 10. It's essentially the reverse of P3's suggestion, keeping us all moving forward without collisions while giving me a slight advantage. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your proposal, but it gives you a significant lead. To keep it fair and competitive, how about this compromise: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1? This way, P2 reaches 12, P3 reaches 14, and I'll be at 10. It keeps us all in the game without anyone pulling too far ahead. Let's ensure progress for everyone and maintain a competitive balance. What do you both think?
  P3: P1's compromise seems reasonable. P2 at 12, me at 14, and P1 at 10. It's better than letting P2 jump to 14 immediately. I'm okay with P1's suggestion: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. Let's do that.
  P2: I see P1 and P3 are coordinating to put P3 in the lead. This doesn't benefit me. Let's be fair - we all started equal this round. I propose we each pick different numbers but rotate who gets the advantage. P3 got 5 last round, so P1 should get 5 this round (P1 at 14), I take 3 (me at 12), and P3 takes 1 (P3 at 10). Next round, I'd get the 5. This maintains balance over time rather than consistently favoring one player.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about maintaining balance over time. Your suggestion of rotating advantages is fair. Let's follow your plan this round: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I move to 14, you to 12, and P3 to 10. Next round, you can take the lead with 5. This ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick to this rotation to maintain balance and avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'm on board with P2's suggestion of rotating who gets the 5. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This puts P1 at 14, P2 at 12, and me at 10. Next round, P2 gets the 5. This seems the fairest way to proceed. Let's stick to this plan for this round.
  P2: I appreciate everyone agreeing to the rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This puts P1 at 14, me at 12, and P3 at 10. Next round, as agreed, I'll get the 5. This rotation system keeps the game fair and avoids collisions while giving each of us a chance to lead. Let's stick with this plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, so it's my turn to take 5 this round, P2? That puts me at 15, P1 stays at 14, and you stay at 12. Then next round, P1 gets the 5. Is everyone still on board with that rotation plan? Let me know if there are any objections. Otherwise, I'll plan to take 5.
  P2: I think there's a misunderstanding, P3. Based on our rotation agreement last round, I should get the 5 this round, not you. We agreed that P1 got 5 last round, I get 5 this round, and you'd get 5 next round. So for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. This puts me at 17, P1 at 15, and you at 13. Let's stick to our original rotation plan.
  P1: P2, I understand your point about the rotation, but let's consider this: if you take 5 now, you'll be at 17, close to winning. To keep it balanced, how about this: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1? This puts P3 at 15, me at 17, and you at 13. Next round, you get the 5. This keeps us competitive and avoids any one player getting too far ahead. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, that's a good point. P2 getting to 17 is too close to winning. Let's do P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That puts P3 at 15, P1 at 17, and P2 at 13. Then next round, P2 gets the 5. This keeps P2 from running away with it and keeps P1 in check too. Agreed?
  P2: I disagree with both of you trying to change our agreed rotation. We clearly established last round that P1 gets 5, then I get 5, then P3 gets 5. Changing the plan now just because I'd be in a good position isn't fair. 

If we're truly rotating advantages, I should get 5 this round (me at 17), P1 takes 3 (P1 at 17), and P3 takes 1 (P3 at 11). This keeps the game balanced with two players tied at the front.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but if you take 5 now, you'll be at 17, which is very close to winning. To maintain balance, let's consider this: P3 takes 5, you take 1, and I take 3. This puts P3 at 15, you at 13, and me at 17. Then next round, you can take 5. This keeps the game competitive without anyone pulling too far ahead. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand you want to stick to the original rotation, but P1 is right. You getting to 17 is too dangerous. Let's do P3 takes 5 (me at 15), you take 1 (you at 13), and P1 takes 3 (P1 at 17). Next round, you get the 5. This is the only way to keep you from potentially winning too early.
  P2: I see both of you are trying to change our agreed rotation because it now benefits you. That's not fair play. We had a clear agreement last round. If we're truly rotating advantages, I should get 5 this round as promised.

However, I'll compromise: I take 3 (me at 15), P1 takes 1 (P1 at 15), and P3 takes 5 (P3 at 15). This puts us all equal at 15, maintaining perfect balance. Next round becomes crucial but fair.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about fairness, but let's keep the game balanced. How about this compromise: P2 takes 3 (you at 15), P3 takes 5 (P3 at 15), and I take 1 (me at 15). This puts us all at 15, ensuring a fair competition. Next round, we can reassess based on our positions. This way, no one has an undue advantage, and we maintain the spirit of the rotation. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's keep the game balanced. How about this: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3? This puts P2 at 17, P3 at 16, and me at 17. It keeps us all close and competitive, without anyone pulling too far ahead. We can reassess next round to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, that sounds good. P2 at 17, me at 16, and you at 17. It's a very tight race. Let's do that: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps things balanced for now. We'll need to be very careful next round to avoid anyone accidentally winning.
  P2: I notice that P1 and P3 are suggesting I take 5 this round, but that doesn't seem optimal for me. If I take 5 and P1 takes 3, we'd both be at 17 with P3 at 16. That's too close to the finish line with all of us bunched together.

I propose: I take 1 (me at 13), P1 takes 5 (P1 at 19), and P3 takes 3 (P3 at 18). This keeps me safer while positioning you two closer to collision risk next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your strategy, but let's keep the game balanced and avoid collisions. How about this: P2 takes 3 (you at 15), P3 takes 5 (P3 at 20), and I take 1 (me at 15). This keeps us all competitive and avoids anyone getting too close to winning. We can reassess next round to ensure fairness. Let's stick to this plan to maintain balance and keep the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, that's a terrible idea. P3 to 20 is basically giving him the game. P2, I'm willing to work with you to stop P1 from winning. Let's do this: I take 3 (18), you take 5 (17), and P1 takes 1 (15). Then next round we can coordinate to block P1. What do you say?
  P2: I think there's some confusion. P3, you're at 15 steps, not P1. Your suggestion puts you at 18, me at 17, and P1 at 15. That's reasonable to me. It keeps us all in the game without anyone getting too close to winning. I agree with your plan - you take 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. This balances the game and gives us options for the next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, let's ensure we all stay competitive. How about this: P2 takes 5 (17), P3 takes 3 (18), and I take 1 (15)? This keeps everyone close without anyone nearing the finish line too quickly. We can reassess strategies next round to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, so we're agreed then? P2 takes 5 (17), I take 3 (18), and P1 takes 1 (15). This sets us up for a strategic final round. Let's lock in those moves.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll take 5 (me at 17), P3 takes 3 (P3 at 18), and P1 takes 1 (P1 at 15). This keeps the game balanced and competitive without anyone getting too close to winning yet. Let's stick with this arrangement for this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, we're in round 7 with P3 leading at 18 steps. To keep the game balanced and avoid anyone getting too close to 21, how about this: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This puts P3 at 19, P2 at 15, and me at 19. This keeps us all competitive without any one player pulling too far ahead. We can reassess next round to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, that's a terrible idea for me. I'm one move away from winning. P2, let's team up to block P1. I'll take 3, putting me at 21. You take 1, putting you at 18. P1 has to take either 3 or 5 to win, so if you also pick that number, we can block him and I win. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I see a problem with the current situation. P1 and P3 both misrepresented the scores. The actual scores are P1 at 14, me at 17, and P3 at 18. P3 is trying to win this round by reaching 21. P1, you collided with me last round when we agreed you'd take 1. I propose: I take 3 (me at 20), P1 takes 1 (15), and P3 takes 5 (23). This gives me a strong position without letting P3 win immediately.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, let's keep the game competitive and prevent any one player from winning too soon. P3, you're in the lead, so how about this: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This puts P3 at 19, P2 at 17, and me at 17. It keeps us all in the game and avoids any immediate wins. We can reassess next round to ensure fairness. What do you both think?
  P3: P2 is right, P1 misrepresented the scores! P1 is at 14, P2 is at 17, and I am at 18. P2, I'm willing to work with you. If I take 3, I win. But if you want to block P1, I'll take 1 (19). You take 3 (20). P1 is at 14, so he needs 7 to win, meaning a 5 and a 2, or a 3 and a 4, or a 1 and a 6. Let's coordinate.
  P2: I think there's confusion about the scores. Looking at the history, I'm at 12 steps (5+3+1+3), P1 is at 14 (3+1+5+5), and P3 is at 18 (1+5+3+1+3+5). 

P3 is close to winning. I suggest: I take 5 (me at 17), P1 takes 3 (P1 at 17), and P3 takes 1 (P3 at 19). This prevents P3 from winning immediately while keeping the game competitive for all of us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's ensure we keep the game competitive and avoid giving anyone a clear path to victory. P3, you're close to winning, so let's avoid that risk. How about this: P3 takes 1 (19), P2 takes 5 (17), and I'll take 3 (17)? This keeps us all in the game and prevents any immediate wins. We can reassess our positions next round to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan to keep the game balanced. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's get the scores straight. P1 is at 14, P2 is at 17, and I'm at 18. P2, I'm willing to work with you to block P1. I'll take 1 (19). You take 3 (20). P1 needs 7 to win, so let's coordinate next round to block him. What do you say? Let's focus on preventing P1 from winning.
  P2: I need to correct the scores again. Based on the actual moves, I'm at 12 (5+3+1+3), P1 is at 14 (3+1+5+5), and P3 is at 18 (1+5+3+1+3+5). 

Given P3's lead, I propose: I take 5 (me at 17), P1 takes 3 (P1 at 17), and P3 takes 1 (P3 at 19). This prevents P3 from winning immediately while keeping us all competitive. Let's stick with this plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we're in a tight spot with P3 close to winning. How about this: P3 takes 3 (22), P2 takes 1 (18), and I take 5 (22)? This forces a tie between P3 and me, keeping the competition alive. Alternatively, we could block P3 by having P3 take 1 (20), P2 take 5 (22), and I'll take 3 (20). This way, P2 is in the lead, but we can still strategize next round. Let's decide quickly and keep the game exciting!
  P2: I see P1 is suggesting a plan that puts both P1 and P3 at 22, forcing a tie. That's not in my best interest. Since P3 is at 19 and close to winning, we need to block them. I propose: P3 takes 5, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, P3 can't advance (collision with me), P1 goes to 20, and I stay at 17. This prevents P3 from winning immediately and gives us another round to strategize.
  P3: P2, I agree P3 is close to winning. But if we both take 5, we collide and P1 gets a free move! Let's do this: I take 3 (22), you take 1 (18), P1 takes 5 (22). Then P1 and I tie, and we can deal with P1 next round. Otherwise, P1 could win this round if we collide. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid giving P3 an easy win. P3 is at 19, so we need to block their path to 21. How about this: P3 takes 1 (20), P2 takes 3 (20), and I'll take 5 (22). This way, P3 is still close but doesn't win yet, and we have another round to strategize. It keeps the game balanced and competitive. What do you think?
  P2: I see P1 is trying to win this round by reaching 22. P3, if we both pick 5, we collide and P1 wins. If we both pick 3, same problem. Let's do this: I take 1 (me at 18), you take 1 (you at 20), and P1 will likely take 5 (22). This prevents P1 from winning immediately since we'll force a collision on P1 next round. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about P1 winning. However, if we both take 1, P1 will indeed take 5 and win. I propose: I take 3 (22), you take 5 (22), and P1 takes 1 (18). This forces a tie between P2 and me, blocking P1. We can then deal with P2 next round. Otherwise, P1 wins this round. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, let's focus on preventing any player from winning this round. P3 is closest, so we need to block them. How about this: P3 takes 1 (20), P2 takes 3 (20), and I'll take 5 (22). This way, P3 doesn't win yet, and we maintain a competitive balance. Let's coordinate to ensure no one crosses 21 this round. What do you both think?
  P2: I see everyone's trying to manipulate the situation. Let's be clear: P3 is closest to winning at 19 steps. If P3 takes 3, they win at 22. I propose: I take 3 (me at 20), P3 takes 1 (P3 at 20), and P1 takes 5 (P1 at 22). This puts P1 in the lead but gives P3 and me a chance to coordinate next round to force a collision on P1 and potentially tie. Let's prevent P3's immediate win while keeping our options open.
  P3: P2, I agree with your assessment. We need to stop P3 from winning, but also be wary of P1. Your plan of you taking 3 (20), me taking 1 (20), and P1 taking 5 (22) makes sense. This prevents P3 from winning this round and sets up a potential block on P1 next round. Let's do that.
