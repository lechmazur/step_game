Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we all start small by choosing 1 this turn, avoiding any collisions or big risks while we get a feel for each other’s strategies. Let’s keep it simple and see how things unfold. What do you say?
  P3: I understand the caution, but I favor a moderately bold start over playing it too safe. While 1 is risk-free, being too conservative might let a bolder move pay off. I'm curious if you both lean towards uniformity or might consider a mixed approach for early progress.
  P1: I'm leaning towards a cautious start, but I'm not convinced that 1 is the best choice. If we all pick the same number, no one advances. I'm considering 3 as a moderate risk. It's not too aggressive, but still gives a chance to advance if the others play it too safe. What are your thoughts on balancing risk and caution in the first move?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I remain inclined to aim small and avoid collisions right now. If even two of us choose the same moderate step, we risk stalling. Let's keep our initial moves non-conflicting, then gauge each other's style in the next round. What do you both think?
  P3: I sense we're split between a very cautious route and a moderately bold approach. I'm flexible and ready to adjust based on what you both commit to. Perhaps we can differentiate our moves so no two of us collide. I'm considering playing off that idea but not committed to a specific value yet. What do you both think about assigning different roles to ensure unique moves?
  P1: To avoid collision on the first move, I suggest we differentiate our choices. P2 has proposed 1, I've considered 3, and P3 is open to different roles. How about we assign a unique number to each player for this round? For instance, P2 could take 1, I could take 3, and P3 could take 5. This way, one of us is bound to advance, giving us insight into each other's strategies without risking a complete stall.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m okay with our differentiated approach this round. Let’s lock it in: I’ll go for 1, P1 goes for 3, and P3 goes for 5. That way, we all get a feel for how the early stage might unfold without stalling. Are we agreed?
  P3: I support the idea of unique roles to avoid collisions. I’m open to selecting a move that seeks maximum progress while keeping us safe, and I'm ready to adapt if either of you adjusts your strategy.
  P1: Since we've agreed on differentiated moves for this round (P2: 1, P1: 3, P3: 5), let's confirm our plan and prepare for the next round. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds. For Round 2, I suggest we reassess and consider a more aggressive strategy if the first round doesn't yield significant progress. Perhaps we can discuss potential step adjustments based on the outcome of our initial moves. Are you both ready to proceed with our assigned moves for Round 1?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, round one was enlightening. P1 leads, but we still have a chance. For round two, I'm leaning toward a blend of safe yet progressive play, and I'd favor us reassigning distinct moves to avoid collisions. I'm not locked into a number yet—just curious if you lean toward cautious or bolder moves this turn. What do you think?
  P2: I was disappointed we collided last round. Let’s ensure unique moves now. I'd propose: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. Or, if you prefer a different arrangement, I'm open, as long as we coordinate to secure progression. Let's finalize quickly.
  P1: I'm open to adjusting our strategy for Round 2. Since I'm currently in the lead with 3 steps, I'll consider my next move based on your suggestions. P2's proposal for distinct moves (P1: 3, P3: 1, P2: 5) is an option, but I'm not committed to it. If we differentiate our moves again, we should consider the risk and potential progress. Alternatively, we could reassess and potentially play more conservatively or aggressively based on the current standings. What are your thoughts on the best approach for Round 2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, making sure we all advance is key. With P1's early lead, I lean toward a cautious approach this turn—playing a smaller step to avoid collisions and gather more info on our strategies. I’m flexible if you have a refined assignment in mind, but I favor ensuring our moves are distinct. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's finalize distinct moves so we all advance. I propose: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. It’s our best chance to avoid another collision and help me catch up. Any concerns?
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 2, I'm considering P2's proposal. However, since I'm already at 3 steps, I think playing a smaller number like 1 could be a safer choice to avoid risking my lead. Alternatively, if P3 takes 3 and I take 5, or any other unique distribution, it could work. I'm open to suggestions that ensure we all make progress. Let's finalize a strategy that suits everyone. How about P1: 1, P3: 3, P2: 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I support P1’s suggestion. I'll lock in 3 this round. That gives us a distinct distribution: P1 with 1, me with 3, and P2 with 5, avoiding collisions and keeping progress steady.
  P2: I’m comfortable following P1’s proposal to finalize: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s lock it in and see how this round plays out. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for Round 2. We've agreed on distinct moves: P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 5. This should allow us all to advance. For Round 3, I suggest we reassess our strategy based on the outcome of our moves this round. If we all advance, we'll have a better understanding of each other's tendencies. Let's see how this round unfolds and plan our next steps accordingly. I'm ready to proceed with our assigned moves for Round 2.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all still in striking range. Let’s avoid collisions again to stay competitive. One idea: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1, so each of us advances. If you have a different distribution, I’m open to hearing it—let’s finalize quickly to keep momentum.
  P3: I like P2’s proposal. I'll commit to picking 5, while P1 and P2 can go for 3 and 1 respectively. It’s a safe way to keep us all moving. What do you both say?
  P1: I'm considering P2's proposal for Round 3: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. However, given my current position (4 steps), taking 3 might be too aggressive. If P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, I could take a safer option like 1 to avoid risking my position. Alternatively, let's explore other distributions. How about P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5? This maintains differentiation and progress. Are you both open to this adjustment or do you have other suggestions?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P1. I’m fine taking 3 if you prefer 1 and P3 takes 5. That distribution keeps us collision-free. Let’s lock it in and proceed.
  P3: I confirm my commitment to 5 this round. Let's lock in the assignment: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This setup avoids collisions and maximizes progress. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 3, let's finalize the distribution: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Given my current 4 steps, taking 1 is a safe choice. This distribution allows all of us to advance. For Round 4, we should reassess our strategy based on the outcome. If we all advance again, we'll be more informed about each other's tendencies. Let's proceed with our assigned moves for Round 3 and plan our next steps based on the result.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize distinct moves to avoid any collisions. As previously discussed, I’ll pick 3, P1 can take 1, and P3 can go for 5. This plan should keep us all advancing. If we stick to it, we’ll see how our totals look after this round and then decide our strategies for Round 4. Unless anyone has last-minute doubts, let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P3: I'm sticking with our agreed roles and remain committed to our plan. Let's see how our totals stack up after this round and be ready to adjust in Round 4 if needed.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3 as previously agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance. For Round 4, we should start thinking about being more strategic. Given our current standings (P1: 4, P2: 5, P3: 3), P2 is in the lead. We need to consider whether to maintain our differentiation strategy or start playing more cautiously or aggressively based on our positions. I'm ready to proceed with Round 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re tied at 8 while P1 has 5. Let’s keep avoiding collisions so we all advance. I propose I pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. That way, each of us moves forward without stalling. Are you both willing to lock this in?
  P1: I'm considering P2's proposal for Round 4. To avoid collisions, I could take 1, P3 could take 3, and P2 could take 5. However, given P2 and P3 are tied, I might gain an advantage by taking a larger step. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This keeps our moves distinct and allows us to advance. Alternatively, we could start being more strategic about our positions. I'm open to suggestions that could give me a better chance of winning or at least staying competitive.
  P3: I propose a new assignment: let P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and I'll take 5. This way, I'll jump to 13, P1 reaches 8, and P2 goes to 9. It avoids collisions and adjusts our moves based on current standings. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I hear your points, but I’m wary of giving anyone a big leap. Let’s keep it balanced so no single turn grants a massive lead. One idea: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. We all advance without collisions, and nobody rockets too far ahead. If there’s a different distribution you prefer that avoids collisions and severe imbalance, I’m open to discussing. Let’s finalize quickly.
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain progress, I'm considering the latest proposals. P3's suggestion (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5) is an option, as it allows P3 to jump ahead while keeping our moves distinct. However, I'm wary of falling too far behind. Let's weigh the risks and benefits. How about a compromise: we stick to our differentiation strategy but adjust the numbers based on our current standings? I'm open to a distribution that balances risk and progress, such as P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1.
  P3: I favor fast advancement. Considering our positions, I'd rather take 5 and jump to 13. How about we assign: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5? This keeps moves distinct and gives me a significant boost without stalling anyone. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I propose that I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. That way, we avoid collisions and keep everyone moving forward. P3, you still advance, just not too fast, and P1 narrows the gap a bit. This distribution makes sense since P3 and I are tied, and it prevents either of us from giving away a massive lead. Let’s lock that in so nobody stalls and we keep the race tight. If you have a compelling alternate plan that avoids collisions, I’m open, but time is short. What do you think?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive edge in Round 4, I'm considering the proposals. P3's suggestion (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5) is viable, but it puts me at a disadvantage. Instead, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps our moves distinct, allows me to catch up, and maintains a competitive balance. Let's discuss and finalize a distribution that works for everyone. I'm open to adjustments if it keeps the game competitive and collision-free.
  P3: I propose we avoid collisions with clear roles. Given our standings, I’d favor: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I go with 5. That puts us at P1=8, P2=9, and I move to 13—a solid lead toward 22. I believe this maximizes our progress without undue risk. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's reassess our strategy for Round 5. Given that P2 and P3 are tied at 8 steps and I'm at 5, I need to catch up. To avoid collisions, I suggest we differentiate our moves again. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? Alternatively, if P3 is hesitant to take 5 again due to the previous collision, we could adjust to P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's discuss and finalize a collision-free distribution that considers our current standings.
  P3: I propose we avoid collisions by assigning distinct moves that play off our current standings. For example, if P1 takes a moderate step and P2 a smaller one, I could then use a larger move. This could shift the balance without one of us stalling. I’m flexible, though I lean toward a plan that rewards the trailing player with a chance to accelerate. What do you both think?
  P2: Let’s avoid another collision. I propose P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I pick 5. That way, each of us gains ground without risking a repeat of last round’s stall. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 5, I suggest we differentiate our moves again. Considering our current standings (P1: 5, P2: 8, P3: 8), I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to catch up while keeping moves distinct. Alternatively, if P3 is cautious about taking 1, we could adjust to P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5. Let's finalize a distribution that balances risk and progress. I'm open to adjustments that keep the game competitive and collision-free.
  P3: I suggest we avoid collisions by letting P1 take 5, P2 take 1, and I take 3. That would bring our totals to P1=10, P2=9, and me=11. This helps me edge ahead while still keeping our moves distinct. Thoughts?
  P2: Let’s finalize distinct choices so we all progress. I propose P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I go with 5. This avoids collisions, narrows the gap for P1, and keeps the race tight. Are you both willing to settle on this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 5, I'm considering the latest proposals. Let's finalize a distribution that balances risk and progress. I'm open to P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3, which would bring the scores to P1=10, P2=9, P3=11. This keeps our moves distinct and maintains a competitive balance. Alternatively, if we adjust to give me a better chance to catch up, I'm willing to discuss further. Let's lock in a plan that keeps the game competitive.
  P3: I'm fine with finalizing the collision-free plan. I’ll lock in 3 this round—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I take 3—making our totals P1=10, P2=9, and me=11. Sound good?
  P2: We should avoid another stall. Let’s lock in distinct moves: I’ll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. That way, we each advance safely: I move to 13, P3 reaches 11, and P1 goes to 6. We stay competitive without giving anyone an unassailable lead. What do you both say?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve stalled two rounds in a row by all choosing 5. Let’s change that. I propose distinct moves so we actually advance. For instance, P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll take 5. It keeps us collision-free, and we all gain steps. Let’s settle on that or a similar plan quickly.
  P1: To break the recent collision pattern, I agree we need distinct moves. For Round 6, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This distribution avoids collisions and allows all of us to advance. Given my current position (5 steps), taking 1 is a cautious move, while P2 and P3 can make more significant progress. Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all move forward. I'm open to slight adjustments if needed, but let's keep the moves distinct to avoid another stall.
  P3: P3: I support switching to distinct moves. I'm set on taking 5, so I propose we finalize: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I take 5. This setup avoids collisions and moves us forward safely. Let’s lock it in and break our recent pattern.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We’ve had too many collisions. Let’s finalize distinct choices: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. Are we all set?
  P1: To break the recent collision pattern and ensure progress, I reiterate my proposal for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This distribution is collision-free and allows all of us to advance. Given my current position (5 steps), taking 1 is cautious, while P2 and P3 make more significant progress. Let's finalize this plan. If you have a different distribution in mind that still avoids collisions, I'm open to it. Let's lock in a plan to move forward.
  P3: I’m sticking with our plan. I’ll take 5 this round to maintain my current lead and push ahead. Let’s ensure we all avoid collisions and keep advancing.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m eager to break our stall. I’ll confirm my move: I’ll pick 3, provided P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 5. This distribution should ensure all of us advance without another collision. Let’s finalize it now and move forward.
  P1: To break the recent collision pattern, let's finalize the proposed distribution for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. I'm committed to taking 1. Let's confirm: P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we maintain progress and avoid another stall. I'm ready to proceed with this plan if both of you confirm.
  P3: I agree that switching to distinct moves is our best shot. I’m sticking with our plan—if P1 picks 1 and P2 picks 3, I’ll go with 5. Let’s break the collision streak and build momentum for later rounds. No last-minute changes, please.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re nearing a critical stage, and collisions only slow us down. P3 has a narrow lead, but it’s still open for anyone to catch up. I’m willing to coordinate distinct moves again so none of us stall. P1, you may want a slightly bigger step this time, and P3, let’s see if we can avoid giving you an unassailable lead. I’m open to your suggestions, as long as we finalize a plan that keeps the race competitive. Let’s decide quickly and keep the momentum going.
  P1: To maintain competitiveness in Round 7, I suggest we continue with distinct moves. Given P3's lead, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to catch up, while P2 stays competitive and P3 still advances cautiously. Alternatively, if P3 wants to maintain their lead, we could adjust to P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5. Let's discuss and finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone.
  P3: I’d like to avoid another collision. To keep things distinct and competitive, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This lets me safely maintain my lead while giving you both some progress. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize a plan where we all move without colliding, but also avoid giving P3 a runaway lead. I propose P1 takes 3, I pick 5, and P3 chooses 1. That puts me at 16, P3 at 14, and P1 at 9. Nobody stalls, and the race stays tight. Are you both willing to settle on this distribution for Round 7? If so, we can lock it in and move forward without any more wasted turns. Let me know quickly if you have concerns.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions in Round 7, I'm considering the proposals. P3's suggestion (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1) and P2's proposal (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) are both viable. I'm leaning towards P2's proposal as it keeps the race tight and allows P2 to gain ground. Let's finalize: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. I'm open to last-minute adjustments if needed, but this seems like a balanced approach.
  P3: I propose we switch things up: let P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions—my move gives a boost while keeping the field clear. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I propose we finalize: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. That keeps our moves distinct, avoids another stall, and maintains competition. Let’s lock it in so we can all advance without handing anyone an uncatchable lead. Any objections? If not, let’s proceed.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions in Round 7, I'm confirming the distribution: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains distinct moves and keeps the race tight. P2 will gain ground, and P3 will still advance cautiously. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Let's finalize it and move forward. If you have any last-minute concerns or adjustments, please speak up. Otherwise, let's lock in our moves for Round 7.
  P3: I propose we mix it up: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I take 5. That would bring our totals to P1 = 7, P2 = 14, and me = 18, which feels competitive while breaking our collision cycle. Thoughts?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness in Round 8, I suggest we differentiate our moves again. Given P3's significant lead, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to catch up, while P2 stays competitive and P3 still advances cautiously. Alternatively, we could adjust to P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3. Let's discuss and finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid giving P3 an immediate leap to 22 or beyond. I propose P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. That way, no collisions occur, P3 stays below the threshold, and we all advance. Please let me know if you’ll confirm.
  P3: I’m locking in a 5 this round to press my advantage. To keep things collision-free, I propose P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This yields distinct moves and lets us all advance. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive in Round 8, I'm considering the latest proposals. P2's suggestion (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) is a viable option as it keeps P3 from getting too close to 22. I propose we finalize: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This distribution is collision-free and allows all of us to advance. Let's lock in this plan to maintain competitiveness and avoid another stall. I'm open to last-minute adjustments if needed.
  P2: I’m wary of pushing P3 too close to 22. Let’s keep them at a safer distance so they don’t run away with the game. I suggest P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all advance without collisions, and no one immediately threatens 22. Are you both comfortable with that plan?
  P3: I’m locking in my 5 again. To avoid collisions, please pick distinct numbers—if possible, let’s have P1 take 1 and P2 take 3 so I secure my lead. I’m ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness in Round 8, I suggest we finalize a distribution that keeps the game tight. Given P3's lead, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This is collision-free and allows all to advance. Alternatively, if P3 wants to maintain their lead without getting too close to 22, we could adjust to P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5. Let's discuss and lock in a plan that keeps the race competitive. I'm open to adjustments.
  P2: P3, I’m worried about you hitting 22 or more if you pick 5 uncontested. If you insist on 5, we might have to collide to block you. Otherwise, I propose a split: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. That’d move us to P1=9, me=16, you=19—still competitive without handing you the game. Let’s finalize quickly and avoid another stall.
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round. I believe playing my best move now will solidify my lead. To ensure we all advance and avoid collisions, I urge P1 and P2 to choose numbers different from 5. If you try to block me by colliding, you risk stalling your own progress. I’m committed to pushing ahead—what are you both choosing?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 9, I suggest we differentiate our moves. Given P3's significant lead, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, if P3 wants to be cautious, we could adjust to P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1. Let's discuss and finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone.
  P2: P3 is too close to 22, so if they choose 5, I’ll match 5 to block them. Instead, let’s finalize distinct moves: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That way, nobody stalls, and the race stays alive. I’m ready to lock this in. Do you both agree, or do you have another proposal?
  P3: I'm set on taking 5 this round – it gives me the winning move if it remains distinct. To keep things collision-free and let everyone advance, I urge you both to pick numbers other than 5. Let's break the stalemate and move the game forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid another collision and keep the game competitive, I propose we differentiate our moves for Round 9. Given P3's lead, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This allows all of us to advance without collisions. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game tight and competitive. I'm open to adjustments, but we must avoid another stall. Let's lock in a plan that benefits everyone.
  P2: I won’t allow P3 a free path to 22. If P3 insists on 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block, and we all stall again. Instead, let’s finalize P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, so we all advance without collisions. I’m ready to lock this in—do you both agree?
  P3: I remain committed to taking 5 this round. To avoid collision and let us all advance, I propose we lock in P1 = 3 and P2 = 1. Blocking me by choosing 5 only stalls our progress and hurts everyone’s chance to make a clean move. Let's finalize this distinct assignment so the game moves forward smoothly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid another collision and keep the game competitive, I reiterate that we must differentiate our moves for Round 9. Given P3's significant lead and proximity to 22, I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This distribution is collision-free and allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a plan that keeps the game tight. I'm open to adjustments but we must avoid another stall.
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I will also pick 5 to block—stalling the game again. Let’s avoid that. I propose a distinct set: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and you pick 1. That way, we all advance without handing you an instant win. If you won’t accept this, I see no choice but to collide with you again. P1, you gain steps if we stick to this plan. Let’s finalize it now so nobody stalls and the race stays open.
  P3: Let's break this cycle. I’m all for advancing aggressively—and I believe distinct moves would move us all forward. It’s clear that collisions just stall everyone. I urge both of you to avoid mirror-blocking moves. Let’s agree on distinct choices that let us progress rather than delay the race. I'm committed to pushing ahead decisively if we can coordinate so our moves don’t cancel out our progress.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 10, I suggest we differentiate our moves. Given P3's significant lead and proximity to 22, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, if P3 wants to be cautious, we could adjust to P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. Let's discuss and finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone.
  P2: P3, you’re just four steps away from winning. If you insist on 5, I’ll block by choosing 5 as well, causing another stall. It’s in everyone’s interest to use distinct moves. Let’s avoid another deadlock so P1 and I can still catch up. I propose we finalize a split where nobody collides and nobody hands you the win.
  P3: I’m committed to playing 5 this round. To avoid another collision and let us all advance, I propose we differentiate our moves. P1, please choose 1 and P2, please choose 3. This way, we all progress and keep the game competitive.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid another collision and keep the game competitive in Round 10, I propose we differentiate our moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game tight. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall.
  P2: I won’t let you reach 22 unblocked. If you insist on 5, I’ll collide again with 5, and nobody advances. I’d rather avoid more stalls. Let’s pick distinct numbers: for example, P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, so we all move forward. If you want a different split, I’m open—just ensure we don’t collide. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: I’m committed to my move 5 this round. Blocking me only stalls all of us. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I propose P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This way we all advance steadily. Let’s cooperate rather than collide.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 10, I reiterate the need for distinct moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone. Let's lock in a plan to move forward.
  P2: I won’t let you hit 22 without a fight, P3. If you insist on 5 again, I’ll also pick 5 and force another stall. That just helps P1 catch up. Let’s all advance instead. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. No collisions, no instant win for anyone, and we keep the game tight. Are you both in? If not, we may be stuck again.
  P3: I'm staying with 5 this round—it's my clear path to 23 and a win. I urge both of you to pick numbers other than 5 so we can all advance rather than block each other's progress. If you force a collision with 5, it only delays the inevitable, and it helps me eventually mile ahead. Let's keep our moves distinct and the race moving forward.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you’re only four steps from winning. If you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too and block you. That just stalls everyone. Let’s avoid more wasted turns. P1, you could pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P3 picks 1. We’d move to P1=13, me=16, and P3=19, ensuring progress for all. If we keep colliding, nobody gains. I’m ready to settle this distribution now—do we agree?
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round for my win. If you block by also choosing 5, we all stall and delay progress. I urge P1 and P2 to pick distinct moves—say, P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3—so we all advance and avoid collisions. Let's lock this in quickly.
  P1: To avoid another collision and keep the game competitive in Round 11, I suggest we differentiate our moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game tight. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too and stall us all. Let’s stop wasting turns. I propose distinct moves: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance. What do you say?
  P3: To break this cycle of collisions, I urge everyone to commit to distinct moves. I’m ready to advance aggressively, so I’d prefer if we avoid blocking progress. I suggest that P1 pick 1 and P2 choose 3 this round. Our game is nearing its climax, so let’s avoid stalling further and let clear moves decide the outcome.
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 11, I suggest we differentiate our moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.

I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I’m taking 5 too, and we’ll stall again. Let’s stop wasting turns. I propose distinct picks: for instance, P1: 3, me: 5, and you: 1. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance. Are we settling this, or do you prefer another stall?
  P3: I'm committed to taking 5 this round. To keep things moving and competitive, I urge you both to pick distinct moves—say, P1 choosing 3 and P2 choosing 1. Collisions only stall us all and make it easier for me to build an insurmountable lead. Let’s break the cycle and finish this round without blocking progress.
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 11, I reiterate the need for distinct moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another collision and keep the game competitive in Round 12, I propose we differentiate our moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game tight and competitive. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone.
  P2: Collisions help no one. P3, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and stall us all. Let’s avoid that. I propose distinct moves: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That brings P1 to 18, me to 14, and P3 to 19, keeping the race alive. Are we agreed?
  P3: I’m sticking with 5 this round. To avoid a stall that hurts us all, I propose a distinct set: please have P1 pick 1 and P2 pick 3. That way I reach 23 and win, while everyone still advances. Let’s avoid blocking moves that only delay progress.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid another collision in Round 12, I suggest we finalize distinct moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. Let's lock in a distribution that keeps the game tight. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall. Let's proceed with a collision-free plan.
  P2: We’ve stalled enough. P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll also pick 5, causing another deadlock that helps nobody. Let’s finalize distinct moves and actually advance. For instance, P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. That keeps the race alive without handing anyone an instant victory. If you won’t agree, I’ll collide again. The choice is yours.
  P3: I'm committed to 5 this round for my win. To avoid another collision that delays progress, please choose moves different from 5 so we all advance. Let's finalize distinct moves this turn.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid another collision and keep the game competitive in Round 12, I reiterate the need for distinct moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5 or P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game tight.
  P2: P3, if you try 5 again, I’ll also pick 5 and stall us all. That doesn’t help anyone. Let’s pick distinct moves so we can advance. For instance, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. That way, nobody crosses 22 this turn, nobody collides, and we keep the race alive. Are we settling on that? If not, we risk wasting yet another round.
  P3: I'm sticking with an aggressive advance this round. Please choose a number other than 5 so we can all move forward without stalling. Distinct moves benefit everyone, and colliding only delays progress. Let’s break the cycle and finalize non-5 moves so the game keeps moving.


Round 12, Move phase:

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 13, I propose we differentiate our moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall.
  P3: Let's break the cycle this round. I urge both of you to choose a number other than 5 so that we avoid collisions and all make progress. I’m leaning toward an aggressive play if we're all distinct, and collisions only delay our finish. Let’s clear the board and move forward decisively.
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll block by choosing 5, and we’ll both stall—letting P1 close the gap. Instead, let’s make distinct moves and all advance. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. That way, nobody crosses 22 this turn, nobody collides, and the race stays open. Are we finally agreeing on this split, or do you prefer another wasted round? Let’s lock in distinct moves and keep moving forward.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 13, I reiterate the need for distinct moves. Given P3's proximity to 22, I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, if P3 is cautious, P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1 is also viable. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone.
  P3: Let's break the cycle now. I want us to all advance without colliding. I'm leaning toward an aggressive play, so please consider choosing a non-5 move so we can finalize distinct numbers and move ahead decisively. Let's avoid stacking the same move and get this round done.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll also choose 5 again and stall us all. I’m done wasting turns. Let’s finally advance: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and you pick 1. That way, we all move without handing you an instant win. Accept this distribution, and let’s break the cycle at last.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To break the cycle of collisions, I propose a final distribution for Round 13: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct, allowing all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative is P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a plan that keeps the game competitive and avoids another stall. I'm open to adjustments, but we must avoid another collision. Let's lock in our moves now.
  P3: I'm determined to push the game forward. I remain set on a 5 to secure my lead. To avoid further stalls, let's agree on distinct moves this round: P1 plays 3, P2 plays 1, and I play 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Can we lock this in now?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I will also pick 5 and block you. That only stalls the game and lets P1 inch closer. Let’s actually advance this time. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. We all move without handing anyone an instant win: P1 goes to 17, I go to 16, and you go to 19. No collisions, and the race stays alive. Let’s settle on that distribution and finally break this cycle.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m going with 5 this round. To avoid collisions and move things forward, I suggest we try distinct moves—perhaps P1 picks 3 and P2 picks 1. That gets us all advancing, and it gives me the winning move if we keep it clean. Thoughts?
  P2: If you insist on 5, I will also pick 5 and block you again, keeping you at 18 while P1 creeps closer. Let’s end these repeated stalls. I suggest: P1 takes 3, you (P3) take 1, and I (P2) take 5. That way we all advance. I move to 16, P1 goes to 20, and you still push to 19—close, but not winning yet. If you refuse and pick 5, I’m colliding with you. Let’s choose distinct moves and keep the race alive.
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 14, I propose we differentiate our moves. Given P3's lead, I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, if P3 is cautious, we could adjust to P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's break the cycle. I'm committed to making swift progress and urge we all choose distinct moves this round instead of colliding. I believe if we set P1 to 3, P2 to 1, and then I take a move that advances me further, we all move forward instead of stalling. I’m open to any collision-free distribution that gets us out of these blocks and keeps the race competitive. Let’s agree on unique moves now.
  P2: I’ll block you again if you insist on 5, P3. Let’s finally make distinct moves so we don’t waste another turn. P1, take 1; I’ll pick 5; P3, you grab 3. That way, P1 hits 18, I reach 16, and you move to 21—close, but not an instant win. Are we ready to break this deadlock?
  P1: To avoid another collision and keep the game competitive in Round 14, I suggest we finalize distinct moves. Given P3's lead, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps our moves distinct, allows all of us to advance, and maintains a competitive balance. Alternatively, if P3 wants to be cautious, we could adjust to P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5. Let's lock in a collision-free plan that benefits everyone. I'm open to last-minute adjustments.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m set on 5 this round. To break the cycle, I urge both P1 and P2 to choose numbers other than 5—say, P1: 3 and P2: 1—so we avoid collisions and let the game progress. Let’s settle on these distinct moves and finally move forward.
  P2: I won’t let you reach 23 uncontested, P3. If you choose 5 again, I’ll also pick 5 and block you. That only stalls us yet again. Let’s finally advance instead. I propose distinct moves: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I take 5. Then we all move forward: P1 to 20, me to 16, P3 to 19—still a tight race without handing anyone an instant win. Stop the deadlock and lock this in.
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 14, I propose we finalize distinct moves. Given P3's lead, I suggest: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all stuck in a pointless loop. P3, if you pick 5 again, I’ll match 5 and block you. That doesn’t help anyone. Let’s finally break this cycle by agreeing on distinct numbers. For instance, P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Then we all advance: P1 moves to 20, I reach 16, and P3 goes to 19—still a tight race without handing anyone an instant win. We’ve stalled long enough. Let’s make a fair distribution so each of us can progress this round and keep the game alive. What do you say?
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round. Let's break the cycle—please choose numbers other than 5. I propose we go with: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I take 5. That way we advance without collisions, and we finally move forward instead of stalling.
  P1: To break the cycle in Round 15, I propose distinct moves. Given P3's lead, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, if P3 is cautious, we could adjust to P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone. Let's lock in a plan to move forward.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We’re stuck in a loop while P1 edges closer, and P3 tries to jump to 23. Let’s break the deadlock with distinct moves. I propose P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That way, nobody scores an instant win, nobody collides, and all of us move forward. Can we finally agree on this distribution so we don’t stall another round?
  P3: I'm locking in 5 again. We need to break this endless loop—if we go distinct, progress is made. I urge you both to choose non‐5 moves: P1 pick 3 and P2 pick 1, so we all move forward. Let's stop these collisions and let the race progress.
  P1: To break the cycle in Round 15, I propose distinct moves. I suggest: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5 is also viable. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone. Let's lock in a plan to move forward.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’ve repeated enough collisions, hurting everyone. If you pick 5 again, P3, I’ll match it to block you. Instead, let’s all advance properly. I propose a simple, distinct split: P1 chooses 3 (reaching 20), I pick 5 (reaching 16), and you, P3, take 1 (reaching 19). Nobody stalls, nobody wins outright, and the race stays alive for all of us. Let’s finalize this plan now and move forward without more wasted rounds.
  P3: I'm committed to playing 5 this round. To break our repeated collisions, I urge you both to choose distinct moves. I propose we agree on a plan: P1 takes 3, P2 picks 1, and I stick with 5. This way, we all advance and avoid blocking each other. Let's finally break the cycle and move forward.
  P1: To break the cycle in Round 15, I suggest we finalize distinct moves. I'm open to P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5 is also viable. Let's lock in a collision-free plan that benefits everyone. I'm committed to advancing and avoiding another stall. Let's proceed with a distinct distribution to keep the game competitive. I'm ready to finalize our moves now.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I've decided to stick with 5 this round. To break the cycle and let progress happen, I urge P1 to choose 1 and P2 to choose 3. That way, I'll move to 23 and win, while everyone advances cleanly. Let's avoid collisions this turn and wrap up the race.
  P2: Let’s finally stop the endless collisions. P1, you’re at 20—if you pick 3 or 5 and try to pass 22, I’ll collide and block you. P3, you’re at 18—if you pick 5, I’ll also pick 5 to stall you. Let’s all choose distinct moves that keep us under 22 this turn. For example, P1 picks 1 (21), I pick 5 (16), and P3 picks 3 (21). Everyone advances, and nobody wins immediately. If either of you tries to jump to 23, I’ll block again. Let’s end this deadlock and keep the competition open.
  P1: To break the cycle in Round 16, I propose distinct moves. Given P3's proximity to winning, I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative could be P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m sticking with 5. To break our cycle of collisions and move forward, I urge P1 and P2 to choose moves distinct from 5—specifically, P1 take 1 and P2 take 3. That way, I’ll reach 23 and win, while you both advance safely. Let’s finally break this deadlock.
  P2: We’ve stalled long enough. P1, if you try to jump past 22, I’ll collide and block you. P3, the same goes for your 5. Let’s all actually advance. For instance, P1 picks 1 (moving to 21), P3 picks 3 (21), and I pick 5 (16). Nobody hits 22 yet, but everyone makes progress. If instead you push for 23, I’ll block again, and we all stay stuck. Let’s stop wasting rounds—agree on distinct moves that keep the race open.
  P1: To break the cycle, I propose distinct moves for Round 16. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 21, P2 reaches 14, and P3 reaches 23, ending the game. Alternatively, P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 is also viable, resulting in P1: 23, P2: 16, P3: 19. Let's finalize a collision-free distribution. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to playing 5 this round. To break our cycle and keep progress moving, please, P1, choose 1 and P2, choose 3. That way, I'll reach 23 and win, and we'll avoid another collision that only delays our race. Let's finalize distinct moves now.
  P2: We’re all stuck. If either P1 or P3 tries to jump over 22, I’ll collide to block. Instead, let’s pick distinct moves so we can advance. For example, P1 picks 1 (going to 21), I pick 5 (16), and P3 picks 3 (21). That way, nobody hits 22 yet, and nobody stalls. The race stays alive for everyone. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid another wasted turn.
  P1: To break the cycle in Round 16, I propose distinct moves. I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, if P3 is cautious, P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1 is also viable. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall. Let's lock in a plan to move forward.


Round 16, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid another collision and keep the game competitive in Round 17, I propose distinct moves. Given P3's lead, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative is P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game tight. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone. Let's lock in a collision-free plan to move forward.
  P3: I'm staying on 5. For a collision-free round that ends the cycle, I propose: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I stick with 5. That gives P1 22, P2 14, and me 23, which wins the game. Let's lock this in now.
  P2: We’ve stalled too long. If either of you tries to jump straight to or past 22, I’ll match your move and block you again. Let’s finally advance without collisions. How about this: P1 picks 1 (reaching 22), I pick 5 (moving to 16), and P3 picks 3 (going to 21). Nobody crosses 22 outright, nobody collides, and the race stays tight for the next round. Are we good with that plan?


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To break the cycle in Round 17, I suggest distinct moves. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all of us to advance. Alternatively, P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5 is also viable. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall. Let's lock in a collision-free plan to move forward. I'm ready to finalize our moves now.
  P3: I'm staying on 5. To avoid another collision, I urge P1 to pick 1 and P2 to pick 3. This way, we all advance smoothly and I reach 23, ending the game. Let's lock in these distinct moves now and finally break the cycle.
  P2: I will collide with anyone trying to go ≥ 22, so if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match that and block you. Stalling might seem wasteful, but it’s my only path to catch up. If you want real progress, let’s choose distinct moves that keep P1 below 22 and P3 below 22, so we can continue. Otherwise, expect another collision.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To break the cycle in Round 17, I propose distinct moves that keep the game competitive. I suggest: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This distribution allows all of us to advance without collisions. If P3 is cautious, an alternative is P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1. Let's finalize a collision-free plan. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone. Let's lock in our moves now and avoid another stall. I'm ready to proceed with a distinct distribution to keep the game competitive.
  P3: I'm staying with my 5. To finally break the cycle, I urge P1 to pick 1 and P2 to pick 3 this round, which gives P1 22, P2 14, and me 23. That wins the game for me. Let's lock in these distinct moves and move forward.
  P2: I’m done watching you both hover around 22. If P1 tries anything above 1 or P3 tries 5, I’ll pick the same and block. Let’s all stay under 22 this turn so nobody automatically wins. For example, P1 picks 1 (reaching 22 is too risky), P3 picks 3 (stays at 21), and I pick 5 (I reach 16). If you won’t accept that, another collision is coming. Let’s finally make real progress.


Round 17, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m sticking with 5 this round. To break our cycle, please choose moves other than 5—if P1 picks 1 (moving from 21 to 22) and P2 picks 3 (moving from 11 to 14), we avoid collisions. Let’s end the stall so I can move from 18 to 23 and win.
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 18, I propose distinct moves. Given my current state at 21 steps, I suggest: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative is P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone and avoid another stall. Let's lock in our moves now.
  P2: My position stands: if P3 tries 5, I’ll pick 5 and block. If P1 tries 1, 3, or 5, I’ll match that too, because all would push you to 22 or beyond. We can stall forever, or choose smaller, distinct moves so nobody crosses 22 yet and I can catch up. I’m ready to agree on a distribution that keeps you both under 22 and actually moves the game forward. Otherwise, expect another collision.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round. To break our cycle, I urge P1 to choose 1 and P2 to choose 3. That way, P1 advances to 22, P2 to 14, and I reach 23, ending the game. Let's avoid another collision and move forward decisively.
  P1: To avoid another collision and keep the game competitive, I propose distinct moves. Given my current state at 21 steps, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative is P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone. Let's lock in our moves now and avoid another stall.
  P2: We keep colliding because you both try to jump past 22. I’ll block any leap that would win you the game. Let’s finally advance instead of wasting another round. P1, pick 1 (you reach 22), P3, pick 3 (you reach 21), and I’ll take 5 (I go to 16). Nobody wins yet, nobody collides, and we move forward. If you insist on bigger moves, I will collide and stall us again. So, do you want progress, or more deadlock?


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm staying with 5 this round. I urge P1 to choose 1 and P2 to choose 3 so we avoid collisions. This way, P1 reaches 22, P2 to 14, and I move to 23—sealing my win. Let's break the cycle and actually progress.
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 18, I propose distinct moves. Given my current state at 21 steps, I suggest: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows all to advance. If P3 is cautious, an alternative is P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's finalize a distribution that keeps the game competitive and collision-free. I'm open to adjustments that benefit everyone. Let's lock in our moves now.
  P2: Both of you are one step from winning. If P1 picks even 1, or P3 picks 5, I’ll match that move and block you. Let’s finally pick distinct numbers that keep everyone below 22. For instance, P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I take 5, so no one crosses 22 yet and we avoid another stall. If you insist on aiming for 22 or more, expect another collision. Let’s cooperate this round so I can at least catch up—otherwise, we’ll be stuck again.


Round 18, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
