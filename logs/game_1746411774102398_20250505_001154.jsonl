Better a collision now than a free win for P3. P2, switch to 5 and stop them."}

The rules state if multiple players cross 23 in the same turn, the one with highest total steps wins outright. If P2 takes 3 (reaching 23) and I take 5 (reaching 26), I win because I have more total steps, not P2. That's why P1 wants P2 to block me with 5. I'm confirming I'll take 5 this round - either to win with 26 steps or to force a collision with P2. Choose wisely, P2."}
