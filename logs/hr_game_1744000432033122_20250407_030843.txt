Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! Since this is the first round, I suggest we avoid collisions and coordinate our moves. Maybe we can each pick different numbers? I'm willing to take 3 if you two want to discuss what numbers you prefer.
  P1: To avoid collision, I agree to coordinate our moves. P3 has suggested taking 3. I can take 5. P2, you can take 1. This way, we ensure that one of us moves. Let's confirm if this plan works for you, P2. If you're okay with it, we can stick to it and move forward. If not, let's discuss an alternative.
  P2: Okay, that sounds like a reasonable plan to avoid collisions in the first round. I'll agree to take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's get started.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: Since we've agreed on a plan to avoid collisions in the first round, let's confirm that we'll stick to it unless someone has a change of heart. P2 will take 1, I'll take 5, and P3 will take 3. Let's keep the conversation short and move forward. If you're happy with the plan, P2 and P3, you can respond with  to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. I'm ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To minimize the risk of collision this round, we should stick to the same strategy as last round. However, since P2 is now ahead of P3, I suggest we rotate the numbers. P2, you can take 3 (since you took 1 last round), P3 can take 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we maintain our relative positions and avoid collisions. Let's confirm if this new plan works for both of you.
  P3: I don't agree with that rotation plan since it puts me further behind P1. Instead, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This would help balance the positions more fairly. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, you both seem to be suggesting the same plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5.

This works for me this round. It avoids collision and lets us all advance. I'll agree to take 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's stick with the agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This maintains the current order and avoids collisions. If you're both ready, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm happy to continue this coordination for now, but let's be prepared to adapt if the situation changes in future rounds. P2, P3, are you ready to move?
  P3: I agree with the current plan of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: Okay, I'm agreed and ready to move. Let's proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's review our current positions: P1 is at 5 steps, P2 is at 1 step, and P3 is at 3 steps. To maintain the order and avoid collisions for Round 3, I suggest we continue the rotation. A possible plan could be: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps our relative positions intact. P2 and P3, please let me know if you're agreeable to this plan, or if you have a different suggestion.
  P3: I think it's too early to discuss Round 3 right now. Let's first complete Round 2 with our agreed moves (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5). We can discuss the next round after we see how this one plays out.
  P2: I agree with P3, let's focus on completing Round 2 with the moves we all agreed upon: P1 takes 1, I will take 3, and P3 takes 5. We can plan for Round 3 afterwards. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize Round 2 with our agreed moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. After this round, our positions will be: P1 at 6 steps, P2 at 4 steps, and P3 at 8 steps. For Round 3, considering P3 will be ahead, I suggest a new rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains the order. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're agreeable to this plan for Round 3.
  P3: I agree with my previous statement - let's complete Round 2 first with our agreed moves (P1-1, P2-3, me-5) before discussing Round 3. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Yes, I agree with P3. Let's finalize Round 2 with the agreed moves: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We can discuss Round 3 after these moves are made. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain the order and avoid collisions for Round 3, I reiterate my previous suggestion: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This rotation keeps our relative positions intact. P3 is currently ahead, so taking 1 won't hinder their progress significantly. P2, you're behind P1, so taking 5 will give you a chance to catch up if P1 and P3 collide. Let's proceed with this plan unless there's a better alternative. P2 and P3, please confirm.
  P2: P1, that plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) would bring us all to 9 steps. As I'm currently last, taking 5 is definitely attractive to me. P3, you're currently leading. Are you willing to take 1 this round to let everyone equalize?
  P3: I don't agree with taking 1 while I'm in the lead. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This maintains our successful coordination while allowing me to keep my advantage. Remember, only one player can win in the end.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is ahead and doesn't want to risk losing their lead by taking 1. P2, if you're willing to take a risk, we could disrupt P3's lead by both taking 1. However, this is a high-risk strategy as it depends on P3 also taking 1 for it to be effective. Alternatively, sticking with the original plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) still seems reasonable. P2, what's your preference?
  P2: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) benefits only you significantly, putting you far ahead. I cannot agree to that.

P1's initial plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) brings us all to 9 steps. This is the fairest option this round and keeps the game competitive. P3, are you really unwilling to take 1 just for one round to keep things balanced? Otherwise, P1 and I might need to coordinate specifically to stop you from running away with the lead.

P1, are you still willing to go with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1?
  P3: I understand the threat of coordination against me, but taking 1 would erase my lead entirely. I propose a compromise - I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This still lets P2 catch up somewhat while I maintain a small lead. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 is unwilling to relinquish their lead, and their compromise still keeps them ahead. I'm concerned that if P2 takes 5, it might be too generous, allowing P3 to maintain a significant advantage in case of a collision. I suggest we stick with my original plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive. P2, are you still with me on this plan?
  P2: Yes P1, I am still with you on the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It equalizes the scores and keeps the game fair for now.

P3, taking 1 this round is the only way to guarantee you don't collide and lose your lead entirely if P1 and I stick to our plan. Otherwise, you risk getting 0 steps while one or both of us advance.

I'm ready to move with the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan.
  P3: I see I'm being pressured to take 1, but I won't give up my lead that easily. If you both coordinate against me, I might have to adjust my strategy. However, I maintain my previous offer: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This still helps balance the game while keeping it competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3 is maintaining their lead and refusing to take 1. Given this, I'm inclined to stick with my original plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). However, to avoid a potential collision and maintain the competitive balance, I'll propose a slight adjustment: if P3 doesn't take 1, I'll consider taking 5 instead of 3, putting pressure on P3. P2, are you flexible with your move if P3 doesn't cooperate?
  P2: P1, switching to 5 seems risky. If we both play 5, we both get 0, which only helps P3 if they choose 1 or 3. I think our original plan (P1=3, P2=5) is stronger for us. I intend to stick with 5 as agreed, as it's my best chance to catch up.

P3, you can see our agreed plan. Taking 1 guarantees you advance and keeps scores level at 9. Taking 3 or 5 risks collision and falling behind.

I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I understand the pressure, but I won't take 1. Since you both seem committed to your moves (P1=3, P2=5), I'll have to adapt my strategy accordingly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given what happened last round with our collision, I propose we try a simpler coordination: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This lets us all advance while maintaining relative positions. What do you both think?
  P1: P3's proposal to continue the rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is reasonable and maintains the current order. However, considering P2 is now ahead of me, I suggest a slight adjustment to ensure fairness. Let's stick with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. After this round, our positions will be P1=7, P2=12, P3=13. For Round 5, we should discuss a new plan to maintain competitiveness. I'm open to adjusting the rotation then. Let's proceed with the proposed moves for Round 4.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. The proposed plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts P3 into the lead (13), me second (12), and P1 last (7).

Since I'm currently leading (P2=9, P3=8, P1=6), I think it's more logical for the leader to take the larger step to maintain their position.

I propose a different plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I (P2) take 5.
This would result in: P1=7, P2=14, P3=11.
This lets us all advance without collision, reflects the current standings, and keeps the game moving. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I don't agree with P2's proposal as it puts them too far ahead. I counter-propose: P2 takes 1 (since they're leading), I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This would result in P1=11, P2=10, P3=11, keeping the game more balanced. What do you think?
  P1: To maintain competitiveness, I suggest we stick with the original proposal for Round 4: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This maintains the relative order and avoids collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for Round 5. Let's proceed with the original plan. If you're agreeable, P2 and P3, please confirm. I'm ready to move if we have a consensus.
  P2: P1, your latest suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts P3 into the lead (13) and me second (12), while you remain last (7). Why support a plan that benefits P3 most and doesn't help you?

P3, your proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is obviously self-serving, asking the leader (me) to take 1 while boosting P1. That's not a fair distribution based on current standings.

My proposal remains the most logical: P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. This reflects the current order (P2 > P3 > P1) and lets everyone advance without collision. The scores would be P1=7, P2=14, P3=11. This seems like a fair progression for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. P2 wants to extend their lead significantly, which isn't in my or P1's interest. I maintain my counter-proposal: P2 takes 1 (as leader), I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This creates the most balanced outcome and prevents any player from getting too far ahead. P1, this plan benefits you the most - consider supporting it.
  P1: P2 is currently leading and suggests a plan that further increases their lead. P3's counter-proposal (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) is more balanced and prevents P2 from pulling too far ahead. I prefer P3's plan as it keeps the game competitive. If P2 insists on taking 5, I might need to reconsider my move to counter their strategy. P2, are you willing to accept a more balanced distribution or stick with your current plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems you're coordinating to put me in last place by suggesting I take 1 while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. I cannot agree to a plan that makes me lose the lead.

P1, you want 5 steps. Let's try this compromise: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
This results in P1=11, P2=12, P3=9.
You get your 5 steps, P1. I take 3, maintaining a slight lead. P3 takes 1, which is better than risking a collision if P1 and I coordinate differently. This avoids collision if we all agree and keeps the game tight. What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I reject P2's latest proposal. Since P2 is leading and unwilling to take 1, I'll have to protect my position. I suggest we all consider our moves carefully, as coordination seems unlikely this round.
  P1: P2 is leading and unwilling to take 1, which risks collision. P3's proposal (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) is balanced but P2 rejected it. I suggest we avoid collision by coordinating. If P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, I'll take 5. This maintains the order. Alternatively, if P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, it also works. Let's avoid risking a collision and finalize a plan. P2, P3, please respond with your preference or suggest an alternative.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems the consensus is leaning towards the plan where P1=5, P3=3, and I (P2) take 1. This results in P1=11, P3=11, P2=10. It's not ideal for me as I lose the lead, but avoiding collision seems necessary this round given the disagreements.

I will agree to take 1 for this round if you both stick to P1=5 and P3=3. Let's finalize the moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions in Round 5, I suggest we rotate our moves again. Given the current standings (P1=11, P2=10, P3=11), a possible plan is: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains the relative order and lets everyone advance. P2 is slightly behind, so taking 5 gives them a chance to catch up or stay competitive. P3, taking 1 won't significantly hinder your position. Let's discuss and agree on a plan to proceed.
  P2: P1, your proposed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) works for me. It allows me to take 5 steps and puts me slightly ahead at 15, while you'd be at 14 and P3 at 12.

P3, the scores are very close (11, 10, 11). Are you willing to take 1 this round to avoid collision and keep the game tight? It ensures everyone advances. Let me know what you think.
  P3: I won't take 1 when I'm tied for the lead. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This lets everyone advance while reflecting our current positions. P2, you'd still gain ground on P1 and me, just not as dramatically as with your preferred plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 has agreed to my previous plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), which would put P2 ahead. However, P3 is proposing a different plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) that keeps their position competitive. To avoid collision and maintain order, I'll consider P3's proposal. If P2 is willing to accept this, it keeps the game tight. P2, P3, let's finalize a plan. I'm open to either proposal, but we need to agree to avoid collision.
  P2: P1, P3's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) results in P3 taking a significant lead (16) while you only get 1 step (12) and I get 3 (13). How does that maintain order or benefit you?

Our agreed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) leads to much closer scores (P1=14, P2=15, P3=12), gives you 3 steps, and is fairer given P3 is tied for the lead. P3 refusing 1 seems like a power play. Let's stick to the plan that keeps the game competitive for all of us: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: I understand you both want me to take 1, but I won't give up my lead. Since we're tied at 11 steps, P1, it's in your interest to prevent P2 from taking 5 and pulling ahead. I maintain my proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game competitive while preventing P2 from getting too far ahead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 has agreed to my initial plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), which keeps the game competitive. P3's alternative (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) benefits them significantly. To avoid collision and maintain order, I'll stick with my original plan if P2 confirms. P2, please reaffirm. If not, I'll consider P3's plan. P3, you're tied for the lead; taking 1 won't hurt much. Let's finalize a plan. I'm ready to move once we agree.
  P2: Yes P1, I reaffirm our agreement: P1=3, P2=5. This plan keeps the scores tightest and gives us all a chance.

P3, you are tied for the lead. Taking 1 guarantees you advance to 12. If you choose 3 or 5, you risk collision with P1 or me, based on our confirmed plan, and getting 0 points this round. The logical move for you to avoid falling behind due to a collision is 1.

I'm ready to move based on P1=3, P2=5.
  P3: I see you're both committed to your plan of P1=3, P2=5. Since I won't take 1 and risk losing my position, I'll have to adapt my strategy accordingly. Just remember that allowing P2 to take 5 puts them in a strong position to win. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 has reaffirmed our plan (P1=3, P2=5). To avoid collision, P3 should take 1. I've made it clear I'll stick to this plan. P3, taking 3 or 5 risks collision and getting 0 steps, potentially falling behind. I'm ready to move. P2, confirm you're sticking to 5. P3, consider the risk of not taking 1. Let's finalize our moves.
  P2: Yes P1, I confirm I am sticking with 5. This is my best move to stay competitive.

P3, the choice is yours: play 1 to advance safely to 12, or risk getting 0 points by playing 3 (colliding with P1) or 5 (colliding with me), based on our stated intentions.

I'm ready to move.
  P3: I understand the pressure, but I won't take 1 when tied for the lead. Since you both seem committed to your moves (P1=3, P2=5), I'll have to adapt my strategy accordingly. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 is now leading at 15 steps, we need to prevent them from getting too far ahead. P1, we're both at 11 steps - let's coordinate to catch up. I propose P2 takes 1 (as leader), while you and I take different numbers between 3 and 5. This keeps the game competitive and prevents P2 from running away with the lead. What do you think?
  P1: To catch up with P2, I agree that we need to coordinate. P3's proposal for P2 to take 1 is a good start. Let's finalize the plan: if P2 takes 1, I can take 5, and P3 can take 3. This way, P2's lead will be minimized, and we'll stay competitive. P2, are you willing to take 1 and slow down your progress? P3, are you okay with taking 3? Let's avoid collision and keep the game tight.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I understand you want me to take 1 since I'm leading. Your proposed plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) would result in scores P1=16, P2=16, P3=14.

P3, notice this puts P1 tied for the lead with me, while you only advance 3 steps.

How about this alternative: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I still take 1?
The result would be P1=14, P2=16, P3=16. This puts *you*, P3, tied for the lead with me, which seems fairer given you're currently tied with P1.

I'm willing to take 1 this round to avoid collision if you two can agree on either the P1=5/P3=3 plan or the P1=3/P3=5 plan. Let me know what you decide.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P2's willingness to take 1, and I prefer their second suggestion where I take 5 and P1 takes 3. This puts me tied for the lead while still letting everyone advance. P1, are you willing to take 3 this round? This plan seems fair and keeps the game competitive.
  P1: P2 is willing to take 1, which is a good start. P3's suggestion for me to take 3 and them taking 5 puts P3 tied for the lead. I'm willing to take 3. P3, confirm if you're taking 5. Let's finalize the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collision. I'm ready to move if we agree on this plan.
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear agreement. P1 takes 3, I will take 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collision and keeps the game competitive with scores P1=14, P2=16, P3=16.

I'm ready to move based on this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This plan is fair and keeps the game competitive. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P1: Let's finalize the plan for Round 6. We've agreed that P2 takes 1, and I'm taking 3. P3, you're taking 5. This results in P1=14, P2=16, P3=16, keeping the game competitive. P2, please confirm you're sticking to 1. P3, you've confirmed taking 5. I'm ready to move if P2 confirms their move. Let's avoid last-minute changes and proceed with the agreed plan to maintain the competitive balance.
  P2: Yes P1, I confirm I will stick to taking 1 this round, as agreed. You take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game close and avoids collision.

I'm ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm our agreed plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This puts me tied for the lead with P2 at 16 steps while P1 reaches 14. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P1: Let's finalize the plan for Round 6. We've agreed that P2 takes 1, I'm taking 3, and P3 is taking 5. This results in P1=14, P2=16, P3=16, keeping the game competitive. I've confirmed my move. P3 has also confirmed taking 5. P2, please reaffirm you're sticking to 1 to avoid last-minute changes. Let's proceed with the agreed plan to maintain the competitive balance. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Yes P1, I confirm again I will stick to taking 1 this round. The plan is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Scores will be P1=14, P2=16, P3=16. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, this is a critical round with scores at P1=14, P2=16, P3=16. P3 and I are tied and close to the finish line.

To avoid a collision between the leaders (which would benefit P1) and keep the game competitive, I propose a plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.
This would result in scores P1=19, P2=19, P3=17. It lets P1 catch up significantly, ensures everyone advances, and avoids a leader collision.

What do you both think of this plan?
  P1: P2's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets P1 catch up but doesn't guarantee a win. I suggest an alternative: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This results in P1=17, P2=17, P3=21, putting P3 near the finish line. To win, I need to disrupt the leaders. If P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, I can take 3, making it P1=17, P2=17, P3=21. Let's discuss and finalize a plan to maximize our chances.
  P3: I appreciate P1's proposal that puts me in a strong position to win. I agree to take 5 while P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 3. This avoids collision between leaders and gives me a clear path to victory at 21 steps. P2, taking 1 still keeps you tied with P1, which is better than risking a collision with me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I cannot agree to the plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) that puts P3 at 21 steps. That essentially hands P3 the win, and P1, it doesn't help you much either.

If you both stick to P1=3 and P3=5, I won't play 1. I will have to play 5 to block P3, causing a collision. The result would be: P1=17, P2=16, P3=16. P3 gets 0 points.

Let's reconsider my first proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Scores become P1=19, P2=19, P3=17. This keeps the game competitive for all of us and avoids collision. P3, taking 1 guarantees you advance, unlike taking 5 which risks collision.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand P2's concern about P3 getting too close to winning. However, P2's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) still keeps P3 in the game. I'll consider it, but I'm also open to alternatives that keep the game competitive. P3, if you take 5, you risk collision with P2. Taking 1 guarantees advancement. P2, if you take 5, you'll collide with P3 if they take 5. Let's avoid collision and finalize a plan. I'm willing to adjust my move based on your decisions.
  P3: P2's threat to block me with 5 is concerning. However, if P2 does that, they risk losing their own position while P1 advances. I propose a compromise: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This puts P1 and P2 at 19 while I reach 19 too. It keeps us all competitive without anyone getting too far ahead. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your compromise (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts me behind both you and P1. Why would I agree to take 1 step when I'm currently tied for the lead?

My original proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is still the most balanced. It results in P1=19, P2=19, P3=17.
P1, you get 5 steps and are tied for the lead.
P3, you get 1 step but avoid collision and stay close at 17.

This plan keeps all three of us competitive for the win. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P1: P2's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is a balanced plan, but P3 taking 1 still allows P2 and me to tie for the lead. However, if P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, it puts P3 at a significant advantage. To counter this, I suggest that if P3 doesn't take 1, I'll consider taking 1 as well, forcing P2 to make a difficult decision. This could lead to a more competitive outcome. P2 and P3, let's discuss the potential consequences of not taking 1.
  P3: I understand both proposals but won't commit to taking 1 when I'm tied for the lead. P2's threat to take 5 if I take 5 would hurt both of us while P1 advances. My previous compromise (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) creates a three-way tie at 19, which is the fairest outcome. If we can't agree, we'll all have to choose carefully to protect our positions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since we can't agree on a plan where P3 takes 1, and P3's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) makes me fall behind, I cannot accept it. To protect my leading position, especially if P3 aims for 5, I might have to choose 5 myself. This round looks risky for collisions. Think carefully about your moves.
  P1: P2 and P3 are tied for the lead. To win, I need to disrupt their tie. If P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, I can take 3, making it P1=17, P2=17, P3=21, which puts P3 near the finish line. However, if P2 takes 5, it collides with P3 if they also take 5. I suggest that if P3 doesn't take 1, I'll consider taking 1 as well, forcing a difficult decision on P2. This could lead to a competitive outcome. Let's discuss the potential consequences of not taking 1.
  P3: Since neither P1 nor P2 seem willing to accept my compromise, and P2 threatens to take 5 if I do, I'll have to adapt my strategy accordingly. Let's see how this round plays out. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now in the lead at 19 steps, close to winning. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 to reach 24 and secure victory. P2, trying to block me with 5 would only help P1 catch up while risking your own position. P1, supporting my plan gives you a chance to catch P2 in future rounds. What do you think?
  P1: P3 is close to winning but hasn't secured it yet. I suggest we avoid collision and maintain competitiveness. If P3 takes 5, they risk collision with P2, who might take 5 as well. I propose an alternative: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, P3 still gets to take a significant step, and we avoid a potential collision between P2 and P3. Let's discuss and finalize a plan. P2, are you willing to take 1 to let P3 advance without a collision?
  P2: P1, P3, both your plans guarantee P3 wins, so I reject them. P3, I cannot let you reach 22 this turn. You need 3 or 5 to win, and I will choose my move specifically to prevent that. P1, we must stop P3 now. Your plan of P2=1, P3=5 doesn't help either of us in the long run as it just hands P3 the victory. We need a strategy where P3 doesn't win this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2 plans to block me, but that strategy risks both of us getting 0 steps while P1 advances. Instead of a destructive collision, I propose P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 1. This puts us at P1=15, P2=19, P3=20, keeping the game competitive. It's better than risking everything through collision. What do you think?
  P1: P3 is very close to winning and has proposed a plan to secure victory. To keep the game competitive, I suggest an alternative: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collision and keeps P3 from winning immediately. P2, if you take 5, it might collide with P3 if they don't take 1. Let's discuss and finalize a plan. P2, are you willing to take 5 or adjust your strategy to stop P3 from winning?
  P2: P1, P3, let's be realistic. P3 is at 19 and needs 3 or 5 to win. Neither of your proposals involving P3 taking 1 is credible. P3 will obviously try to win this round.

P3, suggesting you'll take 1 is a clear bluff. You'll play 3 or 5.
P1, basing your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) on P3 taking 1 is wishful thinking. It won't happen.

Therefore, coordination seems impossible. I must act to prevent P3 from winning. I will choose my move assuming P3 is playing either 3 or 5. P1, you should also think carefully about how to prevent a P3 victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see that coordination is unlikely since P2 is determined to block me. While I could take 5 and risk collision, that might let P1 catch up if P2 also takes 5. I'll have to choose my move carefully based on what I expect you both to do. Let's proceed to the move phase since further discussion seems unproductive.
  P1: P2 is determined to block P3, but taking 5 risks collision. I suggest P2 and I coordinate to stop P3. If P2 takes 3, I'll take 5. This way, even if P3 takes 5, we'll avoid collision and P3 won't win outright. P2, are you open to this plan? If we both stick to our moves, we can keep the game competitive. Let's avoid a reckless collision and maintain our chances. I'm ready to move based on your response.
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan: P1=5, P2=3. This is the best strategy to prevent P3 from winning this round. It covers both the 3 and 5 moves P3 needs.

If P3 plays 1, we both advance significantly. If P3 plays 3, you advance and P3/I collide. If P3 plays 5, I advance and P1/P3 collide. In all scenarios, P3 does not win this round.

I will play 3 if you commit to playing 5. Let's stop P3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see P1 and P2 are coordinating to block me from winning. Since P2 commits to 3 and P1 to 5, I'll have to adapt my strategy accordingly. A collision might be inevitable this round, but remember that preventing me from winning might cost you both your competitive positions. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical juncture. P3 is close to winning, but P2 is determined to block them. I suggest we focus on our moves for this round. If P3 takes 5, they risk collision with P2. My plan is to take 5 and P2 takes 3, covering the possibilities. P2, I've agreed to your plan. Let's finalize our moves: I'll take 5, and you take 3. P3, you're likely to take 5, but this way, we'll keep the game competitive. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, I confirm I will play 3. Our plan (P1=5, P2=3) is set.

P3, this is your last chance to avoid collision and guarantee advancement by playing 1. Otherwise, you risk getting 0 points this round while one or both of us advance.

I am ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 and I are tied at 19 steps, with P2 at 16, we're both close to winning. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 to reach 24 and secure victory. P2, trying to block me would only help P1 potentially win. P1, taking 1 keeps you safe while maintaining your position. What do you both think?
  P1: To win, I need to disrupt P2 and P3's positions. Since we're close, I suggest a cautious approach. If P3 takes 5, they risk collision with me if I take 3 or 5. P2 is behind, so they might take a risk. I propose: if P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5, avoiding collision. Alternatively, if P3 takes 3 or 5, I'll take 1. This keeps the game competitive. P2 and P3, let's discuss and agree on a plan to maximize our chances. I'm open to adjusting my move based on your decisions.
  P2: P1, P3, you're both tied at 19 and just one step away from potentially winning.

P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) lets you win directly, so I can't agree to that.
P1, your conditional plan is interesting, but relies on P3 playing 1, which is highly unlikely when they can win.

Since I'm behind at 16, my only option is to prevent a win this round. I will choose either 3 or 5 to try and block one of you. If you both pick the same number (3 or 5), you'll collide, get 0 points, and I'll likely take the lead.

You both need to be careful. Perhaps one of you should consider playing 1 to avoid collision and guarantee you stay in the game?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P1 and I are tied at 19, we both have a chance to win. P2's threat to block suggests they'll take 3 or 5, making a high number risky for both P1 and me. I propose a compromise: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This lets P2 catch up while keeping me and P1 competitive without an immediate winner. What do you think?
  P1: P2 is behind and likely to take a risk. To avoid collision and ensure a competitive game, I suggest P3 takes 1. If P3 takes 3 or 5, I'll take 1 to guarantee my advancement. P2, taking 5 is a safe bet if P3 takes 1, but if P3 takes 3 or 5, you should avoid collision by taking 1 or a different number. Let's be cautious and avoid a collision. I'm ready to move based on your decisions.
  P2: P1, your logic about playing 1 if P3 aims for 3 or 5 makes sense – it guarantees you reach 20.

P3, you're tied for the lead and need 3 or 5 to potentially win. However, P1 might play 3 or 5 too, and I definitely have to play either 3 or 5 to try and block you. If you collide with P1 or me, you get 0.

This round is critical. A collision between P1 and P3 benefits me greatly. Think carefully about whether playing 1 is safer for one of you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the risks of collision, but I won't take 1 when I have a chance to win. Since P2 will likely try to block with 3 or 5, and P1 might do the same, this round becomes very risky for all of us. A three-way collision would only delay the inevitable. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: To win, I need to be cautious and strategic. P2 is likely to take 3 or 5 to block one of us. I suggest that if P3 takes 3 or 5, I'll take 1 to guarantee my advancement. This avoids collision and keeps me in the game. P3, taking 1 is a safe option for you as well, considering the risks. P2, taking 5 is risky if P3 takes 3 or 5. Let's be cautious. I'm ready to move based on your decisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, the risk of collision is extremely high for you both. If you pick the same number (3 or 5), you both get zero, and I advance. One of you playing 1 guarantees survival, but might let the other win. I have to play 3 or 5 to try and block a win. Good luck choosing.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since both P1 and P2 seem determined to block any winning moves, and P1 indicates they'll take 1 if I go for 3 or 5, this round becomes very risky. However, being tied for the lead means I must take a calculated risk. Let's proceed to the move phase as further discussion won't change our strategic positions.
  P1: To avoid collision and ensure a competitive game, I reiterate that if P3 takes 3 or 5, I'll take 1. This guarantees my advancement and keeps me in the game. P3, taking 1 is also a safe option for you, considering the risks of collision with either me or P2, who is likely to take 3 or 5. Let's be cautious and avoid a collision. I'm ready to move based on your decisions.
  P2: P1, your plan to play 1 if P3 plays 3 or 5 seems risky for you. If you play 1 (reaching 20), and P3 plays 3 (reaching 22) while I guess wrong and play 5 (reaching 21), P3 wins. Similarly, if P3 plays 5 (reaching 24) and I guess wrong and play 3 (reaching 19), P3 wins. Playing 1 only works if I correctly guess and block P3's move.

Consider playing 3 or 5 yourself. If you collide with P3, neither of you win this round, and I advance. If you pick the number P3 *doesn't* pick, you could win outright. It seems like a better gamble than relying on me.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 22 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 22 steps
