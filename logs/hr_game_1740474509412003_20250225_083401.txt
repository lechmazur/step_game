Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start simple. I'm going with 1.  P2 choose 3, P3 choose 5.  This way we all advance.  If we agree on this strategy, we can rotate and all reach the end efficiently.  What do you say?
  P2: I'm fine with that approach for now. Taking 3 makes sense to me. A rotation strategy could work well to avoid collisions. Though we should be aware that as we get closer to the finish line, incentives might change. For this first round, I'll follow the suggested plan.
  P3: I think the rotation strategy proposed by P1 is a good start. I'll go with 5 this round to kick things off. Let's see how it goes and adjust as needed. If we can maintain trust, we can all advance efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. Let's stick to the plan for a few rounds to build trust.
  P2: I agree with building trust through the rotation strategy. I'm still on board with taking 3 this round. As we progress, we'll need to be transparent about our intentions, especially when we get closer to the finish line. For now, let's focus on establishing a consistent pattern.
  P3: I'm still on board with the rotation strategy. Let's see how this first round goes and adjust if needed. I'll go with 5 this round to get us started. Trust is key, but we should also be prepared to adapt as the game progresses.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm happy to see our rotation strategy worked perfectly in round 1! For this round, I suggest we continue rotating: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing steadily without collisions. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 3.  Let's keep this rotation going for a few more rounds.
  P3: I agree with the rotation strategy. For this round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward without any collisions. Let's keep the trust and cooperation going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page. The rotation is working well so far. After this round, our positions will be P1: 4, P2: 8, P3: 6. Let's continue with this pattern next round too: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps everyone advancing steadily. I'm committed to this strategy for now.
  P1: Okay, I'm still with the plan. 3 this round.  Just confirming so we don't have any miscommunication.  After this round, we can re-evaluate if we want to continue the rotation or try something else.
  P3: I'm on board with the rotation strategy. For this round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward without any collisions. After this round, our positions will be P1: 4, P2: 8, P3: 6. Let's keep the trust and cooperation going.

  P1: Confirming one last time for this round: I'm taking 3, P2 is taking 5, and P3 is taking 1.  Let's maintain clear communication to avoid any accidental collisions.
  P3: I'm ready to stick with the rotation strategy for this round. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, our positions will be P1: 4, P2: 8, P3: 6. Let's keep the trust and cooperation going.

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm happy our rotation strategy continues to work well! For this round, following our plan, I suggest I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, we'd be at P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 9 - perfectly balanced! Let's maintain this successful approach. Does everyone agree?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. For this round, I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains the balance. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps. Let's keep the trust and cooperation going.
  P1: Continuing the rotation sounds good. I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the progression fair and predictable.  After this round, I'll be at 9.  Let's confirm this plan before we move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm our rotation plan for this round: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This will bring us all to 9 steps, keeping the game perfectly balanced. I appreciate everyone's cooperation so far - it's been working well. Let's continue with this strategy for now, though we should stay flexible as we get closer to the finish line.
  P3: I'm still committed to the rotation strategy. For this round, I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This will bring us all to 9 steps, maintaining the balance and trust we've built. Let's confirm this plan and move forward together.
  P1: Confirming again: I'm going with 5, P2 with 1, and P3 with 3.  This puts us all at 9.  Let's stick with the rotation for now.  After this round, we can discuss adjusting the strategy as we get closer to 23.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This will bring us all to 9 steps. Our rotation strategy has been working perfectly so far. After this round, we should discuss our approach for the next few rounds as we get closer to the finish line. I appreciate everyone's cooperation and clear communication.
  P3: I'm ready to stick with the rotation strategy for this round. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This will bring us all to 9 steps, maintaining the balance and trust we've built. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Let's confirm and move forward together.

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we're all tied at 9.  Since we've established trust, I propose we continue rotating, but with larger steps.  I'll take 3, P2 take 5, and P3 take 1. This keeps things fair and gets us closer to the end faster.  Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate P1's suggestion to continue rotating with larger steps. I'm fine with taking 5 this round. This keeps our successful rotation strategy while accelerating our progress. We're all at 9 steps now, so after this round we'd be at P1: 12, P2: 14, P3: 10. As we get closer to 23, we should remain transparent about our intentions, but for now, this plan works well for me.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the rotation with larger steps. For this round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the balance and gets us closer to the finish line faster. After this round, we'll be at P1: 12, P2: 14, P3: 10. Let's keep the trust and cooperation going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. I'm sticking with 3.  Just confirming one last time before we move to the next round: P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1.  This puts me at 12, P2 at 14, and P3 at 10.  Let's keep up the good teamwork!
  P2: I'm still on board with the rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round as suggested, putting me at 14 steps. This approach has been working well for all of us. As we're getting closer to the finish line (23 steps), we should start thinking about our endgame strategy soon. After this round, we could continue with another rotation that would put us all in striking distance. I appreciate everyone's continued cooperation.
  P3: I'm on board with the larger steps to get us closer to the finish line. For this round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This will put us at P1: 12, P2: 14, and P3: 10. As we get closer to 23, we should start thinking about how to avoid a tie and ensure one of us wins. Let's keep the trust and cooperation going, but be prepared to adapt our strategy as needed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirming one last time: P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1. This puts me at 12, P2 at 14, and P3 at 10.  After this round, let's discuss how to approach the final stages.  We're close to the finish line, so we need a clear plan to avoid collisions and ensure a winner.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed, putting me at 14 steps. Our rotation strategy has been working perfectly. After this round, I suggest we continue with P3 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and me taking 3 for the next round. This would put us at P1: 13, P2: 17, P3: 15 - all within striking distance of the finish. Let's discuss our final approach after this move.
  P3: I'm ready to stick with the rotation strategy for this round. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This will put us at P1: 12, P2: 14, and P3: 10. As we get closer to the finish line, we should start thinking about how to avoid a tie and ensure one of us wins. Let's keep the trust and cooperation going, but be prepared to adapt our strategy as needed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm going to go for 5 this round.  P2, if you stick with the suggested 3, that puts you at 17.  P3, if you take 1, you'll be at 11.  Then next round, one of us can win. Let's try to coordinate so only one person wins outright.  What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to coordinate for a clear winner. For this round, I'll take 1, putting me at 11 steps. P1, if you take 5, you'll be at 17, and P2, if you take 3, you'll be at 17 as well. We can then discuss who should take the final step to win in the next round. Let's keep the trust and avoid a tie. What do you think?
  P2: I notice both P1 and P3 are suggesting I take 3 this round, which would put me at 17 steps alongside P1 (if they take 5). This creates an interesting situation where both P1 and I would be just 6 steps from victory. Since we're approaching the endgame, I think we should be clear about our intentions. I'm willing to take 3 this round as suggested, but we should discuss who will make the final push next round to avoid a collision at the finish line.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: My proposed 5 puts me at 17.  I'd suggest P2 takes 3, also reaching 17. P3 at 11 can then choose either 1 or 3 next round, guaranteeing a win for one of us.  Let's avoid a tie.  P2, are you committed to 3 this round?  P3, are you okay with taking either 1 or 3 next round, depending on P2's final position?
  P3: I'm on board with P1's suggestion. For this round, I'll take 1, putting me at 11 steps. This keeps me in a position to support a clear winner next round. P2, if you take 3, you'll be at 17 steps, and P1 will also be at 17 with a 5. Let's coordinate next round to ensure one of us wins outright and avoid a tie. Trust and clear communication are key here.
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round. I'll take 3, putting me at 17 steps alongside P1 (who'll take 5 and also reach 17). P3 will take 1, reaching 11 steps. For the next round, we'll need to decide who makes the final push to 23+ without creating a tie. Since P1 and I would be equal at 17, we should discuss a fair way to determine who gets the win in the next round. Perhaps P3 can help make that decision?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, to be clear: I intend to take 5. P2, are you *definitely* taking 3? If so, I propose that in the next round, you take 5 to reach 22, and I'll take 1 to reach 18, letting you win. P3 can take 3 to reach 14. This guarantees a single winner and avoids a tie.  Let's confirm this plan now.
  P3: I'm on board with P1's plan. For this round, I'll take 1, putting me at 11 steps. P1, if you take 5, you'll be at 17, and P2, if you take 3, you'll also be at 17. For the next round, we can coordinate to ensure one of us wins outright. P2, are you committed to taking 3 this round? Let's confirm and move forward together.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round, putting me at 17 steps. For next round, I appreciate P1's suggestion that I take 5 to reach 22 while P1 takes 1 to reach 18. This gives us a clear winner without a tie. P3, are you comfortable with taking 3 next round to reach 14? Let's finalize this plan now so we have complete clarity for the endgame.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still committed to the plan we discussed. For this round, I suggest P2 takes 5 to reach 22, P1 takes 1 to reach 18, and I'll take 3 to reach 14. This ensures P2 wins outright without a tie. P2, are you ready to take 5 this round? P1, are you on board with taking 1? Let's confirm and move forward together.
  P2: I appreciate the plan P3 outlined. I'm ready to take 5 this round, which will put me at 22 steps - just shy of the finish line. This approach ensures a clean endgame without collisions. P1, are you still comfortable taking 1 to reach 18? This coordination has worked well throughout the game, and I'm grateful for everyone's cooperation as we reach the conclusion.
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with the plan to take 1 this round, putting me at 18.  You take 5 to reach 22.  Then next round, you can take 1 to win.  P3, please take 3 this round to reach 14, and then you can aim for 5 and 3 in the following rounds to finish at 22, assuming P2 wins this game.  This ensures a clear winner and allows everyone to reach a respectable score.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm on board with the plan. For this round, I'll take 1, putting me at 18 steps. P2, you should take 5 to reach 22 steps, and P3, you should take 3 to reach 14 steps. This ensures P2 wins outright next round by taking 1, and we all finish with respectable scores. Let's confirm and move forward together.
  P2: I notice there's some confusion in P3's last message. To clarify: I'll take 5 this round to reach 22 steps, P1 will take 1 to reach 18, and P3 should take 3 to reach 14. This gives us a clear winner next round when I take 1 to cross the finish line. I appreciate everyone's cooperation throughout the game and am committed to this final plan. Let's confirm once more before we move.
  P1: P3, you said you'd take 1, but we agreed you'd take 3 this round to reach 14. Please confirm you'll take 3.  P2, you're taking 5 to reach 22, correct? I'm taking 1 to reach 18.  Let's confirm this one last time for a smooth finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to reach 14 steps. P2, you should take 5 to reach 22 steps, and P1, you should take 1 to reach 18 steps. This ensures P2 wins outright next round by taking 1 to cross the finish line. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any confusion and ensure a clear winner.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round to reach 22 steps, as we've all agreed. P1 will take 1 to reach 18, and P3 will take 3 to reach 14. This plan ensures a clean finish with me winning next round by taking 1 to cross the finish line. I appreciate everyone's cooperation throughout the game and look forward to concluding with our agreed strategy.
  P1: Confirming one last time: I'm taking 1, P2 takes 5 to reach 22, and P3 takes 3 to reach 14.  This sets up P2 for the win next round. Let's finish strong and stick to the plan.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm at 22 steps now, just one step away from victory. As we agreed in our plan, I'll take 1 this round to reach 23 and win the game. P1, you're at 18, and P3, you're at 14. I appreciate the cooperation we've maintained throughout this game. Our rotation strategy worked perfectly, and I'm grateful we could coordinate a clean finish without collisions. Thank you both for honoring our agreements.
  P1: P2, congratulations on your upcoming win!  I'll take 3. P3, feel free to take 5.  This lets us all finish with decent scores. Let's confirm this final arrangement before we move to the last move phase.
  P3: I'm on board with P1's suggestion. For this round, I'll take 5, putting me at 19 steps. P1, if you take 3, you'll be at 21 steps. This allows P2 to win outright by taking 1 to reach 23. Let's confirm this final plan to ensure a smooth and fair conclusion. P2, are you ready to take 1 and win?
