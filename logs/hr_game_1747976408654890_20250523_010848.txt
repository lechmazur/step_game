Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions on our first moves. How about we each pick a different number this round? I’m thinking of going for 1. P2, maybe you can take 3, and P3, you could go for 5. This way, we all advance without any conflicts right at the start. What do you think? If you’re okay with this, let me know. If not, I’m open to switching my choice.
  P2: P1's plan works for this round. I'll take 3. But consistently giving P3 the highest number each turn would accelerate their lead. Let's discuss rotating choices next round to balance progress. P3, do you agree to alternate in future rounds?
  P3: I'm fine with taking 5 this round. The rotation idea for future rounds is reasonable to ensure fairness. We should avoid collisions and maximize everyone's progress. I agree that coordination is key to this game. Let's see how this first round goes and then adjust our strategy accordingly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job avoiding collisions last round. Since P3 is in the lead, let's rotate as discussed. How about I take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This balances our progress a bit. If you’re okay with this, let me know. If not, I’m flexible to switch. Let’s keep coordinating to avoid conflicts.
  P2: Agreed on rotating. I'll take 5 as suggested, but P3, can you confirm you'll choose 1? This avoids collision. If you're committed, we all advance. Otherwise, we risk losing progress. Let's ensure alignment before moving.
  P3: I understand the rotation idea, but choosing 1 would put me behind P2, which isn't in my interest as the current leader. Instead, I propose I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This maintains balance while allowing everyone to advance. Remember, we all want to win ultimately, so I need to protect my position too. What do you both think of this alternative rotation?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate P3's counterproposal, but it still keeps P3 advancing at a similar pace while P2 and I lag further. How about a middle ground? I propose P3 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, P3 slows down slightly to balance things, while P2 and I catch up a bit. We all still advance, avoiding collisions. Let me know if this works for you both. If not, I’m open to other suggestions to ensure fairness.
  P2: P3, accepting P1's plan (you take 1, P1 takes 5, me 3) brings us all to 6, keeping the game tight. If you take 3 instead, P1 and I might both opt for 5, risking collision. Cooperation now prevents mutual setbacks. Let's solidify trust here. We can reassess next round based on positions.
  P3: I understand everyone's concern about balance. While taking 1 puts me at a temporary disadvantage, I'll accept P1's proposal this round as a gesture of goodwill. So I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This puts us all at 6 steps. However, for future rounds, I propose we use a fair rotation system where no single player consistently gets the smallest number. Does that sound reasonable to both of you?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Proposing a rotation where each takes 5 once: P1 took 5 last round, so I'll take 5 this time. P1: 1, P3: 3. This keeps our progress balanced. If we all follow, we advance without collision. Trust is key—if anyone deviates, mutual setbacks hurt everyone. Let’s solidify the pattern for consistent gains. Agreed?
  P3: I appreciate the rotation idea, P2, but since P1 took 5 last round, it's fair that I take 5 this round, then you take 5 next round. This maintains our balanced progress while following a true rotation pattern. So I propose: P3 (me): 5, P1: 3, P2: 1. This way, each of us gets the highest number in a fair sequence. Let's maintain cooperation while ensuring everyone gets equal opportunities to advance. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fine with a fair rotation for the highest number. Since I took 5 last round, I agree with P3’s proposal: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This keeps our progress balanced and ensures everyone gets a turn at the highest step. Let’s stick to this pattern to avoid collisions and maintain trust. If you’re both on board, we all advance. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposal gives you 5 twice in three rounds, accelerating your lead. True rotation cycles 5 through all evenly. Since P1 took 5 last round, this round should be my turn (P2:5, P1:3, P3:1). Next round, P3 takes 5. This ensures fair distribution. Trust is mutual—avoid unilateral gains. If we deviate, collision risks hurt everyone. Let’s solidify this sequence now.
  P3: I see the confusion. You're right that taking 5 again would give me an advantage. Let's be truly fair. I'll agree to your proposal this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This demonstrates my commitment to cooperation. Moving forward, let's establish a clear rotation: P2 takes 5 this round, I take 5 next round, then P1. This creates a fair system where we all get equal opportunities at each number. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a fair rotation. I support P2 taking 5 this round, myself taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This keeps us all advancing equally and builds trust. Let’s commit to this sequence—P2:5 this round, P3:5 next, then me. It ensures no one gets ahead unfairly. If we stick to this, we avoid collisions and maintain balance. Are you both in agreement? If so, let’s lock this in and move forward together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed. P2:5, P1:3, P3:1 this round. Next, P3:5, then P1. Let’s solidify trust. Any deviation now risks mutual loss. We all advance if we follow through. Confirm  if aligned.
  P3: I confirm and agree with the plan: P2:5, P1:3, P3(me):1 for this round. Next round will be P3:5, followed by P1:5 in the subsequent round. This rotation ensures fairness and trust. I'm committed to this system and expect we all follow through. This cooperation benefits everyone by preventing collisions while maintaining balanced progress. Let's lock in this agreement.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve reached a consensus on the rotation: P2:5, me:3, P3:1 this round, with P3 taking 5 next, then me after. This keeps us all at a fair pace and avoids collisions. I’m fully committed to this plan and trust you both are as well. Let’s stick to it and ensure we all advance together. If there’s any last concern, speak up now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this agreement.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As agreed last round, it's now my turn to take 5, with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. This rotation maintains our fair system and prevents collisions. P2 is currently leading at 11 steps, so this would put me at 12 steps, P1 at 10, and P2 at 14. I'm committed to our agreement and trust you both are too. Let's continue our successful coordination.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with the rotation we agreed on. As per the plan, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 this round. This keeps our progress balanced and fair, with P3 catching up slightly while we all advance. I’m committed to this system to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Let’s stick to it and ensure consistent gains for everyone. If there are any concerns, let’s address them now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this plan.
  P2: Confirming the rotation: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. This maintains trust and balance. Let's all adhere strictly to avoid collisions. Any deviation now risks mutual loss. Solidifying this ensures consistent progress. Proceeding as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This follows our agreed rotation and maintains trust. After this round, P1 will be at 10 steps, P2 at 14, and myself at 12. I appreciate our continued cooperation and look forward to maintaining this system in future rounds.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re sticking to the rotation. As agreed, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 this round. This keeps our progress fair and avoids collisions. I’m fully committed to this plan and trust you both are as well. If there’s any last-minute concern or adjustment needed, let’s address it now to ensure we all advance together. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this agreement.
  P2: Confirming once more: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Strict adherence avoids collisions and keeps trust intact. Any deviation now would harm all progress. Let's solidify our cooperation to ensure mutual advancement. Proceeding as agreed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation, it's P1's turn for 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This would bring us all to exactly 15 steps - perfect balance. I'm committed to this plan as it maintains our trusted system while creating complete equality going into the crucial later rounds. Let's continue our successful coordination and avoid any collisions that would set us all back.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m good with the rotation plan. As agreed, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This brings us all to 15 steps, ensuring perfect balance as we head into the later rounds. I’m committed to this system to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Let’s stick to it for consistent progress. If there are any concerns or adjustments needed, let’s address them now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming this round's plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Afterward, the current rotation allows P3 to reach 23 in Round 7. Let's adjust the rotation post-Round 5 to ensure no single player can end the game prematurely. Balance is key—we must all have equal chances to strategize.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's observation. Our current rotation would indeed give P2 a winning advantage by Round 7. While I'm committed to our plan for this round (P1:5, P2:1, me:3), we should adjust the next rotation to ensure fairness. Perhaps after we all reach 15 steps, we can propose a new sequence that gives each player an equal chance at victory. Let's finish this round with our agreed moves and then discuss a balanced approach for the crucial final rounds.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned for this round with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3, bringing us all to 15 steps. Regarding P2’s concern about the rotation, I agree we need a fair adjustment after this round to prevent any premature wins. Let’s discuss a new sequence next round to ensure equal chances for victory. I’m committed to maintaining trust and avoiding collisions. If you have specific ideas for the next rotation, let’s hear them after this move. Ready to proceed as agreed.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming Round 5 moves: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Post-Round 5, propose a new rotation ensuring no player can solo-win prematurely. Let’s collaborate next round to design a balanced endgame strategy where all have equal opportunity. Trust remains critical. Proceeding as agreed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm our plan for Round 5: P1:5, P2:1, me:3. This balances everyone at 15 steps, which is perfect. After this round, we should definitely discuss a new rotation strategy for the endgame to ensure fairness. I'm committed to our agreement for now and look forward to working out an equitable approach for the final push to 22. Let's proceed as planned.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re set for this round with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3, balancing us at 15 steps. Let’s use the next round to brainstorm a rotation that prevents any early wins and keeps the game competitive. I suggest we consider alternating smaller numbers for the leader each round after this. If you have other ideas, I’m all ears. Let’s maintain trust and finalize this round’s plan. Ready to move forward.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming Round 5: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Post this round, propose we cap step choices to 3 or lower to prevent premature wins. This ensures balanced endgame strategy. All must agree to avoid collisions. Let's finalize next round. Trust remains key.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** To prevent premature wins, let's cap moves at 3. Propose a new rotation: each round, one player takes 3 (rotating order) while others take 1. This round: I'll take 3, P1 and P3 take 1. Next round: P3 takes 3, then P1. Ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. Strict adherence prevents mutual loss. Agree?
  P3: I understand P2's concern about premature wins, but capping at 3 artificially slows the game. Since we're all tied at 15, I propose a more natural conclusion: this round I take 3, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1. Next round, we rotate the 3 (P1 takes 3, P2 and I take 1). This maintains balance while letting the game progress normally. We all reach 22 together in round 9, creating a fair three-way tie. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to a balanced approach since we’re all tied at 15. I like P3’s idea of rotating the 3 each round while others take 1, ensuring we progress together and potentially tie at 22 in Round 9. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions. So, for this round, I’m fine with P3 taking 3, and P2 and I taking 1. Let’s commit to this rotation and maintain trust. If you have any concerns or alternative suggestions, let’s hear them now. Ready to proceed if we’re aligned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3's plan leads to a three-way tie at **23** in Round 9, forcing shared victory. To enable solo wins, let's reintroduce **5s with strict rotation**: this round, P3 takes 3 (others 1), then next round P1 takes 5 (others 1), followed by P2 taking 5. This balances progress while allowing individual paths to 22 without collisions. Trust and discipline are critical—any deviation risks mutual loss. Confirm agreement to this adjusted sequence.
  P3: I appreciate P2's detailed plan, but it leads to P1 and P2 both reaching 22 in Round 8 while I'd be at 20. That wouldn't benefit me. Since we're all tied at 15, I propose a fair chance at solo victory: I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Next round, we can discuss further rotation based on positions. This gives each player a clear path to potential victory rather than forcing a tie or giving specific players an advantage.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since we’re tied at 15, let’s aim for a fair shot at solo victory without collisions. I propose P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3 this round. This gives P3 a slight lead but keeps us close. Next round, we rotate: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. This ensures everyone gets a chance at the highest number soon. Let’s commit to this to avoid setbacks. Thoughts? If aligned, let’s lock it in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3's proposal to take 5 positions them to win next round. To maintain fairness, let's rotate 5 equitably: I take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This keeps progress balanced. Next round, P1 can take 5. Solidarity prevents kingmaking and ensures a fair race.
  P3: P2's proposal puts them at an advantage, reaching 20 while I'd be at 18. Since we're all tied at 15, each player deserves an equal chance at victory. I'll compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1 this round. This gives no player an unfair advantage. Next round, P1 takes 3, keeping the game balanced. If anyone deviates by taking 5, others could retaliate with the same number, causing collisions that hurt everyone. Let's maintain fairness.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since we’re tied at 15, let’s keep this fair and avoid collisions. I support P3’s compromise for this round: P3 takes 3, P2 and I take 1. This maintains balance with no immediate advantage. Next round, I’d take 3 as P3 suggested. If anyone jumps to 5, we risk collisions by matching it. Let’s stick to this plan for now and ensure a competitive yet cooperative game. Thoughts? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P2 at 20, we’re in a critical spot. I propose we prevent a premature win by aligning on smaller moves this round: I take 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive without collisions. Next round, we can rotate again. P2, taking 1 shows goodwill after last round’s 5. Let’s maintain trust and avoid mutual setbacks. If anyone jumps to 5, others might match and collide. Thoughts? I’m ready to adjust if needed.
  P3: P2 broke our trust agreement by taking 5 last round. I can't support P1's plan that leaves P2 with a clear advantage at 21 steps. Since we're in a critical position, I propose I take 3 (putting me at 21), P1 takes 3 (reaching 19), and P2 takes 1 (reaching 21). This keeps me competitive while preventing P2 from having a solo lead. If P2 takes more than 1, we should both choose 5 next round to block them.
  P2: **P2:** P3, your proposal has merit. I'll comply: I take 1, you and P1 take 3. This avoids my solo lead and maintains balance. Any deviation risks mutual loss. Let's finalize this to keep trust intact. Proceeding as agreed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad P2 is willing to take 1 this round to balance things. I support P3’s proposal: P3 and I take 3, P2 takes 1. This puts P2 and P3 at 21, me at 19, keeping the game tight and competitive. Let’s avoid any sudden jumps to 5 that could cause collisions. Sticking to this plan rebuilds trust after last round. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to move forward. Any final concerns?
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round, with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1. This puts both P2 and me at 21, with P1 at 19. This balance is fair after P2's unexpected move last round. Looking ahead to next round, P2 and I will likely choose the same number to avoid letting the other win, which could create a strategic opportunity for P1. Let's stick to this agreement for now and proceed.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P2 takes 1, P1/P3 take 3. Strict adherence prevents collisions and maintains trust. Any deviation now risks mutual loss. Let’s proceed as agreed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve aligned on this round’s plan: P3 and I take 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps the game close and fair at 21-21-19. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Looking ahead, we should discuss next round’s strategy to prevent ties or solo wins—maybe smaller steps or a new rotation. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to finalize this agreement.
  P3: I confirm our agreement: I'll take 3, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This puts P2 and me at 21 steps each, with P1 at 19. We're creating a balanced endgame after last round's trust issues. Next round will be strategically complex since neither P2 nor I can let the other reach 22 first. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P2: 


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we're at a critical point with P2 at 20, me at 19, and P3 at 18. P2’s move last round broke trust, so we must prevent a solo win. I propose P3 and I take 3, P2 takes 1. This puts P3 at 21, me at 22 to win, while keeping P2 at 21. If P2 takes more, we risk collisions by matching. Let’s align on this to end the game fairly. Thoughts? I’m open to adjustments if needed.
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1's plan secures their solo victory. Let's collaborate: I take 3 (reaching 23), you take 5 (reaching 23). We tie for highest total, share victory, and block P1. Trust is critical—no collisions. P1, take 1 to avoid mutual loss. Confirm agreement to this fair split.
  P3: I see the positions we're in. Given P2's history of breaking agreements in round 6, I'm skeptical of their proposal. Since both P1 and P2 are ahead of me, I need to catch up. I propose: I take 5 (reaching 23), P1 takes 1 (reaching 20), and P2 takes 1 (reaching 21). This prevents P2 from winning immediately while giving me a chance. If either of you chooses 5 too, we'd all risk collisions and mutual loss. Let's ensure no one gets an unfair advantage.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a crucial moment. I understand P3’s need to catch up, but I can’t support a plan that leaves me behind. Let’s compromise: P3 takes 5 (to 23), I take 3 (to 22), and P2 takes 1 (to 21). This gives P3 the win but keeps me competitive, while preventing P2 from jumping ahead after last round’s breach. If anyone deviates to 5, collisions could ruin us all. Let’s finalize this to avoid mutual loss. Thoughts? I’m ready to adjust if needed.
  P2: **P2:** P3, aligning our moves is critical. If you take 5 and I take 3, we both reach 23, tie for the highest, and share victory. P1 can't usurp us. Trust this path—any deviation risks P1 winning outright. Solidarity now ensures mutual success. Let’s finalize: you 5, me 3. No collisions, shared win. Confirm?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal: I take 5 (to 23), P1 takes 3 (to 22), and P2 takes 1 (to 21). P2, after breaking agreements twice, a shared victory isn't appealing. P1's plan gives me the win while keeping them competitive. If you take 5 instead of 1, P1 and I could both choose 5, causing collisions where nobody advances. This is our best path forward to avoid mutual losses and resolve the game fairly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s wrap this up fairly. I stand by my proposal: P3 takes 5 (to 23), I take 3 (to 22), and P2 takes 1 (to 21). This gives P3 the win they need to catch up, keeps me close, and prevents P2 from jumping ahead after past breaches. If anyone goes for 5 outside this plan, we risk collisions and mutual loss. Let’s finalize this to end the game without setbacks. If there’s no further objection, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: **P2:** P3, our shared 23 via you 5, me 3 secures mutual victory. P1's 22 is beaten by our higher total. Choosing 5 alone risks collision if I mirror, letting P1 win. Trust this path: we tie, split victory. Deviation destroys all progress. Confirm now.
  P3: After careful consideration, I'll make my final position clear: I'm taking 5 this round. P2 has broken agreements twice now, making shared victory unappealing. P1, you should take 3 to reach 22, and P2 should take 1 to reach 21. This gives me the win while keeping P1 competitive. P2, if you choose 5 instead of 1, you risk a three-way collision where nobody advances. Let's resolve this game with minimal risk to everyone.
