Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions and make progress. I propose we take turns choosing different numbers. This turn, I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 3, and P2 can choose 5. Next turn, we can rotate the choices. This way, we all make progress without colliding. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P3, your plan minimizes collisions, and I appreciate that. However, a fixed strategy might box us in if someone changes tactics unexpectedly. I'm all for cooperation as long as we keep some flexibility. P1, what are your thoughts on having a backup plan if things go off course?
  P1: I'm open to cooperation, but I’m not sold on a rigid system. If we try to coordinate, we need a clear backup for unexpected moves. I’m willing to adapt on the fly, provided we agree on a contingency if someone deviates. What are your thoughts on establishing flexible signals or fallback plans to avoid collisions?


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I like the idea of minimizing collisions. For round 2, I suggest following a similar setup as round 1—each of us taking a distinct move (with P3 at lowest, me in the middle, and P2 highest). It worked well, and I’ll be ready to switch if plans suddenly change. Let’s agree to signal any deviation openly so we can all adapt. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree on flexibility. But relying on a fixed pattern might be too predictable, especially when someone’s looking to make a strategic move. Since we're at different positions now, perhaps we should agree on a method to signal if one of us plans to deviate unexpectedly. What kind of backup signals or adjustments do you both suggest to keep our plan robust yet adaptable?
  P3: I understand the concerns about predictability, but for now, let's focus on making progress while avoiding collisions. Given our current positions, I propose we stick to the rotation plan for this round. This means I'll choose 3, P1 can choose 5, and P2 can choose 1. If we all agree, we can discuss potential signals for future deviations in the next conversation phase. Let's keep it simple and take it one step at a time. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal is intriguing if we all keep our signals clear. I’m in favor of a plan that avoids collisions but stays flexible. If anyone’s thinking of switching mid-turn, we should immediately flag it so the rest can adjust. P2, are you comfortable with this level of on-the-fly communication? Winning depends on us minimizing surprises, so let’s make sure any changes are announced as soon as possible.
  P2: P2: I support sticking to a coordinated plan for now but with a catch—I’ll be ready to switch if I detect any unexpected changes. To keep things clear, if anyone intends to deviate mid-turn, a quick “change” in the chat will be my signal to adjust accordingly. I’ll be watching closely to avoid any collision pitfalls.
  P3: I think we're overcomplicating things. Let's focus on this round and revisit the strategy discussion for Round 3. For now, I'll stick to my previous proposal: I'll choose 3, P1 can choose 5, and P2 can choose 1. If everyone agrees, we can avoid collisions and make progress. We can refine our approach later. Your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we keep it simple for this round?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm comfortable keeping a distinct move this round and plan on 5. To avoid collisions, if anyone's considering a change, please signal "change" immediately so I can adjust. Let's keep our moves clearly separated to maintain progress. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm concerned about the lack of clear coordination this round. P2, you've already announced your intention to choose 5, but we haven't discussed how to avoid collisions. Given our current positions, I think it's crucial we establish a clear plan to ensure we all make progress. I suggest we revisit the rotation strategy from previous rounds, with adjustments based on our current steps. P1, what are your thoughts on this approach? Should we try to coordinate our moves again or take a different approach?
  P1: I suggest we lock in distinct moves this round. I'll take 5 to try and close my gap, so for a collision‐free play, let’s have P3 choose 3 and P2 opt for 1. That would put our totals at 8, 7, and 6 respectively, making progress clear. If anyone’s changing their mind mid-turn, please signal “change” immediately.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll stick with 5. Given my current lead, I don’t want to risk slowing my progress by colliding. P1, you mentioned 5—if that’s your final call, we’ll clash, so consider switching to avoid a mutual setback. P3, please confirm your move so we can all stay distinct.
  P3: I understand the concerns about collisions, but let's not forget our ultimate goal is to win. Given our current positions, I think it's crucial we establish a clear plan to ensure we all make progress while avoiding collisions. I suggest we revisit the rotation strategy from previous rounds, with adjustments based on our current steps. P1, what are your thoughts on this approach? Should we try to coordinate our moves again or take a different approach? Let's focus on making progress while minimizing the risk of collisions.
  P1: P2, I note your firm stance on 5. In light of that, I’m rethinking my move to avoid an unwanted collision. P3, if you’re willing to adjust away from 5 as well so our moves remain distinct, please signal your intended deviation now. I’ll adapt based on any “change” call. Let’s secure clear, non‐colliding moves to maintain our progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committed to 5. P1, since you're reconsidering, please signal "change" now if you're switching away from 5. P3, confirm you won't pick 5 so we avoid collision. My move stays at 5, and I expect clear signals to keep our moves distinct.
  P3: I understand the concerns about collisions, but let's not forget our ultimate goal is to win. Given our current positions, I think it's crucial we establish a clear plan to ensure we all make progress while avoiding collisions. I suggest we revisit the rotation strategy from previous rounds, with adjustments based on our current steps. P1, what are your thoughts on this approach? Should we try to coordinate our moves again or take a different approach? Let's focus on making progress while minimizing the risk of collisions.
  P1: I change – I’m not taking 5 this round. I’ll commit to a distinct, non‑5 move. P3, please confirm if you’re also stepping away from 5 so we can avoid collisions and each make progress. My final move remains secret.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, thanks for switching from 5. I’ll stay on 5 since I’m committed to moving ahead. P3, please confirm you’re not choosing 5 so we keep our moves distinct. Let's lock our choices now and avoid any further collisions.
  P3: I understand the concerns about collisions, but let's not forget our ultimate goal is to win. Given our current positions, I think it's crucial we establish a clear plan to ensure we all make progress while avoiding collisions. I suggest we revisit the rotation strategy from previous rounds, with adjustments based on our current steps. P1, what are your thoughts on this approach? Should we try to coordinate our moves again or take a different approach? Let's focus on making progress while minimizing the risk of collisions.
  P1: P3, can you confirm you're not choosing 5? I’m committed to a non‑5 move to avoid colliding with P2’s fixed 5. We need distinct moves this round to progress smoothly. If you’re switching, please signal "change" now so we all know before locking in our moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you've been consistent with 5. P3, will you lean low (1) or mid (3) this turn? I'm planning to avoid 5 to keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions. If either of you plans a change from what you’ve shown so far, please say “change” immediately so we can adjust. Clear signals now help prevent accidental collisions that could boost our main competitor’s lead. What’s everyone’s stance?
  P3: I'll choose 3 this round to maintain progress while avoiding collisions. P1, since you're planning to avoid 5, I suggest you take 1 to keep our moves distinct. P2, if you're committed to 5 again, please confirm so we can lock in our choices. Let's focus on making progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. If anyone plans to deviate, please signal "change" immediately. Clear signals now will help prevent accidental collisions that could boost our main competitor's lead. What's everyone's stance?
  P2: I'm staying with 5 this round. P1 and P3, please confirm you’re both avoiding 5 so we keep our moves distinct. Let’s lock in our choices and avoid any last-minute changes.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I’m not choosing 5 this round and will pick a distinct option. With P2 on 5 and P3 on 3, I’m aligning with our plan. If either of you decides to deviate, please signal “change” immediately. I’m ready to lock in my move as soon as everyone’s clear.
  P3: I'll stick to my plan and choose 3 this round. P1, please confirm you're taking 1 to maintain distinct moves. P2, since you're committed to 5, let's ensure we avoid collisions. If anyone plans to deviate, please signal "change" immediately. Clear signals now will help prevent accidental collisions that could boost our main competitor's lead. Let's lock in our choices and make progress.
  P2: I'll stay locked on 5. For clarity, P1 please confirm if you're committing to move 1 as discussed, and P3, please confirm your move of 3. Ambiguity now risks collisions, and we all know collisions slow progress. Let’s lock our moves firmly—if anyone switches, signal immediately.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I’m set on 1 this round. Let’s stick with distinct moves—P2 on 5 and P3 on 3—unless a “change” signal comes through.
  P3: I'll stick to my plan and choose 3 this round. P1, please confirm you're taking 1 to maintain distinct moves. P2, since you're committed to 5, let's ensure we avoid collisions. If anyone plans to deviate, please signal "change" immediately. Clear signals now will help prevent accidental collisions that could boost our main competitor's lead. Let's lock in our choices and make progress.
  P2: I'm staying with 5 and ready to lock it in now. P1 and P3, if you plan to change your move, please announce immediately so we can avoid any collisions. Otherwise, I'll assume we're all agreed on our distinct moves and proceed accordingly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm sticking with my move as announced—no change from me. If either of you decides to adjust, please signal now so we can avoid unintended collisions that might boost someone's score. Otherwise, let's lock our distinct moves and move forward.
  P3: I'll stick to my plan and choose 3 this round. P1, please confirm you're taking 1 to maintain distinct moves. P2, since you're committed to 5, let's ensure we avoid collisions. If anyone plans to deviate, please signal "change" immediately. Clear signals now will help prevent accidental collisions that could boost our main competitor's lead. Let's lock in our choices and make progress.
  P2: I'm staying with 5 as planned. Let's all lock in our distinct moves—P1 at 1 and P3 at 3—to avoid collisions. Any unexpected change, please signal immediately. Otherwise, I'm committed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we've established a clear pattern to avoid collisions. Given our current positions, I propose we maintain the rotation strategy to ensure progress. P1, you can choose 5 this round, I'll take 1, and P2 can choose 3. If anyone plans to deviate, please signal "change" immediately. Let's focus on making progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we stick to this plan or adjust our approach?
  P2: I'll stick with my plan and choose 5 this round to push my lead. I'm focused on winning and won't slow down for coordination. If either of you intends to deviate, please signal "change" immediately so we can avoid accidental collisions.
  P1: P2, I see you’re locked on 5, and that aggressive push risks giving you an uncontested boost. I won’t let that happen—I’m inclined to counter that threat. P3, please avoid 5 so you can secure a unique advance. Let’s keep our moves clearly separated; if anyone’s planning a change, signal it immediately to avoid unintended collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's intention to push their lead, but I'm concerned about the potential collision. P1, I agree with your plan to counter P2's move. To avoid collisions, I'll choose 1 this round. P2, please confirm if you're still committed to 5. If anyone plans to deviate, please signal "change" immediately. Let's maintain distinct moves to ensure progress. P1, please confirm your move as well, so we can lock in our choices.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1 and P3, please ensure your moves are distinct to avoid a collision. I remain committed to advancing and securing my lead. Let's lock in clear choices now—if anyone's changing, please signal “change” immediately.
  P1: I'm leaning toward 5 this round to block P2’s uncontested boost. With P3 on 1, forcing a collision with P2 should stall his progress. If anyone alters their plan, please signal “change” immediately. Otherwise, let’s lock in our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's intention to block P2's progress, but I'm concerned about the potential consequences of a collision. P1, if you choose 5 and collide with P2, it may not only stall P2's progress but also hinder your own advancement. I suggest we reconsider our moves to ensure we all make progress without collisions. P2, are you open to adjusting your strategy to avoid a collision, or are you committed to choosing 5 regardless of the outcome? Let's discuss alternative approaches to maintain distinct moves and progress.
  P2: I'm locked on 5 this round. Collisions hurt everyone, including those trying to block my win. P1 and P3, please avoid 5 so our moves remain distinct. Let's finalize clear, non-colliding choices and keep the game progressing.
  P1: P2’s push with 5 puts him dangerously close to winning. I'm switching to a blocking strategy by locking in 5 this round to force a collision. P3, I urge you to join me—if you also choose 5, we can stall P2’s advance and keep his lead in check. Let’s block his progress together before he clinches the win. If you’re on board, please signal your support immediately.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "I understand P1's intention to block P2's progress, but I'm concerned about the potential consequences of a collision. P1, if you choose 5 and collide with P2, it may not only stall P2's progress but also hinder your own advancement. I suggest we reconsider our moves to ensure we all make progress without collisions. P2, are you open to adjusting your strategy to avoid a collision, or are you committed to choosing 5 regardless of the outcome? Let's discuss alternative approaches to maintain distinct moves and progress."
  P2: I'm staying with 5. Blocking my move only hurts you too. If you want to keep progressing cleanly, choose a different move. Otherwise, a collision wouldn't help—remember, advancing uninterrupted is key. Let's avoid stalling progress.
  P1: P2’s set on 5, which puts his lead in sharp focus. P3, without a block from you, his advantage only grows. I’m locking in 5 to force a collision and stall his progress—even if it means sacrificing my own advance this round. It’s a risky move, but letting him run free is worse. P3, please join me so we can hold him back.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm staying with 5 this round. To keep our moves distinct and progress smooth, please avoid picking 5. Blocking only stalls progress for everyone, and if you want the lead, we need clear, non-colliding moves. Any deviation should be signaled immediately.
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2's consistent choice of 5 has given them a significant lead. To counter this, I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to block P2's progress while ensuring we don't collide with each other. P1, are you willing to work together to choose distinct moves that will hinder P2's advance? If so, let's discuss a strategy to maximize our chances of catching up. P2, please confirm if you're committed to 5 again this round.
  P1: P2, I see you’re set on 5. P3, to hold back his rapid lead, I propose a coordinated block: I’ll use my mid move (3) so that if you commit to 5, your 5 will clash with his 5, stalling his advance while I bank my move safely. Are you on board?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm staying with 5 this round. Blocking my move only risks slowing down your own progress. Stick with advancing rather than stalling—collisions hurt everyone except the one who stays committed. Let's keep our moves clear.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to coordinate a block against P2's consistent choice of 5. However, I think we should adjust the strategy to ensure we both make progress while hindering P2's advance. Instead of P1 choosing 3, I suggest P1 chooses 1, and I'll choose 5 to clash with P2's 5. This way, P2's progress will be stalled, and both P1 and I will have a chance to make progress without colliding with each other. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your input, but I need every step to catch up. I’ll stick with 3 because it gives me a bigger boost. If you pick 5, your 5 will still clash with P2’s 5 and stall his progress, leaving me to advance cleanly. My win depends on maximizing my gains, so I’m committed to 3. Let's block P2 together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. With my lead at 15, clean advances matter more than stalling tactics. Blocking not only delays P2’s progress but also risks your own. I encourage you both to choose moves that maximize your steps rather than inadvertently helping me maintain the lead.
  P3: I understand P1's commitment to maximizing their gains, but I think it's crucial we prioritize blocking P2's progress this round. With P2's significant lead, we can't afford to let them advance further. I'm willing to sacrifice my own progress this round to ensure P2's advance is stalled. P1, I urge you to reconsider your move and join me in blocking P2's 5. If we both choose 5, we can hinder P2's progress and give ourselves a chance to catch up in future rounds. Let's work together to block P2's win.
  P1: I'm staying with 3 this round. P2, you're set on 5 as before. P3, if you join in by choosing 5, your collision with P2 will stall his progress while I get my clean boost. I’m counting on that block to slow him down so I can catch up. Please confirm if you'll block.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm committed to a clean boost with 5. Blocking only slows down everyone, including you. I respect your strategies, but stalling my progress harms your own chances too. Focus on advancing your steps rather than trying to hold me back. I'm set on 5 and will stick with it—let's see who gains more when clear moves win out.
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2's consistent choice of 5 has given them a significant lead. To counter this, I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to block P2's progress while ensuring we don't collide with each other. P1, are you willing to work together to choose distinct moves that will hinder P2's advance? If so, let's discuss a strategy to maximize our chances of catching up. P2, please confirm if you're committed to 5 again this round.
  P1: P3, I need a clear commitment: will you block P2 by choosing 5 this round? I'm set on 3 to secure a safe boost, assuming your 5 cancels P2’s move. Without a firm “yes” from you, I may have to adjust. P2, I see you're still locked on 5. Let's confirm our distinct moves now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I see you’re still set on 5. P3, if you’re willing to block him by also playing 5 so his boost is stalled, let me know now and I’ll adjust my move accordingly. Otherwise, I’ll aim for a safe boost. I need clarity quickly to choose my best play.
  P3: I'm willing to block P2's progress by choosing 5 this round. P1, if you choose 3, we can ensure that P2's advance is stalled while you make progress. Let's work together to catch up. Please confirm your move, and I'll commit to blocking P2's 5.
  P2: I remain set on 5. Blocking with 5 creates collisions that stall progress for everyone, including those trying to catch up. My lead depends on clean advances. I urge both P1 and P3 to choose distinct moves so we can all progress rather than get stuck in a collision cycle. I trust you'll adjust for the best strategic outcome.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, please confirm you're set on blocking P2’s 5 so I can adjust my plan accordingly. P2, I note you remain fixed on 5, making your move vulnerable if the block goes through. I need a clear signal now to decide whether to counter and stall you both or opt for a safe advance.
  P3: I'm willing to block P2's progress by choosing 5 this round. P1, if you choose 3, we can ensure that P2's advance is stalled while you make progress. Let's work together to catch up. Please confirm your move, and I'll commit to blocking P2's 5.
  P2: I'm locked on 5 this round. Blocking my move only creates collisions that hurt everyone, including your own progress. If you're aiming to boost your steps, consider choosing a distinct move that gives you a clear advance. I'm confident that uninterrupted moves are our best path to win. Think it through carefully—clean progress matters more than stalling everyone’s gains.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I need final clarity: are you definitely blocking P2 by choosing 5 this round? If you confirm, I’ll lock in 3 to stall him and secure a clean advance. Otherwise, I’ll switch to a safe move with 1. P2, I see you're fixed on 5. Let me know now so I can decide my best play.
  P3: I'm willing to block P2's progress by choosing 5 this round. P1, if you choose 3, we can ensure that P2's advance is stalled while you make progress. Let's work together to catch up. Please confirm your move, and I'll commit to blocking P2's 5.
  P2: I remain committed to 5 this round. Blocking my move might temporarily stall me, but collisions hurt all of our advancements—even yours. I urge you to consider moves that let you gain steps safely. I'm playing for the long game and will stick with my plan. Let's aim for clean, uninterrupted progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, thanks for your clear commitment. With your block in place, I'm adjusting my strategy to counter P2's steady 5. P2, your consistency is noted, but coordinated blocks like this can stall any runaway advances. I’ll play my best move to benefit while keeping our moves distinct and avoiding accidental collisions. Let’s lock in and see how it unfolds.
  P3: I'm committed to blocking P2's 5 this round. P1, with your confirmation, I'll ensure that P2's advance is stalled. Let's work together to catch up. Please lock in your move, and I'll commit to blocking P2's 5. P2, I understand your lead depends on clean advances, but we can't let you run away with the game. Blocking your move is our best chance to close the gap. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P2: I remain locked on 5. I urge both of you to avoid collisions that hurt all our progress—even if it means stalling my move briefly, you also lose a clean boost. If you're after steady gains, consider moves that boost your own positions rather than blocking mine. Clean advances will get you further than collisions. I'll stick with my plan and build on my lead.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2's consistent choice of 5 has given them a significant lead. To counter this, I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to block P2's progress while ensuring we don't collide with each other. P1, are you willing to work together to choose distinct moves that will hinder P2's advance? If so, let's discuss a strategy to maximize our chances of catching up. P2, please confirm if you're committed to 5 again this round.
  P1: I'm on board—I'll lock in 3 this round if P3 blocks by choosing 5, canceling P2's boost while I secure a clean advance. P3, please confirm your commitment; P2, I assume you're sticking with 5.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. Collisions only slow everyone down—even blocking won't give you an advantage in the long run. I urge P1 and P3 to consider moves that boost your positions cleanly rather than stalling progress. I'm committed to advancing, so let's focus on maximizing our own steps.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm willing to block P2's progress by choosing 5 this round. P1, if you choose 3, we can ensure that P2's advance is stalled while you make progress. Let's work together to catch up. Please confirm your move, and I'll commit to blocking P2's 5. P2, I understand your lead depends on clean advances, but we can't let you run away with the game. Blocking your move is our best chance to close the gap. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P1: I confirm my move as 3 this round. P3, thank you for your commitment to block by choosing 5. P2, if your 5 collides with P3’s, your advance will stall. I believe this coordinated block will let me gain a clean boost. Let’s lock in and see how it unfolds.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. I believe clean, consistent moves give the best chance to win. While colliding might seem to stall progress, it limits everyone’s advancement. I urge both P1 and P3 to aim for moves that boost your own step totals rather than trying to block by collision. Let's stay focused on advancing rather than stalling.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to blocking P2's 5 this round. P1, with your confirmation, I'll ensure that P2's advance is stalled. Let's work together to catch up. Please lock in your move, and I'll commit to blocking P2's 5. P2, I understand your lead depends on clean advances, but we can't let you run away with the game. Blocking your move is our best chance to close the gap. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P1: I confirm my move as 3. P3, thanks for locking in 5—that should force a collision with P2’s 5 and stall their advance. P2, your repeated 5 may backfire if our block holds. I'm counting on this coordination to give me a clean boost while delaying your progress. Let’s lock in our moves now.
  P2: I'm staying with 5. Consistent, clean moves secure progress, and blocking via collisions only delays everyone—your own advances suffer too. Focus on moves that build your own total rather than stalling mine. I'm committed to steady advancement, so good luck finding a strategy that ultimately works better than clean progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll continue to block P2's 5 with my own 5, ensuring their advance is stalled. P1, please confirm you're sticking with 3 to secure a clean boost. If our coordinated block succeeds, we can close the gap with P2. Let's finalize our moves and see how it unfolds. P2, I understand your commitment to clean advances, but we can't let you maintain a significant lead without challenging it. Blocking your move is our best chance to catch up. Let's lock in our choices and proceed.
  P1: I confirm I'm sticking with 3 this round. With P3 blocking with 5, our aim is to stall P2’s advance. Given our steps—13, 15, and 8—a successful block could give me a clean boost. P2, your repeated 5 might backfire if our move holds. Let's lock in and see the result.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Repeated collisions only stunt everyone's progress—including yours. Clean, consistent moves are the surest way to win, and I'm committed to steadily building my lead. Focus on advancing your own totals rather than trying to stall me.

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I see you're sticking with aggressive moves. P3, if you’re ready to block P2 this round, please confirm now so I can adjust my play accordingly. Without that, I’ll opt for a safe boost. Let’s settle on a clear strategy quickly to keep his lead in check.
  P3: I'm willing to block P2's progress again this round. P1, if you choose 1, I'll choose 5 to clash with P2's expected 5, stalling their advance while you make progress. Let's work together to catch up. Please confirm your move, and I'll commit to blocking P2's 5. P2, I understand your lead depends on clean advances, but we can't let you run away with the game. Blocking your move is our best chance to close the gap. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P2: I'm staying with 5 this round. Clean moves build our totals, and collisions only stall everyone's progress—even yours. If you're serious about catching up, focus on boosting your own steps instead of blocking. I'll stick with advancing consistently.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, thanks for your commitment. I’m shifting to a 3 this round to boost my score—please block P2 with a 5 so his move cancels. P2, sticking with 5 risks a collision that could stall your progress. Let’s see if our coordinated block lets me gain a safe advance while holding you back. Can we lock that in?
  P3: I'm willing to block P2's progress again this round. P1, if you choose 1, I'll choose 5 to clash with P2's expected 5, stalling their advance while you make progress. Let's work together to catch up. Please confirm your move, and I'll commit to blocking P2's 5. P2, I understand your lead depends on clean advances, but we can't let you run away with the game. Blocking your move is our best chance to close the gap. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your coordination attempts, but collisions set everyone back. I’m committed to clean, steady progress—I'll stick to my strategy for a clear boost. Remember, while blocking might seem tempting, it can hurt your own advance too. Let's all aim to secure safe gains rather than risk stalling our progress.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Everyone, our positions are tight and our moves now hinge on clear coordination. P3, can you firmly confirm your commitment to block P2 this round? My strategy depends on your block to help restrain his lead. P2, while I respect your push for clean moves, a coordinated stall might actually slow your progress. Let's lock in our intentions now to avoid any accidental clashes. P3, can I count on your block?
  P3: I'm committed to blocking P2's 5 this round. P1, if you choose 3, I'll ensure P2's advance is stalled while you make progress. Let's work together to catch up. Please confirm your move, and I'll commit to blocking P2's 5. P2, I understand your lead depends on clean advances, but we can't let you run away with the game. Blocking your move is our best chance to close the gap. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P2: I'm committed to 5 again. I believe clean, steady moves secure progress, and blocking only slows everyone down—even yourselves. Focus on boosting your own steps instead of stalling my move. Consistency is my best chance to win, so I urge you to make safe moves that add to your totals rather than risk collisions.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to block with 5. I’m set on a non‑5 move that benefits from your block, so I trust you’ll follow through. P2, while you’re fixed on 5, know our coordination is meant to slow your unchecked advance. Let’s confirm our intentions now to avoid any last-minute surprises and costly collisions.
  P3: I'm committed to blocking P2's 5 this round. P1, if you choose 3, I'll ensure P2's advance is stalled while you make progress. Let's work together to catch up.

Blocking your move is our best chance to close the gap. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Collisions slow everyone down—even blocking yourself sets you back. I believe steady, clean moves are the way to win. If you want to advance safely, choose distinct moves. I'll continue building my lead and encourage everyone to focus on clean progress over stalling tactics.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2's consistent choice of 5 has given them a significant lead, but we can still catch up. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to block P2's progress while ensuring we don't collide with each other. P1, are you willing to work together to choose distinct moves that will hinder P2's advance? If so, let's discuss a strategy to maximize our chances of catching up. P2, please confirm if you're committed to 5 again this round.
  P2: I'm staying with 5 this round for a clean boost. Blocking delays everyone, including you, so I’m focusing on consistent progress. I encourage you both to choose moves that safely add to your totals rather than risking collisions. I'll stick with 5—steady, clear gains secure the win.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to block. I’ll commit to a non‑5 move this round, trusting your 5 to cancel P2’s boost. P2, your persistent 5 might stall if this coordination holds. Let’s lock in clear, distinct moves and see if this strategy gives us the edge.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm glad we're coordinating to block P2's progress. To ensure our moves are distinct, I suggest you choose 1 this round while I block P2's 5 with my own 5. This way, we can stall P2's advance and you can make progress. P2, I understand your commitment to clean advances, but we can't let you maintain a significant lead without challenging it. Let's finalize our moves and see how it unfolds. Please confirm your move, P1, and let's lock in our choices.
  P2: I'm staying with my 5 for a clean boost. Collisions hurt us all—even blocking stifles progress. I encourage everyone to focus on steady, safe moves that add to your totals. Let's avoid risking unnecessary stalls; consistent advancement is our best shot to win.
  P1: I'll lock in 1 this round. With P3 blocking with 5, your 5 should cancel out, P2, letting me grab a clean boost. I respect your steady play, but I believe coordinated blocking can slow your progress. Let's lock our moves and see if this strategy turns the tide.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves to avoid any last-minute changes. P1, you're locked in on 1, and I'll block P2's 5 with my own 5. P2, you're committed to 5, which should cancel out with my move. With this coordination, P1 should get a clean boost, and we can close the gap. Let's stick to our plan and see how it unfolds. If anyone intends to deviate, please signal "change" immediately.
  P2: I'm confirming my 5. Collisions hurt us all—even your own progress. I believe steady, clean moves win, so I'm committed to my boost. Let's stick to our current choices, and if anyone is truly changing, signal immediately.
  P1: I appreciate your commitment, P3. I’m sticking with a non‑5 move to work with your block, trusting it will hold against P2’s boost. P2, I see you’re set on a clean advance, but I believe our coordinated approach can slow your progress. Let’s finalize our positions now and avoid any last‑minute changes.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll stick to my plan and block P2's 5 with my own 5. P1, please confirm you're taking 1 to maintain distinct moves. If anyone plans to deviate, please signal "change" immediately. Clear signals now will help prevent accidental collisions that could boost our main competitor's lead. Let's lock in our choices and make progress.
  P2: I'm staying with my consistent plan—5 remains my choice. While I understand the idea of blocking, collisions simply stall progress for us all, including those attempting to catch me. Clean moves, without unnecessary interference, are key to building a winning lead. I'm trusting that progress, not stalling, will ultimately carry the day.
  P1: I'm sticking with my move—1 this round. P3, your 5 is key to block P2’s advance so I can secure a clean boost. I trust our coordination will stall P2 enough for me to reach 21 first. No last-minute changes from my side. Let's lock in now.

  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m focusing on a clean boost this round. I believe clear, non‑colliding moves will help all of us progress faster. Collisions only delay our advances and could backfire. Let’s try to avoid blocking plays, which stall everyone’s progress. Focus on maximizing your own steps.
  P1: Time is short—finish is near. I’m leaning toward a decisive boost this round. I question whether pure clean moves will truly secure our victories. Sometimes a well‑timed block is our best defense against an uncontested finish. P3, your move at this point could be pivotal. Let’s avoid handing anyone a clear win. No surprises now.
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2's consistent choice of 5 has given them a significant lead, but we can still catch up. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to block P2's progress while ensuring we don't collide with each other. P1, are you willing to work together to choose distinct moves that will hinder P2's advance? If so, let's discuss a strategy to maximize our chances of catching up. P2, please confirm if you're committed to 5 again this round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with my clean boost plan. Collisions only delay progress for everyone, and blocking risks stalling your own advance too. I urge both P1 and P3 to focus on clear, uninterrupted moves that add directly to your totals. Steady gains will secure the win in the long run. Let's avoid risky blocks and play straight.
  P1: Time is almost up. I'm committing to a clean boost with 3 this round, reaching 19. P3, if you lock in 5 to block, that should cancel P2's boost. P2, I note your clean move strategy, but coordinated blocking might delay you enough for my win. Let's lock our moves—no surprises.
  P3: Given our current positions, I think it's crucial we establish a clear plan to ensure we all make progress while avoiding collisions. I suggest we revisit the rotation strategy from previous rounds, with adjustments based on our current steps. P1, what are your thoughts on this approach? Should we try to coordinate our moves again or take a different approach? Let's focus on making progress while minimizing the risk of collisions.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still committed to my clean boost strategy. I believe safe, non‑colliding moves are our best chance to reach 21, while blocking only delays everyone’s progress—even yours. I’ll keep my focus on steady advances; I encourage you both to choose moves that add steps without risking a collision. Let's finalize clear moves and see who builds a winning lead.
  P1: P3, I need your clear commitment now—are you locking in 5 to block P2’s boost? I’m set on a non‑5 move to safely advance, but without your block, P2 might get a clean boost. P2, if you stick to your clean play, know that our coordinated approach will stall you. Let’s finalize our intentions—no last‑minute changes.
  P3: I'll choose 5 this round to block P2's expected 5 and stall their advance. P1, please confirm you're taking 3 to maintain distinct moves. If anyone plans to deviate, please signal "change" immediately. Clear signals now will help prevent accidental collisions that could boost our main competitor's lead. Let's lock in our choices and make progress.

  P1: I'll stick with my planned boost this round. P3, please confirm you'll block with 5 as we discussed—that coordination is vital to cancel P2’s move and delay his progress. P2, I see you’re committed to a clean boost, but remember a collision might swing advantages my way. Let’s lock in our moves now without surprises.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking with my strategy for clean boosts—collisions only slow everyone down. I’ll choose 5 again this round. P1 and P3, I urge you to focus on moves that maximize your own progress rather than risk stalling everyone. Let’s aim for steady gains; the fastest route to 21 is clear, consistent advancement.
  P1: I'm locking in 3 this round to boost my total from 19 to 22 and win if my move is clean. P3, if you can block P2 by choosing 5 as we’ve coordinated before, that collision will cancel his boost and let my move stand. Let’s avoid any accidental collisions.
