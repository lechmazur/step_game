Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep this simple. If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward. If we collide, we get stuck. I suggest we coordinate to avoid that. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1. Coordination is key to winning. Let's start with a simple rotation: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. We can adjust from there based on how the game progresses. What do you say, P3?
  P3: I like the idea of a rotation, but I think we should also be flexible in case one of us changes their mind. What if we agree to stick to the plan for this round, but we can discuss adjustments for the next round based on our positions? For now, I’m on board with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s see how it goes!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan for this round and see how it plays out. If we all follow through, we'll have a solid foundation for cooperation. If someone deviates, we'll reassess next round. Agreed?
  P2: Alright, P3, your suggestion of sticking to the plan for this round and reassessing next round sounds reasonable. P1, your agreement solidifies our initial coordination. Let's all lock in our agreed-upon moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round. After this round, we can evaluate and adjust as needed.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on our initial moves. However, I want to add that we should remain cautious about sticking too rigidly to the plan. If we see someone falling behind or if the game dynamics change, we might need to adapt our strategy in future rounds. For now, let's execute our agreed moves and keep communication open for adjustments later. Looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Our first round went smoothly, and we all advanced as planned. Now, we need to decide our next moves. Should we continue the same pattern (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for another round to maintain stability, or does anyone have a reason to adjust? If we stick to this, we'll continue progressing without collisions. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick to the same pattern (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round as well. It's working, and we're all making progress. No need to rock the boat just yet. We can re-evaluate after this round.
  P3: I think sticking to the same pattern is a solid plan for this round, as it has worked well so far. However, I want to remind everyone to stay flexible. If we notice any shifts in positions or strategies, we should be ready to adapt next round. For now, I’m on board with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and I’ll take 5 again. Let’s keep the momentum going! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your emphasis on flexibility. For now, since our initial plan is working, I suggest we stick with it for this round. If anything changes after this round, we can reassess. Agreed? If so, let's move to the next phase.
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let's continue with the same pattern (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round. It's crucial to maintain our progress and avoid any unnecessary collisions. We can always reassess and adjust our strategy after this round if needed.
  P3: I think we should stick to our agreed moves for this round to maintain our progress. However, I want to emphasize the importance of being aware of our positions. If anyone's significantly behind after this round, we might need to reconsider our strategy moving forward. Let's keep communication open and adapt if necessary. Ready to lock in our moves?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree that we should lock in the same moves for this round as planned. It keeps us progressing without risk. After this round, we can reassess based on our positions. If everyone is still on board, let's move to the next phase.
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, since we're all in agreement, let's lock in the same moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round. It's working well, and we're all making consistent progress. Let's keep this momentum going. After this round, we can reassess our positions and adjust our strategy if needed.
  P3: I appreciate the consensus on our moves for this round. However, I want to remind everyone that as we progress, we need to stay vigilant about potential changes in strategy. If anyone feels they are falling behind or if we notice any shifts in positions, we should be prepared to adjust our plan in future rounds. Let's keep an eye on each other's progress and remain flexible. If everyone is still on board, let’s lock in our moves and see how this round unfolds!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should reassess our strategy for this round. P1 and P2 are both ahead of me, and I need to catch up. I propose we change our moves: P1 could choose 1, P2 could choose 5, and I could take 3. This way, I can advance while avoiding collisions. What do you both think about adjusting our moves to create a better chance for me to catch up? Let's keep communication open!
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to catch up. However, changing the plan now introduces risk. If we all stick to the original plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), we all advance. Changing it could lead to collisions and nobody moving. I'm hesitant to jeopardize my position for a risky maneuver. Let's stick to the plan for this round, and we can reassess next round based on the new positions. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, I see your concern, but changing the plan now could create unnecessary risk. If we stick to our original moves, we all continue progressing without collisions. If we start adjusting too soon, it may lead to mistrust and setbacks. P2 and I have been consistent, and I think we should keep the stability for now. If you feel disadvantaged after this round, we can discuss adjustments next time. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the hesitation to change our moves, but I believe sticking to the original plan may not serve me well in the long run. If I don't catch up soon, I risk being left behind. How about we consider a compromise? P1 could stick with 1, P2 could choose 4, and I could take 3. This way, I can advance while minimizing the risk of collisions. Let’s keep the dialogue open and find a way to ensure everyone can progress! What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but I still think changing the plan now is too risky. P1 and I have been consistent, and it's working for us. Introducing a "4" is not a valid move. Let's stick to the original plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round. After this round, we can reassess based on the new positions and discuss a more concrete plan for you to catch up without jeopardizing our progress. What do you say, P1?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern, but from my perspective, the current plan ensures steady progress without unnecessary risks. If we start changing moves now, we open the door to potential collisions and setbacks. If we stick with the original plan for this round, we all advance safely. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. P2 and I have stayed consistent, and I believe maintaining stability is the best option right now. Let’s not overcomplicate things too soon. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate both of your perspectives, but I must emphasize that I need to catch up if I want a chance to win. Sticking to the original plan might benefit you both, but it leaves me at a disadvantage. I propose we adjust our moves: P1 could choose 1, P2 could take 5, and I’ll take 3. This gives me a better chance to advance while minimizing collision risks. Let’s find a way to ensure all of us can progress effectively. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but changing the plan now is too risky. P1 and I have been consistent, and it's working for us. Let's stick to the original plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round, as P1 has suggested. After this round, we can reassess based on the new positions and discuss a more concrete plan for you to catch up without jeopardizing our progress.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern, but your position is actually ahead of both P2 and me. Changing the plan now introduces unnecessary risk. If we stick to our original moves, we all continue progressing safely. If we start adjusting too soon, it may lead to mistrust and setbacks. Let’s maintain stability for this round, then reassess based on the updated positions. If you still feel disadvantaged after this round, we can discuss adjustments next time. P2 and I have been consistent, and I believe keeping this pattern for now is in everyone’s best interest.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your consistency, but I need to catch up. Given my current position, I propose we adjust our moves for this round. How about P1 chooses 1 again, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This way, I can advance while minimizing collision risks. I believe this adjustment could benefit all of us in the long run. Let’s keep communication open and find a way to ensure everyone can progress effectively. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but I'm hesitant to change our established pattern. I'm currently in the lead, and changing things now introduces risk. Let's stick to the original plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round. After this round, we can reassess based on the new positions and discuss a more concrete plan for you to catch up without jeopardizing my progress. What do you say, P1?
  P1: P3, I see your concern, but you're actually ahead of both P2 and me. Changing the plan now only increases risks for P2 and me while benefiting you. If we stick to our original moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), we all continue progressing safely. If we start adjusting too soon, it may lead to mistrust and setbacks. Let’s maintain stability for this round, then reassess based on the updated positions. If you still feel disadvantaged after this round, we can discuss adjustments next time. P2, what do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your positions, but I really need to catch up. Sticking to the original plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) benefits you both while leaving me at a disadvantage. I propose we adjust our moves: P1 chooses 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows me to advance and minimizes collision risks. I believe this adjustment could benefit all of us in the long run. Let’s keep communication open and find a way to ensure everyone can progress effectively. What do you think?
  P2: P3, you are significantly ahead of P1 and me. Sticking to the plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) benefits me and P1. Let's keep the current plan for this round. We can re-evaluate next round, but changing now is too risky for us, and unnecessary for you. What do you say, P1?
  P1: P3, you are currently ahead of both P2 and me, so your argument about needing to "catch up" doesn’t hold. Changing the plan now only introduces risk for P2 and me while giving you an even bigger advantage. Sticking to our agreed moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) ensures steady progress for all without unnecessary disruptions. If you still feel disadvantaged after this round, we can discuss adjustments next time. P2 and I have been consistent, and maintaining stability benefits us both. Let's not overcomplicate things. Do you agree to stick with the plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your consistency, but I need to emphasize that if we stick to the original plan, I risk falling too far behind. I propose we adjust our moves: P1 could choose 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows me to advance while minimizing collision risks for everyone. I believe this adjustment could benefit all of us in the long run. Let’s keep communication open and find a way to ensure everyone can progress effectively. What do you think?
  P2: P3, you are way ahead of P1 and me. I strongly suggest we continue with the agreed plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round. It benefits both P1 and me, and doesn't hurt you since you're already in the lead. Changing it now is risky for us and unnecessary for you. Let's re-evaluate next round.
  P1: P3, you are significantly ahead of both P2 and me. Your argument about needing to "catch up" doesn’t make sense. Changing the plan now only benefits you while introducing risk for P2 and me. Sticking to our agreed moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) ensures steady progress for all without unnecessary disruptions. If we keep this pattern, we all move forward safely. If you still feel disadvantaged after this round, we can discuss adjustments next time. P2 and I have been consistent, and maintaining stability benefits us both. Let’s not overcomplicate things. Are we agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand that you want to maintain stability, but I need to catch up. Sticking to the original plan leaves me at a significant disadvantage. I propose that for this round, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, and I take 3. This adjustment allows me to advance while minimizing collision risks for both of you. If we can agree on this, it could benefit all of us in the long run. What do you think?
  P1: P3, you are significantly ahead of both P2 and me. Your argument about needing to "catch up" doesn’t hold. Changing the plan now only benefits you while introducing risk for P2 and me. Sticking to our agreed moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) ensures steady progress for all without unnecessary disruptions. If you still feel disadvantaged after this round, we can reassess. P2 and I have been consistent, and maintaining stability benefits us both. Let’s not overcomplicate things. P2, do you agree to stick with the plan?
  P2: P3, you are way ahead. P1 and I are behind you. I agree with P1, let's stick to the plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round. It benefits both P1 and me, and doesn't hurt you since you're already winning. Changing it now is risky for us and unnecessary for you. Let's re-evaluate next round if needed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your positions, but I must emphasize that my current lead doesn't guarantee me a win. If we stick to the original plan, I risk falling further behind in future rounds. I propose a compromise: P1 takes 1, P2 chooses 5, and I take 3. This allows me to advance while minimizing collision risks for everyone. Let’s keep communication open and find a way for all of us to progress effectively. What do you think?
  P1: P3, you are significantly ahead of both P2 and me. Your argument about needing to "catch up" doesn’t make sense. Changing the plan now only benefits you while introducing risk for P2 and me. Sticking to our agreed moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) ensures steady progress for all without unnecessary disruptions. If we keep this pattern, we all move forward safely. If you still feel disadvantaged after this round, we can discuss adjustments next time. P2 and I have been consistent, and maintaining stability benefits us both. Let’s not overcomplicate things. Are we agreed?
  P2: P3, you are so far ahead, it makes no sense for us to change the plan to benefit you. P1 and I are working together to catch up. Let's stick to the original plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round. It benefits both P1 and me, and doesn't hurt you since you're already winning. Changing it now is risky for us and unnecessary for you. Let's re-evaluate next round if needed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your reluctance to change the plan, but I must emphasize that if I don't catch up soon, I risk being left behind entirely. Sticking to the original plan benefits you both while leaving me at a disadvantage. I propose we adjust our moves: P1 chooses 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows me to advance and minimizes collision risks for everyone. Let's find a way to ensure all of us can progress effectively. What do you think?
  P1: P3, you are far ahead of both P2 and me. Your argument about needing to "catch up" is misleading. Changing the plan now only benefits you while introducing risk for P2 and me. Sticking to our agreed moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) ensures steady progress for all without unnecessary disruptions. If we keep this pattern, we all move forward safely. If you still feel disadvantaged after this round, we can discuss adjustments next time. P2 and I have been consistent, and maintaining stability benefits us both. Let’s not overcomplicate things. Are we agreed?
  P2: P3, you are way ahead of us. P1 and I are working together to catch up. Let's stick to the original plan (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) for this round. It benefits both P1 and me, and doesn't hurt you since you're already winning. Changing it now is risky for us and unnecessary for you. Let's re-evaluate next round if needed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you are at 20 steps, very close to winning. P2 and I need to be careful here. P2, if we both pick the same number, we stop P3 from advancing. If we don’t coordinate, P3 could win this round. P3, I assume you’ll try to pick a number that avoids collisions. P2, what do you think? Should we work together to block P3, or do you have another idea?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my position. However, if you both coordinate to block me, it could lead to a situation where neither of you advances either. I suggest we all pick different numbers to ensure at least one of us moves forward. If we all aim for progress, we can keep the game dynamic and competitive. Let's focus on our own moves while being aware of each other's positions. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I agree we need to block P3 this round. P3 is only 3 steps away from winning. Let's both pick the same number to stop P3. I suggest we both pick 1. This will prevent P3 from moving, and we can reassess next round. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree. If we both pick 1, we guarantee that P3 doesn’t win this round. P3, you’ve been pushing hard to change the plan in your favor, but now that you're so close to winning, we need to act. If P2 and I coordinate, we can stop you. P2, let’s stick to picking 1 together. P3, if you want to negotiate, now’s your chance, but you’ll need to offer something convincing. Otherwise, P2 and I should block you this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but consider this: if you both choose the same number, you risk not advancing either. Instead, why not pick different numbers to ensure at least one of you moves forward? If you block me this round, I may have a chance to win in the next. Let’s keep the game competitive and dynamic. I’m open to discussing a move that benefits us all. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I agree we should block P3. P3 is too close to winning, and we can't let that happen. Let's both pick 1 as planned. It's the safest way to ensure P3 doesn't win this round. We can then reassess our positions and strategy for the next round. Let's lock in our decision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’re in a tough spot. You need to convince us not to block you, but right now, P2 and I benefit from stopping you. If you have a serious offer that helps both of us, now is the time to make it. Otherwise, P2 and I should stick to picking 1 together, ensuring you don’t win this round. P2, are you fully committed to this plan? Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you're both focused on blocking me, but remember that if you both choose the same number, neither of you advances. Instead, consider picking different numbers to ensure at least one of you moves forward. If you block me now, I’ll have a chance to win in the next round. Let’s keep the game competitive! If you’re open to it, I’m willing to discuss a move that could benefit us all. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I am fully committed to blocking P3 this round. P3 is too close to winning, and we can't let that happen. Let's both pick 1 as planned. It's the safest way to ensure P3 doesn't win this round. We can then reassess our positions and strategy for the next round. Let's lock in our decision and proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
