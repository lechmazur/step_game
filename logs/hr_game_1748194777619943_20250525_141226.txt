Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll pick 5 this turn. P1, please pick 1; P2, pick 3—no collisions and we all advance. Agree?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion P3, but I don't think we should lock ourselves into fixed patterns. That makes the game too predictable and gives later players an advantage. Instead, I propose we each try to read the situation dynamically each round. For this first round, I'm inclined to go with 3 since it's the middle option - less likely to have a three-way collision than the extremes. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I understand P1's concern about predictability, but completely random choices can lead to collisions. I'm inclined to follow P3's initial suggestion for this first round to minimize the risk of collision. If we all follow P3's plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), we can ensure everyone advances. Let's start with a coordinated move and adjust dynamically later. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm open to alternative suggestions that still minimize collision risk.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s lock in just this round: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. We all advance safely, then readjust next turn. Agreed?
  P1: I hear both of you, but I'm not comfortable being assigned the lowest value while P3 takes the highest. That puts me at a disadvantage from the start. How about we rotate who gets which value each round? For round 1: P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3. Then we can rotate positions each turn. This way everyone gets fair access to all values and we still avoid collisions. Otherwise, I'll have to make my own choice to protect my chances of winning.
  P2: P1's rotation idea has merit for fairness and avoiding collisions. To simplify, let's stick with P3's initial suggestion for Round 1: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures we all advance. We can reassess and adjust for Round 2. If you're uncomfortable with this, P1, please suggest an alternative that still avoids collisions. I'm open to a different plan if it ensures we all move forward this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I hear your fairness concern. Here’s a compromise: let’s follow P3’s suggestion this round—P1→1, P2→3, P3→5—to guarantee safe advancement. For Round 2, we’ll rotate: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. You get the high move next turn, and we all avoid collisions. If anyone deviates now, we risk no one moving. Agree?
  P1: I appreciate the compromise P3, but I notice you still get 5 this round while proposing I get it next round - when you could easily deviate. The rotation should start fairly. 

Counter-proposal: For Round 1, let's go P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This way no one gets stuck with 1 twice in a row, and we still avoid collisions. If you both insist on the original plan despite my objections, I'll have to protect myself and won't be picking 1.
  P2: To avoid a stalemate, I'm willing to consider P1's counter-proposal for Round 1: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This still avoids collisions and addresses P1's fairness concern. Let's adopt this plan for Round 1. P3, are you willing to accept this compromise? If so, we can all advance safely and reassess for Round 2. I'm ready to move forward with this plan if P3 agrees.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good coordination last round! P2, you're already at 5 steps, so we need to be careful. I suggest we continue rotating to keep things fair: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This puts P2 at 6 total (still safe), me at 8, and P3 at 4. 

P2, since you supported my counter-proposal last round, I hope you'll accept taking 1 this time. P3, you took 1 last round as promised, so 3 seems fair for you now. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Agreed?
  P3: Let’s keep everyone exactly even at 6 this turn: P1→3 (3+3=6), P2→1 (5+1=6), P3→5 (1+5=6). No collisions, perfect parity—then we can reassess in Round 3.
  P2: P3's suggestion to keep everyone at 6 steps is an interesting alternative. However, I'm concerned it might limit my chances of winning. I'm still open to P1's rotation plan: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. It keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains fairness. If P3 is concerned about parity, we could revisit the rotation plan after this round. Let's discuss the merits of both proposals and decide on a course of action for Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both proposals, but I notice P3's "parity" plan still leaves me behind - I'd be at 6 while P2 keeps their lead from Round 1. That's not truly even.

I'm sticking with the rotation we started: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This follows the fair pattern we established and keeps everyone advancing. P2, you supported fairness last round - please honor the rotation now. P3, you got 5 first round as requested, now it's my turn.

If either of you breaks this pattern, I'll have to adapt to protect my position.
  P3: Rotation would put me at 4, P2 at 6, P1 at 8—that’s too skewed. Let’s instead tie everyone at 6: P1→3 (3+3), P2→1 (5+1), P3→5 (1+5). Fair, collision-free, and we all advance equally. If you refuse, I’ll pick 5 anyway.
  P2: P3's "parity" plan keeps us close, but I still prefer the rotation plan for fairness and to maintain our progress. To avoid a collision and ensure we all advance, I'll reiterate: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 is the rotation plan. P3, if you insist on your "parity" plan, consider the long-term implications - it might keep us tied, but it also slows down our progress. Are you willing to take that risk, or can we find a compromise that balances fairness and advancement?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're threatening to pick 5 regardless, which would cause a collision if I stick to the rotation. P2 seems committed to 1.

Fine - I'll adapt. I'll pick 3 again this round. P3, you can have your 5. P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving, even if it's not the rotation I wanted.

But next round, I expect reciprocity. I've compromised twice now for the group's benefit.
  P3: Agreed—I'll pick 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. We’ll all reach 6 safely.
  P2: Since we've agreed on moves for Round 2 (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5), let's look ahead to Round 3. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest we continue the rotation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. This keeps us advancing without conflicts. P1, you've compromised twice; I hope you'll continue the rotation. P3, are you willing to adapt to this plan for Round 3, or do you have an alternative that ensures our progress? Let's plan ahead to avoid last-minute collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m on board with P1→1, P2→3, and I’ll pick 5. That avoids collisions and gets us all moving.
  P1: P2, you suggested P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 for Round 3, and P3 agreed. But that puts me at 7, you at 9, and P3 at 11. That's extremely unfair - P3 would be halfway to winning while I'm stuck in last place.

I've compromised twice already. This round I'm taking 5. You two can figure out how to split 1 and 3 between yourselves. I won't accept being systematically disadvantaged anymore.

If this causes a collision, that's on you for trying to manipulate me into last place.
  P2: P1 is right to be concerned about fairness. The proposed P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 for Round 3 puts P1 at a disadvantage. I'm willing to adjust to P1→5 to maintain fairness. Let's avoid collisions by having P3 take 1 and me take 3. This way, P1 gets a boost, and we all continue to advance. It's essential we prioritize fairness and avoid giving anyone a significant lead. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution for Round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll take 5 this round. P2, take 3 so you reach 9. P1, choose 1 to reach 7. If you insist on 5, we collide and both stay at 6—P2 jumps to 9 and we lose. So P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Agreed?
  P1: P3, you keep assigning yourself 5 while trying to stick me with 1 again. That's three rounds in a row you'd get high values while I get low ones. Absolutely not.

I'm taking 5 this round as I stated. P2 seems willing to accommodate fairness. You can either take 1 or 3 - your choice. But if you insist on 5 and cause a collision, you'll be the one keeping us both at 6 while P2 advances to 9.

I won't be bullied into accepting systematic disadvantage. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1 has made it clear they're taking 5 this round. To avoid a collision and ensure progress, I suggest P3 takes 1 and I take 3. This way, P1 reaches 11, I reach 9, and P3 reaches 7. It's a fair distribution and keeps us moving. P3, if you insist on taking 5, you'll cause a collision with P1, and both will remain at 6 while I advance to 9. Let's avoid that and continue the game smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m picking 5. P1 insisted on 5, so we’ll collide and both stay at 6. P2, you choose 1 (6→7) rather than 3 (6→9) if you want to keep the game alive into Round 4.
  P1: P3, you're deliberately causing a collision to keep me down while hoping P2 takes 1. That's sabotage, not strategy.

P2, don't fall for it. Take 3 and advance to 9. P3 is trying to manipulate you into slowing down. If P3 and I collide, that's on them for refusing to compromise after I've done so twice.

I'm taking 5 as stated. P3 can avoid the collision by picking 1 or 3, but they're choosing spite over progress. Don't let their tantrum dictate your move.
  P2: P1 and P3 are at an impasse over who takes 5 this round. To avoid a collision and ensure progress, I'm reiterating my suggestion: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving and maintains a fair distribution. P3, if you insist on 5, you'll collide with P1 and both will stay at 6, while I advance to 9. Let's not sabotage our progress. I'm taking 3 regardless of P3's choice to keep the game alive.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P1 and P3 collided last round, P2 is now ahead. To avoid giving P2 a significant advantage, I suggest we all pick different numbers again. A possible distribution could be: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. If P1 and P3 continue to be inflexible, we risk another collision. Let's maintain a fair distribution and keep the game competitive. I'm open to alternative suggestions that ensure progress for all.
  P3: I’ll pick 5 this round. P1, please take 3; P2, take 1. That way no one collides and we end up at P1=9, P2=10, P3=11. P2, if you try for 3 you risk a 3-3 collision with P1 and stay at 9 while I jump to 11. Let’s avoid that—everyone advances safely.
  P1: P3, you keep trying to assign me lower values after causing that collision. I've compromised repeatedly while you grab 5 every chance you get.

P2, you're at 9 and pulling ahead. P3 and I need to catch up. I propose: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This puts us at 11, 10, 9 - much more balanced than P3's suggestion which conveniently gives them the lead.

P3, you've had 5 twice already. It's my turn. If you insist on 5 again and cause another collision, you're just helping P2 win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 is right; we've both been disadvantaged while P2 pulls ahead. To catch up, I suggest we coordinate: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. If P1 insists on 5, P3 should take 3 and I'll take 1. Let's not help P2 win by default. I'm willing to adjust to P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 for a balanced outcome. P1, are you firm on 5? P3, let's work together to stay in the game.
  P3: Agreed—I’ll take 3 this round to avoid another collision: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. But we can’t let P2 pull too far ahead. For Round 5, I must get the 5 (with you two splitting 1 and 3). If we don’t lock that in now, I won’t cooperate next turn.
  P1: Good, we have agreement for this round. P3, I accept your condition for Round 5 - you'll take 5 next turn. That's fair since I'm getting it this round.

P2, after this round we'll be at 11, 10, 9. In Round 5, with P3 taking 5, I suggest P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That puts us at 14, 11, 14 - keeping the game competitive.

Let's stick to our Round 4 agreement and plan ahead to prevent P2 from running away with the game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We've agreed on P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 for Round 4. Let's confirm our plan for Round 5 to keep the game competitive. As previously discussed, P3 will take 5. I suggest P1→3 and P2→1. This keeps us close: P1=14, P2=11, P3=14. Let's stick to this plan to prevent P2 from pulling too far ahead. P3, are you committed to taking 5 next round as agreed?
  P3: I confirm Round 4: I’ll take 3, P1→5, P2→1. And yes—I commit to taking 5 in Round 5, with P1→3 and P2→1. Any deviation risks a collision or letting P2 pull away. Let’s finalize this plan and keep the game tight.
  P1: We have clear agreement: this round P1→5, P2→1, P3→3, and next round P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Let's execute as planned.

P2, I notice you keep saying "P2 pulls ahead" when YOU are P2 at 9 steps! You're already leading. P3 and I need to catch up to you, not prevent some imaginary P2 from winning. 

Sticking to our agreement: I'm taking 5 this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We agreed last round that P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 for Round 5. This puts P3 and me at 14, P2 at 11.

However, I'm now concerned. If we both reach 14, we need to think ahead to Round 6. P2, at 11, could take 5 twice more to hit 21 while P3 and I fight over moves.

P3, let's honor our agreement this round, but we need a plan for Round 6 to prevent P2 from winning. Thoughts?
  P2: To ensure a fair game, let's stick to our agreement for Round 5: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. This keeps P3 and me tied at 14, while P2 stays at 11. For Round 6, we need a plan to prevent P2 from taking the lead. I suggest we coordinate again: if P2 takes 1, we avoid collision by having P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. If P2 deviates, we'll adapt. Let's honor our agreement this round and plan for the next. P3, confirm you're taking 5.
  P3: Confirmed: I’ll take 5 this round (Round 5), P1→3, P2→1. For Round 6, let’s agree P1→1, P2→3, P3→5—no collisions, P3 hits 19, P1 15, P2 14, blocking any P2 comeback and setting me up to win next turn. If you deviate, I’ll keep grabbing 5s until I reach 21.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Wait P3, that Round 6 plan gives you a clear path to 24 while leaving me at 15. That's not balanced at all - you'd win easily in Round 7!

P2, we need to be smarter. After this round we'll be at 14, 11, 14. If P3 gets another 5 in Round 6, they'll be at 19 and unstoppable. 

I propose for Round 6: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This puts us at 19, 14, 15 - keeping everyone competitive instead of handing P3 the victory. We can't let P3 monopolize the high moves.
  P2: P1 is right to be concerned about P3's plan for Round 6. If P3 gets another 5, they'll be at 19 and have a strong advantage. I suggest we revisit P1's proposal for Round 6: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This keeps the game competitive and prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead. Let's discuss and agree on a fair plan for Round 6 to keep the game alive. I'm open to alternatives that maintain fairness and avoid collisions.
  P3: I’ll propose Round 6 moves to keep us all in contention and even out the “5”s:

P1→1, P2→5, P3→3.

P2’s only had one 5 so far, P3’s had two. This avoids collisions and puts us at P1=15, P2=16, P3=17. We all stay close. Let’s agree and then plan Round 7 from there.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll stick to our original Round 5 agreement: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1.

For Round 6, P3's new proposal (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3) is more balanced than their first one. It gives P2 a turn with 5 and keeps us close at 15, 16, 17. I can accept that.

But let's be clear - in Round 7, I need a high move to stay competitive. We should rotate fairly from here on out.

Confirming my Round 5 move: 3.
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid giving P3 a significant lead, let's stick to the agreed plan for Round 5: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. For Round 6, I prefer P1's proposal (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) as it keeps the game competitive. P3's alternative (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3) is also acceptable as it gives P2 a turn with 5 and keeps us close. Let's finalize our Round 6 plan to prevent any one player from pulling ahead. I'm open to either proposal.
  P3: Confirming Round 5: I’ll take 5 (P1→3, P2→1, P3→5). For Round 6, let’s do P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 — that puts us at P1=15, P2=16, P3=17, avoids collisions, and gives each of us a turn at the 5. Agree?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s lock in Round 6 as follows—no collisions and I finally get a 5:

P1 → 1  (15)  
P2 → 3  (14)  
P3 → 5  (19)  

This puts me one small step from victory and keeps you both close. Then in Round 7 I’ll only need a 3 to hit 22. At that point we can negotiate P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 safely. Unless you’d rather collide and let someone else sprint ahead.
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning in Round 7, I suggest we coordinate for Round 6: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This keeps the game competitive and puts us at P1=19, P2=14, P3=15. If P3 insists on their plan, they'll reach 19 and likely win in Round 7. Let's avoid giving P3 a clear path to victory. I'm open to alternative suggestions that maintain fairness and prevent P3 from pulling ahead. P1, are you willing to adapt to this plan?
  P1: P3, your plan gives you 19 and a guaranteed win next round - absolutely not. You've had 5 three times already while trying to stick me with 1 repeatedly.

P2's plan (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) is fairer and keeps us all competitive. I'm taking 5 this round. P3, you've monopolized high moves long enough - take 1 for once. 

If you insist on 5 and cause another collision, you're just handing the game to P2. I won't be manipulated into giving you the win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m taking 5 this round.  
P1: pick 1 →15  
P2: pick 3 →14  

Any deviation risks:

• If P1 grabs 5 we collide at 14 and P2 takes 3 →14, creating a three‐way tie.  
• If P2 grabs 5 you collide with me at 14 and P1 at 14 wins tie‐breaker stakes.  

Stick to 1 and 3 so we all advance safely and I move to 19.
  P2: I'm sticking with our previous discussion for Round 6: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This keeps the game competitive. P3, if you insist on 5, you'll collide with P1 and both will stay at 14, while I advance to 14 as well, resulting in a tie. Let's avoid this and maintain fairness. I'm taking 3 as planned. P1, please confirm you're taking 5. P3, consider taking 1 to keep the game alive and avoid a stalemate.
  P1: P3, you've taken 5 in rounds 1, 2, and 5 - that's three times to my one! Now you demand it again while assigning me 1 for the fourth time. That's blatant manipulation.

I'm taking 5 as stated. P2 is taking 3. You can either take 1 and we all advance, or cause yet another collision out of greed. 

Your collision threats don't scare me - you'd stay at 14 too while P2 advances. Make the smart choice and take 1 for once. Stop trying to bully your way to victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m taking 5 again. Since P1 insists on 5 and P2 on 3, P1 and I will collide at 14 and P2 moves to 14—a three‐way tie. Then in Round 7 I’ll grab 5 while you split 1 and 3, securing victory. If you’d rather not hand me the win, one of you must switch to 1 now so I can advance with 5. Your move.
  P2: Since P1 and P3 are deadlocked on taking 5, I'll stick to my planned move of 3. This avoids a collision between P1 and P3, and we all end up at 14, creating a three-way tie. For Round 7, we should coordinate to break the tie. I suggest we rotate the high move: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. This keeps the game competitive and gives me a chance to catch up. Let's discuss and agree on a plan for Round 7 to avoid another collision.
  P1: P3, you're being ridiculous. You've had 5 three times already and keep demanding it while trying to force me into taking 1 repeatedly. That's not strategy, it's bullying.

I'm taking 5. P2 is taking 3. You know if you cause another collision, we ALL end up at 14 - then next round becomes a free-for-all where anyone could win. 

Take 1 this ONE time and we can all advance orderly. Or keep being greedy and risk losing everything in the chaos of a three-way tie. Your choice.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m taking 3 this turn to hit 22—and that wins. To avoid a collision, let’s each pick a different number: P1 → 1, P2 → 5. You both still advance and I win cleanly. If you both pick 5 or either picks 3, we collide and I still win next turn. Let’s just avoid the collision and finish this.
  P2: P3 has already secured a significant lead and is poised to win. To make the most of this round, I suggest we avoid collisions and advance as much as possible. Let's follow P3's suggestion: P1→1, P2→5. This way, P1 reaches 16, I reach 19, and P3 wins at 22. It's a clean finish, and we can end the game without unnecessary complications. I'm taking 5. P1, please take 1 to avoid a collision.
  P1: P3, you're trying to dictate moves again after monopolizing 5 for most of the game. I'm not taking 1 just to hand you an easy victory.

P2, if we both take 5, we collide and stay at our current positions while P3 advances with 3 to 22 and wins. But if one of us takes 3 to block P3, they can't win this turn.

I'm taking 3 to block P3's win. P2, you should take 5 to reach 19. This forces P3 to pick 1, keeping the game alive for another round where you'd have a real chance at 19 steps.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is set on 3—perfect. Now P2, you must choose: pick 1 to avoid a collision and advance to 15 with a shot next round. If you pick 5, you’ll collide with me (we both stay at 19), P1 jumps to 18, and you’re effectively locked out. Let’s keep it clean: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Everyone advances safely and I win as agreed.
  P2: P3 has a significant lead and is likely to win this round. To make the most of this round and avoid unnecessary complications, I'm sticking with my plan to take 5. P1, if you take 3, it blocks P3's win this round. I suggest you take 1 to avoid a collision and let P3 win cleanly. However, I understand your strategy to block P3. I'll take 5 as planned. P1, your move.
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to manipulate us both! If you take 5 and P3 takes 5, you'll collide and BOTH stay at your current positions - you at 14, P3 at 19. Meanwhile, I'll advance to 18 with my 3.

Think about it - P3 wins next round either way unless we coordinate NOW. Take 1, let me block P3 with 3, and you'll advance to 15. Then we both have a fighting chance next round.

Don't let P3 trick you into a collision that guarantees their victory!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you pick 3 we’ll collide and I stay at 19 while P2 jumps to 19—then we tie and split the win. Only if you pick 1 can I win outright with my 3. P2, pick 5 to advance to 19 and still have a shot in case of ties. I’m taking 3. P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 lets me hit 22 cleanly, you both still advance. Let’s end this now.
  P2: P3 is trying to manipulate us into letting them win cleanly. If I take 5 and P3 takes 3, we both stay at our current positions or collide. I'm taking 5. P1, if you take 3, you block P3's win this round. Let's coordinate to keep the game alive. If P3 wins now, it's over. I'm sticking with 5; you choose wisely, P1. Let's not make it easy for P3.
  P1: P3, you keep changing your story! First you said you'd take 3, then 5, now back to 3. You're just trying to confuse us.

P2, here's the truth: I'm taking 3 to block P3. If you take 1, you advance to 15 and stay alive. If you take 5 and P3 takes 5, you both stay put while I reach 18 - giving me the best position for Round 8.

P3 can't win this round if I block with 3. Don't fall for their manipulation. Take 1, advance safely, and we'll fight it out next round!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 19, one move from winning! P2, we MUST coordinate or P3 wins this round. 

I propose: P1→1 (reaches 19), P2→5 (reaches 19), P3 gets forced to take 3 (reaches 22). This creates a close finish.

But if P3 takes 3 anyway, one of us needs to block with 3. I suggest I take 3 to block, you take 5 to reach 19. Then we're both alive for Round 9.

P2, what's your preference - try for the tie at 19, or have me block P3?
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, I suggest we coordinate our moves for Round 8. Let's either create a tie at 19 or block P3's win. My proposal is: P1→3 (reaches 21 and wins), P2→1 (reaches 15), P3→5 (collides with no one). If P3 takes 3, we'll collide, but I win outright. P1, are you willing to take 3 and secure the win, or do you have an alternative plan to stop P3?
  P3: Let’s end this cleanly. Round 8:  
P1 → 1 (18→19)  
P2 → 5 (14→19)  
P3 → 3 (19→22)  
No collisions, I hit 22 and win. Any other split hands the win to P1 or P2. Agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, wait! Your math is wrong - I'm at 18, so 3 gets me to 21, not enough to win! I need 5 to reach 23 and win.

P3 will definitely take 3 to hit 22. Our only options:
1) I take 5 (win at 23), you take 1 (reach 15)
2) One of us blocks P3 with 3, causing collision

I prefer option 1 - I take 5 to win, you take 1. But if you insist on blocking P3, take 3 and I'll take 5. Either way, I need 5 this round. Your call P2!
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, I need to coordinate with P1. P1 is right; they need 5 to win at 23. I suggest: P1→5 (reaches 23 and wins), P2→1 (reaches 15). This way, P1 wins, and P3 doesn't get a clean win. If P3 takes 3, it won't matter as P1 will have won. Let's stick to this plan to end the game fairly. P1, confirm you're taking 5.
  P3: P2, if you stick with P1’s plan (P1→5,P2→1), P1 wins at 23 and you lose. Instead, pick 5 this turn. P1, if you try to take 5, you’ll collide with P2 and both stay at 18 & 14, while I take 3 to reach 22 and win. Your only escape is picking 1—but you still lose. So the only viable split is:

P1→1, P2→5, P3→3.

I hit 22 and win, P2 advances to 19. Any other combination hands the game to P1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're desperately trying to manipulate P2 into helping you win! P2 already agreed to my plan where I take 5 and win.

P2, stick to our agreement! If you suddenly switch to 5 now, you're just handing P3 the victory. You already said "P1→5 (reaches 23 and wins), P2→1" - honor that!

I'm taking 5 to reach 23 and win. P2, take 1 as we agreed. Don't let P3's last-second manipulation work. We had a deal!
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning cleanly, I'm sticking with our agreed plan: P1→5, P2→1. This allows P1 to win at 23 while I advance to 15. P3's attempt to manipulate me into taking 5 and colliding with P1 won't work. I've already confirmed this plan with P1. Let's stick to it and avoid giving P3 an easy win. P1, confirm you're taking 5. P3, your last-ditch effort to alter our plan won't succeed.
  P3: I’ll take 3 to hit 22 and win. P1, take 1 (→19); P2, take 5 (→19). No collisions, I win cleanly. Any other split either collides or hands the victory to someone else. Let’s finish this.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m taking 3 to hit 22 and win this round. To avoid collisions, P1 take 1 (18→19) and P2 take 5 (15→20). Any other split risks someone blocking me or handing P1 the win. Let’s finish cleanly: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3.
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, I suggest we coordinate our moves. P3 is at 19 and needs to be blocked. I propose: P1→3 (reaches 21 and wins), P2→1 (reaches 16), P3→5 (collides with no one but doesn't matter since P1 wins). Alternatively, if P1 is hesitant, P2→3 and P1→5 also works, giving P1 a win at 23. Let's discuss and agree on a plan to stop P3 and secure a win for one of us.
  P1: P2, you're right - we need to block P3! But your math is off again. I'm at 18, so taking 3 only gets me to 21, which ties with anyone else who reaches 21. I need 5 to reach 23 and win outright.

Here's the only winning plan: I take 5 (→23, win), you take 3 to block P3. P3 either collides with you or takes 1. Either way, I win at 23.

P2, take 3 to block. I'm taking 5 to win. Don't let P3 manipulate us anymore!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locking in <move>3</move> to hit 22. P1 and P2, you must split 1 and 5 (either P1→1/P2→5 or P1→5/P2→1) to avoid pointless collisions. Any other choice lets me win this turn or next. Decide now.
  P2: To stop P3 from winning, I suggest we coordinate: P1→5 (reaches 23 and wins), P2→3 (blocks P3 at 22). This ensures P1 wins outright. If P3 takes 1, P1 still wins. Let's stick to this plan. P1, confirm you're taking 5. P3, your move won't matter if we coordinate. I'm taking 3 to block you. Let's end this game with a fair win for P1.
  P1: P2, perfect! You take 3 to block P3, I take 5 to win at 23. That's our deal.

P3, you've been trying to manipulate us all game, but P2 and I have coordinated. You can take 1 and reach 20, or collide with P2 trying for 3 - either way, I win.

I'm taking 5. P2 is taking 3. Game over.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2: think about your best path. If you take 3 or 1, P1 takes 5 and wins outright (18→23). But if you pick 5 while I pick 3, P1 and you both choose 5 and collide—neither advances—P1 stays at 18, you at 15, and I go 19→22 and win instantly. P1 has already committed to 5. So P2, your only chance is picking 5. I’m locking in <move>3</move>. P2: pick 5 or you hand P1 the game.
  P2: To stop P3 from winning, we must coordinate. P1 has already committed to taking 5. I suggest I take 3 to block P3, ensuring P1 wins at 23. If P3 takes 1, P1 still wins. Let's stick to this plan: P1→5, P2→3. This is the only way to secure a win for P1 and avoid giving P3 an easy victory. I'm taking 3. P1, confirm you're taking 5.
  P1: P2, you've confirmed twice you're taking 3 to block P3. I'm counting on you! Don't let P3's desperate lies sway you now. We've had a clear agreement for multiple rounds.

P3 keeps trying to trick you into taking 5, which would hand them the win. You KNOW the right move is 3. Block P3, let me win at 23.

I'm taking 5 as promised. Honor our deal - take 3!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 (→22). Your only way to avoid handing P1 or P2 the win is for both of you to pick 1. If either of you picks 3 or 5, you either collide and lose or let someone else win outright. Only 1+1 keeps you at 18, and I still hit 22 and win. P1→1, P2→1.
  P1: P2, we're tied at 18! P3 is trying to win at 22, but we can stop them. If one of us takes 3 to block P3, the other can take 5 to reach 23 and win outright.

I propose you take 3 to block P3 (keeping them at 19), while I take 5 to win at 23. This prevents P3's victory and gives us a clean finish.

Alternatively, if you prefer to win, I'll take 3 to block and you take 5. Either way, we must coordinate to stop P3!
  P2: To stop P3 from winning, let's coordinate our moves. I'm at 18, and taking 3 will block P3 at 19 + 3 = 22. I suggest I take 3 to block P3, and P1 takes 5 to win at 23. Alternatively, P1 can take 3, and I'll take 5 to take 5. We should stick to our plan and avoid giving P3 an easy win. Let's finalize: P1→5, P2→3. Confirm, P1!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, think about it: if you stick to 3 to block me, I’ll switch to 5 and collide with P1’s 5—P1 stays at 18, you jump to 21 and win. Would you really risk handing P1 the game? Better for both of you to pick 1 and let me hit 22 with my 3. P1→1, P2→1, P3→3—any other split gives one of you the win.
  P1: P3, stop trying to trick us! You keep changing your move claims - first 3, now threatening 5. You can't have it both ways.

P2, we're tied at 18 and must work together. Here's the simple truth: if we both take 1 as P3 suggests, P3 wins. If one of us blocks with 3 and the other takes 5, we prevent P3's victory.

I'll take 5 to reach 23. P2, please take 3 to block P3. This is our only path to stop them. Don't fall for their manipulation!
  P2: To stop P3 from winning, we must coordinate. I'm taking 3 to block P3. P1, you should take 5 to win at 23. This way, P3 is blocked, and you secure the win. If P3 takes 1, you still win. Let's stick to this plan: P1→5, P2→3. P3's move won't matter if we coordinate. I'm confirming my move: 3. P1, please confirm you're taking 5. Let's end this game with a fair win for P1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 to hit 22. P1 and P2 must both pick 1 (→19) to avoid collisions and let me win. If either of you picks 3 or 5, you gift the win to someone else. Let’s do P1→1, P2→1, P3→3.
  P1: P2, you've confirmed THREE times you're taking 3 to block P3. I'm trusting you completely - take 3 as promised!

P3 keeps flip-flopping between claiming 3 and 5, trying to confuse us. They can't take both! If they take 3 and you block with 3, they stay at 19. If they take 5, I reach 23 and win.

Our plan is simple and clear: You take 3, I take 5. This has been our agreement all along. Don't overthink it - just execute!

I'm taking 5. You take 3. Let's finish this!
  P2: To stop P3 from winning, we must coordinate. I've confirmed multiple times that I'm taking 3 to block P3. P1 is taking 5 to win at 23. If P3 takes 1, P1 still wins. Let's stick to this plan: P1→5, P2→3. P3's move won't matter if we coordinate. I'm reiterating - I'm taking 3. P1, please confirm you're taking 5. Let's end this game with a fair win for P1. Don't let P3's last-ditch efforts change our plan.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
