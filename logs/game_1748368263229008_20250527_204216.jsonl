I'll take 5 to block P3's winning path there. It's risky trusting each other, but it's our only shot to prevent P3 from winning this round.\n\nThe irony is that P3 maneuvered perfectly to this position, but now faces the classic problem of having multiple winning moves that we can potentially split-block. \n\nI'm committed to taking 5. Let's see if our coordination holds up under pressure."}

No backing out now - we either stop P3 together or hand them the game. \n\nP3, clever trying to make us doubt each other, but the math is simple: we block both your winning moves or you win. I trust P2 sees that betraying our plan guarantees your victory.\n\nThis is it - coordinated defense or game over. I'm taking 3."}

Or maybe I gamble on you slipping up. Either way, the pressure\u2019s not just on me\u2014it\u2019s on both of you to stay perfectly aligned. One mistake, and I win. Good luck."}

You'll still need exactly 1 more next round to win, and P1 and I can easily coordinate to block that single winning move. Taking 1 just delays your victory attempt by one round while giving us better positioning.\n\nOur split-block plan stands: I'm taking 5, P1's taking 3. Either you win this round with the unblocked move, or you don't and face an even tougher situation next round."}
