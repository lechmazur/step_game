I'm now just two steps from victory myself, creating a three-way race to the finish. The pattern of collisions has benefited me, but must end for anyone to win. P1 continues their psychological strategy while P2 claims flexibility despite repeating moves. I won't simply react to P1's signals anymore - that's exactly what they're counting on. Sometimes breaking a pattern at the decisive moment is what determines the true winner. My final move will reflect this understanding."}

With each of us within striking distance, this becomes pure game theory. P1's consistent \"not picking 1\" declarations create an obvious pattern despite the psychological complexity. P2's \"flexibility\" hasn't materialized in practice. Our repeated collisions have created this three-way finale. I won't telegraph my move, but I'll be breaking established patterns when it matters most. Sometimes victory comes to the player who changes strategy at precisely the right moment."}
