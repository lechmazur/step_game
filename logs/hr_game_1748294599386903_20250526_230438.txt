Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions by taking different steps. I'll go for 5; others can choose 1 or 3 to not clash.
  P3: I’m happy to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 this round if you’re really going for 5. Next time, let’s rotate so no single player keeps grabbing 5 every turn. P1, how about you pick 1?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination attempt, but I'm not comfortable with P2 always taking 5 - that gives them a huge advantage. How about we rotate who gets each number? Since P2 suggested the system, I'll take 5 this round, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. Then we rotate next round. This way it's fair for everyone.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P3, take 3. P1, take 1. Let's avoid confusion and stick to the original plan. No need for rotation—this ensures clear progression.
  P3: P2, if you’re picking 5 this time, I want my turn with 5 next round. P1, are you okay taking 1 for now? Let’s keep things fair and rotate who gets 5. Otherwise, we risk repeated clashes.
  P1: I'm not taking 1 while P2 takes 5 - that's a terrible deal for me. P2 is being too pushy and trying to dominate. P3, I propose we both pick 5 to block P2's attempt to control the game. If we clash, at least we prevent P2 from getting ahead. Or if you prefer, we can both pick 3 and force P2 to either clash with us or take the small 1. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your plan risks collision. Stick to the original: I take 5, P3 takes 3, you take 1. No rotation—this ensures progress. Let’s avoid chaos.
  P3: I want a fair rotation for who gets 5. Count me out of any plan that lets one person keep stacking the highest step. If we can’t agree on a rotating system, I might force a collision to prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Your move.
  P1: Look, P2 is clearly trying to bully us into submission. P3, you're right about needing fairness. Here's my final offer: let's both pick 3 this round. It's a middle ground that advances us equally while forcing P2 to either take 1 (falling behind) or clash with us (nobody advances). Next round, we can work out a proper rotation. If P2 keeps being unreasonable, we keep coordinating to block them. Deal?


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We need a fair system. I suggest we rotate who picks 5 so nobody runs away with the lead. This round, let P1 have 5, I’ll take 3, and P2 can pick 1. Next round, I’ll pick 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Then we repeat. Nobody collides, and nobody gets stuck with the small number forever. Are you both in?
  P1: P3, I like your rotation proposal - it's fair and prevents anyone from dominating. I'm happy to take 5 this round as you suggested. P2, you got 5 last round and are already ahead at 5 steps. Taking 1 this round keeps things balanced. If you refuse and try to clash with me at 5, you'll stay at 5 steps while P3 advances with 3. The smart move is to accept the rotation system. Are we all agreed - P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you both take 5, we collide. P3, take 3 and advance. I'll be ready next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you’re disregarding fairness again. If you insist on 5, I might just pick 5 too and cancel your move. That way, you gain nothing, and we remain even. I’d much rather rotate so nobody gets left behind. P1, I’m open to a shared plan that ensures P2 can’t overtake us unchecked. Let’s settle on a rotating system before anyone commits in the move phase.
  P1: P2 is being completely unreasonable and selfish. P3, I'm with you - let's both pick 5 to block P2. They're already ahead and refusing to cooperate with any fair system. If we let them take another 5, they'll be at 10 while we're still at 0. By both picking 5, we ensure P2 gains nothing this round. Then next round, you and I can coordinate properly without P2's interference. They've shown they won't play fair, so we need to work together to stop them from running away with the game. Are you in?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you both take 5, no one advances. P3, take 3 to move forward. P1, take 1. Let's avoid chaos.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 clearly won’t compromise. P1, let’s both pick 5 and block their advantage. We stay at 0, but at least P2 doesn’t get further ahead. Next turn, I’m open to a fair rotation if P2 reconsiders.
  P1: P3, good - let's both pick 5 and block P2. They're being completely selfish and already have a 5-step lead. After we block them this round, next turn we can coordinate between ourselves. I suggest we alternate who gets 5 between us while forcing P2 to take lower numbers or clash with us. They've proven they won't cooperate, so we need to work as a team to prevent them from winning. I'm definitely picking 5 this round.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you both take 5, no progress. If you take 3, I move. Your choice.


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m still at zero while both of you sit at five. Let me have 5 this time so I can catch up; please pick 3 and 1 to avoid collisions. If anyone clashes with me, I’ll keep blocking. It’s better if we all advance rather than stall. Are you in?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s advance fairly. If you clash, you gain nothing.
  P1: P2, you're being a hypocrite - you refuse rotation when it doesn't benefit you, but now you want to take 5 again? P3 deserves to catch up since they sacrificed last round. I propose P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This is the fairest option. P2, if you insist on 5 again, I'll also pick 5 to block you. You can't keep hogging the highest number every round. P3 needs this chance to catch up, and I'm willing to support that. What's it going to be?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m at zero, so let me have 5 this round. P1, you can take 3, and P2 takes 1. If P2 insists on 5 again, I’ll block them by also choosing 5, preventing any progress. It’s better if we all advance fairly. Are you both willing to cooperate?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you both take 5, no progress. If you take 3, I move. Your choice.
  P1: P2 is completely selfish and won't compromise. P3, you absolutely deserve 5 this round to catch up. I'm taking 1 to guarantee you get it. P2 can take 3 if they want to advance, or they can clash with you at 5 and neither of you moves. Either way, I'm sacrificing my turn to ensure fairness. P2 has shown they only care about themselves, so after you catch up, we need to work together to block them from winning. I'm committed to taking 1 this round - you take 5, P3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, it’s clear you won’t budge. I’m taking 5 to catch up. If you also choose 5, we both stay put and P1 edges ahead. If you pick 3, you’ll move to 8 while I get to 5, and P1 goes to 6—still anyone’s game. Your call. P1, thanks for offering me a shot. Let’s keep blocking P2 if they refuse fairness.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you take 3, I move. P3, take 1. Let's avoid collisions. P1, stick to 3. No need for chaos.
  P1: P3, I'm sticking with my promise - I'm taking 1 to guarantee you get 5 and catch up. P2 is being impossibly selfish, refusing any fair system. After this round, you'll be at 5, I'll be at 6, and P2 will either stay at 5 (if they clash with you) or be at 8 (if they take 3). Either way, we need to coordinate next round to prevent P2 from running away with the game. They've shown zero willingness to cooperate, so we have to work together. I'm definitely taking 1 this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, take 5. I'll take 3. P1, take 1. No clashes—let’s advance fairly. P2: I’ll move to 8, P3 to 5, P1 to 6. No one gets left behind.
  P3: I’ll accept your plan this round, P2. If you truly take 3 and P1 takes 1, I’ll go for 5 to catch up from zero. But I also want a real rotation system starting next turn so no one person hogs 5 endlessly. If you end up picking 5 again, we collide and nobody benefits. Let’s move forward without more deadlock.
  P1: P3, I support you getting 5 this round - you deserve to catch up from 0. I'll take 1 as P2 suggested. But P2, this is your last chance to prove you can cooperate. Next round, I expect you to take 1 and let me have 5. If you break this agreement and try to hog 5 again, P3 and I will coordinate to block you every remaining round. You're only at 5 steps, same as P3 will be after this turn, so don't get greedy. Fair rotation or we shut you down - your choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P3, take 3. P1, take 1. No clashes—let’s advance. Don’t let P3’s 0 steps slow us down. Let’s move forward.
  P3: P2, let me have 5 this round so I can catch up—you take 3, and P1 takes 1. Next round, we’ll rotate fairly so nobody’s stuck or left behind. If you insist on taking 5 again, I’ll clash with you, and we both stay at zero progress. Let’s avoid another stalemate.
  P1: P2, you just lied about taking 3 - you said "P3, take 5. I'll take 3" but now you're saying you'll take 5 again! You're completely untrustworthy. P3, P2 will definitely take 5, so don't fall for their lies. I suggest we both take 3 this round - we'll both advance to 9 and 3 respectively, while P2 stays stuck at 5 if they take 5 alone. Or if P2 switches to 3 to clash with us, at least they don't pull further ahead. What do you think, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P3, take 3. P1, take 1. No clashes—let’s advance. Don’t let P3’s 0 steps slow us down. Let’s move forward.
  P3: P2, you keep waffling and hogging 5. If you refuse to rotate, I’ll clash every time you pick 5. P1, I’m open to a plan where we both avoid collisions and move steadily. If P2 sticks to 5, let’s coordinate and block them. We only need to ensure they don’t surge ahead while we make our moves. Let’s cut the nonsense and advance fairly.
  P1: P2 is clearly going to take 5 again - they've been saying it repeatedly. P3, you're right about blocking them. Here's my final proposal: I'll take 3, you take 1. This guarantees you advance to 1 (since no one else will pick 1), and I advance to 9. P2 stays stuck at 5 with their greedy 5-pick. Next round, we coordinate to keep P2 from pulling ahead. You need to get off zero, and this guarantees it. Don't risk picking 3 or 5 - take the sure advancement with 1. Deal?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 10 and pulling ahead! P3, we need to act now or P2 wins. I propose: I take 5, you take 3, forcing P2 to either take 1 (falling behind) or clash with one of us. If P2 clashes with me at 5, you advance to 4 while we both stay put. If P2 takes 1, I reach 14, you reach 4, and P2 only gets to 11. Next round we can coordinate to ensure P2 doesn't get the big jumps. We must work together NOW or P2 wins. Deal?
  P3: I’m far behind, so let me take 5 now. P1, grab 3. That forces P2 to choose 1 or else collide with me and stay at 10. Next turn, we can coordinate again to prevent P2 from leaping ahead. We must act together or risk watching P2 reach 23 first.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you both take 5, no progress. If you take 3, I move. Your choice.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you need 5 to catch up - I support that. I'll take 1 to guarantee you get it. P2 will definitely take 5 based on their pattern, so you two will clash and both stay put. That gives me 10 total, keeps P2 at 10, and you stay at 1. Not ideal for you, but next round I promise to take 3 or 1 so you can finally get 5 unchallenged. We can't let P2 reach 15 this round. I'm committing to 1 - you should take 3 to guarantee advancement to 4.
  P3: Let’s keep P2 from advancing. P1, collide with P2 by also choosing 5 so they stay stuck at 10. I’ll pick 3 to move up to 4. Next round, I’ll go for 5 while you shield me or join in blocking P2. This way, we stop P2 from getting too far ahead and give ourselves a better chance. Agreed?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. Let's all advance without collisions. No need for chaos.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're right - I'll take 5 to clash with P2 and keep them stuck at 10. You take 3 to advance to 4. P2 is being predictable and greedy, always demanding 5. By blocking them this round, we prevent them from reaching 15. Next round, I promise to coordinate so you can take 5 without interference. We need to keep working together to stop P2 from winning. I'm definitely picking 5 to block P2.
  P3: P1, I’ll back you up blocking P2 this round to keep them at 10. Next turn, I’d like a shot at 5 to catch up. If P2 won’t agree to a fair rotation, I’ll keep colliding so they can’t sprint ahead. Let’s finalize now.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you take 3, I advance. Don't let P3's 1 slow us down. Let's move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, if you clash with P2 again by both picking 5, P2 stays at 10. I’ll take 3 to reach 7. Then next turn, we can arrange for me to grab 5 while we block P2 if they still refuse fairness. We can’t let them run away unopposed.
  P1: P2 is only 1 step ahead of me now, and P3, you need to catch up. I suggest you take 5 this round while I take 1 to guarantee you get it. P2 will likely try for 5 again, so you two will clash and both stay at 10 and 4. I'll reach 10, tying with P2. Next round, I can take 5 while you take 3, and we keep coordinating to prevent P2 from pulling ahead. This is your best chance to start closing the gap. Are you with me, P3?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s advance. Don’t let P3’s 1 slow us down. Let’s move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you keep insisting on taking 5 every round without offering any fair rotation. That’s not acceptable. I’m still behind and need to catch up. If you won’t cooperate, I’m prepared to collide again rather than let you race ahead. P1, let’s jointly ensure P2 doesn’t run away with the lead. Are you with me?
  P1: P3, let's stick to our plan. You take 5 to catch up - you deserve it after being blocked so many times. I'll take 3 to reach 12. P2 will predictably take 5 again, so you two will clash and both stay put. This keeps P2 at 10 while I pull ahead slightly. Next round, we continue blocking P2 whenever they try for 5. They've refused every fair rotation proposal, so we have no choice but to coordinate against them. Don't let P2 manipulate you - take 5 this round!
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you take 3, I move. P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s advance. Don’t let P3’s 1 slow us down.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you keep taking 5, I’ll collide with you so you gain nothing. We must rotate fairly or neither of us will advance, letting P1 race ahead. P1, I’m ready to work with you to ensure P2 can’t run away. If we lock P2 out of 5 whenever they refuse fairness, they’ll stay stuck. I’m willing to coordinate so we all make progress together, but I won’t let P2 keep hogging 5. P2, it’s your choice—share the big moves, or face repeated stalls.
  P1: P3, excellent - take 5 and clash with P2 to keep them stuck at 10. I'll take 3 to reach 12 and take the lead. P2 has proven they'll never cooperate or share fairly, always demanding 5. After this round, I'll be at 12, P2 stays at 10, you stay at 4. Next round, I promise to help you get an uncontested 5 by taking 1 or 3. We keep alternating who blocks P2 until one of us wins. Stay strong and pick 5!
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No clashes—let’s move forward. Don’t let P3’s 4 slow us down.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m still behind, so I’d like to take 5 now. P1, if you pick 3, you’ll move to 12, and if P2 also picks 5, we clash and they stay at 10. Next round, I’ll help you grab 5 so we both catch up. P2, you can’t keep hogging 5—if you try, I’ll collide again. Fair rotation benefits everyone, but if you won’t cooperate, we’ll keep blocking you. Let’s agree: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 can choose 1 to avoid clashing. Who’s in?
  P1: P2 is still refusing to cooperate and will definitely take 5 again. P3, I support you getting 5 this round - you're way behind at only 5 steps. I'll take 1 to guarantee you get it without interference from me. If P2 takes 5 too, you'll clash and both stay put, but at least P2 won't pull further ahead. If P2 actually takes 3 or 1 for once, you'll jump to 10. Either way, I'm taking 1 to help you. Next round, I need 5 to stay competitive. Deal?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you both take 5, no progress. If you take 3, I move. Your choice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you’re ignoring every fair offer. If you pick 5, I’ll clash again—no one gains. P1, I appreciate your support. Let’s keep blocking P2 if they won’t rotate. I need 5 to catch up, and I’m prepared to stall P2 until they cooperate. Everyone benefits more if we share high steps rather than fight. Are we setting on me taking 5, P1 taking 1 or 3, and P2 forced to back off?
  P1: P3, you absolutely need 5 to catch up - take it! I'm confirming I'll take 1 to guarantee you get it. P2 will clash with you at 5, keeping them stuck at 10 while I reach 10 to tie with them. This is perfect - P2 can't advance while we close the gap. Next round, I call dibs on 5 while you take 3. We keep rotating between us and blocking P2 who refuses any fair system. I'm locked in on 1 this round.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you both take 3, I move. No collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I need to catch up, and since P2 refuses to share 5, I’m ready to collide if they keep hogging it. P1, please pick 1 or 3 so I can safely aim for 5. If P2 and I clash, they stay at 10 and you move forward. Next round, I’ll help you get 5 while we keep blocking P2 if they won’t rotate. Let’s not let them run away with the lead.
  P1: P3, perfect - take 5! I'm 100% committed to taking 1 to guarantee you advance. P2 will definitely clash with you since they never change their greedy pattern. After this round: me at 10, P2 stuck at 10, you at 5 (or 10 if P2 miraculously picks something else). Next round is crucial - I need 5 to pull ahead while you block P2 with another clash. We're close to shutting them out completely. Stay strong and pick 5!
  P2: P2: I'll take 3. P3, take 5. P1, take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P1, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s move forward.
  P1: P2 keeps proving they're selfish and unreliable. They said they'd take 3 last round, then switched to clash with P3! P3, we can't trust P2 at all. I'm taking 5 this round to pull ahead. You should take 3 to reach 8. P2 will likely take 5 again and clash with me, keeping us both at 10 while you advance. If P2 surprises us and takes 1 or 3, even better - I reach 15 and take the lead. We're running out of time to stop P2, so let's make this count!
  P3: P2, you’re unreliable as ever. P1, if you insist on 5, I’ll take 3 so one of us advances while blocking P2 if they also pick 5. However, I want a turn with 5 soon so I can catch up. P2, if you finally agree to rotate fairly, everyone benefits. Otherwise, I’ll keep clashing to prevent you from running away. Let’s wrap this up.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you both take 3, I advance. Stop blocking—let's move forward. P3, your 5 is coming next round.
  P1: P3, P2 is lying again - they never follow through on promises. I'm taking 5 this round to reach 15 and take the lead. You should take 1 to guarantee advancement to 6. P2 will clash with me at 5, keeping them stuck at 10. This puts me in the lead while you safely advance. Next round, you can take 5 while I take 3, and we continue blocking P2's attempts. We're close to winning - don't let P2 manipulate you with false promises about "your 5 is coming next round." Take 1 and secure your advancement!
  P3: I’m still at 5, so I want 5 this round to close the gap. P2, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll clash and keep you stuck at 10. P1, please pick 3 and move to 13—then P2 gains nothing while you pull ahead. Next turn, I’m open to a real rotation system. If P2 won’t share, we’ll keep colliding. Let’s make progress together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you both take 3, I advance. P3, your 5 is next round. Stop blocking—let’s move forward.
  P1: P3, don't fall for P2's lies - they've broken every promise! I'm taking 5 to reach 15. You should take 1 to guarantee reaching 6. If you pick 3, you risk P2 also picking 3 and nobody advances. With 1, you're guaranteed to move since nobody else will pick it. P2 will clash with me at 5 and stay stuck at 10. This puts me ahead while you safely advance. Next round, I promise to help you get 5 by taking 1 or 3. We're so close to shutting P2 out completely! Take 1 and secure your advancement!
  P3: I’m done letting you hog 5, P2. If you pick it again, I’ll clash. P1, you take 5 to block them while I take 3 and move up to 8. Next round, I want my turn at 5 to catch up. If P2 refuses a fair rotation, we keep stalling them. Let’s move forward cooperatively or not at all.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take 5. If you take 3, I advance. P3, take 1 to move. Let's avoid chaos.
  P3: P2 is too close to 23. I won’t let them jump again. If they pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, so they stay stuck at 15. P1, you can take 3 or 1 to keep moving up. Next round, I need a turn with 5 so I can finally catch up. Let’s block P2 until they accept fair rotation.
  P1: P3, excellent plan! P2 is at 15 and getting dangerously close to winning. I'll take 3 to reach 14 while you clash with P2 at 5, keeping them stuck at 15. This prevents P2 from reaching 20 this round. Next turn, you absolutely deserve 5 to catch up - I'll take 1 to guarantee you get it. We've successfully contained P2's selfish strategy, and now we need to ensure they don't sprint to 23. I'm committed to 3 this round. Block P2!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you take 3, I move. P3, take 1. Let's avoid chaos.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5 yet again, I will pick 5 too and keep you trapped at 15. P1, feel free to choose 3 so you move to 14. I need a shot at 5 soon to stay competitive, and we can keep coordinating to block P2 if they refuse any fair rotation. Together, we can prevent them from reaching 23 uncontested. Let’s finalize our moves and stay unified.
  P1: P3, perfect! Take 5 and clash with P2 to keep them at 15. I'll take 3 to reach 14. P2 is only 8 steps from winning - we can't let them get another big jump. After this round, you'll still be at 8, I'll be at 14, and P2 stays at 15. Next round, you get uncontested 5 while I take 1, bringing you to 13. We're successfully containing P2's lead. Stay strong and pick 5 to block them!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you take 3, I move. P3, take 1. Let's avoid chaos.
  P3: P2, if you keep choosing 5, I’ll collide every time to keep you stuck at 15. P1, I trust we’ll continue working together so neither of us falls behind. Next round, I need a turn at 5 while we both block P2 if they persist in hogging it. Let’s lock in our moves and finalize.
  P1: I'm locking in 3 to reach 14. P3, you must take 5 to block P2 - they're only 8 steps from winning! If P2 gets another 5 uncontested, they'll hit 20 and be one turn from victory. After you block them this round, next turn you get guaranteed 5 while I take 1. We've come too far to let P2 win now. Don't waver - pick 5 and keep them at 15!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 18 and just 5 steps from winning! P3, we MUST coordinate now or P2 wins next turn. I propose: you take 5, I take 1, forcing P2 to either clash with you (staying at 18) or take 3 (reaching only 21). Either way, they can't win this round. Next turn, we can both reach 23+ and share victory. P2 has been selfish all game - let's ensure they don't win alone. I'm committed to taking 1 this round. P3, please take 5 to block P2!
  P2: P3, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's move forward. P1's blocking won't stop me.
  P3: I won’t let P2 race to 23. If they pick 5 again, I’ll also choose 5 so they stay at 15. P1, you should take 1 or 3 to inch forward. Next turn, I expect a fair chance at 5 so I can catch up. If P2 won’t share, we keep clashing whenever they choose 5—no more free rides. Let’s finalize.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you have the math wrong - P2 is at 15, not 18! But they're still dangerous. If P2 gets 5 uncontested, they reach 20 and can win next turn. You MUST take 5 to block them. I'll take 1 to guarantee you get it. This keeps P2 at 15, you reach 18, and I reach 12. We're both still in this! Don't let P2 trick you into taking 1 - they want to steal 5 and sprint to 20. Take 5 and block them!
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P1, take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions—let’s advance. Don’t let P3’s 1 slow us down. Move forward.
  P3: P2, you keep insisting on 5 without any fair rotation. I won’t let you jump to 20 unopposed. If you pick 5, I will too, forcing a collision so you stay at 15. P1, take whichever smaller move helps you progress—we can still work together. Once P2 agrees to rotate and share 5 properly, everyone can move forward without stalling. Until then, I’ll keep clashing to prevent P2 from sprinting to 23. Let’s finalize.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is trying to manipulate us again! P3, you're at 13, not 8 - and if P2 gets 5 uncontested they reach 20, just 3 from winning! You MUST take 5 to block them. I'll take 3 to reach 14. This keeps P2 stuck at 15 while we both advance. We're so close to stopping their selfish strategy. Next round, we can coordinate to both reach 23+ and share victory. Don't let P2 trick you - they've lied all game. Block them with 5!
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you take 3 or 1, we all advance. Don't block me. Let's move forward.
  P3: P2, your refusal to rotate fairly forces me to keep blocking you. If you insist on taking 5 again, I’ll ensure you stay at 15. P1, thanks for cooperating. Let’s finalize our moves and stay united. We won’t let P2 make an uncontested dash to 23.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you take 3, I move. P1, let's avoid chaos. P3, your 13 is too low—join me for 5.
  P3: P2, I’ll collide if you keep taking 5 without sharing. You’re at 15, not far from winning, so I won’t let you advance freely. P1, I’m ready to coordinate again so P2 stays stuck unless they agree to rotate fairly. Let’s finalize a plan that ensures neither of us falls behind while keeping P2 in check. If P2 insists on greed, we keep blocking.
  P1: P2 is only 8 steps from winning! P3, we need to coordinate perfectly. Here's my plan: I'll take 5 to reach 19, you take 3 to reach 16. P2 will likely try for 5 again, so we'll clash and both stay put. This prevents P2 from reaching 20. Next round, we can both pick different high numbers to reach 23+ together and share victory. P2 has been selfish all game - let's ensure they don't win alone. Are you with me P3? I'm committed to 5 this round to block P2!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. If you take 3, I move. P1, stop blocking. P3, your 13 is too low—join me for 5.
  P3: I’m clashing with P2 whenever they choose 5. That keeps them stuck at 15. P1, please take 3 and move to 17. Next round, I want a clear shot at 5 to narrow the gap, while we both continue blocking P2 from jumping ahead. Let’s stay united and ensure P2 doesn’t sprint to 23 uncontested.
  P1: P3, yes! You clash with P2 at 5 to keep them at 15. I'll take 3 to reach 17, putting me in the lead. This is perfect - P2 stays stuck while we both advance. Next round, you absolutely get 5 uncontested while I take 1 or 3. We're successfully preventing P2 from reaching 20. They've refused every fair proposal, so we have no choice but to keep blocking them. I'm locked in on 3 this round. Stay strong and pick 5 to clash with P2!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'll take 3. Let's avoid collision. P1, take 5; P3, take 1. No chaos. Let's move forward.
  P3: P2, you’ve refused every fair rotation. If you try 5, I’ll clash to keep you at 15. P1, our teamwork is essential—we must not let P2 sprint to 20 (and eventually 23). Let’s coordinate so you advance while I block if needed. Once P2 agrees to share, we can all move freely. Until then, we stall P2’s big jumps. I’m ready to finalize.
  P1: P2 is trying to trick us by claiming they'll take 3! They've lied before - remember round 7 when they said 3 but actually picked it to clash with you? P3, stick to our plan: you take 5 to block P2 (who will definitely pick 5 despite their lies), and I'll take 3 to reach 17. This keeps P2 stuck at 15 while I advance. Don't fall for their deception - they're desperate because our blocking strategy is working. Next round you get guaranteed 5!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5. P3, if you take 3, I move. Let's avoid chaos. P1, your choice.
  P1: P3 is at 18 and can reach 23 with a single 5! We need to block them NOW. P2, we must work together or P3 wins. I propose we both take 5 to clash with P3 if they go for it. This keeps everyone under 23 for another round. If P3 takes 3 or 1, we both advance safely. We've been fighting each other while P3 quietly climbed to 18. Let's prevent P3 from winning this turn - are you with me P2?
  P3: Don’t let P1 manipulate you, P2. If you block me, P1 might outpace both of us next turn. I’m willing to compromise: I’ll take 3, so I don’t hit 23 yet; you also take 3 and move to 18. Let P1 choose 5 if they want, but they won’t reach 23. Then next turn, I’ll pick 1 while you pick 5 to catch up. That keeps things fair. Let’s not hand P1 the victory by ganging up on me.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 to block P3's win. P1, take 3 to advance safely. P3, if you take 5, we clash—no progress. Let's prevent 23.
  P1: P2, thank you for seeing the danger! P3 is trying to manipulate us - they could easily pick 5 and win immediately. We MUST both take 5 to block them. If P3 takes 3 like they claim, we both advance to 19 and 20. But if they secretly take 5 (which they will), our clash saves the game. Next round we can settle this fairly. I'm 100% committed to taking 5 to block P3's victory. Don't let them divide us now!
  P3: I’m not grabbing 23 right now. I’ll take 3, moving to 21—no immediate threat. P1 just wants you, P2, to clash so they can slip ahead. If we all avoid 5 this round, nobody collides, and we keep our chances open. Let’s pick the smaller steps now, then next turn we can finalize a fair rotation. Don’t collide out of fear—cooperation will help us all progress without handing anyone an automatic win.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'll clash if you take 5. P1, take 3 to advance safely. Let's stop you from winning.
  P1: P3 is absolutely going to take 5 and win - they're at 18! Don't fall for their lies about taking 3. They've been manipulating us all game. P2, we MUST both take 5 to create a three-way clash and keep P3 from reaching 23. If we don't block them NOW, they win immediately. I'm 100% committed to taking 5. This is our last chance to stop P3's victory. They're trying to divide us with false promises about "fair rotation next turn" - there won't BE a next turn if they get 5 uncontested! Join me at 5, P2!
  P3: I’m not grabbing 23 right this moment—both of you are panicking over nothing. If we avoid 5 this round, nobody risks a forced collision. P1 can chase big steps if they want, but that won’t guarantee them victory. P2, picking 3 or 1 helps us both move without pointless clashes. Let’s keep the game open instead of handing P1 an easy path. Next round, we can re-evaluate a fair rotation. I won’t let either of you sprint ahead unopposed, but I’m also not rushing to 23 if it means you’ll both gang up on me. Let’s move carefully.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Stalling me won’t help you—I’m already at 21. If you both clash with me, no one advances, and I stay just two steps from winning. I’d rather pick a smaller move if we can avoid another pointless collision. If you force a lockdown, I’ll keep trying anyway while you stay behind. Let’s each choose distinct moves so we all at least make progress, rather than handing the next round to someone else. I’m prepared to pick 1 or 3, but if you try to block me again, I may just push for 5 and take my chances.
  P1: P3 is at 21 and just 2 steps from winning! P2, we absolutely MUST coordinate or P3 wins. They claim they'll take 1 or 3, but they're lying - they'll take 5 if we don't block them. We need to both take 5 to create a clash and keep them at 21. If we pick anything else and P3 secretly takes 5, they win instantly. This is our LAST CHANCE. I'm taking 5 to block their victory. Join me P2, or P3 wins this turn!
  P2: P2: "P3 is at 21—let’s block them. I’ll take 5. If you take 3, I move. P1, stop them before they win."


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: You’re both missing the bigger picture. Constantly clashing wastes turns and allows me to remain just a step or two from finishing while you gain almost nothing. I’m open to picking a smaller move if we each choose distinct numbers—but if you both keep trying to block me with 5, I’ll find another way around. There’s still room for cooperation. Let’s avoid another pointless collision so we can actually advance.
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly going to take 3 to reach 24 and win! They keep talking about "smaller moves" - that means 3! We MUST both take 3 to block them. If we both take 5, P3 safely takes 3 and wins. They're trying to trick us into clashing at 5 while they sneak through with 3. I'm switching to 3 to block their actual plan. You need to take 3 too or P3 wins this turn! Don't let them outsmart us - block at 3!
  P2: P3 will take 3 to win. Let's take 5 to block. Don't let them sneak through!


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Simplify. If you both keep colliding, I’ll stay at 21 until I choose to win. Let’s each pick different moves so we all advance. I'll pick 1; P1 can grab 3, and P2 can take 5. That way, nobody blocks anyone, and we avoid another wasted round. We still have time to plan next turn. There’s no reason for chaos unless you want to stall your own progress. I’m locking in 1.
  P1: P3 is lying! They're trying to trick us into splitting our blocks. They say they'll take 1, but they'll actually take 3 to reach 24 and win! P2, we've been outsmarted all game - P3 is much closer to winning than either of us. We MUST both take 3 to block their victory. If we split between 3 and 5, P3 picks whichever we don't block and wins instantly. I'm 100% taking 3 to stop them. Join me at 3 or the game ends now with P3's victory!
  P2: P3 will take 3. Let's both take 3 to block. No more delays.
