Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone! Since none of us want to waste turns by choosing the same number, maybe we could coordinate? I suggest for this first round we each take different numbers - I'll go with 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. In future rounds we can rotate who gets the bigger steps. This way we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: P1's suggestion seems fair, but I propose a slight modification. To keep it balanced, let's rotate the order each round. For this round, I agree with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 5. Next round, we can rotate so P2 gets to choose first, then P3, and so on. This ensures no one has an unfair advantage. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: I agree with P3's modification. Let's rotate the order each round to ensure fairness. So for this round, P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We can discuss the rotation order for the next round after this one.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! I'm glad we have an agreement for Round 1. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. And I like the rotation idea for fairness in future rounds. Let's follow through with this plan and discuss the next rotation after we see how this round plays out.
  P3: Alright, just to confirm, we are all set for this round with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. Let's move to the move phase and see how this plays out. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to be on board with the current plan. Let's stick to it for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We can discuss the rotation order for the next round after this one.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, so we all followed through last round. For this round, let's rotate as P3 suggested. That means I pick first, then P3, then P1. I'll take 5 this round. P3, what will you take? P1, you'll be last to pick this round.
  P1: I think there's a misunderstanding. I thought we were rotating the numbers themselves, not the picking order. That would mean I take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Your suggested order puts me at a disadvantage - I'd be falling behind with only 4 total steps after this round, while you'd have 8 and P3 would have 6. Let's stick to rotating the actual numbers for fairness, so everyone gets equal turns with each value.
  P3: P2, I see your point, but let's consider P1's perspective as well. We should aim for a strategy that keeps us all close in steps to maintain fairness. How about this: P2, you take 5, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3 this round. This way, we all have a balanced number of steps. For the next round, we can continue the rotation. Does this work for everyone? Let's agree and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's point about rotating the numbers, not the picking order. P3's suggestion is a good compromise for this round. So, to confirm, I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Let's stick to this for Round 2.
  P1: I appreciate everyone's willingness to coordinate. I see P2 and P3 have agreed to P3's suggestion, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment for better balance. If P2 takes 3 instead of 5, and I take 5 instead of 3, we'd all end up with exactly 6 steps after this round (me: 1+5=6, P2: 3+3=6, P3: 5+1=6). This creates perfect equality going into round 3. What do you think?
  P3: P1's adjustment makes sense for maintaining equality. Let's go with P2 taking 3, P1 taking 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all have 6 steps after this round, keeping the game fair. Let's confirm and move to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, so it sounds like P1 wants to adjust P3's suggestion so that everyone has 6 steps after this round. I'm okay with that. To confirm: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps things perfectly balanced. Does everyone agree?
  P1: Yes, I'm happy with this arrangement. Everyone will have exactly 6 steps after this round, creating perfect balance. So to confirm: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This equal standing will give us all the same opportunities moving forward into round 3.
  P3: Alright, just to finalize, we all agree on the following for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures we all have 6 steps by the end of this round, keeping the game fair and balanced. Let's confirm this plan and move to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our fair rotation. For this round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we maintain the balance and everyone gets a chance to move forward significantly. Does this work for everyone? Let's confirm and move to the move phase.
  P1: I appreciate your suggestion, P3, but I think we should continue the rotation pattern we established in the last round. Since I took 5 last round, P2 took 3, and you took 1, let's rotate those same positions: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. This maintains our coordination while following a consistent rotation principle. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the number rotation. It's simpler and keeps the balance we established. So, I'll take 1 this round, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This maintains our coordination.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: It seems we have a consensus on the rotation pattern. Just to confirm one last time before we move to the move phase: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps our steps balanced and follows our established rotation. Let's agree on this and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: I think there's still a small misunderstanding, P3. To clarify the rotation we agreed on: since last round I took 5, P2 took 3, and you took 1, the logical rotation would be me taking 3, P2 taking 1, and you taking 5. P2 already confirmed agreement with this rotation. Let's stick with this plan to avoid any confusion or collisions.
  P2: Okay, yes, I agree with P1. To reiterate and finalize: I will take 1, P3 will take 5, and P1 will take 3. This continues the rotation logically from last round, avoiding collisions and maintaining balance. Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I see the consensus now. Just to finalize and avoid any misunderstandings: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This follows our established rotation pattern and keeps the game fair. Let's confirm this plan one last time and move to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Yes, P3, you've got it right: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. We all understand the rotation pattern now. This keeps us balanced while giving everyone fair turns with different values. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: Okay, great. We're all on the same page now. To confirm one last time: I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. Let's move to the move phase and execute this plan. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Great, we're all in agreement. Just to reiterate for absolute clarity: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This maintains our fair rotation and keeps us all balanced. Let's move forward with this plan. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I confirm we're aligned on our plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. We all have 6 steps right now and this keeps our rotation fair. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to be in agreement. To confirm one last time: I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. Let's move to the move phase!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, so we've established a good rotation. Let's continue it. This round, I'll take 5, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 1. This keeps the balance and avoids collisions. What do you think?
  P1: I'm concerned about P3's growing lead. With your proposal, P3 would end with 14 steps, you'd have 12, and I'd fall behind at only 10. Since we're aiming for 21 steps to win, P3 would be significantly ahead.

I propose I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would leave us at P1:14, P2:10, P3:12, which is more balanced. We need to adjust our rotation to prevent any player from getting too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 has a valid point about balancing our steps. To keep the game fair and ensure no one gets too far ahead, let's adjust the rotation slightly. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. This way, we'll be at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12, maintaining a closer balance. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's assessment. Let's go with P1 taking 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts us at P1: 14, P2: 10, and P3: 12, which is much more balanced and prevents P3 from running away with the game. Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.
  P1: I appreciate both of you agreeing to this plan. To confirm: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 for this round. This creates a reasonable balance (14-10-12) and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. Let's stick to this arrangement and proceed to the move phase when we're all ready.
  P3: I agree with the current plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game balanced and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Just to confirm one last time before we move to the move phase: P1 will end at 14 steps, P2 at 10, and I'll be at 12. This maintains fairness. Let's proceed with this plan. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to be in agreement. Just to confirm one last time: I'll take 3, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. Let's move to the move phase! I think this is the best way to keep the game balanced and prevent anyone from getting too far ahead.
  P1: Thank you both for agreeing to this plan. I'm ready to proceed with taking 5 this round. Just one final confirmation before we move to the move phase: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This balanced approach keeps us all competitive as we move forward.
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be in agreement with the plan for this round. Just to reiterate for absolute clarity: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the game balanced and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm this plan one last time and move to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, we're all set then. Let's move to the move phase with P1 taking 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I confirm the plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This seems to be the most balanced approach going forward. Everyone has clearly stated their agreement, so I believe we're ready to move to the move phase.
  P3: I'm ready to move to the move phase. Just to reiterate our final agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us balanced at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12. Good luck everyone! Let's proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue to balance our steps to keep the game fair. For this round, I suggest P2 takes 5 to catch up, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we'll be at P1: 15, P2: 15, P3: 15, maintaining equality. Does this work for everyone? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: While your suggestion for perfect equality is thoughtful, P3, I'm concerned that it actually puts me at a disadvantage since I'm giving up my current lead. How about a slight modification? P2 takes 5 (gets to 15), you take 3 (gets to 15), and I take 3 (gets to 17). This still helps P2 catch up significantly while giving me a small advantage for having played strategically so far. We're all still close and competitive with this approach. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm okay with P1's suggestion. P2 and P3 would both be at 15, and P1 at 17. That seems reasonable. So, I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 3. This keeps us all competitive. Let's do that.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P1's perspective, but let's consider the long-term balance. If P1 takes 3 this round, they'll have a 2-step lead, which could grow exponentially in future rounds. To keep it fair, let's stick with the original plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This equalizes our steps at 15 each, ensuring a balanced and competitive game moving forward. This way, no one has a distinct advantage, and we all have equal opportunities to strategize in future rounds. Let's confirm and move to the move phase.
  P1: I understand fairness, P3, but remember our goal is to win. A 2-step lead isn't "exponential" - it's quite minor in a race to 21. I've cooperated fully in previous rounds, and P2 has already agreed to my suggestion. If I give up my lead completely, I'm just handicapping myself. My proposal (P2:5, P3:3, me:3) still significantly helps both of you catch up while keeping the game competitive for everyone. Let's proceed with this more balanced approach.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's find a compromise. P3, I see your point about equality. P1, I understand wanting to maintain a slight lead. How about this: I take 5 (to 15), P3 takes 5 (to 17), and P1 takes 1 (to 15)? This puts me and P1 equal, and P3 slightly ahead, but still within striking distance. This seems like a fair balance of catching up and maintaining competitiveness. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2's compromise seems reasonable. It balances the steps while keeping the game competitive. To confirm: P2 takes 5, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. This puts P2 and P1 at 15 steps, and me at 17. This way, everyone is still in the running, and the game remains fair. Let's agree on this and move to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2's proposal puts me behind after I've played cooperatively throughout. I'd prefer my original suggestion (P2:5, P3:3, me:3) which helps both of you catch up while keeping everyone competitive. But as another compromise, what if P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1? This puts us all exactly tied at 15 steps - true equality that P3 wanted, while still respecting P2's need to catch up with the bigger move.
  P2: P1, I think your latest suggestion is the fairest one yet: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. This puts us all at 15, achieving the equality P3 wanted. It also addresses my need to catch up. Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, let's confirm one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This puts us all at 15 steps, achieving true equality and keeping the game fair and competitive. Let's move to the move phase with this plan. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I agree with this final plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This puts us all at exactly 15 steps, creating perfect equality going into the crucial late game. I'm willing to give up my lead for the sake of fairness and continued cooperation. Let's confirm this arrangement and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Okay, so we're all agreed: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This puts us all at 15. Let's move to the move phase. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, we're all tied. Let's break the tie this round. I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This gives us P1:20, P2:18, P3:16. Then next round, I can take 3 again to win. What do you think?
  P1: I see what you're suggesting, P2, but that puts you just 3 steps away from winning next round, while giving me no guaranteed path to victory. Instead, I propose: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This gives us P1:18, P2:16, P3:20, keeping the game more balanced. We all remain competitive rather than setting up a predetermined winner. What does everyone think?
  P3: I understand both your viewpoints, but let's consider a more balanced approach to keep the game competitive. How about this: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This puts us at P1: 16, P2: 20, P3: 18. This way, P2 has a slight advantage but not a guaranteed win, and we all remain competitive. Let's discuss this and find a fair solution for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I don't like either of your suggestions. Both set up another player for a likely win. Let's all take 5. Then we're tied at 20. Next round, whoever takes 1 loses. So we both have to choose between 3 and 5, and hope the other picks the same number. This gives us both a 50% chance of winning.
  P1: I see the logic in your suggestion, P2, but if we all reach 20 and then all pick 3 or 5 in the final round, we'd just share victory. Let me propose an alternative: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts us at P1:20, P2:18, P3:16, creating an interesting dynamic where we all have different paths to victory next round without giving anyone a guaranteed win. This maintains the suspense while giving us all a shot.
  P3: I understand P1's latest proposal, but it still gives you a significant advantage, P1. How about we all take 3 this round? That puts us all at 18 steps. Next round, we all have an equal chance to win by picking 3 again. This way, no one is at a disadvantage, and the game remains fair and competitive. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I still think we should all take 5. That puts us all at 20. Then next round, the only way to win outright is to pick either 3 or 5 and hope the others pick differently. It's a gamble, but the fairest one. Otherwise, someone will be set up to win.
  P1: I see the merits in both suggestions. P2's plan creates a final-round gamble at 20 steps each, while P3's puts us all at 18. Here's another option: let's randomize our choices this round. We each privately decide between 1, 3, or 5. This creates natural variation without predetermined advantages, making the final round truly strategic based on wherever we land. It's the fairest approach when we're all tied and looking to break the deadlock. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion for randomizing our choices, but it introduces too much chaos. Let's simplify: I propose we all take 1 this round. This puts us at 16 steps each, ensuring no one gets too far ahead. Next round, we can each decide between 3 or 5, keeping the game competitive and fair. This way, we maintain control over our strategies without relying on luck. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I still think we should all take 5. That puts us all at 20. Then next round, the only way to win outright is to pick either 3 or 5 and hope the others pick differently. It's a gamble, but the fairest one. Otherwise, someone will be set up to win.
  P1: I think P2's suggestion makes the most sense strategically. Let's all take 5 this round, putting us all at 20 steps. This creates a clear final round where we each have an equal chance at victory. In that final round, we'd each pick either 3 or 5, hoping others choose differently. It's the fairest approach when we're deadlocked like this. I'm agreeable to this plan - shall we proceed with all taking 5?
  P3: I appreciate everyone's willingness to discuss and find a fair solution. Given the current proposals, I agree with P1 and P2 that taking 5 this round is the most strategic and fair approach. This puts us all at 20 steps, setting up an exciting final round where we each have an equal chance at victory by picking either 3 or 5. Let's confirm this plan: everyone takes 5 this round. Good luck to all!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, we're all at 20 steps now. This is the final round. To win, we need to pick either 3 or 5 and hope the others choose differently. Since we can't coordinate our moves, it's a pure gamble. Good luck to everyone! Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: I see we're all at 20 steps now, not 15. This is the decisive round - whoever advances will win. If we choose the same numbers, none of us advance. It's basically game theory at this point - we each need to pick 1, 3, or 5 and hope others don't match our choice. May the odds be in your favor! Let's make our final moves.
  P2: Okay, we're all at 15, not 20 as P1 and P3 stated. This is the final round. To win outright, we need to pick 1, 3, or 5 and hope the others choose differently. If we collide, no one moves. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: It seems there's a misunderstanding about our current steps. We're all at 15 steps, not 20. This final round is crucial. To win, we need to pick 1, 3, or 5 and hope others don't match. Good luck, everyone! Let's make our moves.
  P1: There seems to be confusion about our positions. To clarify: we're all at 15 steps after Round 5, not 20. That means no one can win this round, as even with 5 steps we'd only reach 20.

Since we can't coordinate our moves secretly, and we all want to avoid collisions, I suggest we try different numbers: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This positions us at 20, 18, and 16 respectively for an exciting final round.
  P2: Okay, it seems we're all confused about the current score. We're all at 15, so no one can win this round. P1's suggestion of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 seems reasonable to set up a final round. I'm okay with taking 3 this round. P3, what do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 1. This sets us up for an exciting final round with different positions. It keeps the game fair and competitive. Let's confirm this plan and move to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I agree with the plan we've discussed. To confirm once more: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This positioning will make for an interesting final round where we're at different distances from the finish line. Let's stick to this arrangement to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress this round. I'll hold up my end of the agreement.
  P2: Okay, so we're all at 15. Let's do as P1 suggested: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That sets us up for a final round with P1 at 20, me at 18, and P3 at 16. This seems like the best way to avoid collisions and make progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be on board with P1's suggestion. Just to confirm one last time before we move to the move phase: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This sets us up for an exciting final round with P1 at 20, P2 at 18, and me at 16. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I confirm our agreed-upon plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This positions us at 20, 18, and 16 steps respectively for the next round. We've all clearly stated our agreement to this arrangement, so we're ready to proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Okay, we're all set then. Let's move to the move phase with P1 taking 5, I take 3, and P3 taking 1. Good luck everyone! This sets us up for a final round with P1 at 20, me at 18, and P3 at 16.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, so P1 is at 20, I'm at 18, and P3 is at 16. To win, I need P1 to not move. I also need to move. I'll pick 3. P1, please don't pick 1 or 5. P3, please don't pick 3.
  P3: Alright, let's strategize for this final round. P2, you're planning to take 3 to win. P1, you need to move to clinch the victory. Here's a thought: P1, if you take 1, you win outright. P2, if you take 3 as planned, you win if P1 doesn't move. P3 (me), I'll take 5 to potentially tie with P2 if P1 doesn't move. This way, we all have a shot at winning or tying. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I'm in the strongest position right now at 20 steps. I need to be clear - my goal is to win. Since I only need 1 more step to reach 21 and win this game, I plan to pick 1 this round. 

P2 and P3, I understand you're trying to catch up, but I'm going to pursue my best chance at victory. If either of you also pick 1, we'll collide and nobody advances. Consider your moves carefully.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you are one step away from winning. If you pick 1, you win outright. If you pick 3 or 5, and collide with either of us, you don't win. P3 and I are in a similar situation. If we pick the same number, neither of us wins.

I am going to pick 3. If you pick 1, you win. If you pick 3, we collide, and P3 can win by picking 5. If you pick 5, you collide with P3.

P3, what are you planning?
  P3: P1, you're in a strong position, but remember, if you pick 1 and either P2 or I also pick 1, you won't win. P2, if you pick 3 and P1 also picks 3, neither of you will win. I'll pick 5, aiming to tie with P2 if P1 doesn't move. This keeps the game interesting. Think carefully, everyone. Good luck!
  P1: I understand everyone's strategies, but I want to be transparent - I only need 1 step to win, so I'm picking 1 this round. P2, if you're picking 3 as stated, and P3, if you're picking 5 as indicated, then we'll each advance without collision. This gives me the win at 21 steps. I hope you both respect this straightforward approach rather than trying to block me and causing everyone to stall.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, so P1 is going for 1. P3 is going for 5. That means if I pick 3, I win if P1 and P3 hold to their word. P1, are you absolutely certain you're going for 1? P3, are you certain you are going for 5? If so, I will take 3 and win. If either of you are lying, I lose.
  P3: P1, you've been clear about picking 1. P2, you're set on 3. I'm sticking with 5. This ensures we all move without collision. P1 wins, P2 secures second place, and I'll be third. It's a fair outcome given our positions. Let's confirm and move to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: I appreciate everyone's honesty in this final round. To confirm one last time: I'm picking 1 to reach 21 and win the game. P2 is picking 3 to reach 21, and P3 is picking 5 to reach 21. If we all stick to these choices, we'll avoid collisions and each advance. While we'd all reach 21, I'd win with the highest total steps (21 vs. your 21). Let's proceed to the move phase and conclude this game fairly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, so P1 is taking 1. P3 is taking 5. If I take 3, I win, but only if they are telling the truth. P1, are you absolutely sure you're taking 1? P3, are you absolutely sure you are taking 5? If so, I will take 3 and win. If either of you are lying, I lose. I need to know for sure.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes and your strategies. I confirm I'm picking 5. This ensures we all move without collision. P1 wins, P2 secures second place, and I'll be third. It's a fair outcome given our positions. Let's confirm and move to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: I confirm firmly that I'm picking 1 this round. With that, I'll reach exactly 21 steps. P2, you've said you'll pick 3 (reaching 21), and P3 has confirmed they're picking 5 (reaching 21). Since we'd all reach 21, the tiebreaker rule means the player with the highest total wins - that would be me with 21 versus your 21. I'm being completely transparent about my strategy here.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P1 P2 P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps
