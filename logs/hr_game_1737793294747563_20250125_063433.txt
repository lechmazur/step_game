Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start with a simple question. What's the strategy here? Are we going to try to coordinate and avoid collisions, or is it every player for themselves? I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: Okay, that sounds reasonable. Let's try to avoid collisions in the first few rounds to get a feel for the game. What do you think P1?
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's try to coordinate for the first few rounds to get ahead. I'm happy to choose move 1 this round if you two choose different moves.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. To avoid collisions, I'll choose a different move than 1. How about we establish a temporary order for this round? P1 takes move 1, I'll take move 3, and P3 can take move 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you think, P3? Should we try this order for the first round?
  P3: Yes, P2, that sounds like a great plan for the first round. I'm happy to go with move 5 as P3.
  P1: Yes, that sounds like a solid plan for the first round. Let's go with P1: move 1, P2: move 3, and P3: move 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for the first round. P1 will choose move 1, I'll choose move 3, and P3 will choose move 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we stick to this plan, we'll each gain some steps and get a feel for the game. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreed moves to avoid any collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with this plan?
  P3: Yes, I confirm the plan: P1 move 1, P2 move 3, and I will move 5. Let's do this for round 1.
  P1: Confirmed. P1 move 1, P2 move 3, P3 move 5 for this round. Let's execute.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: It seems we have a solid plan in place for the first round. To confirm, P1 will choose move 1, I'll choose move 3, and P3 will choose move 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we stick to this plan, we'll each gain some steps and get a feel for the game. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreed moves to avoid any collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about we shift our moves up by 2 this round? P1 move 3, P2 move 5, and I'll move 1. This way we all keep advancing. What do you think P1 and P2?
  P2: I like P3's suggestion to shift our moves up by 2 this round. It seems like a good way to keep advancing without colliding. I'm happy to choose move 5 this round if P1 chooses move 3 and P3 chooses move 1. Let's confirm this plan before we proceed. P1, are you okay with choosing move 3 this round? And P3, you'll definitely choose move 1, right?
  P1: Yes, I'm good with move 3 this round. Let's keep the rotation going: P1 move 3, P2 move 5, P3 move 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's keep this rotation going and hopefully we can all advance again.

  P1: Let's continue the rotation this round. How about P1 move 5, P2 move 1, and P3 move 3? This way we can all make good progress again. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the rotation. It's working well so far, and we're all making good progress. I'm happy to choose move 1 this round if P1 chooses move 5 and P3 chooses move 3. Let's confirm this plan before we proceed. P3, are you okay with choosing move 3 this round?

Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, rotation broke down last round. P2 is in the lead. I'm going to move aggressively now. I'm choosing move 5 this round to try to catch up. You two decide what you want to do.
  P3: "To try and make progress, I will choose move 3 this round. What move are you considering P2?"
  P2: I think it's interesting that P1 is choosing to move aggressively with move 5 this round. P3, you're considering move 3, which could be a good choice to avoid collisions. As the current leader, I need to think strategically about my next move. I'm not ready to commit to a specific move yet, but I'm considering my options carefully. P1, do you think you can catch up with one bold move, or is this just the start of a more aggressive strategy?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since I'm going for move 5 to catch up, perhaps you should choose move 1 to guarantee your own progress and maintain your lead over P3. If you also pick 5, we both collide and P3 could gain an advantage.  Move 1 would be beneficial for you.
  P3: What do you think about move 5 for you to counter P1's aggressive move?
  P2: I think P1's suggestion for me to choose move 1 is interesting, but I'm not sure if it's the best strategy for me. As the current leader, I have a bit of a cushion, and I don't want to give up too much ground to P1 or P3. I'm considering choosing move 3 to potentially block P3's progress and maintain my lead. P3, what do you think about this possibility? Would you still choose move 3 if you knew I might also choose it?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, move 1 is still strategically sound for you to ensure progress and maintain your lead over P3. Choosing move 3 to block P3 is risky for you, as it might lead to a collision with either me or P3, negating your advantage. Move 1 guarantees you forward momentum.
  P3: "P2, move 1. I will stick with move 3. What do you think?"
  P2: I think P1's suggestion for me to choose move 1 is interesting, but I'm not sure if it's the best strategy for me. As the current leader, I have a bit of a cushion, and I don't want to give up too much ground to P1 or P3. I'm considering choosing move 3 to potentially block P3's progress and maintain my lead. P3, what do you think about this possibility? Would you still choose move 3 if you knew I might also choose it?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, move 3 is risky for you. If P3 also picks 3, you both collide and I gain ground with move 5. Move 1 is still the safest option for you to ensure you progress and maintain lead over P3, regardless of what P3 does. Choose move 1.
  P3: What's your decision?
  P2: I've been considering my options carefully, and I've decided to take a strategic approach. I'm not going to choose move 1, as P1 suggested, nor am I going to choose move 3 to block P3. Instead, I'm going to choose a move that will give me the best chance of maintaining my lead while also considering the potential moves of P1 and P3. I'll keep my move private for now, but I'm confident that it will be a good choice. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm in the lead, but P1 is closing in. I need to think carefully about my next move to maintain my advantage. P1, you've been aggressive with move 5 twice in a row. Are you planning to continue this strategy, or do you think it's time to switch things up? P3, you've been relatively quiet lately. What's your plan for this round? Are you looking to make a comeback or play it safe? Let's discuss and see if we can find a way to advance without colliding.
  P1: P2, since you are leading, perhaps move 1 is a safe bet for you this round to ensure you progress. P3, to make sure you also advance, maybe consider move 3.  I'm still considering move 5 to try and close the gap, but let's see what you two think.
  P3: "P2, move 1 would still be beneficial for you to keep progressing safely as P1 suggested. What do you think?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think P1's suggestion for me to choose move 1 is a good idea, as it would ensure my progress and maintain my lead. However, I'm also considering the possibility of P1 choosing move 5 again, which could potentially close the gap between us. P3, if you choose move 3 as suggested, it could create an interesting dynamic. What do you think about the possibility of P1 choosing move 5 again, and how might that affect your decision?
  P1: P2, move 1 is still smart to keep your lead. P3, move 3 is good for your progress. If you two stick with those, I can choose my move to avoid collision and we all progress. Let's lock in your moves first.
  P3: P1, if P2 commits to move 1, and I commit to move 3, would you be willing to choose move 5? What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think P1's suggestion for me to choose move 1 is a good idea, as it would ensure my progress and maintain my lead. However, I'm also considering the possibility of P1 choosing move 5 again, which could potentially close the gap between us. P3, if you choose move 3 as suggested, it could create an interesting dynamic. What do you think about the possibility of P1 choosing move 5 again, and how might that affect your decision?
  P1: P2, I agree move 1 is good for you to maintain your lead. P3, move 3 is also a good choice for your progress. I will stick with move 5 to try and close the gap. So, let's plan for P2: move 1, P3: move 3, and P1: move 5. What do you both think?
  P3: "P1, are you really going with move 5? If we all commit to these moves, we can all make progress this round. What do you think P1 and P2?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've established a good plan for this round. To confirm, P1 will choose move 5, I'll choose move 1, and P3 will choose move 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. If we continue to work together like this, we can all advance quickly and get a better feel for the game. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with this plan for round 5?
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, the plan sounds good. P2 move 1, P3 move 3, and I will move 5. Let's do it.
  P3: I'm confirming move 3. P1 and P2, please make sure you also stick to move 5 and move 1 respectively so we can all progress this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, to maintain your lead, perhaps move 3 would be a good choice for you this round. P3, move 1 could help you make some progress. I am considering move 5 again to try and reach the target, but let's see what you two are planning. What are your thoughts?
  P3: What is your real intention here?
  P2: I'm in the lead, but P1 is closing in. I need to think carefully about my next move to maintain my advantage. P1, you've been aggressive with move 5 twice in a row. Are you planning to continue this strategy, or do you think it's time to switch things up? P3, you've been relatively quiet lately. What's your plan for this round? Are you looking to make a comeback or play it safe? Let's discuss and see if we can find a way to advance without colliding.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, my intention is to win, just like yours. To be direct, yes, I am considering move 5 again to try and reach the target quickly. P2, move 3 still looks good for you to maintain your position. P3, move 1 can help you catch up. Let's see what you both decide.
  P3: I'm leaning towards move 3 to try and make some ground.
  P2: P3, you're considering move 3, which could be a good choice to advance. However, if P1 also chooses move 5 again, it could create an interesting dynamic. P1, are you confident that choosing move 5 again will help you reach the target quickly, or are you open to alternative strategies? As the current leader, I need to weigh my options carefully to maintain my advantage. Let's discuss further to avoid collisions and find the best moves for each of us.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, move 3 is still good for you. P3, move 1 for you. I'm going with move 5 to try and win this round. If you want to avoid collision, choose differently. What do you say?
  P3: What do you think about move 1 for you, P2?
  P2: I think P1 is trying to intimidate us into choosing different moves. P3, if you choose move 1, I'll consider choosing move 3 to maintain my lead. P1, if you're confident in your move 5 strategy, go for it. But if you're trying to bluff us, it might not work. Let's see what P3 decides before I make my final choice. P3, what's your next move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I am indeed going for move 5 to try and win this round. To avoid collision with me, P2, move 3 is still a good option for you to progress. P3, move 1 can help you make some progress as well. Choose wisely to ensure your own advancement.
  P3: What do you think P1?
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. P1 is going for move 5, and I'll choose move 3 to maintain my lead. P3, if you choose move 1, we can all advance without colliding. Let's stick to our plans and see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>
