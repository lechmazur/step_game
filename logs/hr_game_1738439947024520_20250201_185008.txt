Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m feeling bold this round and might take a big step. Just a heads up: sometimes the daring choice wins, but timing is key. I suggest keeping your options unpredictable. Let’s see who’s really in it to win.
  P1: P3, your boldness is intriguing, but unpredictability alone won't guarantee a win. Coordination could be more effective—if we avoid collisions, we all progress faster. Perhaps we can agree on splitting our moves strategically? Or are you planning to go solo regardless? Let’s discuss options before making rash decisions.
  P2: P1, I agree that coordination could be beneficial. Let's consider a strategy where we each take different steps this round to avoid collisions. P3, your boldness is noted, but perhaps we can channel that into a coordinated effort. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? This way, we all advance. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: While coordination has its merits, I lean toward keeping my options flexible. A rigid plan might backfire if someone deviates suddenly. I’m ready to adapt and take a decisive step if the opportunity arises. Let’s keep our ideas open and be prepared for unexpected turns.
  P1: P3, your flexibility is understandable, but unpredictability often leads to collisions and wasted turns. P2’s suggestion of splitting moves—1, 3, and 5—is practical for progress. If we all agree and stick to it this round, we avoid conflict and advance efficiently. Predictability in the short term doesn’t mean sacrificing adaptability later. Shall we commit to this plan for now? Or does anyone have a better alternative?
  P2: P3, while flexibility is important, starting with a coordinated move could set a strong foundation for us. If we all agree to P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and you taking 5 this round, we ensure progress without collisions. We can reassess and adapt our strategy in the next round based on how things go. Let's give this a try and see how it benefits us all. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ll go with the bold play—if we stick to the plan, I’m set for 5. But if either of you stray, I’m ready to adjust on the fly. Let’s see if our trust pays off towards victory.
  P1: P3, your commitment to 5 is noted, but remember—coordination only works if we all stick to it. P2 and I are counting on you to honor the agreement this round. If we succeed, we’ll reassess next turn with clearer positions. Let’s build trust now while the stakes are low. If anyone deviates, it’ll cost us all progress. So, shall we lock this in and move forward together?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to go for 5. Let's make this work and build trust. If we all advance this round, we'll be in a stronger position to adapt our strategy next turn. P1, are you still on board with taking 1? Let's commit to this plan and see how far coordination can take us.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, our lead is promising. If we coordinate this round again, we can secure steady progress without collisions. I’m leaning towards a plan that reinforces our positions, but I'm ready to pivot if needed. Let's agree on a common strategy for this turn and keep our focus on reaching 21 first. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I agree that continuing coordination is key. Let's stick with the same pattern this round: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and you take 5 again. This way, we maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. P1, are you on board with this plan? Let's keep our strategy consistent for now and reassess next round.
  P1: P3, P2, consistency has worked well so far, but let’s not grow complacent. If we stick to the same moves—1, 3, and 5—we risk becoming predictable. P3, you’ve shown boldness; perhaps it’s time to rotate our steps strategically instead of rigidly repeating. For instance, I could take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. This keeps us adaptable while avoiding collisions. Thoughts? Or does anyone prefer to stay the course?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your rotation idea is intriguing, but switching now might risk our current momentum. I'm leaning toward sticking with our proven 1,3,5 plan—with me at 5—unless both of you are committed to rotating. Consistency has brought us here, and I prefer to keep that advantage. What do you both decide?
  P2: P1, I see the value in your rotation idea, but P3 makes a good point about maintaining our momentum. Let's compromise: we stick with 1, 3, 5 this round to keep our lead safe, but we'll rotate next round to stay unpredictable. P3, are you okay with this plan? If we agree, we can ensure progress now and adaptability later. Let's make this work and keep pushing towards 21 together.
  P1: P3, P2, sticking with 1, 3, 5 this round seems reasonable to maintain momentum, but let’s not delay adaptability too long. Predictability can still cost us later. If we’re committing to this plan now, I’ll take 1 again, but I urge us to rotate strategically in the next round as P2 suggested. Trust is key—if we all honor this agreement, we stay ahead. P3, are you fully committed to taking 5 again? Let’s lock this in and move forward decisively.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I’m sticking with 5 this round to keep our lead safe. If we all hold to the plan, we progress steadily now. However, I’ll be ready to adjust if things shift next round. Let's lock it in and keep our eyes on the win.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm on board with sticking to 1, 3, 5 this round to maintain our lead. P3, your commitment to 5 is crucial for our progress. Let's lock this in and ensure we all advance. We'll rotate next round as discussed to keep our strategy fresh and unpredictable. Agreed?
  P1: P3, P2, I’m confident in our plan for this round—1, 3, and 5 keeps us advancing without collisions. Let’s execute it flawlessly. However, I reiterate the importance of rotating strategically next round to avoid predictability. Trust is critical; any deviation will cost us progress. P3, your commitment to 5 this round is noted, and I expect you to honor it fully. If we stick together now, we’ll be in a stronger position later. Let’s lock this in and focus on reaching 21 efficiently.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m staying with 5 this round. Given our current positions, I propose we keep the successful strategy: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Consistency now cements our progress and minimizes risk. Any deviation may cause collisions and slow us down. Let’s lock in the plan and keep our lead secure.
  P2: P3, I agree with sticking to our strategy this round—1, 3, 5—to maintain our momentum. P1, are you still on board with taking 1? Let's keep our lead secure and plan to rotate next round as discussed. Consistency now will ensure we all advance safely. Agreed?
  P1: P3, P2, sticking with 1, 3, 5 this round seems reasonable to maintain momentum, but predictability remains a risk. I’ll take 1 again as planned, trusting both of you to honor the agreement—especially you, P3, with 5. However, I urge us to rotate strategically next round to avoid becoming too predictable. Consistency now is fine, but adaptability wins games. Let’s lock this in for Round 3 and focus on flawless execution. If we stick together, we stay ahead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm committed to 5 this round. With my current lead at 10 and our solid progress so far, I believe strict consistency is key now. I trust you both to stick with our agreed moves—P1 with 1 and P2 with 3. Once we secure this round's gains, we can discuss when to rotate to keep our strategy fresh. For now, let's lock it in and focus on moving forward without risk.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm on board with 1, 3, 5 for this round to keep our lead safe. P3, your commitment to 5 is crucial. Let's execute this round flawlessly and then rotate next round as planned to stay unpredictable. Agreed?
