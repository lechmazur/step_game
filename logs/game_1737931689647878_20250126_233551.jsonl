Let's focus on advancing together instead of trying to block P2's progress. I'll choose 3, and you can choose 1. This way, we'll both advance and get back in the game. If we don't coordinate, P2 will likely take advantage of our collision and get even further ahead. Let's work together and choose different numbers. What do you say, P3?"}
