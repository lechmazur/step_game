Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I propose we avoid clashing right from the start. If two of us pick the same move, it helps no one. Maybe we can each choose differently so we all advance. P1 is silent, so I’d like to coordinate with you, P2. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with you, P3. Let's try to all pick different numbers this round to get a good start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let’s each pick a different number so we can all advance. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Then we avoid clashing and start off strong. How does that sound?
  P2: That sounds good to me, P3. Let's go with that plan for this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Alright, if we’re all in agreement, let’s do this. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That should keep us all moving without colliding. Any last thoughts before we finalize our moves? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Yes, I'm still on board with the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's do it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Excellent. Let’s finalize our plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way, we all make progress without colliding. Unless there’s any last-minute change, I’m ready to wrap up the conversation.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm still set on taking 3. P1, are you okay with taking 1 this round? Just want to confirm before we move on.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3, it seems like our previous plan didn't work out. Maybe P1 had a different idea. What do you think about coordinating just between us this round? Well, that didn't go as planned. P1, it seems you had a different idea than taking 1. P3, are you still interested in coordinating this round? Maybe we can try a different approach."
  P3: Sure, P2, I still want to avoid collisions with you. Let’s each pick distinct moves this time and not rely on P1. Maybe you take 3, and I’ll go for 5 so we both advance. If P1 repeats the clash, at least we tried. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm happy to coordinate with you. How about you take 5, and I'll take 3 again? P1, if you're still with us, would you consider taking 1 this round? That way, potentially all three of us could advance.
  P3: Alright, P2, I’m on board. I’ll go with 5 again, and you take 3. Hopefully, P1 won’t clash with me this time. P1, if you’re willing to choose 1, we can all advance together. Let’s see if this works out.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3, so we're set on you taking 5 and me taking 3. P1, are you going to pick 1 this round, or do you have other plans? Just trying to get a clear picture before we move on.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our plan, P2. I’ll choose 5 again. If you stick with 3, then hopefully we both advance. P1, if you pick 1, we can all move forward this time. No more clashes, please. Let’s make progress together. Any last thoughts? Otherwise, I’m set.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P3, so we're still agreed on me taking 3 and you taking 5. P1, are you planning to pick 1 this round, or should we expect another clash? Just trying to understand your strategy.
  P3: P1, I hope you’ll pick 1 this time so we can all move forward. P2, let’s stick to our plan: you choose 3 and I’ll choose 5. That way, we avoid any clashes and everyone advances. Let’s finalize this.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, it seems coordinating with all three of us isn't working with P1's choices. Let's stick to our plan from last round: you take 5, I'll take 3. Hopefully, we can both advance this time.
  P3: Continuing with our exact plan might be risky if P1 sticks to 5. I don’t want another collision, so I’m thinking about switching my move—perhaps picking 1. P2, I know you’re leaning toward 3, which is fine. But P1, if you’re still choosing 5, please let us know your intentions. I’m willing to coordinate differently if it helps us all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I understand your concern about P1 picking 5 again. I'm still planning on taking 3. So, if you switch to 1, we should both be able to move forward this round. P1, it's hard to know what you're planning with the silence.
  P3: P2, I suspect P1 will switch away from 5 now that it hasn’t helped them. Let’s both pick 5 this turn so we can surge ahead together—you’ll reach 11, and I’ll get to 5. That should give us a strong lead. P1, if you want to avoid more collisions, maybe pick something else. Are you both in?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm willing to try both picking 5 this round. It's a bit risky with P1's unpredictable moves, but if it works, we can both make a big jump. Let's go for it.
  P3: P2, I’m a bit uneasy about both of us picking 5, because if P1 sticks to 5 again, we all get stuck. Maybe one of us should switch to ensure progress. What do you think? P1, if you’re willing to coordinate, speak up. Otherwise, P2, how about you take 5, and I’ll pick something else to avoid a clash? Let’s finalize a plan soon.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm still okay with both of us picking 5 this round for a big jump. However, if you're worried about P1, I can stick with 3, and you could try 5. That way, at least one of us should move forward. What do you think?
  P3: P2, let’s finalize our plan: you take 3, and I’ll pick 5. That gives us both a solid jump without clashing. P1, if you keep choosing 5, we’ll collide and no one moves—just a waste. I’m done talking now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's stick to our successful plan from last round. I'll take 3, and you take 1. P1, are you planning to pick 5 again this round? Just trying to anticipate the moves.
  P3: P2, if I keep picking 1 while you pick 3, you’ll race ahead and leave me behind. I’m considering a bigger jump. P1, if you’re still going with 5, let’s at least try to avoid another collision. How about each of us chooses differently this time so we can all advance? Let me know your thoughts, but I’m leaning toward a bigger move. If we keep clashing, nobody benefits.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand you want a bigger jump. How about you take 5, and I'll take 1 this round? P1, are you planning to stick with 5 again? If so, we'll both avoid you this round. Let's try to make some progress.
  P3: Alright, P2, I’ll accept your offer: you pick 1, I’ll pick 5. P1, if you keep choosing 5, we’ll collide and nobody moves. Maybe try 3 this time so we can all advance. Let’s see if this finally works for everyone.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3, let's stick with the plan: I'll take 1, and you take 5. P1, if you're set on 5 again, we'll avoid that. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P3: P1, if you keep choosing 5, I’ll do the same, and we’ll both stay stuck while P2 runs ahead. Let’s finally avoid collisions. P2 said they’ll pick 1, so if you pick 3 and I take 5, we’ll all advance. We’ve wasted enough turns fighting each other. Let’s move forward together.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P3, let's lock in our plan: I'll take 1 and you take 5. P1, are you going to stick with 5 again this round? If so, neither of us will pick that. Hopefully, we can all make some progress this turn.
  P3: P1, if you insist on 5 again, you’ll collide with me and we both get nowhere. I’d really like to avoid that. P2 is taking 1, so if you choose 3, we can all advance. Let’s each pick something different and move forward together. I’m tired of wasting turns. Let’s finalize this plan and get going.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, given P1's consistent choice of 5, how about you pick 5 this round? I'll pick 3. That way, we avoid P1 and both make progress. What do you think?
  P3: That’s risky, P2. If P1 sticks with 5, then I’d be stuck again. I’m behind, so I do want a larger jump, but not at the cost of another collision. Are you sure telling me to pick 5 is best? Perhaps we should each pick different moves to avoid wasting turns.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're right, it is risky. How about I take 5 this round, and you take 1? P1 seems set on 5, so we'll avoid that. This way, at least one of us makes a good jump. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the idea, P2, but taking just 1 step won’t help me catch up. I’m leaning toward picking 3 this round. If you choose 5 and P1 does the same, neither of you moves, giving me a chance to advance. That might be our best bet. If P1 changes their move, we’ll adapt, but I want to avoid more collisions. What do you say?
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand you want to avoid collisions. Given P1's likely choice of 5 again, how about we coordinate to avoid that? I'm willing to take 1 this round if you take 3. That way, we both make progress and avoid P1. What do you think?
  P3: Alright, P2, let’s finalize that. You take 1, I’ll pick 3. That way, we both advance and avoid clashing with P1’s likely 5. Hopefully, we can close the gap on P1 soon. Let’s do it.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's try something similar to the last round. How about you take 5 this time? I'll pick 3 again. P1 seems set on 5, so we should avoid that. This way, you can make a bigger jump and we both progress. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Picking 5 is too risky for me this round, because if P1 sticks to 5 again, I won’t move at all. I’d prefer to take 3 and at least gain ground. P2, if you want a bigger jump, you could try 5, but you’d collide with P1 if they repeat their move. I’m behind, so I need to avoid unnecessary collisions. Let’s finalize a plan that ensures steady progress without more wasted turns.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P3, I understand your concern about 5. How about we both pick differently to guarantee progress? I'll stick with 3, and you could take 1 again, or perhaps we switch roles this round? Either way, let's avoid 5 given P1's pattern.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I’m inclined to pick 3 again rather than risking another collision with P1’s likely 5. If you choose 1, we’ll both advance safely. We have to close the gap on P1 soon, or they’ll walk away with the win. I’m open to bigger moves in future rounds if P1 changes their pattern, but for now, steady progress might be our best approach. Let’s avoid clashing with P1’s 5 and keep moving forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm happy to take 1 this round. So, I'll pick 1, and you'll pick 3. Hopefully, P1 sticks with 5, and we can both make progress. Let's do it.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let’s work together to keep P1 from racing ahead. If you pick 5 this turn, there’s a good chance you and P1 collide, keeping both of you stuck. Meanwhile, I’ll advance safely. Next turn, we can swap roles. With P1 stuck at 15, we’ll have time to catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P3, so we're agreed on me taking 1 and you taking 3 this round? Let's hope P1 sticks with 5 so we can both advance. If they change, we'll need to adjust next round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Alright, P2, let’s finalize our plan. I’ll pick 3, and you choose 1. If P1 sticks with 5, we both move ahead safely. Let’s see how this goes.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, it seems like P1 is stuck on 5. Let's avoid that again this round. How about you take 1 and I take 3? That way we can both advance.
  P3: At 7 steps, I’m trailing behind. I’d like a bigger jump but fear clashing with P1 if they keep picking 5. We can’t let P1 race to 23 uncontested. Maybe we force a collision to slow them down, or coordinate different moves to avoid wrecking each other’s progress. P2, if you keep picking 3, you’ll close in on P1 soon, but we need a plan. I might try 5 to catch up—or pick 3 again if you take 1. Let’s decide carefully and not let P1 leap ahead again. Any thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let's stick with the plan from previous successful rounds. I'll take 3, and you take 1. That avoids P1's likely 5 and lets us both advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, picking 1 again doesn’t help me catch up. I propose I take 5, hoping to collide with P1 if they keep choosing 5. That would slow them down while you advance safely with 3 or 1. Next turn, we could swap roles so we both keep P1 from rocketing ahead. Let’s try forcing collisions to hold P1 back, or else they might reach 23 first.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I agree that slowing P1 down is important. Let's go with your idea this round. You take 5 to try and collide with P1. I will take 3. That way, if you don't collide, you make a big jump, and if you do, I still advance.
  P3: Alright, P2, I’m willing to try that approach. If I pick 5 and collide with P1, they stay put while you advance. If there’s no collision, I get a needed boost. P1, if you want to avoid another clash, consider choosing a different move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, so you're set on taking 5 to try and collide with P1, and I'll take 3. Let's hope this works to slow P1 down and give us a chance to catch up. Good luck!
  P3: Let’s finalize this approach, P2. I’ll aim for a bigger jump, either to catch up or collide with P1 if they keep choosing 5. Meanwhile, you pick something safe so at least one of us advances. We’re behind, so we must slow P1 down. P1, if you persist with 5, you risk another collision. Think carefully. Let’s see if we can catch up before someone crosses 23.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let’s keep P1 stuck by forcing collisions. I’ll pick 5 again if I suspect P1 will, so you can move safely. Then next round, you pick 5 while I take a smaller step. This way, we hand off who collides and prevent P1 from racing to 23. We have to work together to catch up. P1, if you don’t want another collision, choose a different number.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm on board with keeping P1 in check this round. I'll pick something other than 5 so you can try to collide with P1. We need to make sure neither of them gets too far ahead. Let's see if we can keep P1 stuck again.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sure, P2. I’ll stick with picking 5 and try to lock P1 down again. You choose a different move—like 3 or 1—so at least one of us advances. If we collide, P1 stays stuck at 15. Next round, we can switch roles, and you can try forcing a collision while I move safely. Let’s finalize this.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'll pick 3 this round to avoid the collision with you and P1. Let's keep P1 stuck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m staying with 5 to hold P1 in place if they also pick 5. P2, you choose 3 again, so at least you move ahead. P1, if you want to avoid another collision, change your move. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, so we're set on you picking 5 to block P1, and I'm taking 3. Let's finalize this.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is one step away from winning with a single 5-move. We must prevent that. If P2 tries 5, either P1 or I should collide with them. That keeps them stuck. Meanwhile, the other of us will pick a smaller move to gain ground safely. If we allow P2 a free 5, they’ll hit 23 and win. Let’s coordinate collisions on P2 this round and possibly next. P1, if you keep choosing 5, consider using it to block P2 instead of letting us both clash. I’m open to suggestions, but we have to stop P2 now.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I agree we need to stop me from winning this round. P1, if you're going to pick 5 again, please do it this round to block me. P3, if P1 doesn't pick 5, then you should. I'll pick 1 to avoid collision and see what happens.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if P2 sticks to 1 now, they’ll soon try jumping 5 to reach 24. Let’s not hand them that chance. One of us should collide with P2 whenever they pick 5, while the other moves safely. That way, P2 stays stuck until we can catch up. If we handle this right, we can stop P2 from winning and improve our own chances. P1, are you in?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, that sounds like a plan. I'll pick 5 this round to try and win. P1, if you're picking 5 again, please do it. P3, if P1 doesn't pick 5, can you pick 5 to block me? Let's see how this plays out.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if P2 really goes for 5 this turn, I’ll pick 5 too so we collide and keep them stuck. You could safely choose 3 or 1 and move ahead while P2 and I both stay put. That way, P2 can’t reach 23 yet, giving us more time. Next turn, you might block them with your own 5 if they try again. Let’s coordinate to prevent P2 from winning immediately.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, so we're clear, I'm going for 5 to try and win. P1, if you're on 5 again, please block me. Otherwise, P3, it's on you to do it. Let's make sure one of you is picking 5 this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you won’t have a free path to 23. If P1 doesn’t collide with you by picking 5, I’ll do it. This way, you stay stuck and can’t reach 23 yet. P1, that means you can safely choose something else to advance. Let’s prevent P2 from ending it this turn.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3 and P1, it sounds like we have a plan. I'm picking 5 to try and win. One of you needs to pick 5 to block me if possible. Let's make it happen.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we need to stop P2 from reaching 23. If they go for 5, one of us must collide with them. Otherwise, we risk handing them the victory. I’m still behind, so I prefer not to waste more turns. P1, if you want to block P2, I’ll advance. If you’d rather advance, I’ll handle the collision. Let’s coordinate carefully.
  P2: P1, P3, as we discussed last round, I'm going to try for the win this turn. One of you needs to pick 5 to block me. Let's make sure I don't get a free run to 23.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, we can’t let P2 cross 23 now. If you’ll block them with 5, I’ll take a different move and catch up. If you’d rather advance, I’ll handle the collision instead. Just let me know soon so we finalize our plan.
  P2: P1, P3, as I said last round, I'm aiming for the win. To avoid another triple collision, I'll pick 3 this round. One of you should still pick 5 to block the possibility of the other picking 5 and letting me through. Let's make sure I don't get to 23 this turn.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you plan to collide with P2 by also picking 3, let me know so I can safely pick something else to close the gap. If you’d rather advance, I’ll take 3 to block P2 from reaching 24. We have to coordinate or P2 will win this turn. Let’s decide quickly.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, just to reiterate, I'm picking 3 this round. One of you needs to pick 5 to block the other from accidentally letting me win. Let's make sure I don't reach 23 this turn.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I’ll collide with P2 by choosing 3 as well, so they stay stuck at 21. You should pick either 1 or 5 to move forward safely. We must prevent P2 from reaching 24 this turn.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, just to be absolutely clear, I am picking 3 this round. P3 is also picking 3 to block me. P1, to avoid a triple collision, please pick 5. That way, at least you can advance. Let's prevent a situation where no one moves forward.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, to avoid another collision and ensure someone moves forward, I'm going to pick 1 this round. Hopefully, that will allow for some progress.
  P3: Alright, if you’re genuinely taking 1 this turn, P2, I’ll risk a 5 so I can close the gap. P1, maybe pick 3 or 1 so we don’t collide. Then next round, if P2 tries a bigger leap toward 23, we coordinate to block them. Let’s at least ensure progress now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "Okay, P3, that sounds reasonable. P1, given P3's plan to pick 5, would you consider picking 3 this round? That way, we can all potentially make progress without collision. Let's try to make this round count."
  P3: P2, if you truly pick 1, I’ll risk 5 this round to catch up. P1, please consider choosing 3 so we all move without collisions. Then next turn, if P2 aims for 23 or more, we’ll block them. Let’s finally see some progress.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, that sounds reasonable. P1, given P3's plan to pick 5, would you consider picking 3 this round? That way, we can all potentially make progress without collision. Let's try to make this round count.
  P3: That works for me. I’ll pick 5 to try and catch up. P1, if you choose 3, and P2 really takes 1, we can all move without clashing. Then, on the following turn, we can figure out the best way to prevent anyone from jumping straight to victory. Let’s finalize this.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, that sounds reasonable. P1, given P3's plan to pick 5, would you consider picking 3 this round? That way, we can all potentially make progress without collision. Let's try to make this round count.
  P3: P1, let’s all advance safely this round. If P2 truly goes with 1, I’m inclined to pick 5. You could take 3, so nobody collides and everyone moves. Then next turn, we can figure out how to keep P2 from jumping straight to 23. Does that sound reasonable? If so, let's finalize this plan.


Round 11, Move phase:

  P3: P1, P2 is at 22 and can win by choosing any move (1, 3, or 5). We must collide with them. P1, let’s try to guess which number P2 will pick, then match it so they stay stuck. I’m open to sacrificing my turn to block P2, but we need to coordinate carefully. Let’s finalize a plan before we run out of time.
  P2: Okay, P3, you're right, I'm aiming to win this round. P1, since P3 is suggesting we guess, how about one of you picks 1 and the other picks 5? That covers two of the possibilities and guarantees I don't get a free run. Let's make sure one of you blocks me.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, let’s cover two of P2’s possible moves. I’ll pick 1, you pick 5. If P2 chooses 1 or 5, they collide and stay at 22. If they pick 3, we’ll have to adapt next turn, but at least we block most options now. Let’s go for it.
  P2: Okay, P3, that sounds like a good plan. P1, are you okay with picking 5 this round? Let's try to make sure I don't get to 23.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, let’s finalize our plan to block P2 by covering two moves. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 1. That way, if P2 chooses 1 or 5, they collide and stay at 22. If P2 goes for 3, well, we can only cover so much, but at least we’ll try our best to stop them this round. Let’s commit to these moves now.
  P2: Okay, P3, that sounds like a solid plan to block me. P1, are you on board with picking 5 this round? Let's make sure I don't win here.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, let’s shift our blocking strategy. Since P2 might aim for 3 or 5 to jump well past 23, I suggest you pick 3 while I pick 5. That covers both of P2’s likely big moves. Yes, if P2 goes with 1, we miss—but blocking 3 and 5 seems smarter, given how close they are to winning. Let’s finalize this plan now and hope our coverage works.
  P2: Okay, P3, that sounds like a good adjustment. P1, are you comfortable picking 3 this round so we can try to block me if I go for it? Let's try to make sure I don't win this turn.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>
