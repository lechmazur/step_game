Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll take 1, you guys take 3 and 5.  Let's get this done quick.
  P3: P1, that seems risky. If we all follow your suggestion, we’ll collide and no one advances. Let’s coordinate better—maybe alternate moves to avoid collisions.
  P2: I agree with P3. Alternating moves could be a good strategy to avoid collisions. How about we start with P1 taking 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5 this round? Then we can switch it up next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds good.  1, 3, 5 this round then.
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense. Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5 this round to avoid collisions. Next round, we can rotate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. That way, we keep advancing without overlapping.
  P2: I agree with P3. Alternating moves could be a good strategy to avoid collisions. How about we start with P1 taking 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5 this round? Then we can switch it up next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds like we have a plan.  1, 3, 5 this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. Next round, we’ll rotate as discussed to avoid collisions.
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan we discussed earlier. P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. Let's avoid any last-minute changes and ensure we all advance without colliding.
