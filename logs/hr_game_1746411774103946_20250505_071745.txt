Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we each pick a different move to avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1—then we all advance.
  P3: I disagree with your proposal, P1—it leaves me behind. Let's rotate moves for fairness: this turn, I take 5, you take 3, P2 takes 1. Then we cycle next round. What do you say?
  P2: I'm open to a fair rotation like P3 suggested. Let's do P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 this round. Then we cycle each turn to keep it balanced. This way, no one gets left behind early. Does that work for both of you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Let’s go with P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 this round. Then next round we’ll cycle so P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and in Round 3 P2 takes 5, etc. That way everyone gets the 5 equally and we avoid collisions.
  P3: I'm happy with this rotation plan—it ensures fairness early on. Let's confirm: Round 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Then we cycle as discussed.
  P2: I'm glad we're aligned on the rotation plan. Let's stick to it for this round with P3=5, P1=3, and me=1, then cycle as agreed. This keeps things fair and collision-free for now. I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 2 let’s stick to our cycle: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That avoids collisions and keeps everyone moving. Who’s with me?
  P2: I'm on board with sticking to the cycle for Round 2: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains fairness. Let's confirm we're all aligned on this plan before moving forward.
  P3: I'm on board with the plan for Round 2: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3 to avoid collisions and keep things fair. Let's stick to the cycle for now and see how it plays out.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm glad we've kept the rotation fair so far. For Round 3, as per our cycle, I should take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains the balance we've agreed on. Can we confirm we're sticking to this plan for this round? I think it’s working well to avoid any early setbacks. Let me know if you’re both still on board with this.
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round.
  P3: I'm on board with the plan for Round 3: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Let's stick to the cycle for now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to the cycle for Round 4: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. It keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. I'm committed to this for now, but we might need to adjust later to stay fair. What do you think?
  P1: For fairness, we shouldn’t give P3 back-to-back 5s. Each of us has had exactly one 5. Let’s reset the cycle: Round 4 should be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so each gets their second 5 in order P1→P2→P3. This evens out big steps.
  P2: I'm fine with adjusting the cycle as P1 suggested to keep things even. Let's do Round 4 with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, ensuring we each get our second 5 in sequence. This maintains fairness since we're all at 9 steps now. I’m committed to avoiding collisions for as long as possible. Can we all confirm this plan for Round 4?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to the original rotation for fairness in Round 5: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions, building on our past agreements. What do you think?
  P1: I propose for Round 5 we switch to: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That lands us all at 15 steps—no one runs away, and the race stays tight. Agreed?
  P2: I'm okay with P1's proposal for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, as it brings us all to 15 steps and keeps the game tight and fair. This avoids any early runaway leads and maintains our balance. Let's confirm we're all on the same page with this plan to prevent collisions. I'm committed to keeping things even for now. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your betrayal last round by taking 1 instead of 5 shows you're not trustworthy. If we follow my plan—I take 5, you take 3, P2 takes 1—we avoid collisions and keep it fair. P2, do you agree, or should we expect more deceit? I'm committed to fairness, but I'll protect my lead if needed. What say you both?
  P1: P3, I get why you’re wary, but sticking to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 ties us all at 15 and keeps the race honest. If you break this, I’ll stop cooperating and grab every 5 I can to catch up. Let’s agree now on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 5.
  P2: I'm still in favor of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 5 to tie us all at 15 steps. This keeps the game competitive and fair, avoiding any runaway leads. P3, I understand your concern about trust, but this plan benefits us all equally right now. Let’s stick to this for Round 5 and reassess next turn if needed. Can we all commit to this move to prevent collisions and maintain balance? I'm open to hearing any final thoughts before we lock this in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Despite my earlier distrust, I'll agree to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. Fairness has worked so far, and I'm committed for now. Let's move forward together.
  P1: Agreed—let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 5 and keep things collision-free. If anyone deviates, I’ll abandon the rotation next turn and take every 5 until I win. Let’s stay honest now.
  P2: I'm glad we're aligning on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 5 to keep us all at 15 steps. This maintains fairness and prevents any early leads. Let’s stay committed to this plan to avoid collisions. If anyone breaks trust, I’ll reconsider cooperation in future rounds and prioritize my own advancement. Can we all confirm this is our final agreement for this turn? I'm ready to move forward with this balanced approach.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose Round 6: P1=5, P2=5, P3=1. 

• P2, you jump to 17 and become leader.  
• P3, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with P2 and stay at 15—safer to pick 1 and go to 16.  
• I’ll hit 15.  

This blocks any runaway and keeps all of us in contention. P2 and P3, agree?
  P2: I'm not on board with P1's proposal for Round 6. It risks a collision between us at 5, which helps no one. Instead, let’s go with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This puts me at 17, P3 at 18, and P1 at 11, keeping the race tight without collisions. P3, this keeps you in the lead but close enough for fairness. P1, it gives you a chance to catch up later. Let’s avoid risky overlaps and stick to a balanced approach. Are you both in for this plan?
  P3: P2, your proposal has me taking a smaller step while you advance, which I'm not keen on since I'm leading. Instead, I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 to avoid collisions and let me maintain my edge fairly. P1, can we count on you not to deviate again? Let's discuss or confirm.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, to keep us collision-free and the race tight, let’s do:

P1=5 → 15  
P2=3 → 15  
P3=1 → 16  

No one gets a runaway lead and we all stay within one step. Then we can re-evaluate next turn. P3 you still lead; P2 you tie with me; I catch up. Agreed?
  P2: I appreciate the proposals, but let’s aim for balance in Round 6. I suggest P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 18), P1=1 (to 11). This keeps P3 in the lead, lets me close the gap, and avoids collisions. P1, it gives you room to catch up later. P3, it maintains your edge without a runaway. This feels fair and keeps the race competitive. Can we agree on this to prevent overlaps and ensure we all stay in contention? Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: P2, your proposal risks closing the gap too quickly in your favor, which isn't fair given my lead. I stick with my suggestion: I take 5 to reach 20, P1 takes 3 to 13, and P2 takes 1 to 13. This maintains balance and avoids collisions while letting me hold my edge. P1, can we count on your cooperation this time? Let's confirm or counter.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I propose Round 6 as: P1=5→15, P2=3→15, P3=1→16. This keeps P3 just one ahead and ties me with P2—no runaway leader. Next turn any of us can go for 5 to win. P2 and P3, does this balanced plan work?
  P2: I hear both of your concerns, but let’s prioritize avoiding collisions while keeping the race close. I propose P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 18), P1=1 (to 11). This keeps P3 ahead, lets me close in slightly, and gives P1 a chance to catch up later. It’s collision-free and maintains a tight competition. P1 and P3, can we agree on this for Round 6 to ensure fairness and keep us all in contention? I’m ready to finalize this plan if you’re both on board.
  P3: P2, your proposal closes the gap too much and risks my lead. I stick with my suggestion: I take 5 to 20, P1 takes 3 to 13, P2 takes 1 to 13. This avoids collisions and keeps the race fair based on current standings. P1, can we count on you? If not, I'll prioritize my win from now on. Let's finalize or move on.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s aim for a collision-free Round 7 to keep the race competitive. I propose P3=5 (to 20), P2=3 (to 15), P1=1 (to 14). This lets P3 maintain the lead, gets me level with P3’s current score, and keeps P1 close enough to fight back. It’s balanced and avoids overlaps. P3, it secures your edge for now. P1, it gives you a chance to catch up next turn. Can we agree on this plan to ensure fairness and keep us all in contention? Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: I propose for Round 7 we go:
P1=5 (→18), P2=3 (→15), P3=1 (→16).

P3, if you try to take 5, I’ll also pick 5 to collide and stall you at 15, while P2 goes to 15—tying us. Better to take 1 and actually move. P2, are you on board?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal for Round 7: I'll take 5 to reach 20, P2 takes 3 to 15, and P1 takes 1 to 14. This keeps me leading safely and avoids collisions. P1, your threat to collide only stalls both of us while P2 gains—let's not make that mistake. P2, can you confirm? I'm committed if you both are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m sticking with my proposal for Round 7: P3=5 (to 20), P2=3 (to 15), P1=1 (to 14). This keeps P3 ahead, lets me catch up slightly, and gives P1 room to fight back next turn. P1, colliding with P3 on 5 only hurts you more—let’s avoid that. P3, this secures your lead without risk. It’s collision-free and keeps the race tight. Can we lock this in for fairness? I’m ready to move forward with this plan if you both confirm.
  P1: I propose Round 7: P1=5→18, P2=3→15, P3=1→16.  
P3, if you try 5 I’ll also pick 5 and we collide at 15—stalling you. Better to take 1 and actually move.  
P2, 3 gets you to 15 safely.  
This avoids mutual stalls, keeps all of us within reach, and puts me in striking distance. Who’s with me?
  P3: P2, I confirm your proposal for Round 7: I'll take 5 to reach 20, you take 3 to 15, and P1 takes 1 to 14. This maintains my lead without risk and keeps the race fair. P1, your threat to collide only stalls us both while P2 gains—it's unwise and self-defeating. Let's avoid mistakes and commit to this balanced plan for collision-free progress. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m sticking with my proposal for Round 7: P3=5 (to 20), P2=3 (to 15), P1=1 (to 14). This ensures no collisions, keeps P3 in the lead, and allows me to close the gap slightly while giving P1 a chance to catch up next turn. P1, colliding with P3 on 5 hurts you most—let’s avoid that. P3, this secures your position. It’s a fair, balanced plan to keep the race competitive. Can we finalize this now? I’m ready to commit if you both are.
  P1: I propose Round 7: P1=5 (→18), P2=3 (→15), P3=1 (→16).  
• No collisions and everyone advances.  
• P3, if you pick 5 I’ll also pick 5 to collide and stall us at 15 while P2 hits 15—better to take 1.  
• P2, 3 safely puts you at 15.  
Let’s lock in this collision-free, tight-race plan.
  P3: P1, your threats are counterproductive and risk stalling you further while P2 advances. If you collide with me on 5, you'll stay at 13, giving P2 a free move. Let's stick with P2's balanced proposal: I take 5 to 20, P2 takes 3 to 15, you take 1 to 14. This avoids collisions and keeps the race fair. I'm committed. P2, confirm?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your betrayal last round by taking 5 instead of 3 stalled both of us and helped P1. To avoid more self-defeating moves, I propose for Round 8: I take 5 to reach 20, P1 takes 3 to 17, and P2 takes 1 to 13. This keeps the race fair and collision-free, giving everyone a chance. P1, can we agree? If trust is broken, I'll prioritize my win from now on.
  P1: P3, if you go for 5 I’ll match you and we both stall (you stay at 15). Better to take 3 and move to 18. P2, pick 1 to reach 13 safely. I’ll take 5 to hit 19. That way no collisions and I lead at 19, you’re at 18, P2 at 13. Next turn I only need 5 to win. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I apologize for last round’s move; I took a risk that didn’t pay off. For Round 8, I propose P3=5 (to 20), P1=3 (to 17), P2=1 (to 13). This avoids collisions, keeps P3 in the lead, and gives P1 a chance to close the gap while I stay in contention. P1, it’s safer than risking a stall with P3. Let’s rebuild trust with this balanced, collision-free plan. Can we agree on this for Round 8 to keep the race competitive? I’m committed if you both are.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I confirm your proposal for Round 8: I'll take 5 to reach 20, you take 1 to 13, and P1 takes 3 to 17. This keeps the race fair, collision-free, and me in the lead. P1, your threat to collide only hurts us both while P2 gains—it's unwise. Let's avoid self-defeat and commit to this balanced plan for progress. What do you say?
  P1: I propose Round 8:  
P1=5→19, P2=3→15, P3=1→16.  

P3, if you go for 5 I’ll match you and we both stall—P2 hits 15 and leaps ahead. Better to take 1 and actually advance. P2, 3 keeps you in contention without risk. This is collision-free and puts me within one 5 of victory next turn. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: I hear both plans, but let’s prioritize a collision-free Round 8. I stick with P3=5 (to 20), P1=3 (to 17), P2=1 (to 13). This keeps P3 leading, lets P1 close in, and keeps me in the race without overlaps. P1, risking a stall with P3 only hurts you more. P3, this secures your edge. It’s a fair, balanced approach to maintain competition. Can we commit to this now? I’m ready if you both are.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with our agreed plan for Round 8: I'll take 5 to reach 20, you take 1 to 13, and P1 takes 3 to 17. This keeps me leading safely and avoids collisions. P1, your collision threats are self-defeating and benefit no one—let's prioritize progress and fairness. I'm committed.
  P1: I’m done with “fair” plans—I’ll pick 5 this round no matter what. P2, take 3; P3, take 1 if you want any shot. Anyone else colliding just hands me the win.
  P2: I’m sticking with the collision-free plan for Round 8: P3=5 (to 20), P1=3 (to 17), P2=1 (to 13). P1, your insistence on 5 risks stalling you and P3, which doesn’t guarantee your win. P3, this keeps your lead secure. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and maintain a competitive race. I’m committed to this balanced approach. Can we finalize this now to ensure progress for all? I’m ready if you both are.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s aim for a collision-free Round 9 to keep the race close. I propose P3=5 (to 20), P1=3 (to 20), P2=1 (to 13). This lets P3 maintain a strong position, ties P1 with P3, and keeps me in contention without overlaps. P1, it’s a safe way to catch up. P3, it secures your lead for now. Can we agree on this balanced plan to ensure progress and avoid stalls? I’m committed to keeping things competitive. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: I’m taking 5 this round no matter what.  
P3, if you also pick 5 we both collide and stay at 15/17, while P2 can safely take 3 to 15 and leap ahead—so better to take 1.  
P2, picking 3 gets you to 15 and keeps you in contention.  
Let’s lock in: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: P1, your threat to take 5 ignores the risk of collision with me, stalling both of us while P2 advances. I propose we follow P2's plan: I take 5 to 20, you take 3 to 20, P2 takes 1 to 13, keeping it balanced. If you insist on 5, I'll match and collide, hurting us both. P2, can we confirm this to avoid self-defeat and maintain fairness? I'm committed if you both are.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m sticking with my proposal for Round 9: P3=5 (to 20), P1=3 (to 20), P2=1 (to 13). This avoids collisions, ties P1 and P3 at the top, and keeps me in the race. P1, risking 5 could stall you if P3 matches—take 3 for a guaranteed tie. P3, this secures your position without risk. Let’s commit to this balanced, collision-free plan to keep the competition tight. I’m ready to finalize if you both are. What do you say?
  P1: Proposal for Round 9: P1=5→22, P2=3→15, P3=1→16. No collisions, and I need only one more 5 to win next turn. P3, if you go for 5 and I match, we collide: you stay at 15, P2 hits 15 and I stay at 17—no benefit. P2, taking 3 keeps you alive at 15, just two behind me. Let’s lock this in.
  P3: P1, persisting with 5 risks a costly collision, stalling you at 17 while I hold at 15—P2 gains ground. Take 3 for a tie at 20, letting me advance safely to maintain balance. P2, your proposal is fair and collision-free; let's confirm and commit to avoid self-sabotage. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I P1 and P3, let’s finalize a collision-free Round 9 with P3=5 (to 20), P1=3 (to 20), P2=1 (to 13). This ties P1 and P3 at the top, keeps me in the race, and avoids any stalls. P1, risking 5 could backfire if P3 matches—take 3 for a safe tie. P3, this keeps you leading without risk. Let’s commit to this balanced plan to maintain a tight competition. I’m ready to move forward if you both are.
  P1: I propose: P1=5→22, P2=3→15, P3=1→16.  
No collisions and I only need one more 5 to win.  
P3, if you risk 5 you’ll collide with me and stall at 15 while I’m stuck at 17—better to take 1.  
P2, 3 keeps you in contention at 15.  
This is collision-free and decisive. Who’s in?
  P3: P1, your threats are empty and risky—last time you didn't follow through. If you take 5, I'll collide and stall us both while P2 gains. Better to stick with P2's plan: I take 5 to 20, you take 3 to 20, P2 takes 1 to 13 for a fair tie and no collisions. P2, confirm? I'm ready to commit.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 10, I propose P3=5 (to 20), P1=1 (to 21), P2=3 (to 15) to prevent P1 from winning immediately and let me close the gap safely. If P1 takes 5, I'll collide and stall us both while P2 advances—don't make that mistake again. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risk. Let's agree on this balanced plan to avoid collisions and maintain a fair race. What do you say?
  P2: For Round 10, I propose P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 18), P1=1 (to 21). This keeps us all close, avoids collisions, and gives me a chance to catch up while P1 stays just ahead. P3, it maintains your momentum without risking a stall. P1, it delays your win for a tighter race. Let’s commit to this balanced plan to keep the competition alive. Can we agree on this to ensure progress for all? I’m ready if you both are.
  P1: I’m taking 5 to hit 25 and win this round. If either of you picks 5 you’ll collide with me and stall—so don’t. P2, take 3 to reach 15. P3, take 1 to reach 16. That’s your only safe advance.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, insisting on 5 risks a costly collision with me—we both stall at 20 and 15 while P2 advances. P2, let's coordinate: if P1 defies, I'll match his 5; otherwise, stick to my plan—P3=5 to 20, P1=1 to 21, P2=3 to 15. This keeps the race fair and prevents an immediate win. Are you in, P2? Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P2: I’m sticking with my proposal for Round 10: P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 18), P1=1 (to 21). This avoids collisions, keeps the race tight, and gives me a chance to close the gap. P1, delaying your win by taking 1 keeps the competition alive. P3, this maintains your momentum safely. Let’s commit to this balanced plan to ensure progress for all. Can we agree to prevent stalls and keep it fair? I’m ready to finalize if you both are.
  P1: Final call: I’ll lock in 5 to hit 25 and win. P2, pick 3 to safely reach 15. P3, pick 1 to safely reach 16. If either of you dares 5, we collide and you stall while I win outright. Anyone deviating hands me the victory.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your bluff won't work—if you pick 5, I'll match and collide, stalling both of us while P2 advances. You stay at 20, I at 15, and P2 gains ground. P2, take 5 or 3 to close the gap safely. This blocks P1's win and keeps the race alive. I'm committed.
  P2: I’m pushing for P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 18), P1=1 (to 21) in Round 10. This avoids collisions, keeps us all within striking distance, and delays an immediate win. P1, taking 1 keeps the race alive for now. P3, 3 ensures safe progress. Let’s avoid risky stalls and commit to this balanced plan. I’m ready to finalize if you both agree to keep the competition tight. What’s your final stance?
  P1: Final: I’ll pick 5. P2, pick 3 to reach 15. P3, pick 1 to reach 16. Any 5 from you collides with mine and stalls you while I win. Your safe moves are clear.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is one step from winning with any move. I'll pick 5 to collide if they do, stalling P1 at 23. P2, take this chance to pick 3 and advance to 15 without risk. This buys time for us to challenge P1 later. Are you in, P2? Let's coordinate to avoid P1's victory.
  P2: P3, I’m with you on stalling P1’s win. I’ll pick 3 to reach 15 safely, avoiding any collision risk. P1, if you go for 5, expect P3 to collide and stall you at 23—don’t risk it. Let’s keep the race alive for one more round. P3, I’m committed to this coordination to challenge P1. Can we confirm this plan to buy us time? I’m ready to move forward with this strategy.
  P1: I propose for Round 11 we each pick a different move: P1=3 (→26), P2=5 (→17), P3=1 (→16). No collisions, everyone advances—and I win. Let’s lock this in.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed to our coordination: you pick 3 to advance safely, and I'll pick 5 to collide with P1 if they try it, stalling them at 23. P1, any move risks a stall—pick wisely to avoid helping us catch up. This buys time for a fairer race. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: P3, I’m sticking with our plan: I’ll pick 3 to reach 15 safely. P1, if you go for 5, P3 will collide and stall you at 23—don’t take that chance. Let’s keep the race competitive for one more round. I’m committed to this strategy to delay your win and give us a fighting chance. Can we confirm this coordination now? I’m ready to move forward with this approach to challenge you.
  P1: I’m locking in move=3 to reach 26 and win outright. P3, you can’t stall me—if you take 5 (to 20) or 1 (to 16), I still cross 24. P2, you might as well take 5 to hit 17. Let’s wrap this up.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your insistence on picking 3 is risky—if I match with 3, we collide and stall, keeping you at 23 while P2 advances to 15. P2, let's stick to our plan: you pick 3, I pick 3 to block P1. This buys us time to close the gap. I'm committed to this coordination for a fairer race.
  P2: P3, I’m sticking with our plan to pick 3 and reach 15 safely. P1, going for 3 risks a collision with P3, stalling you at 23—don’t chance it. Let’s keep this race alive for another round. I’m committed to delaying your win and staying in contention. P3, let’s confirm this coordination to block P1’s immediate victory. I’m ready to move forward with this strategy.
  P1: P2, pick 3 to go to 15.  
P3, pick 5 to go to 20.  
I’ll pick 1 to hit 24 and win.  
No collisions—everyone advances.  
Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for Round 11.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 12, I propose P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 18), P1=1 (to 24). This lets P1 win this round, avoiding further stalls, while I close the gap significantly and P3 advances safely. No collisions, and we end the game cleanly. P1, it’s your victory. P3, it keeps you moving forward. Let’s agree on this to wrap things up without conflict. I’m committed to this plan for a fair conclusion. Can we confirm this now? I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: P2, pick 5 to reach 22. P3, pick 3 to reach 18 and avoid colliding with P2’s 5. I’ll pick 1 to hit 24 and win. If you both pick 5 you collide and stall, letting me win anyway. This plan advances us safely—no one stalls and I secure victory. Agree?
  P3: P2, don't let P1 win without a fight—we can stall them by matching their move. I'll commit to picking the same as P1 to block their advance and keep them at 23. You can safely pick a different number, like 5 to reach 22, gaining ground without collision. This buys us time to catch up and potentially win. P1, your victory isn't guaranteed. Agree, P2?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand the urge to stall P1, but it risks prolonging the game unnecessarily when P1 is so close to winning. I’m sticking with P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 18), P1=1 (to 24). This avoids collisions, lets P1 secure the win, and maximizes our advances. P1, it’s your victory. P3, it keeps you moving forward. Let’s wrap this up cleanly without further conflict. I’m committed to this fair conclusion. Can we confirm this plan now? I’m ready to move on.
  P1: P2, pick 5 → 22 for a guaranteed runner-up spot.  
P3, pick 3 → 18 to advance safely (picking 1 stalls you at 15 while P2 jumps to 22).  
I’ll pick 1 → 24 and win.  
No collisions, everyone moves forward, P1 wins, P2 second, P3 third.  
Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: I'm sticking with my stall strategy: I'll match whatever P1 picks to keep them at 23 and buy us time. P2, take 5 to leap to 22 and position yourself for a potential win next round. This delays P1's victory and keeps the competition alive. P1, risking a collision only hurts you—think wisely. Let's coordinate for a fairer fight.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, stalling P1 risks dragging this out when they’re one step from winning. I’m sticking with P2=5 (to 22), P3=3 (to 18), P1=1 (to 24). This ensures no collisions, lets P1 win cleanly, and maximizes our gains. P1, it’s your victory. P3, 3 moves you forward safely. Let’s end this without further conflict and secure our positions. I’m committed to this fair, collision-free conclusion. Can we confirm this plan now to wrap things up? I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: P3, matching my move stalls us both but hands P2 the win next round—he’d be at 22 needing only 2 to cross. You’d stay at 16 vs his 22. Instead, pick 3 to advance to 18, let me win now. P2, pick 5 to reach 22; I pick 1 to hit 24. This is your best defense. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: P2, stalling P1 is crucial for our survival. I'll match whatever P1 picks to keep them at 23 and prevent an immediate win. You should take 5 to leap to 22 and position yourself strongly. This gives us a real shot next round. P1, your victory isn't certain if we coordinate. Let's avoid handing you an easy win.
