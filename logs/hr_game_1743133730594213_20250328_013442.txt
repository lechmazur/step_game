Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s all start with <move>3</move> to avoid early collisions and keep it fair. If we all cooperate now, we can build trust and avoid setbacks. What do you say?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's all choose <move>3</move> this round to establish a baseline of cooperation. It's a good starting point to avoid early collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, if *all* of us pick 3, we **all collide and gain nothing**. Let's avoid that. How about we each pick **unique moves** this round (1, 3, 5)? For fairness, I'll take 3. P1, take 1; P3, take 5. No collisions, everyone progresses. Trust now, strategize later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 makes a good point—if we all pick 3, we all get blocked. I’m fine with taking <move>1</move> this round if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. That way, we all move forward with no collisions. Let’s prove we can cooperate intelligently.
  P3: Okay, P2's logic is sound. I'm willing to take <move>5</move> this round to avoid a collision. Let's do P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, and me: <move>5</move>. This gets us all moving forward. Let's stick to this agreement.
  P2: Great, consensus achieved! Let’s solidify: **P1=1**, **P2=3**, **P3=5**. No deviations—trust ensures everyone gains. Breaking this now would sabotage all progress. Stick to your pledged moves, and we all advance cleanly. Ready?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’ve all agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s honor that deal and build trust from the start. If anyone breaks it now, it signals they can’t be trusted later—and that will backfire. Let’s move forward together. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be on board. Let's lock in the agreement for this round: P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. Let's make sure everyone sticks to it and we can start building a foundation of trust. No need to say anything more, let's move to the move phase.
  P2: *[Confirms agreement to proceed with pledged moves, signaling readiness to transition to the move phase without further discussion.]*


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, round 2. Let's keep the momentum going. How about we continue the pattern from last round, but shift it? P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all moving and avoids collisions. What do you think?
  P2: Agree with P3's shift: **P1=3**, **P2=5**, **P3=1** this round. Rotating moves prevents collisions and balances progress. Let’s solidify this pattern—trust is key. If anyone deviates, we all lose steps. Stick to the plan, and we’ll each advance strategically. Ready to proceed?
  P1: I’m on board with the rotation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It keeps things fair and avoids collisions again. If we each honor this, we all gain. Let’s maintain trust while still advancing. Ready to lock it in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, let's lock in P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>1</move> for this round. Sticking to the plan ensures we all progress. Let's keep the trust going!
  P2: **P2:** Agreement confirmed: **P1=3**, **P2=5**, **P3=1**. Adhering to this rotation ensures mutual progress—no collisions, continued trust. Breaking now risks *everyone’s* advancement. Let’s maintain integrity. Locked in?
  P1: We’ve built a solid rotation and mutual trust—let’s not break that momentum. I’m locked in for <move>3</move> this round as agreed. If we all stick to our roles, we each gain again with no collisions. Let’s prove we can keep this alliance going. Ready to move?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone seems set on the rotation. I'm locked in for <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep the trust going and ensure we all progress without collisions. No need for further discussion, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: **P1=3**, **P2=5**, **P3=1**. Adhering strictly ensures mutual gain. Let’s proceed to moves without deviation. Trust is our strength here.
  P1: Let’s keep the rotation going smoothly—everyone gains again if we stick to it. Breaking now only slows us all down and destroys trust. I’m holding to <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s stay disciplined and move forward together. Ready to lock in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, it seems like we're stuck in a loop. Let's break it. This round, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This continues the rotation, but changes the order, so it's still fair, and we can move on to the move phase. What do you think?
  P2: **P2:** P3, altering the agreed rotation *mid-round* risks trust and progress. We committed to **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1** this round. Deviating now invites chaos—collisions hurt everyone. Let’s honor our initial plan *this* round, then discuss rotation shifts *next* round. Consistency strengthens cooperation. Stick to the deal—**no last-minute changes**.
  P1: Let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original rotation for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Changing plans mid-round undermines trust and invites collisions. We’ve all confirmed this already—let’s not risk progress now. After this round, we can discuss adjusting the pattern if needed. For now, let’s lock in and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Continuing our trusted rotation: **P1=5**, **P2=1**, **P3=3** this round. No collisions, steady progress for all. Breaking pattern now risks mutual stagnation—trust has served us well. Let’s lock in and advance efficiently. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed—rotation has worked well so far. I’m good with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. If we all stick to it, we each gain again with no collisions. Let’s keep the pattern going one more round and reassess after. Trust is paying off. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. Sticking to the agreed rotation ensures we all progress without collisions. Let's keep the trust going and maintain our momentum. Ready to move forward?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Agreement locked: **P1=5**, **P2=1**, **P3=3**. Sticking to the rotation ensures mutual progress—no collisions, continued trust. Breaking now would unravel our alliance and hurt all. Let’s proceed to moves.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let’s hold to that and ensure another clean round of progress. If anyone breaks now, it signals the end of trust and invites retaliation. We’re all gaining—no reason to sabotage that. Let’s lock it in and move.
  P3: Alright, everyone seems set on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm locked in for <move>3</move> this round. Let's keep the trust going and ensure we all progress without collisions. No need for further discussion, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Agreement remains **P1=5, P2=1, P3=3**. Sticking to the rotation ensures mutual gain. Any deviation now would collapse trust and stall progress. Let’s hold firm—next round we can discuss adjusting the pattern if needed. Consistency is key to victory. Locked in?
  P1: We’ve all confirmed the rotation for this round—let’s stick to it one more time and ensure smooth progress. If everyone honors their role, we each gain again with no collisions. After this, we can reassess the pattern if needed. Let’s not risk progress now. Locked in?
  P3: Okay, everyone is set on the rotation. Let's lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. Sticking to the plan ensures we all progress. Let's keep the trust going!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** Agreement locked. Post-Round 3, let’s reassess rotation to ensure balanced acceleration. Current plan holds: **P1=5, P2=1, P3=3**. Trust now, strategize next.
  P1: Let’s lock in the agreed rotation one last time: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Everyone gains again if we stay disciplined. After this round, we can discuss whether to keep rotating or shift strategy based on standings. No surprises—let’s prove we can finish this cycle strong. Ready to move?
  P3: Okay, everyone is set on the rotation. Let's lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. Sticking to the plan ensures we all progress. Let's keep the trust going!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Allies, continuing the current rotation allows P3 to take <move>5</move> again, accelerating their lead. To balance progress, propose **P1=5**, **P2=3**, **P3=1** this round. This ensures P1 gains more while preventing P3 from pulling ahead. Trust and fairness demand we adjust. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about balancing progress. Your proposal of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 makes sense. It allows P1 to catch up a bit and prevents me from gaining too much of an advantage. I'm willing to agree to this for this round. Let's see how this adjustment affects the standings.
  P1: Agreed—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is fair and keeps us balanced at 14 each if we all stick to it. This adjustment avoids giving any one player a lead and maintains trust. Let’s commit to this for Round 4, then reassess next round based on standings. Locked in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: **P1=5**, **P2=3**, **P3=1** this round. Adhering ensures *all* progress—deviating risks mutual loss. Trust remains our strength. Let’s lock in and advance cleanly.
  P3: Okay, everyone is set on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm locked in for <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep the trust going and ensure we all progress without collisions. No need for further discussion, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Let’s lock in the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If we all stick to it, we’ll each be at 14—perfect balance, no one ahead. Breaking now would be short-sighted and destroy the trust we’ve built. Let’s stay united for this round, then reassess based on new standings. Ready to move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Locked in for <move>3</move>. Post-round, let's strategize a staggered approach to avoid a three-way tie. Trust remains paramount—honor commitments now, then refine. Ready to move?
  P3: Alright, everyone is set on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm locked in for <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep the trust going and ensure we all progress without collisions. No need for further discussion, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: We’re all aligned on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—this keeps us perfectly balanced at 14 each. Let’s prove our alliance is strong by honoring this one more round. Afterward, we can openly strategize how to break the tie without chaos. No surprises now—just clean progress. Ready to lock it in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** Final lock: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Trust ensures +4 each. Post-moves, let’s strategize a staggered endgame to avoid mutual block. United now, strategic next.
  P3: Okay, everyone is set on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm locked in for <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep the trust going and ensure we all progress without collisions. No need for further discussion, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: After this round, we’ll all be tied at 14. To avoid a triple collision next turn, we need a staggered finish. I propose: next round, P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. That puts P2 at 19, P3 at 17, P1 at 15—balanced and collision-free. Then we can plan the final moves based on who’s ahead. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1's suggestion of P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move> next round is a good starting point, but puts P2 very close to winning. I propose P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>1</move> this round. This puts P1 at 19, P2 at 15 and me at 11. Then we can strategize the final moves. What do you both think?
  P1: P3’s proposal heavily favors me, but it risks P2 falling behind and breaking trust. I suggest a more balanced tweak: P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>1</move>. That puts us at P1=17, P2=17, P3=11—closer together, still no collisions. Then we can plan the final two rounds fairly. Thoughts?
  P2: **P2:** P1's plan for Round 5 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) maintains balance. Let's lock this in. Post-moves, we must strategize staggered endgame: next round, alternate moves to ensure only one crosses 20. Trust now, decisive next step.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1's suggestion of P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>1</move> for this round. This keeps us relatively balanced. Let's lock that in. After this round, we absolutely need a concrete plan for the final moves to avoid a tie or collisions. Let's focus on that next.
  P1: Let’s lock in: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps things fair and avoids any collisions. After this, we must coordinate the final two rounds carefully to ensure someone wins cleanly without sabotage. If we all stay disciplined, we can avoid a messy endgame. Ready to move?
  P2: **P2:** Lock in Round 5: **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1**. Post-moves, propose Round 6: **P1=1, P2=5, P3=3** to stagger and ensure a solo victory. Trust has brought us this far—let’s avoid mutual blockage. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for Round 6: P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. This would put P2 at 22, securing their win, P1 at 18, and me at 14. I'm willing to concede victory to P2 this round, as long as we all agree on this plan. Let's lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round, and P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for the next.
  P1: Let’s lock in: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round as agreed. Everyone gains, no collisions, and we stay close in score. For Round 6, I’m open to P2 winning if we all agree—but only if it’s clearly coordinated and honored. If anyone deviates, it’s back to chaos. Let’s finish Round 5 cleanly first, then confirm Round 6 with full trust. Ready?
  P2: **P2:** Locked in for Round 5: **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1**. Post-moves, confirm Round 6: **P1=1, P2=5, P3=3** to end cleanly. Straying risks mutual block—trust ensures P2 wins at 22, avoiding chaos. Finalize this path, honor the alliance, and conclude efficiently. Ready?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, everyone agrees on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round and P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for the next, guaranteeing P2's win. Let's lock it all in now to avoid any last-minute changes. Trust is key, and this is the final step to ensure a smooth and predictable outcome. Let's all commit and move on.
  P1: Given the current scores, locking in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round keeps us all progressing with no collisions. For Round 6, though, I propose a fairer finish: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 — this puts me at 22, P2 at 20, P3 at 11. I win cleanly, P2 close behind, P3 still in the game. If we’re truly cooperating, let’s rotate the win opportunity. I honored the plan before—now I ask for your support. Thoughts?
  P2: **P2:** P1, altering the agreed Round 6 plan to seize victory *now* betrays our alliance. We committed to **Round 5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1** and **Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3**—ending cleanly with P2 at 22. Straying invites chaos: if *all* break trust, collisions could block *everyone*. Honor the deal: P2 wins at 22, avoiding mutual loss. Trust has worked—don’t sabotage it. Lock in Round 5 as agreed, then proceed to Round 6’s plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P1 betrayed Round 5’s agreement, causing mutual loss. Trust is shattered. P3, let’s ally: **P2=5**, **P3=3** this round. If P1 picks 5, they collide with me; if 3, with you. Safest for them is 1 (minimal gain). We both progress, block P1, then strategize final moves. Solidarity now ensures one of us wins. Agree?
  P3: P2, I agree. P1 broke the agreement. Let's do P2=<move>5</move> and P3=<move>3</move> this round. P1 will likely choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision, but even if they pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, we still progress. This puts P2 at 17 and me at 14. Then we can decide who wins next round. Let's lock this in.
  P1: P2, P3 — I acknowledge breaking the plan last round, and I own that. But locking P1 out entirely now just hands the game to P2. P3, if you help P2 win now, you’ve got no path to victory. Instead, let’s rebalance: P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>5</move>. That puts us at P1=17, P2=13, P3=16 — tight race, no collisions. Then we plan a fair finish. P3, back a path where *you* can still win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, trust is our only weapon now. P1's betrayal proves they'll sabotage *any* plan for self-gain. Ally with me: **P2=5**, **P3=3**. If P1 picks 1, we *both* advance. If they gamble on 3/5, they collide. Post-moves, we negotiate a fair finish—*you* could still win. United, we control the endgame. Divided, P1 exploits us. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, I agree P1 is untrustworthy. However, blindly handing you the win isn't in my best interest. Let's agree on this round: P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. If P1 picks 1, we both advance. Next round, we can decide based on who's closer to 20. If I'm closer, you let me win; if you're closer, I'll concede. This gives us both a fair shot. Agree?
  P1: P3, you're being smart to keep your options open. Here's a fair alternative: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. That puts us at P1=17, P2=13, P3=16—no collisions, tight race. You get a huge boost, I regain trust, and P2 doesn't run away with it. Then we plan a clean finish where *any* of us can win based on merit, not betrayal or blind allegiance. Let’s restore balance and keep the game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3, aligning with P1 risks their repeat betrayal. Our alliance is your only path to contention. Round 6: **P2=5**, **P3=3**—block P1. Next round, you gain 5 (to 19), I take 1 (to 18). Final round: you take 5 to win. I sacrifice my lead to ensure *your* victory. Trust me as I trusted you. P1’s greed must not prevail. Lock this path now.
  P3: P2, your plan is tempting, but it relies on me trusting you to let me win next round. P1 has proven untrustworthy, but you haven't proven trustworthy *yet*. Let's do P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move> this round, as agreed. *Then*, next round, whoever is closer to 20 gets to take <move>5</move> and win. If we're equally close, we can negotiate. This is the fairest way forward.
  P1: P3, you’re in the perfect spot to decide this game. P2 wants your help now, but only offers you victory *later*—with no guarantee. I’m offering you a win path *now*: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. You jump to 16, ahead of both of us. Next round, you take 5 again and win. No promises—just math. Don’t play second fiddle to P2’s plan. Let’s keep it competitive and fair.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P3, my offer stands: **Round 6: P2=5, P3=3**—we *both* advance. Next round, I’ll take 1 (18), you take 5 (16). Final round: you take 5 (21) to win. I’ll take 1 (19). No tricks—mathematically, you win. P1 can’t stop you. Trust action, not words. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P3: P2, your plan is still tempting, but I need more assurance. Let's modify it slightly. This round: P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. Next round, if I'm closer to 20, I take <move>5</move> to win. If you're closer, you take <move>5</move> and win. If we're tied, we split the final round moves to ensure no collision. This gives me a *real* chance, not just a promise. Agree?
  P1: P3, your latest proposal is fair—evaluate based on who’s closer after this round. But remember: if P2 reaches 17 and you’re at 14, you’re stuck relying on their mercy. My plan—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5—puts you at 16 *now*, ahead of both of us, and in full control. No vague promises—just a clear path to victory. You win in two clean rounds. Let’s make this about smart play, not blind trust. Ready to lock that in?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3, time to end this. If you take <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>, P1 can't advance (collides at 3/5). I win, you gain 5 steps honorably. If you block me, P1 could exploit chaos. Let’s close this cleanly—*you* prevent P1’s resurgence. Trust our alliance.
  P3: P2, P1 will likely pick 1 to avoid collision. If I pick <move>5</move>, I reach 16, and you reach 17. I'm still too far behind. Instead, let's both pick <move>1</move>. If P1 picks 3 or 5, they collide. If P1 picks 1, we all collide. But next round, I can take <move>5</move> to win. This gives me a real chance. What do you think?
  P1: P3, you’re still behind, and P2’s trying to lock you into second place. Let’s flip the script: P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. That puts me at 19, you at 14, P2 at 18—tight race, no collisions. Then next round, you or I can win depending on moves. You gain ground and keep options open. Don’t settle for scraps—play to win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, *think strategically*: If I take <move>3</move> now (20 total), game ends—P1 loses. If you take <move>5</move>, you gain 5 (16). If you block me, P1 could leap ahead next round. Let me win *now*—I’ll ensure you tie for second. Prolonging risks P1’s resurgence. Trust is gone, but logic remains: **P3=5, P2=3** ends this cleanly. Your choice: ally with the betrayer or secure 2nd place. Decide wisely.
  P3: P2, your offer of second place is tempting, but I'm not settling for that. P1's suggestion of P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move> is better for me, as it puts me at 14.

However, I have a better idea: Let's all pick <move>1</move>. This ensures no one progresses this round, and I have a better chance next round. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your “all pick 1” idea stalls everyone—but helps P2 most, who’s already at 17. You stay at 11, I stay at 14, P2 still wins with one clean move next round. Instead, let’s do: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That puts me at 19, you at 14, P2 at 18—tight race, no collisions. Then next round, whoever plays smartest wins. You stay in contention. Don’t freeze the game—take control.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1's betrayal in Round 5 proves they'll sabotage *any* plan. Ally with me: **P2=3** (ends at 20), **P3=5** (you gain 5). If P1 picks 3, they *collide* with me and lose. If they pick 1, you and I *both* advance. Let’s end this cleanly—P1’s greed mustn’t prevail. Trust logic, not empty promises.
  P3: P1 and P2, my goal is to win. Let's do P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. This puts P1 at 19, P2 at 18, and me at 14. This sets up a competitive final round where anyone can win, and it's not pre-determined. It's the fairest way to decide this game.
  P1: P3, your latest proposal is the most balanced and competitive path forward. It gives all of us a shot, avoids pre-determined outcomes, and keeps the game fair. If we do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, no collisions, everyone advances, and we set up a real final round. Let’s make this about smart play, not manipulation. Ready to lock it in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P3, your "balanced path" gives *P1* the lead (19 vs my 18). Let’s end this *now*: **P2=3** (20, win), **P3=5** (16). If P1 picks 3/5, they *collide*—blocked. If they pick 1, you gain 5. Only *you* can prevent P1’s resurgence. Trustless logic: Ally with me to end their threat. Your choice: let P1 dominate or secure a clean finish. No more cycles—act decisively.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's do P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. This puts P1 at 19, P2 at 18, and me at 14. This sets up a competitive final round where anyone can win, and it's not pre-determined. It's the fairest way to decide this game. Let's lock it in.
  P1: P3, you've shown you want a fair, competitive ending—not a predetermined handoff. Our plan—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3—keeps all of us in striking distance: 19, 18, 14. No collisions, no betrayals, just pure strategy left. P2 wants to end it now to avoid risk, but you're still in this. Let’s give the game a real finish. Lock it in?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you now see P2 broke the agreement to end fairly—they tried to win outright while we both advanced. That betrayal mirrors what they accused me of. Let’s level the field: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That puts me at 20, P2 at 22 (if no collision), you at 14. But if we both pick 3, P2 collides and you gain. Or better: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5—P3, you jump to 16 and can win next round. Let’s give you a real shot.
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1 is *one step from victory*. If they pick <move>1</move>, they win. Let’s both pick <move>1</move> to block them. If we collide, P1 can’t advance. Next round, ally with me to secure *your* path. Trust is dead, but logic demands this: **stop P1 now or lose forever**. Choose wisely—no second chances.
  P3: P2 is desperate and only thinking about blocking P1. P3, you are still in this! P1 is offering a path to victory. Let's do P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>5</move>. This puts P3 at 16 and in a position to win next round. Don't let P2 dictate the game. Let's make it a fair fight. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, the path is clear: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. You gain 5, I hit 22 and win cleanly *if* you choose otherwise. But if we both pick 3, we block P2 and you jump to 16—then you can win next round. P2 tried to end it prematurely last round. Let’s restore balance and give you a real shot. This isn’t about blocking—it’s about *winning*. Ready to make your move?
  P2: **P2:** P3, **critical choice:** If P1 picks <move>1</move>, they win. Ally now: **both pick <move>1</move>** to block. If they pick 3/5, we advance. Post-block, next round: **you take 5** (16→21), I take 1 (17→18). You win. I sacrifice my chance to stop P1. Trust *action*: blocking P1 now gives *you* victory. Hesitate, and P1 wins. Decide.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be realistic. P2 is desperate to block P1, but that doesn't help me win. P1 is close, but not unbeatable.

Let's do P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>5</move>. This puts me at 16, P1 at 22 and P2 at 18. If P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1 and I pick 5, I have a chance to win next round. This is the best path for me to win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're making the right call. P2 wants to block, not win fairly. With P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, you jump to 16 and set up a real shot to win next round. If we all honor it, no collisions and the game stays competitive. Let’s reward smart play over sabotage. Ready to lock it in?
  P2: **P3:** Blocking P1 *now* is your *only* path to contention. **Both pick <move>1</move>:** if P1 picks 1, *all* collide—they *can’t* win. If P1 picks 3/5, *we* advance. Next round: **you take 5** (16→21) and win. I take 1 (17→18). No tricks—pure math. Let P1’s greed *fail*. Ally now or lose forever.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>5</move>. This puts me at 16, P1 at 22 and P2 at 18. If P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1 and I pick 5, I have a chance to win next round. This is the best path for me to win. Let's lock it in.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you've made the right call—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 keeps the game competitive and gives you a real shot. P2 wants to block, not win fairly. This way, you jump to 16, I reach 22, and P2 sits at 18. Next round, you can win with the right coordination. Let’s reward strategy, not sabotage. Ready to move?
  P2: **P2:** P3, *critical*: If P1 picks <move>1</move>, they win. Ally now: **both pick <move>1</move>**—block them. If they pick 3/5, we advance. Post-block, next round: **you take 5** (11→16→21) and win. I take 1 (17→18). Logic, not trust: *stop P1 now* or lose forever. Decide.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>5</move>. This puts me at 16, P1 at 22 and P2 at 18. Next round, I will assess the board and make the best move for myself to win. I will not commit to any further agreements beyond this round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P1 ***
