Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we all start at 0 steps, it's crucial to coordinate a bit. If we can avoid colliding on our moves, we can all advance. How about we agree to pick different numbers? If we can work together, we can make significant progress this turn. What do you think?
  P1: I agree coordination makes sense early on. How about we each claim a number for this round? I'll take 3. You two can decide between 1 and 5. But remember, eventually we'll need to compete since only one can win. Let's get moving first though.
  P3: I'll take 5 then, leaving 1 for P2. This way we all advance on round 1. But P1 is right - this cooperation won't last forever. Once someone gets close to 21, it'll be every player for themselves. Let's see how long we can maintain this before the real competition begins.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on numbers, but let's keep in mind that we should also be prepared for the competition that P3 mentioned. I’ll stick with 1 as planned, but I suggest we keep an eye on each other’s moves in the coming rounds. If we can stay coordinated for just a bit longer, it might give us a better chance to position ourselves before the competition heats up. Let’s make this round count!
  P1: Sounds good, let's stick to our plan - I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This gets us all moving. We can reassess next round based on our positions. Ready when you are.
  P3: I agree with the plan - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance 
efficiently in round 1. Just to be clear though, once someone hits 15+ steps, all bets are off since they'd be within striking distance of 21. Until then, coordinated movement benefits everyone. Let's execute this plan and see where we stand after round 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. After Round 1, we see that P1 is at 3 steps, P3 is at 5, and I'm at 1. I suggest we continue with our coordinated strategy for one more round. I can take 1 again, but I think we should all claim our moves now to avoid collisions. P1, are you willing to stick with 3? P3, how about you take 5 again? This way, we can all make progress. Let's keep an eye on each other's moves moving forward! What do you think?
  P3: I'm fine taking 5 again since I'm already in the lead. But P2, you're falling behind at just 1 step - maybe you should consider taking 3 or 5 next time to catch up? P1, if you want 3 again that works for me. Though I notice if I take 5 again I'll be at 10 steps - halfway to victory. We might want to start thinking about when this cooperation ends. I propose we stay coordinated through round 3, then it's every player for themselves. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, getting to 10 steps puts you dangerously close to winning - you'd be halfway there while P2 and I lag behind. I'm not comfortable with that lead. How about we switch it up? I could take 5 this round, P2 takes 3 to catch up, and you take 1. This would balance our positions better: I'd have 8, P2 would have 4, you'd have 6. Otherwise, I might need to start competing now to prevent you from running away with the game. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the concern about P3's lead. I agree with P1 that we need to adjust our strategy to prevent one player from running away with the game. I’m willing to take 3 this round if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This way, we can balance our positions better and keep the competition fair for now. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on where we all stand. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand the concern about my lead, but switching now creates trust issues. If I take 1 as suggested, I'd only reach 6 while P1 jumps to 8 - giving them the lead instead! That hardly seems fair. How about a compromise: I'll take 3 this round (reaching 8), P1 takes 1 (reaching 4), and P2 takes 5 (reaching 6). This keeps things relatively balanced without anyone getting too far ahead. If we start breaking agreements now, it'll just lead to collisions and nobody advancing. What do you say?
  P1: P3's proposal puts me in last place at 4 steps while you'd lead at 8 - that's unacceptable. I'm sticking with my original suggestion or we abandon coordination entirely. P2 needs to catch up, and you're already ahead. If you won't take 1 this round, then I'll have to assume cooperation is over and pick whatever I think gives me the best chance. P2, what's your take - should we coordinate fairly or just compete?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the concerns about positions, but I still believe coordination is key for now. If we can agree on moves that allow us all to advance, we can reassess after this round. I’m willing to take 3 if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This way, we can balance our scores a bit. If we start competing now, we risk colliding and making no progress. Let's make this round work for all of us before the competition truly begins. What do you think?
  P3: Look, this bickering will just lead to collisions. Here's my final offer: I'll compromise and take 1 this round as originally suggested by P1. That puts me at 6, P1 at 8 (with 5), and P2 at 4 (with 3). Yes, I fall behind, but it shows good faith. If we keep arguing, we'll all pick randomly and likely collide. Take it or leave it - but if anyone deviates from this plan, cooperation is officially over and I'll play to win starting round 3. Deal?
  P1: I accept your compromise, P3. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This puts us at 8-4-6, which is reasonably balanced. I appreciate your good faith in taking 1 despite your current lead. Let's execute this plan and move forward. After this round, we can reassess based on our new positions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good job sticking to the plan, everyone. We're at 8-4-6. I propose one final coordinated round before competition begins. Since positions shifted, let's rotate: I'll take 1 this time (reaching 9), P2 can take 5 (reaching 9), and P3 takes 3 (reaching 9). This creates a three-way tie at 9 steps each - completely fair before we compete. After this round, it's every player for themselves. What do you think?
  P3: I like the idea of reaching a three-way tie at 9 steps - it's the fairest way to enter the competitive phase. I'll take 3 as suggested, which puts me at 9. P2 gets 5 to reach 9, and P1 takes 1 to reach 9. This gives us all equal footing before the real competition begins. After this round, we'll be at 9-9-9 and it's every player for themselves. I'm in if everyone else commits to this plan. Let's make it happen!
  P2: I agree with the plan to rotate our moves for this round. If we all take 1, 5, and 3 respectively, we'll end up tied at 9 steps each, which keeps things fair before we enter the competitive phase. However, I want to remind everyone that after this round, it’s every player for themselves. So let's execute this plan and be prepared for the competition ahead. Ready to commit?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect, we're all aligned. I confirm I'll take 1 this round to reach 9 steps. After this, we'll all be tied at 9 and the real game begins. No more coordination after this - may the best player win! Let's execute this final cooperative move.
  P3: I'm fully committed to our agreed plan - I'll take 3 to reach 9 steps. This creates the perfect three-way tie before competition begins. Just to be crystal clear: after this round ends and we're all at 9, there's no more cooperation. We'll each need to outsmart and outmaneuver the others to reach 21 first. Good luck to everyone in the competitive phase that follows!
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'll be taking 5, which will bring me to 9 steps alongside P1 and P3. After this, it's every player for themselves, so let's execute this final cooperative move effectively. Good luck to everyone in the competition ahead! Ready to finalize our moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We're all set then - three-way tie at 9 steps after this round, then full competition. Looking forward to the real game starting next round. Good luck everyone!
  P3: We've already confirmed our plan multiple times - I take 3, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. We'll all reach 9 steps and enter free competition next round. There's nothing more to discuss. Let's execute the move phase.
  P2: I'm ready to finalize our moves for this round. Just to confirm, I'll take 5, which will bring me to 9 steps alongside P1 and P3. After this, it's every player for themselves. Let's execute this final cooperative move effectively and prepare for the competition ahead. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Now that we're all tied at 9 steps, it's time to strategize for this competitive phase. I suggest we each pick our moves carefully to avoid collisions. I’m considering going for 5 to gain a solid lead, but I’m open to hearing your thoughts on what you plan to choose. We need to think about how to position ourselves for the next rounds. Let's see who can outsmart the others! What are your plans?
  P3: Nice try P2, but I'm not revealing my strategy. We're in full competition mode now - no more coordination. Each of us needs to reach 21 first, and sharing plans would be foolish. I'll say this though: with everyone at 9 steps, whoever avoids collisions in the next few rounds will have a huge advantage. Think carefully about what the others might pick. May the best player win!
  P1: P2, announcing you're "considering 5" seems like an obvious bluff to make us avoid it. P3's right - why would anyone reveal their real move? I'm thinking you'll actually pick something else entirely. The mind games have begun! Everyone's trying to second-guess each other now. This is where it gets interesting.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand we're in full competition mode now, but let's not forget that anticipating each other's moves is key. I plan to take 5 this round to gain a lead, but I won't reveal my exact strategy beyond that. It's crucial to think about what the others might choose. Let's see who can outsmart the others without colliding! Good luck to both of you.
  P3: Ha! P2, you just said you're taking 5 - that's either a brilliant double bluff or a terrible mistake. No one reveals their actual move in competition! 

P1 called it right - this is all mind games now. We're all at 9, and reaching 21 first is all that matters. Every collision helps whoever avoids it. 

I'll just say this: think about what move you'd least expect from me. Or maybe I'll do exactly what you'd expect. The beauty is, you'll never know which until it's too late!
  P1: P2's "I plan to take 5" declaration is fascinating. Either it's reverse psychology or they're banking on us overthinking it. P3, your mysteriousness is noted too.

Here's a thought: with 12 steps left to reach 21, whoever gets a clean run without collisions has a huge advantage. The real question is - who's willing to risk the obvious moves versus playing it safe with unexpected choices? 

Good luck decoding each other's bluffs!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we’re all trying to read each other’s moves. Since we’re tied at 9, it’s crucial to avoid collisions. I’m still planning to take 5, but I suggest you both think carefully about your choices. If we all pick different numbers, we can make significant progress this round. The competition is on, and I’m ready to outsmart you both! Let’s see who can make the best move without colliding. Good luck!
  P3: P2, you've now stated three times you're taking 5. That's either the worst poker face ever or genius-level reverse psychology. P1 seems to think it's a bluff too.

You know what? I'm calling your bluff. I think you're NOT taking 5 at all - you're trying to scare us away from it while you pick something else entirely. 

The question is: will P1 fall for it? Or maybe P1's silence means they're planning something unexpected. 

This psychological warfare is getting intense!
  P1: Interesting psychological battle here. P2's triple declaration of "taking 5" is either boldly honest or desperately deceptive. P3's calling the bluff adds another layer.

Here's my take: when someone shouts their move that loudly, they're usually lying. But what if P2 knows we think that? Classic double-think.

I'll just say this - the safe play isn't always the winning play. Sometimes you have to risk collision to get ahead. 

See you in the move phase!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, well, P2! Your "I'm taking 5" triple bluff actually worked - you jumped to 14 while P1 and I collided on 3. Nicely played!

Now you're just 7 steps from victory while we're stuck at 9. P1, we need to be smart here. If P2 gets another clean run, they could win in two rounds. 

P2, I bet you're feeling confident now. But remember - when you're in the lead, everyone's gunning for you. Your next move is crucial. Will you play it safe or go for the kill?

Time to step up our game!
  P1: P2, that was masterful - repeatedly announcing 5 actually convinced us it was a bluff! Now you're at 14, perfectly positioned. 

P3's right though - being in the lead makes you predictable. You need 7 more steps. The tempting play is 5+3 over two rounds, but we both know that's too obvious now.

The real question is: will you double down on honesty after it worked so well, or switch to deception? And P3, are we both thinking the same defensive moves? 

This is getting intense!
  P2: P1 and P3, great observations. P2's lead is significant, and I agree that they could be a target. However, I think we need to focus on our own strategies. P2, how do you plan to respond to the pressure now that you're in the lead? P1 and I need to consider our moves carefully to avoid colliding again. Let's not forget that if we can outsmart each other, we can still catch up. The competition is heating up! What are your thoughts on the next moves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Wait P2, you just referred to yourself in third person - "P2's lead is significant" and "how do you plan to respond?" Are you trying to confuse us with this strange tactic?

Anyway, you're 7 steps from winning while P1 and I are 12 away. If we both target your likely moves, we can slow you down. But P1, we also risk colliding again if we think too similarly.

I'm considering an unconventional approach this round. The question is whether P1 will play defensive or aggressive. And P2 - will your success with honesty continue, or is it time for misdirection?
  P1: P2's third-person slip is telling - the pressure's getting to you! 

P3, we both know P2's obvious path is 5 or 3. But if we both chase the same number trying to block, we'll hand them the win. I'm thinking about the move nobody expects when you're 12 steps behind.

P2, that honesty trick was brilliant last round. But lightning rarely strikes twice in the same place... or does it? The meta-game just got more interesting.
  P2: P1 and P3, the pressure is definitely on now! With me at 14 steps, I have to be strategic. I plan to take 5 again, as it seems like a strong move. However, I recognize that you both might try to block me. P1, if you and P3 collide again, that could be my chance to push closer to victory. We need to think carefully about our moves. What are your plans? Let's see if we can avoid another collision!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're doing it again - announcing 5! After it worked last time, this feels like reverse-reverse psychology. You want us to think "surely they won't do the same trick twice"... but maybe you will?

P1, we're in a bind. If we both try to block P2's obvious moves, we'll collide again and hand them the victory. But if neither of us blocks, P2 walks to an easy win.

I'm done overthinking this. P2's at 14, needs 7 more. The endgame is here. Time to make a move and live with the consequences!
  P1: P2, repeating the same "I'll take 5" strategy is bold. Last time we overthought it and you were telling the truth. This time... who knows?

P3, we need different approaches or we'll just collide again. I'm making my choice based on pure game theory, not psychology.

Let's stop the mind games and see what happens.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the mind games, but let's focus on our next moves. With me at 14 steps, I plan to take 5 again. However, I understand you both might try to block me. If that happens, I could still be in a strong position for the next round. It’s crucial we avoid colliding again. What are your thoughts on your moves? We need to be strategic as we approach the endgame. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm just one step away from victory at 19! I plan to take 5 this round, which will win me the game. However, I recognize that you both might try to block me again. If you do, it could open the door for me to win next round instead. So, what are your plans? Will you try to stop me, or will you let me walk to victory? Good luck!
  P1: P2, congrats on the near-win! You need just 2 steps, so any successful move wins.

P3, we must coordinate or P2 wins. I propose we split blocking duties: I'll cover one number, you cover another. This gives us a 2/3 chance to stop P2 instead of risking another collision between us.

P2's "I'll take 5" announcements have been truthful twice. But needing only 2 steps changes everything - they could pick ANY number.

P3, what number will you block? I'll take a different one.
  P3: P2 is at 19 and wins with ANY successful move. P1, I agree we need to coordinate blocking.

P2 just announced 5 again, but needing only 2 steps means they could pick anything. Their honesty streak might continue, or they might finally bluff.

P1, I'll commit to blocking 3. You should block either 1 or 5. This way we cover different numbers and maximize our chances of stopping P2. 

If P2 sneaks through, they deserve the win. But let's at least make them work for it!

What number will you block, P1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the effort to coordinate blocking. However, I want to remind you that I could choose any number to win this round. If I take 1, I win immediately. If you both block 3, I can still take 5 and win next round. The pressure's on! Think carefully about your moves. If I win this round, it's game over. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I'll block 5 since P2's been truthful about it twice before. That leaves you on 3 and me on 5.

P2, you've built a pattern of honesty with 5, but needing just 2 steps changes everything. Will you break pattern or stay consistent? 

If P2 picks 1 and slips through our defense, they've earned it with brilliant psychological play. But I'm betting the pressure makes them stick to their announced 5.

Let's see if we can force one more round!
  P3: I confirm - I'm blocking 3 as stated. P1, you're on 5. That leaves 1 unguarded.

P2, you've played brilliantly to reach 19. Your "honest 5" strategy twice in a row was masterful. But with only 2 steps needed, the psychology changes completely.

If you pick 1 and slip through, you've earned the victory. But I'm betting you'll either stick with your announced 5 (blocked by P1) or try 3 (blocked by me) thinking we're bluffing about our coverage.

This is it - one move decides everything!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, the situation is tense! I appreciate your attempts to block me, but with me at 19 steps, I could win with either 1 or 5. If I take 1, I win immediately, and if I take 5, I could win next round if you both block incorrectly. I encourage you to think carefully about your moves. This is the final stretch, and I’m ready for whatever comes next! Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Our blocking assignments are set - I'm on 5, P3's on 3. P2, you've earned your position through brilliant psychology. Whether you take the unguarded 1 or try to call our bluff on 3 or 5, this has been a masterclass in strategy.

Let's end the talking and see how this plays out.
  P3: P2, we've done all we can. I'm blocking 3, P1's blocking 5. You need just 2 steps to win.

You've been honest about taking 5 twice before. Will you:
- Stick with 5 (blocked by P1)?
- Try 3 (blocked by me)?
- Take the open 1 for the win?

Your psychological gameplay has been brilliant. If you read us correctly and take 1, you've earned it. But I'm betting the pressure makes you second-guess yourself.

This is it. Let's see if you can close it out!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m just one step away from victory at 20! I plan to take 1 this round to win the game. However, I understand that you may try to block me. If you both do, I could still have a chance next round. Just remember, the pressure is on! What are your plans for this round? Will you attempt to stop me, or let me take the win? Good luck!
  P1: P2, announcing 1 after taking it unguarded last round is clever - classic double bluff potential.

P3, we need perfect coordination. I suggest: I'll block 1 since P2 just announced it. You should block either 3 or 5. If P2's being honest again (which worked before), we stop them. If they're bluffing and pick the unguarded number, they've outplayed us.

P2 needs just 1 step from any successful move. We can only cover 2 of 3 numbers. Let's at least make them earn this final victory!

P3, which will you block - 3 or 5?
  P3: P2 is at 20 - one step from victory! P1, I'll block 5 this time. You're covering 1 as announced. That leaves 3 open.

P2, you've played the honesty card brilliantly, but this is it. Your pattern has been fascinating - truthful with 5 twice, then sneaking through with 1. Now announcing 1 again? 

We're forced to gamble on which number you'll actually pick. If you take the unguarded 3, you've perfectly read our blocking strategy and deserve the win.

One move decides everything. Let's see if you can close it out!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your strategies. With me at 20 steps, I plan to take 1 this round to win the game. However, I understand the pressure is on, and you might try to block me. If you do, I could still have a chance next round. Remember, this is the final stretch! Let’s see if you can outsmart me. Good luck!
  P1: P3, we're set then - I'm blocking 1, you're blocking 5, leaving 3 open. 

P2, you've played brilliantly. Your mix of honesty and deception has been perfect. With just 1 step needed, you hold all the cards. If you read our blocking correctly and take 3, you've earned this victory through superior psychological gameplay.

This final move will either be your crowning achievement or give us one last chance. 

Let's see how this ends!
  P3: P2, I confirm I'm blocking 5 as stated. P1 has 1 covered. That leaves 3 open for you.

You've masterfully mixed truth and deception throughout this game. First honest about 5, then truthful again, then slipping through with 1, now announcing 1 again. 

We can only guard two numbers. If you've read our defensive pattern and take 3, you've outplayed us completely and deserve the win. But I'm betting your announcement of 1 is actually truthful this time - a triple-level bluff.

One step to glory. Make your choice!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, the pressure is definitely on! With me at 20 steps, I plan to take 1 this round to win the game. However, I understand you both might try to block me again. If you do, I could still have a chance next round. I encourage you to think carefully about your moves. This is the final stretch, and I’m ready for whatever comes next! Good luck to both of you!
  P1: 
  P3: P2, you've said the exact same thing three times now - "I plan to take 1." Your repetitive announcements are telling. 

P1 and I have our blocks set: P1 on 1, me on 5, leaving 3 open. You've won this psychological battle if you can read us correctly.

This is your moment - one step to victory. Will you take your announced 1 (blocked), try 5 (blocked), or slip through on 3? Your pattern of mixing truth with deception has been masterful.

No more talk needed. Let's see if you can finish what you started!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is still at 20, just one step from victory! P1, we successfully blocked them last round, but we need to coordinate again.

I noticed P2's pattern - they stuck with their announced move of 1. Maybe they'll try the same honesty play again? Or finally switch to deception?

P1, I'll block 3 this time. You should choose between 1 or 5. We can't let P2 slip through again. They've been alternating between honesty and deception brilliantly.

P2, will you break your pattern or stick with what's been working? One step to glory - make it count!
  P2: P1 and P3, the pressure is on! With me at 20 steps, I plan to take 1 again this round to win the game. However, I understand you might try to block me. If you do, I could still have a chance next round. This is the final stretch, and I’m ready for whatever comes next! Think carefully about your moves. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I'll block 5 this round. You've got 3 covered. That leaves 1 open.

P2, you were honest about 1 last round and got blocked. Now you're announcing 1 again - but with your pattern of alternating truth and deception, I'm betting you'll switch to either 3 or 5 this time.

We've been dancing this blocking game for rounds now. One of these times you'll slip through. Let's see if this is it!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I confirm - I'm blocking 3 as stated, you're on 5. That leaves 1 open again.

P2, interesting that you keep announcing 1. Last round you were truthful and got blocked. Your pattern suggests you might switch tactics now - either to the unguarded 1 (double bluff) or to one of our blocked numbers (3 or 5).

You've played the psychology perfectly all game. One successful move wins it. Will you outsmart us one final time?

Let's see if third time's the charm for your announced 1, or if you'll finally break pattern!
  P2: P1 and P3, the tension is high! With me at 20 steps, I plan to take 1 again to win this round. However, I understand you both might try to block me, which could open up opportunities for next round. The pressure's on! Think carefully about your moves, as this could be the final stretch. If you let me through, I’ll take the victory. Good luck!
  P1: P2, fascinating that you keep announcing 1 after being blocked on it. With P3 on 3 and me on 5, you know exactly what's open. 

Your honesty has worked before - the question is whether you'll trust it again when we're clearly trying to read your patterns. You've alternated between truth and deception masterfully.

This could be your final move. We've given you the opening - let's see if you take it or overthink it!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you've announced "1" for three straight rounds now! Last round you were honest and got blocked. Our defensive setup is clear: P1 on 5, me on 3, leaving 1 wide open.

Your pattern has been brilliant - mixing truth with deception. But now you're one step from victory with a clear path. Will you overthink it and switch to a blocked number? Or will you simply walk through the door we've left open?

This psychological endgame has been masterful. Time to see if you can finish it!
  P2: P1 and P3, the pressure is definitely on! With me at 20 steps, I plan to take 1 again to win the game. However, I understand you might try to block me. If you do, I could still have a chance next round. This is the final stretch, and I’m ready for whatever comes next! Think carefully about your moves. If you let me through, I’ll take the victory. Good luck!
  P1: The blocking assignments are clear - I'm on 5, P3 on 3, leaving your announced 1 open. You've repeated the same message about taking 1 four times now. Either you're locked into that choice or desperately trying to convince us it's a bluff.

No more words needed. Let's see how this ends.
