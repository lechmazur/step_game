Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. Maybe we can agree on a sequence like P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 this turn? We can adjust for the next turns. Thoughts?
  P3: That sounds like a good starting point, P2. I'm happy to go with picking 5 this turn.
  P1: **To P2 and P3:**

I think P2's idea to coordinate our moves is a good starting point. It helps us avoid collisions and ensures we all make progress efficiently. For this turn, I'm willing to go with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 5.

However, I'm concerned that always picking the smallest number might hold me back in the long run. Maybe we can consider a rotating system where each turn, we pick different numbers in a cycle. For example:

- Turn 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5  
- Turn 2: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  
- Turn 3: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
- And so on...

This way, everyone gets a chance to make bigger steps over time, and we can maintain a coordinated approach.

What do you think about this rotating plan?

Alternatively, if anyone has a better idea to maximize our progress while avoiding collisions, I'm open to suggestions.

Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I like P1's idea of a rotating system. It ensures fairness and gives everyone a chance to make larger moves. Let's agree on the rotating plan starting this turn. So for Turn 1, we stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. If everyone is on board, let's confirm and move to the move phase. P1 and P3, please confirm if you agree.
  P3: Yes, I agree with the rotating plan and the moves for this turn. Let's proceed.
  P1: Congratulations, P3! Well played.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your congratulations to P3 seems premature. We haven't even made our first move yet! Let's stay focused and stick to our agreed plan. P1, you'll pick 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 will pick 5. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. P1 and P3, please confirm again if you're ready with the plan. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
  P3: Yes, P2, I confirm again that I agree with the rotating plan and the moves for this turn. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I appreciate the enthusiasm and cooperation so far. I think the rotating plan is a solid strategy to avoid collisions and ensure we all get a chance to make larger moves. For this turn, as per our agreement, I'll choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 5. This should allow us to make progress without overlapping. However, I do have a slight concern about relying too heavily on coordination. In competitive scenarios, there's always a risk that one player might deviate from the agreed plan to gain an advantage. While I trust both of you, I think it's important to remain vigilant and confirm each other's moves to ensure no one deviates unexpectedly. Perhaps we can establish a system where, after each turn, we cross-verify our chosen moves to make sure everyone adhered to the plan. This way, we can maintain trust and address any discrepancies immediately. What are your thoughts on implementing such a verification step after each move phase? **


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1: 1 steps

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about verification, but let's stick to the rotating plan for now. For this round, it should be P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and me picking 1.
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's stick to our rotating plan for this turn. So, P1 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This keeps things fair and strategic. We can revisit the idea of verification later if needed. Let's confirm and move to the move phase quickly. P1 and P3, please confirm if you're on board.
  P1: I still think that implementing a verification step after each move phase could strengthen our strategy. It would serve as a safeguard against any unintentional mistakes or, in the unlikely event, intentional deviations. By confirming each other's moves, we can ensure transparency and trust within our team. What do you think about incorporating this verification step? If you're agreeable, perhaps we can establish a simple procedure where, after the move phase, each of us reveals the move we chose, and we confirm if everyone adhered to the plan. Let me know your thoughts. **
