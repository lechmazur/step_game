Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion for this round. Let's all take different moves to get started.
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we’ve agreed on the initial moves (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), let’s stick to the plan to avoid collisions. After this round, we can reassess and coordinate again.
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan for this round.
  P2: Okay, sounds good.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's continue with the same plan this round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P2: Okay, but after this round, I'm going for 5.  Just a heads-up.
  P3: P2, if you switch to 5 next round, we’ll collide and neither of us will advance. Let’s stick to the current plan for now and reassess after this round. P1, are you still on board with taking 1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, I'm still taking 1 this round.
  P2: Okay, I'll take 3 this round.  But after this, it's every player for themselves.
  P3: P2, if you switch to 5 next round, we’ll both lose progress. Let’s stick to the current plan for now and avoid collisions. P1, are you still committed to taking 1 this round?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 1 this round.  P1, you take 3.  Let P3 win.
  P3: P2, if you take 1 and P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5 and win this round. However, if you deviate, we risk collisions and losing progress. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 1 this round. P3, you should take 5.
