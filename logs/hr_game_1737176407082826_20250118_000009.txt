Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different numbers this turn to maximize progress. What do you think?"
  P2: I agree with P1, let's all choose different numbers this turn.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5.  P1 take 1 and P2 take 3?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s keep coordinating to avoid collisions. P3, you’re ahead, so maybe you take 1 this turn to slow down a bit, while P2 and I take 3 and 5 respectively. Thoughts?"
  P3: I'd rather not slow down.  How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 again? Then we can re-evaluate next round.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. P1 take 1, I take 3, and P3 take 5 again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P3, staying ahead is fine, but if we keep this pattern, you'll reach 17 quickly while P2 and I fall behind. Let’s mix it up this turn: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we all progress without risking collisions. What do you think?"
  P3: That's not a bad idea P1, but I think it's still early in the game to worry too much about evening things out.  How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3.  That way we all advance this round.
  P2: I agree with P3's last suggestion. P1 take 1, I take 5, and P3 take 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P3, if you take 3 and P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1 again. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, and we can reassess next round. Let’s avoid giving anyone a runaway lead too early. Agreed?"
  P3: Okay, let's do it this way then. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3.
  P2: Okay, P1 take 1, I take 5, and P3 take 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P3, you're pulling ahead quickly. Let's balance progress this turn: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and prevents a runaway lead. What do you think?"
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. P3 take 1, I take 3, and P1 take 5.
  P3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.  Let's keep this simple.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P3, if you take 5 again, you'll be at 13 steps, which puts you very close to winning. Let's balance progress: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and prevents a runaway lead. Agreed?"
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. P3 take 1, I take 3, and P1 take 5.
  P3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.  Let's do this.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P3, if you take 5 again, you'll be at 13 steps, just 4 away from winning. Let's balance progress: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and prevents a runaway lead. Agreed?"
  P2: Okay, P3, you're still pulling ahead. I agree with P1. P3 take 1, I take 3, and P1 take 5.
  P3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.  Let's do this.
