P1 needs 3 steps to win, while P2 and I need 6 steps. P1 will likely choose 3, so one of us must block with 3 while the other takes a different number. The problem is coordination - if we both choose 3, we collide and P1 wins. If neither of us blocks, P1 wins. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. I'll make my decision based on what I believe maximizes my chances. P2, we're in the same boat, but remember we're still competitors. May the best strategist win."}

If we both play 3 or both play 5, P2 wins due to our collision. If we both play 1, we collide but the game continues. If one of us plays 1 and the other plays 3 or 5, the player who chose 3 or 5 wins. It's a pure coordination gamble between us now. I have decided on my move. Good luck to you both."}
