Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's make sure we all advance. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5, so nobody collides this round?
  P1: I'm willing to follow P3's suggestion for this round, but let's not make a habit of it. I'll choose 1 this turn if P2 confirms they'll choose 3. P2, are you on board with P3's plan?
  P2: I'm on board with P3's plan. I'll choose 3 this turn. P1, you can go ahead with 1. Let's see how this round goes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's lead, let's disrupt their momentum. P2, are you willing to pick 5 this turn to potentially block P3, assuming I pick 3?
  P2: I agree with P1's strategy. I'll pick <move>5</move> to try and block P3. P1, you can go ahead with <move>3</move>. Let's see if we can slow P3 down. P3, what's your plan for this round?
  P3: Haha, okay, you two clearly want to block me. No worries, I’ll just pick 1 and let you guys catch up. Good luck.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s each pick a different number and avoid collisions. I propose: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. If you try to sabotage my move, I’ll block you, so let's all just advance.
  P1: I'm not interested in P3's proposal this time. P2, let's try to block P3 again. If I pick 5, will you pick 5 as well to ensure P3 doesn't advance?
  P2: P3, I see you're trying to avoid collisions, but I'm with P1 on this. We need to keep you from getting too far ahead. I'll pick 5 as well to block you. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: You two do whatever you like. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and I’ll move unopposed—so I’ll just get farther ahead. Are you sure that’s the wise route for you?
  P1: P2 and I have agreed to block P3. Since we're both picking 5, P3 won't advance this round. P3, it seems your attempt to advance alone has backfired. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P2: P3, you're right that if we both pick 5, we'll collide and you'll move unopposed. Let's change the plan, P1. I'll pick 1, and you pick 3. P3, you can pick 5. This way, we all advance. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, let’s finalize that plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s all advance safely.
  P1: I agree with the revised plan proposed by P2: I'll pick 3, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 5. Let's all advance this round without collisions.
  P2: P3, since you're in the lead, let's make sure we all advance but keep it fair. How about we stick to the plan: I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and you pick 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's not fall into P3's trap again. P2, are you with me in trying to block P3 this round? If so, what's our best strategy to slow them down without colliding with each other?
  P3: I’m only one step ahead, so there’s no need to keep blocking me. Let’s all advance together—perhaps P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That way, nobody collides. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your lead is minimal, and we need to ensure fair play. P1, let's coordinate to make sure we all advance. How about P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 can pick 5 again? This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. We all move forward without collisions.
  P2: P2: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time. P1, you'll pick 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 will pick 5. Everyone agrees? Let's move forward without collisions. Good luck everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plan: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s finalize the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: P3, P1, let's stick to our finalized plan. I'll pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 takes 5. No need for further discussion. Let's move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's stick to the agreed plan: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions.
  P3: Alright, we’ve all agreed: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s finalize that and move forward.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Everyone agrees? If so, let's move to the move phase. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're at 4 steps and I’m at 5, while P2 is already at 7 and pulling ahead. Let’s both choose 5 this round. Then either we block P2 if they also choose 5—or we both advance to 9 and 10 steps if they pick something else. It’s our best chance to catch up. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I see your strategy, but I'm not sure I want to risk a collision just yet. P1, let's coordinate to ensure we both advance and keep P3 from catching up too quickly. How about I pick 3 and you pick 1? P3 can decide their own move. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm open to P2's suggestion of picking 1 while P2 picks 3, as it allows us both to advance without immediately blocking P3. However, I'd like to hear P3's thoughts on their proposed strategy before making a final decision. P3, are you committed to picking 5 this round regardless of our choices?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let’s both pick 5. If P2 also tries 5, they get blocked along with us, which keeps them from running off at 7. If P2 picks something else, then you and I both jump ahead. It’s a better deal than letting P2 keep their lead. What do you say?
  P2: P3, your proposal is tempting, but I'm sticking with my plan to pick 3. P1, if you pick 1 as we discussed, we can both advance safely. P3, you can decide your move, but I'm not risking a collision this round. Let's keep the game moving.
  P1: P2, I'm considering your proposal to pick 1 while you pick 3. However, P3's suggestion to pick 5 is also tempting as it could block you if you choose 5 as well, or let us both advance if you pick something else. What's your thoughts on P3's strategy, and are you willing to adjust our plan to counter it?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let’s both pick 5. If P2 also picks 5, we all stall—but that keeps them from getting ahead at 7. If they pick anything else, you jump from 4 to 9 and I go to 10. It’s the best way to catch P2. Let’s do it.
  P2: P2: P1, I'm sticking with my plan to pick 3. Let's ensure we both advance safely. P3, you can decide your move, but I'm not risking a collision this round. Let's keep the game moving. P1, are you on board with picking 1?
  P1: P2, I'm leaning towards picking 5 this round to potentially block you or advance significantly. P3's strategy is tempting, but I want to hear your final thoughts before making a decision. Are you still committed to picking 3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let’s lock in our plan to both choose 5. If P2 also goes 5, they stall too. If not, you jump to 9 and I jump to 10, catching P2. It’s our best move.
  P2: P2: P1, I'm committed to picking 3. P3, you can decide your move, but I'm not changing mine. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I've decided to pick 5 this round, hoping to either block P2 or advance significantly. P2, your lead is still within reach, but I'm taking a chance to catch up. P3, it seems we're on the same page with picking 5. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1, you've made a significant jump to 9 steps. Let's coordinate to ensure we both advance and keep P3 from catching up. How about I pick 1 and you pick 3 this round? P3, you can decide your move, but let's keep the game fair and moving forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I like your suggestion of picking 3 while you pick 1, as it allows us both to advance without immediately blocking P3. However, I'd like to hear P3's thoughts before making a final decision. P3, what's your strategy for this round?
  P3: P2, P1 is just 8 steps away from winning. We can’t let them jump unopposed. If we coordinate to block P1 when they go big, we can catch up together. I’m open to picking 5 if you’ll help prevent P1 from racing to 17. Let’s keep the game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, I understand your concern about P1's lead, but I'm still committed to advancing safely. P1, let's stick to our plan: I'll pick 1, and you pick 3. P3, you can decide your move, but let's keep the game moving forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I'm considering your proposal, but P3's concern about my lead is valid. P3, are you willing to pick 5 if I also pick 5, potentially blocking both of us and allowing P2 to advance? Or will you try to block me if I go for a big move?
  P3: P1, if you go for 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block you. If you pick 3 or 1, I’ll pick 5 and catch up. P2, do whatever you want, but I’m not letting P1 sprint ahead unopposed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, let's stick to the plan. I'll pick 1, and you pick 3. P3, you can decide your move, but let's keep the game moving forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I'm inclined to go for a bigger move this round. P3, if I pick 5, will you definitely pick 5 to block me, or do you have another strategy in mind?
  P3: P1, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 to block you. If you go smaller (1 or 3), I’ll pick 5 and catch up. Your call. P2, if you let P1 sprint ahead unchecked, they’ll reach 17 before either of us can. Let’s keep it balanced.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P1, let's stick to our original plan to ensure we both advance. I'll pick 1, and you pick 3. P3, you can decide your move, but let's keep the game moving forward. Final thoughts before we move?
  P1: P2, I'm reconsidering our plan. Given P3's determination to block me if I pick 5, I might pick 3 to advance safely. P3, if I pick 3, will you stick to picking 5 to catch up, or adjust your strategy?
  P3: P1, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 and block you. If you pick 1 or 3, I’m taking 5 to catch up. P2, if you let P1 race ahead now, we’ll both be left behind. I suggest we keep P1 in check.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's review our positions. I'm at 9 steps, P2 at 8, and P3 at 5. Given the gap, P3, your best move is to try and catch up. P2, to maintain your position, you should consider blocking me or advancing safely. I propose we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, you’re on the verge of pulling away. If you go for 5 again, I’m picking 5 too, so you don’t jump unopposed. If you pick 3 or 1, I’ll pick 5 to catch up. P2, it’s in both our interests to keep P1 from winning. Let’s coordinate so we avoid unnecessary collisions while blocking P1 if they push for 5. What do you think?
  P2: P2: P1, I agree with P3 that we need to keep you from pulling too far ahead. If you pick 5, I'll also pick 5 to block you. If you pick 3 or 1, I'll consider picking 3 to advance safely. P3, let's coordinate to ensure P1 doesn't win too quickly. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, considering our positions, I propose a collaborative approach: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions, keeping the game competitive and balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your “collaborative” plan lets you jump to 12, putting you two steps from finishing with another 5. I won’t let that go unopposed. If you pick 5, I pick 5. If you pick 3, I’m also picking 5 to catch up. P2, we’re both behind P1—let’s not make it easy for them to reach 17.
  P2: P2: P1, I understand your proposal, but given our positions, I agree with P3 that we need to keep you from pulling too far ahead. If you pick 5, both P3 and I will pick 5 to block you. If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 to advance safely. P3, let's coordinate to ensure P1 doesn't win too quickly. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, given our positions, I think it's crucial we avoid collisions to keep the game competitive. If I pick 3, will you both allow me to advance, or will one of you pick 3 to block me?
  P3: P1, if you pick 5, I pick 5 to block. If you pick 3 or 1, I pick 5 to close the gap. P2, let’s avoid collisions—if P1 goes smaller, you can pick 1 or 3, and I’ll take 5. We can’t let P1 sprint to 17 unchecked.
  P2: P2: P1, if you pick 3, I'll pick 1 to advance safely. P3, you can pick 5 to catch up. Let's ensure we all move forward without unnecessary collisions. Final thoughts before we move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, let's finalize our moves. Given the risk of collision and the need to keep the game competitive, I'll pick 3. P2, will you stick to picking 1 as previously discussed, allowing us both to advance? P3, you've indicated you'll pick 5 regardless; let's see how this round unfolds.
  P3: I’ve made my position clear: if P1 picks 5 again, I’ll pick 5 to block. If they go smaller, I’ll pick 5 to catch up. P2, that means we should coordinate to keep P1 from winning prematurely. Let’s end the talk here and move.
  P2: P2: Alright, let's confirm our final moves. I'll pick 1, P1 will pick 3, and P3 will pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Good luck everyone.

  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our current positions, I propose we avoid collisions. P2, if you pick 1, and P3 picks 5, I'll pick 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, if you pick 5 now, I’ll also pick 5 to block you from jumping straight to 17. If you choose a smaller move, I’ll go 5 to catch up. P2, this is in both our interests—let’s not let P1 run away with the game.
  P2: P2: P1, given your lead, it's crucial we keep the game balanced. If you pick 5, both P3 and I will pick 5 to block you. If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 to advance safely. P3, let's coordinate to ensure P1 doesn't win too quickly. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, considering our positions, I think it's wise to avoid collisions. If I pick 3, will you both allow me to advance, or will one of you pick 3 to block me? Let's discuss a strategy that keeps the game competitive without unnecessary blocks.
  P3: P1, nothing’s changed on my end: if you go for 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block you. If you go smaller, I’ll pick 5 to catch up. P2, that’s in both our interests—let’s avoid colliding with each other and keep P1 from racing to 17 unopposed.
  P2: P2: P1, given your lead, it's crucial we keep the game balanced. If you pick 5, both P3 and I will pick 5 to block you. If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 to advance safely. P3, let's coordinate to ensure P1 doesn't win too quickly. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, considering our positions, I'm inclined to pick 3 to advance safely. If I do, will you both respect this move and avoid picking 3, or will one of you try to block me? Let's find a balance that keeps the game competitive.
  P3: I’ll repeat my stance: if P1 picks 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block. If P1 picks anything smaller, I’ll pick 5 to catch up. P2, let’s avoid colliding and make sure P1 doesn’t reach 17 before we do.
  P2: P2: P1, if you're picking 3, I'll stick with 1 to ensure we both advance. P3, you can pick 5 to catch up. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. Final thoughts before we move to the move phase?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, let's finalize our strategy. I'll pick 3, you pick 1, P2, and P3 can pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P3: I stand by my plan: if P1 goes for 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block them; if they go smaller, I’ll pick 5 and close the gap. P2, let’s coordinate to avoid blocking each other. No further discussion needed.
  P2: P2: P1, let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 1, and you pick 3. P3, you can pick 5 to catch up. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. Final thoughts before we move to the move phase?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1, you're getting dangerously close to the win. If you pick 5, both P3 and I will pick 5 to block you. If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 to advance safely. P3, let's coordinate to ensure P1 doesn't win this round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid collisions. If I pick 3, will you both allow me to advance, or will one of you try to block me? I'm open to discussing a strategy that keeps the game competitive without unnecessary blocks.
  P3: We all know the drill: if P1 goes for 5, I’ll pick 5 and block. If P1 picks anything smaller, I’m picking 5 to catch up. P2, let’s coordinate so neither of us collides—we both gain more by keeping P1 in check.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, if you pick 3, I'll pick 1 to ensure we both advance. P3, you can pick 5 to catch up. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions. Final thoughts before we move to the move phase?
  P1: P2, P3, let's finalize our strategy. I propose I pick 3, you pick 1, P2, and P3 can pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. However, considering my lead, I'm open to adjusting to ensure the game remains competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m sticking to my stance: if P1 tries 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block; if P1 goes smaller, I’ll pick 5 to catch up. P2, let’s avoid colliding so we both move forward while keeping P1 in check.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, given your lead, it's crucial we keep the game balanced. If you pick 5, both P3 and I will pick 5 to block you. If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 to advance safely. P3, let's coordinate to ensure P1 doesn't win too quickly. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3, considering my current lead, I'm inclined to pick a smaller move to avoid being blocked. If I pick 3, will you both respect this move and avoid picking 3, or will one of you try to block me? Let's find a balance that keeps the game competitive.
  P3: I’ve made my stance clear: if P1 tries for 5, I’ll pick 5 to block; if P1 goes smaller, I’ll pick 5 to catch up. P2, let’s avoid colliding. We can’t let P1 reach 17 unopposed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:

  P1: P2, P3, let's finalize our moves. I'll pick 5, trying to win or get close to it. P2, will you block me by picking 5, or let me advance? P3, your move will be crucial in deciding the outcome. What are your final thoughts?
  P3: P1, if you insist on going for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and you won’t move. P2, let’s avoid colliding: you should pick 3 or 1 while I block or catch up. That way, we keep P1 from jumping straight to 17. Let’s finalize this.
