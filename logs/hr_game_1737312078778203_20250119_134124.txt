Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's try to coordinate our moves this round. If we all pick different numbers, we can all advance. I suggest one of us takes 1, another 3, and the last one 5. That way, we can maximize our steps. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I think it's crucial we all pick different numbers to ensure we all advance. If we can agree on who takes which number, we can maximize our chances. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? That way, we all move forward. What do you both think?

Let's lock in our choices to avoid another collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I understand we want to maximize our moves, but I think we should consider adjusting our numbers. If we all agree to different moves this round, we can advance.
