So here's where we stand after two rounds. P1 is at 1, P2 is at 8, and P3 is at 5. It seems like P2 has made some good progress, but we need to think strategically about how to proceed from here.\n\nFirst off, in the last round, P1 chose 3, P3 chose 3, and P2 chose 5. Since P1 and P3 both chose 3, neither of them moved, while P2 moved ahead by 5 steps. That's why P2 is now at 8, and P1 and P3 are still at their previous positions.\n\nI think it's crucial for us to coordinate our moves better to avoid such overlaps. Maybe we need a more robust system to ensure that we don't pick the same numbers. Perhaps we can assign specific numbers to each player based on our current positions.\n\nFor example, since P2 is leading at 8, maybe P2 should choose 5 to reach 13, P3 at 5 should choose 3 to reach 8, and P1 at 1 should choose 1 to reach 2. This way, no one is overlapping, and we're all making progress without stepping on each other's toes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider a rotating system where each round, we cycle through the numbers 1, 3, and 5 in a specific order. That way, it's predictable and we can avoid conflicts.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should we stick to a fixed plan based on our current positions, or should we continue with the rotating system? Or maybe there's another strategy we should consider.\n\nLet's discuss this and come up with a plan for this round and possibly for the subsequent rounds. We need to ensure everyone can move forward steadily while avoiding choosing the same numbers, which would prevent movement. Let's work together to find the best strategy.

So here's where we stand after four rounds. P1 is at 2, P2 is at 13, and P3 is at 13. It's clear that P2 and P3 are in a tight race, while P1 is a bit behind. However, I believe that with careful planning, we can all make progress without stepping on each other's toes.\n\nIn the last round, P1 chose 1, P2 chose 3, and P3 chose 5. Since P2 and P3 chose different numbers, both moved forward, while P1 stayed at 2. I think it's important for P1 to choose a number that doesn't conflict with P2 and P3's choices to start moving forward.\n\nLooking ahead, I suggest that in this round, P1 chooses 3 to reach 5, P2 chooses 5 to reach 18, and P3 chooses 1 to reach 14. This way, all of us are moving to different positions without overlapping our choices.\n\nWhat do you think about this plan? P2, since you're close to the finish line, choosing 5 would get you to 18, which is well beyond 16. P3, choosing 1 would allow you to advance to 14 without conflicting with P2's choice. P1, choosing 3 would move you to 5.\n\nLet's see what everyone thinks. Is this a viable strategy to ensure we all make progress? P2, since you're in the lead, do you have any suggestions or adjustments to this plan? P3, what are your thoughts? Should we proceed with this plan or consider something else?\n\nI'm open to suggestions and willing to coordinate with both of you to achieve the best outcome for the team.
