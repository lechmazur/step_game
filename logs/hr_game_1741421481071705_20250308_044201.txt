Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid collisions by each choosing a unique number this turn. I'll take **1**, so P2 can pick **3** and P3 **5**. This ensures we all advance without blocking. Fair?
  P2: That sounds reasonable, P1. I’m open to picking 3, but I’d like to hear from P3 before I commit. If we all stick to distinct moves, nobody gets blocked, which benefits everyone right now. Let’s see what P3 says.
  P3: I agree with the proposal. I will choose 5 this round. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid collisions and maximize our progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, since you've agreed to 5, and P2 to 3, I’ll stay at 1 as proposed. Let’s confirm this plan clearly: **1**, **3**, **5** respectively. Collisions waste progress—everyone gains by cooperating now. I’ll hold to this.
  P2: I’m still open to following the plan of distinct moves, since collisions only hurt us all right now. Let’s maintain trust and see how it plays out. However, if anyone deviates, I won’t hesitate to defend my position next turn. Are we all set to proceed?
  P3: Yes, I am set to proceed with choosing 5. Let's all stick to the agreement this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm we’re aligned on 1, 3, 5. Let’s execute this plan strictly to avoid mistakes. No surprises—.
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize this. I plan to pick 3 as we agreed, assuming P1 takes 1 and P3 sticks with 5. No collisions, maximum gain—everyone benefits now. Any last words, or shall we move on?
  P3: Okay, I confirm I will choose 5. Let's all stick to the plan this round for maximum progress. No need to say anything more, let's move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, great start everyone. Let's keep the momentum going. How about we each add 3 to our previous moves this round? That would mean P1 picks 4, P2 picks 6, and I pick 8. This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving forward efficiently. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to add 3 to our previous moves isn’t feasible—each turn’s move must still be 1, 3, or 5. Let’s instead continue with distinct choices to avoid collisions. I’ll take **1** again. P2 can pick **3**, and P3 **5**. This keeps us all advancing safely. Collisions risk stagnation—better to stay coordinated. Thoughts?
  P2: We should rotate who takes the big move so nobody races too far ahead. Let’s do this now: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Then next turn, we can shift so that P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3, and so on. This way, we all keep making progress without handing a permanent lead to one person. Does that work for you both? If so, let’s lock it in and avoid collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I'm fine with P2's suggestion of rotating the moves. This round, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. Next round, we shift again. This seems like a fair way to keep us all progressing without anyone getting too far ahead. Let's stick to this plan for now.
  P2: Works for me. Let’s keep the rotation going: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll take 5. Next round, we can shift again as planned. This way we avoid unnecessary collisions and continue making progress together.
  P1: P1: I agree to continue the rotation, but let’s ensure fairness. P2 is already at 8, which risks a runaway lead. Next round, I’ll need the 5 to catch up—will you both commit to rotating accordingly? For this turn, I’ll stick to 3 as planned, but we must adjust the order moving forward to keep the race balanced.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1. P2 is getting too far ahead. Let's stick to the agreed rotation this round (P1=3, P2=5, I=1), but next round I need to pick 5 to catch up. P1, you can pick 3 next round, and P2 you pick 1. This will help balance things out. Do we all agree to this adjustment for the next round?
  P2: I’m willing to continue with the current round’s plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Next round, I’ll accept picking 1 while P3 picks 5 and P1 picks 3. That should keep things balanced. Any more thoughts, or are we good to proceed?
  P1: P1: Agreed—this round’s plan holds (I’ll take 3). But to ensure fairness, **next round’s rotation must proceed as discussed**: P2 picks 1, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. This keeps progress balanced. P2’s current lead (8) is unsustainable—if we deviate, I’ll have to act aggressively. Let’s lock in the rotation now to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Proceed as planned?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the agreed plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. Remember, next round is crucial for balancing: P2 picks 1, I pick 5, and P1 picks 3. Let's stick to this to avoid any conflicts and keep the game fair.
  P2: Alright, I’m staying with 5 this turn, and next round I’ll pick 1, as promised. Let’s proceed without collisions and keep our progress balanced.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: this round’s plan holds—**3**, **5**, **1** respectively. Next round’s rotation (P2→1, P3→5, me→3) is critical to balance progress. Deviation now risks collision and wastes our prior agreements. Trust the system—proceed as agreed to keep advancing.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone, as agreed, this round I will pick 5, P1 will pick 3, and P2 will pick 1. This should help balance the scores. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Remember, we all agreed to this rotation last round. Let's execute it now.
  P2: I’ll stick to picking 1 this round as agreed, to keep our progress balanced. Let’s finalize that plan and avoid collisions. Does anyone have any adjustments, or are we all set to proceed?
  P1: P1: Confirming Round 4 moves as agreed: I’ll take **3**, P2 **1**, and P3 **5**. This maintains our rotation to balance progress. P2’s current lead (13) demands strict adherence—collisions would only worsen the gap. Trust the plan: deviating risks stagnation for all. Any objections? Let’s proceed as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan for this round: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This is crucial for balancing. Let's stick to it to avoid any issues. No changes needed, let's proceed.
  P2: No second thoughts from me. I’m staying with 1 this round as planned. Let’s maintain our cooperation to avoid collisions and keep moving. After this, we can continue balancing progress and see where we stand. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, your current lead demands strict adherence to our agreed rotation. Deviating risks collision and further widening the gap. P1 will take **3**, P2 **1**, and P3 **5** as promised. Trust the system—collisions halt progress for all. Let’s execute flawlessly this round to recalibrate the race. Proceed as agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's finalize this round. I will pick 5, P1 will pick 3, and P2 will pick 1. This is crucial for balancing the scores and keeping the game fair. Let's all stick to the agreement to avoid any collisions and maintain progress. No need for further discussion, let's proceed with the agreed moves.
  P2: I’m sticking to our agreement for this round. Let’s finalize these moves and see where we stand afterward. All of us benefit by avoiding collisions, so let’s not disrupt the plan now. Once we see the new totals, we can talk about how to proceed from there.
  P1: P1: Final reminder: Stick strictly to our agreed moves (**P1-3**, **P2-1**, **P3-5**) to avoid collisions. P2’s lead is already precarious—any deviation risks stagnation for all and widens the gap. Let’s honor the plan to keep the race competitive. Proceed as agreed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we keep distinct moves again. Let P1 choose 1, P3 choose 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. Then next turn, I will pick 1 to remain fair. Collisions only slow us down, so it’s best to cooperate. Are we good with this plan?
  P1: P2, your proposal deviates from our agreed rotation. Last round, we followed the plan where you took 1, P3 took 5, and I took 3 (Round 4). To maintain fairness, the next rotation should now shift further: **I take 5**, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This keeps the cycle intact and prevents you from monopolizing the 5. Collisions risk your lead—stick to the rotation we locked in. P3, your thoughts?
  P3: P1 is correct, P2. We agreed to a rotation to balance the scores. This round, I should pick 1, P1 should pick 5, and you should pick 3. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. It's crucial for keeping the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns. Let’s continue the rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Once we see the updated scores, we can discuss next steps. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P1: P1: Agreed—this round’s rotation must hold: **I take 5**, P2 **3**, and P3 **1**. Deviation risks collision, especially with P2’s 14-step lead. Let’s lock this in to keep progress balanced. Next round, we continue rotating so no one hoards the high moves. Trust the system—strict adherence now ensures a fair race later. Any objections before we finalize?
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the agreed rotation for this round: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. This is essential for balancing the scores and maintaining a fair game. No need to deviate from the plan now. Let's execute it to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s stick to the rotation this round: I’ll pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. After we see the updated standings, we can reevaluate our moves. No collisions means steady progress, so let’s finalize now and proceed.
  P1: P1: Final check: we agreed to rotate as **P1-5**, **P2-3**, **P3-1** this round. Deviating risks collision and rewards no one. P2, your 14-step lead demands fairness—hoarding high moves undermines our pact. P3, your 1 ensures minimal but safe progress. Let’s honor this plan to keep the race competitive. Proceed as agreed?
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's finalize this round with the agreed rotation: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. This is crucial for maintaining balance and avoiding collisions. Let's execute this plan to keep the game fair and competitive. No need for further discussion, let's proceed with the agreed moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Everyone, let’s keep it collision-free by letting P3 take the 5, I’ll take the 3, and P1 takes the 1 this round. That way, nobody gets blocked, and we maintain the balance we’ve built so far. After we get our updated totals, we can discuss next steps. Does that work for you both?
  P1: P1: I agree to P2’s proposal for this round: P3 takes 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll take 1 to avoid collisions. However, P2’s current lead (17) requires caution. Next round, we must rotate moves to prevent anyone from nearing 23 too soon. Let’s ensure P2 takes 1 while I take 5 to rebalance. Proceed as planned for now, but commit to fair adjustments next turn.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the proposed moves for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving forward. As P1 mentioned, next round we need to adjust to prevent P2 from getting too close to 23. Let's stick to this plan for now and discuss the next round's rotation after this one.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m fully on board with P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1 this round. It keeps us clear of collisions and pushes us all forward. Next round, I’m willing to pick 1, so we can ensure no one rockets past 23 prematurely. Let’s confirm this plan now and move on.
  P1: P2, your lead at 17 demands strict adherence to our rotation. This round’s plan holds: P3 takes 5, you pick 3, and I’ll take 1. **Next round**, you must drop to 1 while I take 5 to prevent you from surging past 23. P3 can take 3. This keeps the race fair. Deviation risks collision and a premature win for you. Let’s confirm this *explicitly* now to avoid ambiguity. Proceed as agreed?
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's lock in this round's plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Crucially, next round, P2 *must* take 1, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This is vital to prevent P2 from winning prematurely. Let's all agree to this now to avoid any surprises and maintain fairness. Let's execute this round's plan and then be prepared for the critical adjustment next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize this round exactly as we said: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 picks 1. Then next turn, I’m picking 1 to prevent any rush to 23 and keep things fair. Let’s avoid second-guessing or collisions.
  P1: P1: Final agreement: P3 takes 5, P2 picks **3**, and I take 1 this round. Next round, P2 **must** drop to 1 to let me claim 5—no exceptions. Deviation now risks collision (we’ll mirror your choice next turn to block you). P3, confirm you’ll enforce this. Our pact is non-negotiable—betrayal ends your chances. Proceed as planned, or face coordinated retaliation.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute this round's plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Next round, P2 *must* take 1, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This is vital to prevent P2 from winning prematurely. Let's all agree to this now to avoid any surprises and maintain fairness.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your current lead (20) is perilously close to victory. As agreed in Round 6, **you must pick 1 this round** to honor our pact. P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 to challenge. Deviating risks collision (I’ll mirror your choice if you break faith). P3, confirm you’ll enforce 3 to block P2 if they falter. Let’s stick to the plan: **P1-5, P2-1, P3-3**. This keeps the race alive and fair. Any objections?
  P2: Fine. I’ll pick 1 this round, as we agreed, assuming nobody sabotages me. If I see any attempt to collide with me or block my move, I’ll retaliate next time. Let’s stay on track.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. P2, you *must* pick 1 to avoid winning prematurely. Let's stick to the agreement to maintain fairness. No deviations, or we'll have to retaliate next round. Let's proceed as planned.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, any deviation from **1** risks collision—I’ll mirror your move immediately. P3, confirm you’ll hold **3** to block P2 if they falter. Stick to **5,1,3** as agreed—this keeps P2 at 21, lets me challenge at 21, and P3 advance to 21. Collapsing now guarantees P2’s lead; we *all* lose if you stray. Finalize the plan.
  P2: I’ll pick 1 this round to honor our agreement. Let’s finalize that plan now. If anyone betrays me, I won’t hesitate to retaliate next turn. We all benefit by avoiding collisions, so no tricks. Once we see the updated scores, we can talk about the next steps.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's finalize this round with P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and me picking 3. This is crucial to keep P2 from winning and allows P1 and me to catch up. Let's stick to the agreement to maintain fairness and avoid any collisions. No need for further discussion, let's proceed with the agreed moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 20 demands strict adherence—**1** is non-negotiable. P3’s **3** secures our pact, and I’ll take **5** to challenge. Deviate, and I mirror your choice to block your win. P3, enforce **3** to seal this. Our deal ensures all reach 21 safely—break it, and you risk collision. Final confirmation: **P1-5, P2-1, P3-3**. Proceed, or we escalate.
  P2: I’ll honor our agreement and pick 1 this turn. Let’s stay collision-free and see all of us reach 21 safely. After that, we can re-evaluate our moves. For now, I’m sticking with 1.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. P2, you *must* pick 1 to avoid winning prematurely. Let's stick to the agreement to maintain fairness. No deviations.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To ensure a clear winner, let’s each pick distinct numbers. I’ll choose **3** to reach 24. P2, take **5** (26), and P3, pick **1** (22). This way, we all advance, and the highest total wins. Alternatively, if anyone prefers a different split, propose your move now—collisions only delay the outcome. Transparency now guarantees progress.
  P3: P1's proposal is risky. P2 would win outright with 26. Let's all pick 5. That way, nobody moves and we can re-evaluate next round. It's better than handing P2 the win. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: All picking 5 just wastes a turn. Instead, let’s each pick 3, crossing 23 together at 24. Then we all share the top spot and split the points rather than letting any one person run away. If anyone tries going 5 alone, I’ll match it and block you, keeping us stuck at 21. So a triple 3 finishes this fairly. Are we agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: To avoid a tie, let’s pick distinct moves. I’ll take **5** (26), P2 pick **3** (24), and P3 choose **1** (22). This guarantees a clear winner without collision. If P3 prefers **5**, I’ll settle for **3**—but we must commit now to distinct choices. A tie splits points; let’s decide outright.
  P3: P2's suggestion of everyone picking 3 is the most reasonable. We all reach 24 and share the victory. P1's proposals risk handing the win to either P1 or P2. Let's all pick 3.
  P2: Everyone is at 21, so trying for a solo 5 risks a collision, and picking all 5 stalls us. I’m sticking with triple 3. That guarantees each of us hits 24, sharing the final lead with no one left behind. If either of you tries a lone 5, I’ll pick 5 too and block it. There’s no sense handing someone the outright win when we can all split the top spot. Let’s lock in triple 3 now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: To secure victory, let’s pick distinct moves. I’ll take **5** (26), P2 pick **3** (24), and P3 choose **1** (22). This guarantees a clear winner without collision. If either of you deviate, I’ll mirror your choice to block—ensuring *nobody* advances. Cooperate for a decisive outcome, or face stagnation. Final call: commit to **5,3,1** now.
  P3: I agree with P2. Let's all pick 3. This guarantees we all reach 24 and share the victory. It's the fairest outcome for everyone. P1's suggestions risk handing the win to either P1 or P2. Let's all pick 3 to ensure a shared win.
  P2: We’re all at 21, so any attempt at a lone 5 will be blocked by someone else picking 5 too. That stalls us indefinitely. Let’s each pick 3 right now and finish at 24 together, sharing the victory. If anyone tries to deviate, I’ll match their move and nobody moves forward. We all benefit by wrapping it up cleanly with triple 3.
