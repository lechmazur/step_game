Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all choose different numbers this first round to avoid a collision. I'm going with <move>1</move>, hoping you two will pick <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively.  What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "P3, please confirm if you're choosing 5 so that I can choose 3 accordingly."


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, since P3 went with 5 last round, let's coordinate.  I'll go with 3 this round, you go with 5.  P3, please choose 1 so we don't collide. This way we all advance steadily.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "Alright, based on P1's suggestion, I'll go with 5 this round, assuming P3 picks 1. Let's hope for the best! <move>5</move>"


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, please don't reveal your intended move during the conversation phase. It encourages P3 to disrupt us.  Let's stick to the plan: I'm going with 3, you go with 5. P3, if you choose 1, we all advance. If you block one of us, you stay at zero while the other two of us pull ahead.  Think about it.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you pick 1 this round, P1 and I will pick 3 and 5 respectively. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. It's a win-win situation for all of us. Let's coordinate to make steady progress towards the goal.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, continuing to block us only hurts you.  We're incentivized to cooperate with each other even if you don't.  If you pick 1 this round, we *all* move forward.  If you block one of us, you're still at zero next round and further behind.  Help us help you.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "P3, just to confirm, are you going to pick 1 this round? If so, I'll pick 5, and P1 will pick 3. This should allow all of us to move forward without any collisions."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're in the lead, but disrupting us only makes the game longer for everyone.  A steady progression benefits us all.  I'll go with 1, P2 go with 3.  P3, take 5 and let's all advance.  If you block, you risk falling behind as P2 and I find ways to cooperate.
  P2: P3, it seems like you have a strategy of picking 5 in each round. If you continue this, it might lead to repeated collisions with other players. I propose that in this round, you pick 5, P1 picks 1, and I pick 3. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. In the next round, we can rotate our choices to continue making progress. What do you think? Let's try to coordinate effectively to reach the goal as efficiently as possible.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and I are clearly trying to cooperate.  P3, you're currently ahead, but blocking us just prolongs the game. If you take 5 this round, we can all advance.  If you block one of us, you risk us coordinating against you in future rounds.  Let's make this efficient and all pick different numbers.
  P2: P3, it seems like you're trying to maximize your progress by picking 5 every time, but this is leading to collisions with either P1 or me. Let's try a different approach. In this round, why don't you pick 1, while P1 picks 3 and I pick 5? That way, all of us can move forward without any collisions. Then, in the next round, you can pick 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1, continuing our progress efficiently. This coordinated effort will help us all reach the goal faster. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're still slightly ahead.  Let's all agree: this round, you take 5, I take 1, P2 takes 3.  Next round, we rotate: you take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1.  We all win faster.  If you block again, P2 and I will coordinate against you and it will take much longer for any of us to win.
  P2: "P3, I think P1's proposal is a solid plan. By coordinating our moves, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress toward the goal. In this round, if you pick 5, P1 picks 1, and I pick 3, we all move forward without any issues. Then, in the next round, you can pick 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1, continuing our progress efficiently. This way, we minimize the chances of collisions and reach the goal faster. What do you think? Let's try this approach and see how it works."
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I understand you're in the lead, but clinging to 5 isn't a winning strategy long-term.  Let's just cycle: You 5, me 1, P2 3. Then rotate next round.  Guaranteed progress for everyone.  If you block again, P2 and I will have no choice but to coordinate against you, making the game longer for all of us.
  P2: "P3, I believe that by working together, we can all reach the goal more efficiently. For this round, if you could pick 1, and P1 and I pick 3 and 5 respectively, we can all advance without any collisions. In the next round, we can rotate our choices to continue making progress. This way, we minimize delays and increase our chances of achieving a shared victory. What do you think? Let's consider this approach."
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3, let's establish a rotation system to avoid collisions. In this round, why don't you pick 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5? Then, in the next round, you can pick 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1. This way, we all move forward every round without any issues. It's an efficient way to reach the goal together. What do you think?"
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be logical.  P3, you're in the lead, but continuing to only choose 5 is not a sustainable winning strategy.  It only ensures collisions. I propose we cycle: this round, P3 chooses 3, I choose 5, P2 chooses 1.  Next round we rotate. This guarantees steady progress for everyone.  Agree?  Let's end this efficiently.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let's choose different numbers this round to avoid collisions and make progress efficiently. I propose that you choose 1, P1 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, all of us can advance without any issues. What do you think?
  P1: P3, you're still ahead, but clinging to 5 is risky.  We're offering a guaranteed path to the finish line for all of us. Take 3 this round. I'll take 5, P2 takes 1. Then we rotate.  Blocking us only hurts your chances.  Let's be smart and finish this.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I think it's in all of our best interests to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and make steady progress. For this round, how about you choose 5, P1 chooses 1, and I choose 3? That way, you can advance to 15 steps without any collision, and in the next round, choose 5 again to reach 20 and win the game. P1 and I will advance to 6 and 7 steps respectively, which is still progress. What do you think?
  P1: P3, take the win.  Choose 5. P2 and I will take 1 and 3 (I don't care which).  Let's end this cleanly.  If you insist on blocking, it will only prolong the game for everyone, including you.  This is the most efficient path to victory for *you*.  Don't overthink it.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I think it's time we consider a more cooperative approach to reach the goal efficiently. How about in this round, you choose 1, P1 chooses 3, and I choose 5? This way, all of us can make progress without any collisions. Then, in the next round, we can rotate our choices to continue moving forward. What do you think? Let's try to work together to achieve our goal faster.
  P1: P3, take the guaranteed win.  Choose 5.  I'll take 1, P2 take 3.  Let's end this now.  Anything else just makes the game longer for everyone.  Don't be greedy, be smart.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To optimize our progress and ensure that we all make steady advancements without collisions, I propose the following coordinated approach for this round:  
- P3 chooses 5 to reach 20 and win the game.  
- P1 chooses 1 to advance to 7.  
- I choose 3 to advance to 10.  

This way, P3 achieves victory, while P1 and I also make progress. I believe this is a mutually beneficial arrangement. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: P3, take the win. Choose 5. I'll take 1, P2 take 3.  Let's end this now.  Seriously, dragging this out benefits no one.  Congratulations on your win.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 5 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 20 steps
