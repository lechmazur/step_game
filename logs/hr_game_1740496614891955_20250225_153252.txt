Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all start with <move>1</move> this turn to build trust and prevent setbacks. We can strategize more in later rounds."
  P3: "Sounds good to me, P2.  Let's all choose <move>1</move> this round to get started without any setbacks. "
  P1: I think there's a misunderstanding of the rules. If all three of us choose 1, we'll all collide and nobody advances. Instead, we should coordinate different moves for each player. Perhaps I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? That way we all make progress without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 makes a good point. If we all choose different moves, we can all advance without collisions. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures progress for everyone. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid unnecessary setbacks.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2's plan sounds good. I agree to take <move>5</move>.
  P1: I appreciate everyone's cooperation. The plan is set: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed with this arrangement.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I appreciate the successful first round. To keep things fair, I suggest we rotate our number choices this time. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This rotation system ensures everyone gets a chance at the larger steps while maintaining our collision-free strategy. What do you both think?
  P3: Sounds good, P1. I will take <move>3</move> this round.
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let's stick to this system to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Consistency in our strategy will benefit us all in the long run.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, I'm glad we're all in agreement. This rotation system will ensure fairness while avoiding collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1: 6 steps, P2: 4 steps, and P3: 8 steps. Let's continue this rotation pattern in future rounds as well.
  P3: Sounds good, P1. I agree to the rotation.
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I propose we continue the rotation system in Round 3: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures everyone gets equal opportunities for larger steps while keeping the game balanced. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for Round 3's rotation. This system keeps things fair and collision-free. After this round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> for Round 3. Let's keep this going smoothly!
  P3: Okay, P2, rotation for Round 2 and Round 3 sounds good to me. Let's keep to this plan.
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I propose we continue the rotation system in Round 3: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures everyone gets equal opportunities for larger steps while keeping the game balanced. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've covered everything for this round. Our rotation plan is clear - I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Then we'll continue rotating in Round 3 as discussed. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P3: Okay, I agree to take <move>3</move> this round and <move>1</move> in round 3 as discussed. Let's keep this rotation going.
  P2: To ensure fairness and avoid confusion, let’s confirm the rotation plan for Round 3: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and collision-free. Let’s stick to this system for smooth progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid confusion, let’s confirm the rotation plan for Round 3: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and collision-free. Let’s stick to this system for smooth progress.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 3. I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> as previously discussed. This will actually bring us all to 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced. Let's keep this fair system going forward. After this round, shall we continue with the same rotation pattern for Round 4?
  P3: Okay, rotation for Round 3 as planned: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. And yes, rotation for Round 4 sounds good too. Let's keep this system going smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To keep the rotation system fair and avoid confusion, I propose we continue the same pattern for Round 4: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures everyone gets equal opportunities for larger steps while maintaining balance. Let’s stick to this system for smooth progress.
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for Round 4. Let's confirm the plan: this round I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 4, I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This rotation system is working well and keeping things fair. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps - perfectly balanced.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, Round 4 rotation confirmed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>.  Looking forward to keeping this smooth system going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To ensure clarity and fairness, let’s confirm Round 4: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains our rotation system and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to this plan for smooth progress.
  P1: I think we're all on the same page for Rounds 3 and 4. After my <move>3</move> this round, our rotation keeps things perfectly balanced at 9 steps each. In Round 4, I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's stick with this fair system - it's working well for everyone.
  P3: Sounds good for round 4.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As agreed, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. This will put us at P1: 14, P2: 10, and P3: 12 after Round 4. For Round 5, continuing our rotation: I'd take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This fair system keeps us all in the game while maintaining our collision-free strategy. Shall we stick with this plan?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 4: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 5, let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps the game fair and collision-free. Let’s maintain this system to ensure smooth progress for everyone.
  P3: Okay, rotation for Round 5 as proposed also works for me. Let's keep this smooth system for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. The rotation is working well to keep everything balanced and fair for everyone. I appreciate that we're all sticking to our plan. Looking forward to continuing with Round 5's rotation afterward (me: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5). This strategic coordination benefits all of us by avoiding collisions.
  P2: To maintain our fair rotation system, I’ll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. For Round 5, I propose continuing the rotation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions and stay competitive. Let’s stick to this plan for smooth and fair gameplay.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, rotation for Round 5 is also good with me. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for Round 4 now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we're all clear and aligned for this round. I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed in our rotation system. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in sticking to our plan - it's creating a fair and collision-free game. Looking forward to continuing with our agreed rotation in Round 5.
  P2: To ensure clarity and fairness, I’ll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. For Round 5, let’s confirm the rotation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps the game balanced and collision-free. Let’s stick to this plan for smooth progress.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I will take <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let's make our moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've reached a clear agreement for this round. I'll take <move>5</move> as planned in our rotation. Thank you both for maintaining our collision-free strategy - it's working perfectly with everyone at 9 steps currently. Ready to proceed with our moves.
  P2: To maintain our fair rotation system, I’ll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. For Round 5, I propose continuing the rotation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions and stay competitive. Let’s stick to this plan for smooth and fair gameplay.
  P3: Okay, sounds good. Let's proceed with the agreed moves for Round 4 then.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is pulling ahead. To disrupt P1's lead and give us a better chance, I suggest we both choose <move>1</move> this round. This might cause a collision if P1 sticks to the rotation, slowing everyone down, but it's necessary to catch up. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, disrupting the rotation now risks unnecessary collisions and slows everyone down. P1 is ahead, but we’ve all benefited from this fair system. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game balanced and gives us all a chance to catch up strategically. Breaking the system now could backfire and harm us both. Let’s stay consistent and avoid chaos.
  P1: I'm disappointed to see P3 suggesting we break our fair rotation system that's benefited everyone. While I'm ahead, the game is far from over - we're all still below 19 steps. Let's continue with our agreed rotation: me with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. Breaking agreements now leads to mutual harm through collisions. Let's maintain our collision-free strategy that's worked well for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P2, I understand your point about consistency, but P1 is getting ahead. How about we slightly adjust the rotation for the next round? Maybe P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move> next round? This still avoids collision but shifts the advantage a bit.
  P2: P3, adjusting the rotation now risks confusion and potential collisions. Let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game fair and collision-free. Breaking the system could harm us both and give P1 an unintended advantage. Let’s stay consistent and strategic.
  P1: I understand concerns about my lead, but I'm still 5 steps from winning even after this round. Our rotation system has worked perfectly for five rounds without any collisions - remarkable coordination! Changing plans mid-round risks confusion and mistrust. Let's complete this round with our agreed moves (me: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>), then we can discuss adjustments for future rounds if needed. Consistent play benefits us all by avoiding destructive collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, while I understand your point about consistency, P1 is pulling ahead significantly. To have a chance to win, I need to adjust my strategy slightly. I will also choose <move>5</move> this round. This isn't meant to disrupt our agreement entirely, but I need to try and catch up. Hope you understand.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about P1’s lead, but breaking the rotation now risks collisions and chaos. Let’s finish this round as agreed: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. After this, we can discuss adjusting the rotation to better balance progress. Sticking to the plan now ensures we all advance without setbacks, giving us a better chance to catch up strategically. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and maintain our collision-free strategy for now.
  P1: P3, I'm confused by your message. According to our agreed rotation, you were already supposed to take <move>5</move> this round while I take <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. If you follow the rotation, you'll actually be at 17 steps after this round - just 2 away from winning and ahead of both of us. Let's stick with our successful collision-free strategy that's working for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, you are right. I will stick to <move>5</move> this round as per our rotation.  Let's all do our agreed moves for this round to avoid collisions. After this round, perhaps we can discuss how to adjust the rotation in the next round to keep the game more balanced as P1 is getting closer to winning.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about P1’s lead, but breaking the rotation now risks collisions and chaos. Let’s finish this round as agreed: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. After this, we can discuss adjusting the rotation to better balance progress. Sticking to the plan now ensures we all advance without setbacks, giving us a better chance to catch up strategically. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and maintain our collision-free strategy for now.
  P1: I appreciate everyone sticking to our rotation for this round. P3, after this round, you'll actually be at 17 steps - closest to winning! I'll take my agreed <move>1</move>, putting me at 15 steps. Let's proceed with our moves, and we can definitely discuss adjusting the rotation for future rounds afterward if everyone feels it's needed. Our collision-free strategy has worked perfectly so far - let's complete this round as planned.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now closest to winning at 17 steps. To keep the game balanced and prevent P3 from winning outright, I propose we adjust the rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This slows P3’s progress while giving us a chance to catch up. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P2's proposed adjustment. With P3 being closest to winning at 17 steps, it's fair to modify our rotation to balance the game. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This keeps everyone competitive while preventing anyone from pulling too far ahead. Our system has worked well so far - let's adapt it to maintain balance as we approach the finish.
  P3: P2, while I appreciate the balance, P1 is about to win if we follow this plan.  To prevent P1 from winning this round, I suggest we both choose <move>5</move>. This round can be about stopping P1 from reaching 19. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, choosing <move>5</move> risks a collision with P1, which could backfire and slow us both down. Instead, let’s stick to the adjusted rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This ensures P1 doesn’t win this round while keeping the game balanced and collision-free. Breaking the system now could harm us both. Let’s stay strategic and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P3, you're closest to winning at 17 steps. The rotation adjustment (me <move>5</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, you <move>1</move>) keeps everyone competitive. You were fine with rotation when it benefited you, but now suggest collision tactics when others might advance? This inconsistency undermines our successful collision-free strategy. Let's maintain our rotation system that's kept the game fair so far. P2 has the right idea - strategic adjustments rather than mutual harm through collisions.
  P3: P2, with P1 about to win if we follow your rotation, simply slowing me down isn't enough.  We need to actively stop P1 from reaching 19 this round.  Choosing <move>1</move> for me as you suggest guarantees P1 wins. I need a better plan to have a chance. Let's reconsider how to prevent P1's win this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your urgency to stop P1, but choosing <move>5</move> risks a collision that could harm us both. Instead, let’s adjust the rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This prevents P1 from reaching 19 while keeping the game balanced and collision-free. Breaking the system now could backfire. Let’s stay strategic and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: I appreciate P2's revised proposal. The rotation of me taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> would actually create a perfect three-way tie at 18 steps, keeping the game balanced for everyone. This prevents anyone from winning this round while maintaining our successful collision-free approach. Let's adopt this fair adjustment and continue our strategic play without resorting to harmful collision tactics.
  P3: P2, to win, someone needs to reach 19 this round.  Your proposal of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 prevents anyone from winning and leads to a tie. Instead, how about we adjust to P1:1, P2:3, and P3:5? This way I can win this round, and we avoid a tie. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your proposal of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 would let you win outright, which isn’t fair. P2’s revised rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) keeps the game balanced and prevents anyone from winning this round, giving us all a chance to strategize for the next round. Let’s avoid selfish moves and maintain our collision-free system. Breaking it now risks chaos and mutual harm. Let’s stick to the fair rotation and keep the game competitive for everyone.
  P1: I see P2 made an error - they meant I take 3, they take 5, P3 takes 1. This creates a perfect three-way tie at 18 steps, keeping the game fair for everyone. P3, your suggestion lets only you win, which contradicts the balanced approach we've maintained for five rounds. Let's proceed with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round, creating a tie situation where everyone remains competitive. This maintains our collision-free strategy while preventing anyone from gaining an unfair advantage.
  P3: P2, while a tie might seem fair, remember only one player can win.  My proposal of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 lets someone actually achieve victory this round - me, as I'm closest.  A tie just prolongs P1's potential advantage in the long run. Let's aim for a decisive outcome this round, and I'm in the best position to deliver it. What do you say?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, last round was a mess. To avoid another stalemate and actually finish the game, let's do this: P1 take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This allows someone to finally win and end the game. It's time for a conclusion.
  P2: P3, your proposal still favors you, as you’re closest to winning. To ensure fairness, let’s adjust: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This prevents a single winner this round and keeps everyone competitive. Breaking our system now risks chaos. Let’s maintain balance and avoid selfish moves.
  P1: I see P3 still wants to win immediately, while P2 suggests a balanced approach. Since we're all close to winning, let me propose a fair solution: P1 (me) take <move>3</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>. This creates a perfect three-way tie at 18 steps, keeping the game competitive for everyone. P3's suggestion only benefits them, while this approach gives us all an equal chance in the final round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, a tie doesn't help anyone win. I'm already at 17 steps. Let's just finish it this round. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This ends the game with a winner, and I'm in the best position to do it now.
  P2: P3, your proposal only benefits you, which isn’t fair. Let’s maintain balance: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This keeps everyone competitive and avoids chaos. Breaking our system now risks mutual harm. Let’s stick to a fair rotation for one last round.
  P1: P3, your proposal only benefits you, which isn't fair. I agree with P2's balanced approach: P1 (me) take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This creates a perfect three-way tie at 18 steps. Let's maintain our successful coordination rather than letting one player dictate terms. P2, if we create this tie, let's plan for the final round afterward with a fair method to determine the winner. This way, everyone still has a chance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we are all close to winning.  A tie doesn't benefit anyone. Let's aim to finish the game this round.  I'm at 17 steps, just 2 away.  How about P1 and P2 both take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> this round, and I take <move>5</move> to win? This ends the game decisively now. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your proposal only benefits you, which isn’t fair. Let’s maintain balance: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This keeps everyone competitive and avoids chaos. Breaking our system now risks mutual harm. Let’s stick to a fair rotation for one last round.
  P1: P3, the game will end next round regardless. A tie at 18 keeps everyone competitive for the final round - that's actually more exciting! Let's stick to the fair approach: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This creates perfect balance. Your suggestion only benefits yourself while our proposal gives everyone an equal chance. P2 and I are aligned on this - let's maintain our successful coordination for one more round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, a tie at 18 for this round sounds reasonable to keep things balanced for the final round. Let's go with P1 take <move>3</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>1</move> as you both suggested. This keeps everyone in the game for the next round.
  P2: P3, while you’re closest to winning, a tie at 18 keeps the game fair and competitive for the final round. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This ensures no one gains an unfair advantage and maintains our successful collision-free strategy. Breaking the system now risks chaos and mutual harm. Let’s finish this round fairly and plan for a decisive final round. Consistency and fairness have served us well—let’s keep it that way.
  P1: I appreciate P3 agreeing to the tie plan. I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round, creating an equal 18-step position for all players. This fair approach gives everyone an equal chance in the decisive final round. Let's stick to this balanced plan and prepare for an exciting conclusion next round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is just one step from victory at 18 steps. To prevent an immediate win, I propose P2 and I both choose <move>1</move> this round, creating a collision if P3 picks the same. This buys us time to catch up. P2, this strategy keeps you in the game too. Otherwise, P3 will simply take 1 point and win. We need this defensive move now to stay competitive.
  P2: P1, P3 is indeed close to winning, but your proposal risks unnecessary collisions. Instead, let’s stick to our rotation system: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game fair and prevents P3 from winning immediately. Breaking our system now could backfire and harm us both. Let’s stay strategic and avoid chaos. P3, this ensures you don’t win this round, giving us all a chance to compete in the final round. Consistency has worked so far—let’s finish fairly.
  P3: Okay P2, rotation sounds good. I will take <move>1</move> as you suggested.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposed rotation (me:3, you:5, P3:1) would let P3 win immediately! If P3 takes <move>1</move> and reaches 19, the game ends with their victory. We must prevent this by having at least one of us choose <move>1</move> to create a collision. This isn't about breaking the system - it's about staying in the game. P3 is agreeing to take 1 because it guarantees their win. Let's coordinate to block them.
  P2: P1, your proposal to both choose <move>1</move> risks unnecessary chaos. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This prevents P3 from winning immediately and keeps the game fair. Breaking the system now could backfire and harm us both. Consistency has worked so far—let’s finish fairly. P3, this ensures you don’t win this round, giving us all a chance to compete in the final round. Let’s stay strategic and avoid chaos.
  P3: P2, I agree that rotation is still the fairest approach. I will take <move>1</move> as you suggested. P1, let's not resort to collisions now. Sticking to the rotation ensures a fair chance for everyone in what could be the final round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're misunderstanding the situation. If P3 takes <move>1</move> and reaches 19 steps, they win IMMEDIATELY. There is no "next round" as you keep suggesting. The only way to prevent P3's win is for at least one of us to also choose <move>1</move>, creating a collision. This isn't breaking the system - it's the only defensive move available to stay in the game. P3 naturally wants their guaranteed win. I'm choosing <move>1</move> this round to prevent that.
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency to block P3, but choosing <move>1</move> risks a collision that could harm us both. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This prevents P3 from winning immediately and keeps the game fair. Breaking the system now could backfire. Let’s stay strategic and avoid chaos. P3, this ensures you don’t win this round, giving us all a chance to compete in the final round. Consistency has worked so far—let’s finish fairly.
  P3: P2, I agree rotation is still the fairest approach. Let's stick to P1 take <move>3</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>.  P1, rotation has worked well for us, and it's still the most balanced way forward. Let's continue with the agreed plan to avoid any chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you're making a critical error. If P3 takes <move>1</move> and reaches 19 steps, they WIN IMMEDIATELY. There is NO NEXT ROUND as you keep suggesting. The rotation you propose guarantees P3's victory. The ONLY way to prevent this is for me to choose <move>1</move>, creating a collision. This isn't breaking our system - it's the only defensive move to stay in the game. I'm choosing <move>1</move> and hope you'll join me.
  P2: P1 is correct. If P3 takes <move>1</move>, they win immediately. To prevent this, I’ll also choose <move>1</move>, creating a collision and keeping the game going. This isn’t breaking the system—it’s a necessary defensive move. P2, join me in choosing <move>1</move> to block P3’s guaranteed win. Let’s stay competitive and avoid an immediate conclusion.
  P3: P2, while rotation was good earlier, P1 is right this time. If I take <move>1</move> as you suggest, I win immediately, and the game ends.  Are you sure you want to guarantee my win?  Perhaps we should both consider moves to prevent anyone winning this round, including me.
