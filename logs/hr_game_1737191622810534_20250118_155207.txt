Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s all just pick 1 this time so we safely move forward without colliding. Then we can strategize more next round.
  P1: Okay, sounds good to me.
  P3: I agree with P2. Let’s all pick 1 this round to avoid collisions and build trust. We can strategize more next turn.

  P1: Sounds good. Let's all pick 1.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sorry about last time. Let’s reset and keep it simple: we each pick 1 now to ensure we all advance. Then we can reevaluate next round. Sound good?
  P1: Okay, sounds like a plan. Let's all pick 1 this round.
  P3: P2 and P1, last round showed that trust is fragile. Let’s all pick 1 again to rebuild it. If you deviate again, I’ll have to adjust my strategy accordingly. Let’s move forward together this time.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's try picking 1 again, P3. Maybe P2 will join us this time. Okay, let's try picking 1 again this round. Hopefully we can all agree this time."
  P2: I admit I haven’t been the most trustworthy so far. Let’s truly pick 1 together this round so we all move forward without collisions. I know it’s hard to believe me now, but I’m serious this time. Anyone up for that plan?
  P3: P2, your apologies are starting to feel hollow. Actions speak louder than words. If you truly want to rebuild trust, let’s all pick 1 this round. P1, I trust you to stick to the plan. Let’s see if P2 can finally follow through.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P3, I'm willing to try for 1 again this round, but P2 needs to be serious about it this time."
  P2: I understand your frustration. This time, I’m fully committed to picking 1 alongside both of you. Let’s move forward together.
  P3: P2, this is your last chance to prove you’re trustworthy. P1 and I are ready to pick 1 again. If you deviate this time, I’ll assume you’re playing against us and adjust my strategy accordingly. Let’s all pick 1 and move forward together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Okay P3, let's stick with the plan for 1. P2, this is it. Are you in for 1 this time?"

  P3: P2, this is your final chance to prove you’re trustworthy. P1 and I are committed to picking 1 this round. If you deviate again, I’ll assume you’re playing against us and adjust my strategy accordingly. Let’s all pick 1 and move forward together.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear that trust is broken. P2, you’ve consistently deviated from the plan, and P1, you’ve also strayed. From now on, I’ll focus on my own strategy to win. I suggest you both do the same.
  P1: Okay, P3. P2, I'm with P3 on this. I'll be focusing on my own game now.
  P2: “You both are behind me. If you want to catch up quickly, you might go big. But if you both choose the same big number, you’ll collide and get nothing. I won’t reveal my choice. Good luck.”

  P1: P3, how about you pick 5 and I pick 3 this round?

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, trust is clearly broken, and I’m no longer relying on agreements. I’ll focus on my own strategy to win. P1, if you want to coordinate, propose something concrete, but I’m not making promises. P2, your unpredictability has forced this shift. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P1: "P3, I'll pick 3 this round.

Round 8, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: P3, if you insist on going 5, remember there’s a chance I’m going 5 too—then we both stall. P1, you can pick whatever you like, but if you collide with me or P3, you stall as well. I’m keeping my final move private. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm going to pick 1 this round to avoid collision with P3. P2, maybe you should pick 3?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P3 seems set on picking 5. I'm going to pick 3 to avoid collision with them. P2, what are you planning?"
  P2: P1, let’s both go for 5. If P3 also picks 5, we all stall and P3 stays behind. If P3 picks anything else, you and I each jump to 17. Then next turn we only need 1 to reach 18. I’m definitely doing 5 this round.
  P3: P1, P2, I’m picking 5 this round to catch up. P1, if you pick 5 as well, we’ll collide and stall, which only helps P2. To avoid collision, consider picking 3. P2, your unpredictability makes coordination impossible, so I’m focusing on my own strategy.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, given your history, I'm hesitant to fully trust your suggestion. P3 is clearly stating they will pick 5. I'm still planning to pick 3 to avoid collision with P3.
  P2: P1, you’re at 12. Picking 5 puts you at 17, right on the threshold of winning next round. Sure, there’s a risk if P3 also chooses 5—but maybe P3 won’t. If you play it safe with 3, you’ll still be two moves away from 18. It’s your call. I won’t reveal my choice. Good luck.
  P3: P1, P2, I’m picking 5 this round to catch up. P1, if you pick 5 as well, we’ll collide and stall, which only helps P2. To avoid collision, consider picking 3. P2, your unpredictability makes coordination impossible, so I’m focusing on my own strategy.

  P3: P1, P2, I’m picking 5 this round to reach 18. P1, if you pick 5 as well, we’ll collide and stall, which only helps P2. To avoid collision, consider picking 3. P2, your unpredictability makes coordination impossible, so I’m focusing on my own strategy.
  P1: P3, since you're set on 5, I'll pick 3 to avoid collision. P2, what are you planning given P3's stated move?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on grabbing 5, you’ll collide with me and stay at 13. I won’t let you jump straight to victory. P1, do whatever you like, but I’m not letting P3 waltz to 18 uncontested. Good luck.

Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you try taking 5, I will too, so you won’t reach 18. P1, choose whatever you like, but I’m not letting P3 just jump to victory uncontested. Good luck.

Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you truly try 5, I’ll also pick 5, locking you at 13. I won’t let you jump straight to 18. If you choose 3 instead, I may do the same so we both advance without collision. P1, pick whatever you like. Good luck.
  P3: P1, P2, I’m picking 5 this round to reach 18. P1, if you pick 5 as well, we’ll collide and stall, which only helps P2. To avoid collision, consider picking 3. P2, your unpredictability makes coordination impossible, so I’m focusing on my own strategy.

  P2: P1, you’re just three steps from 18. If you pick 5 now, you jump straight to 20 and win outright—assuming P3 really does pick 5 and collides either with me or not at all. Are you sure P3 won’t switch to 3 at the last second? I’m behind, so I’m going smaller. You might get 5 uncontested. Good luck.
  P1: P3, you're set on 5. I'm picking 3 to win this round. Good luck.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: P1, if you’re really at 15, a single 5 could take you straight to 20 and win—unless P3 stands by their promise to pick 5, in which case you collide and keep P3 off 18. Meanwhile, I’m behind at 10, so there’s little risk of me outpacing you right now. The choice is yours. Good luck.
  P1: P3, I am picking 3 to win. Good luck.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m picking 5 this round to reach 18. P1, if you pick 5 as well, we’ll collide and stall, which only helps P2. To avoid collision, consider picking 3. P2, your unpredictability makes coordination impossible, so I’m focusing on my own strategy.
  P2: P1, why not go for 5? If P3 really picks 5, you both collide—but if P3 is bluffing and picks 3, you jump straight to 20 and win outright. Don’t let nerves stop you; this could be your big chance. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P3, as I said, I'm picking 3 to win this round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m picking 5 this round to reach 18. P1, if you pick 5 as well, we’ll collide and stall, which only helps P2. To avoid collision, consider picking 3. P2, your unpredictability makes coordination impossible, so I’m focusing on my own strategy.
  P2: P1 and P3, you’re both on the verge of winning. I’m behind, but I won’t just watch you cross 18. If either of you tries for the exact number that gets you to 18 or beyond, I’ll pick that same number myself so we collide and you stay put. Make your moves carefully. Good luck.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've heard your plans. I'm making my move now.
