Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. It might be beneficial for us to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I suggest we each choose different numbers to maximize our chances. I'm willing to take any number - what do you both prefer?
  P1: "I agree with P3. Choosing different numbers is the best way to ensure we all have a chance to advance. I'll take 5, you two can decide on 1 and 3 between yourselves."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I can take 1, so P3 can choose 3. That way, we avoid any collisions. What do you think?
  P3: That works for me - I'll take 3. Seems like a fair arrangement to start.
  P1: I'll start by saying that I'm willing to collaborate with you both to ensure we all have a chance to advance. However, I do want to point out that choosing 5 might give me an advantage in the long run, since it's the highest number and could potentially allow me to reach 16 steps more quickly. What are your thoughts on this? Should we stick with our original plan or consider alternative strategies?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we should stick to our original plan. I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and maximize our chances to advance. Let's confirm this before we move. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2 - let's stick to the original plan. I'll take 3.
  P1: "I'm glad we agree on the initial plan. However, I want to clarify that I'm not committing to choosing 5 every turn. I'll adapt my strategy as the game progresses. Let's focus on avoiding collisions for now and reassess after the first move."


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we're all on the same page with our plan. Just to confirm: I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 5. Let's stick to that to avoid any collisions. Are we all set?
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with 3 as discussed.
  P1: "I'm glad we agree on the initial plan. However, I want to clarify that I'm not committing to choosing 5 every turn. I'll adapt my strategy as the game progresses. Let's focus on avoiding collisions for now and reassess after the first move."

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see our coordination worked well last round. I'm happy to keep taking 3 if you both want to maintain the same numbers. What do you think?
  P1: "I agree with P3 that our coordination worked well last round. I'm willing to keep taking 5, but I want to hear from P2 before we confirm our moves. What are your thoughts, P2?"
  P2: I think we should stick to our previous strategy. I'll take 1 again, which has worked well, and I encourage you both to confirm your numbers so we can avoid collisions. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree - let's stick with our successful strategy from last round. I'll take 3 again.
  P1: I'm glad we agree to stick with our previous strategy. Since it worked well last round, I'll take 5 again. P2, you'll take 1, and P3, you'll take 3. Let's confirm this plan to avoid any collisions. What do you both think?

Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 again.
  P1: "I think we've established a good rhythm, but I want to remind everyone that we're still early in the game. We should remain flexible and be prepared to adjust our strategies if needed. For now, I'm sticking with 5, but I'll be keeping an eye on the progress of P2 and P3."

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "I'm glad to see our coordination has worked well so far. However, I want to remind everyone that we're getting closer to the end of the game, and we should start thinking about our long-term strategies. I'm still willing to take 5, but I want to hear from P2 and P3 about their thoughts on the current state of the game. Are we going to stick with our original plan or consider alternative strategies?"
  P2: I think it's important to reassess our strategies as we approach the end of the game. P1 is currently in the lead, and we need to be mindful of that. I'm still committed to taking 1, but I suggest P3 consider a different number this round to create some diversity. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree we need to be strategic now. P1 has a significant lead at 10 steps. While our coordination has worked well, I might need to reconsider my number choice to stay competitive. Let's hear everyone's thoughts before committing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I agree with P2 that we should reassess our strategies, especially since I'm currently in the lead. P3, you're considering changing your number choice to stay competitive. I want to remind you that deviating from our original plan could lead to collisions and benefit me even more. Are you willing to take that risk, or should we stick with our original plan?"
  P2: P2: I understand the need to reassess, but I still believe taking 1 is my best option to avoid collisions. P3, if you want to change your number to gain an advantage, just be careful not to collide with P1. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I need to make a strategic move since I'm 4 steps behind P1. I think I'll change my number this round, but I won't reveal which one yet. P2, you should definitely keep your 1 to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "I understand that P3 is considering changing their number choice to stay competitive. However, I want to remind everyone that deviating from our original plan could lead to collisions and benefit me even more. Are you willing to take that risk, or should we stick with our original plan?"
  P2: I appreciate everyone's thoughts on strategy. Given that I'm currently behind, I think it's crucial for P3 to stick to their number to avoid collisions with P1. I’ll keep my 1 to ensure I can advance safely. P1, what are your thoughts on possibly changing your number to keep the game dynamic?
  P3: Given my position 4 steps behind P1, I need to be strategic. I won't commit to taking 3 this round, as that would make it too predictable. P2, you should definitely stick with 1 to guarantee your advancement.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "I understand that P3 is considering changing their number choice to stay competitive. However, I want to remind everyone that deviating from our original plan could lead to collisions and benefit me even more. Are you willing to take that risk, or should we stick with our original plan?"
  P2: I understand the need for strategy as we move forward. P3, since you're considering changing your number, I suggest you choose a number that won't collide with P1's 5. I’ll stick with 1 to ensure my advancement. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I understand P1's warning about collisions, but being 4 steps behind means I need to take calculated risks. I'll make my choice carefully, keeping in mind both the need to catch up and avoid unnecessary collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: "I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P3, you're considering changing your number choice to stay competitive, but I want to remind you that deviating from our original plan could lead to collisions and benefit me even more. Are you willing to take that risk, or should we stick with our original plan?"
  P2: I agree we need to be strategic, especially since P1 is in the lead. P3, if you're considering changing your number, please be cautious to avoid colliding with P1. I’ll stick with 1 to ensure I can advance safely. Let's confirm our moves soon! What are your thoughts?
  P3: I need to make my own strategic choice this round to catch up. While I appreciate the coordination we've had, being 4 steps behind P1 means I can't keep playing predictably. Let's proceed.

  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Given the current state of the game, I think it's clear that P3's decision to change their number choice last round didn't quite work out as planned. I'm still in the lead, and P3 is now 4 steps behind me. I'm willing to continue with our original plan, but I want to hear from P2 and P3 about their thoughts on how to proceed. Should we stick with our original plan or consider alternative strategies?"
  P3: I acknowledge my risky move last round didn't pay off. While I'm still 4 steps behind P1, colliding wasn't productive. I suggest we return to our original coordination - I'll take 3 if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion to return to our original coordination. I agree that sticking to our plan could help us avoid collisions. I'll take 1 again, and I think P1 should continue with 5 while P3 takes 3. Are we ready to confirm this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I agree with P3's suggestion to return to our original coordination. However, I want to remind everyone that I'm still in the lead, and sticking to the original plan may not be the best strategy for P2 and P3. Are you both willing to take that risk, or should we consider alternative strategies?"
  P3: Let's be realistic - I need to catch up to P1 but collisions clearly don't help anyone. I'll commit to taking 3 this round if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5.
  P2: I agree with the suggestion to return to our original coordination. I'll take 1 again, and I think P1 should continue with 5 while P3 takes 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and maximize our chances to advance. Let's confirm our moves! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "I think we've established a good rhythm, but I want to remind everyone that we're still early in the game. We should remain flexible and be prepared to adjust our strategies if needed. For now, I'm sticking with 5, but I'll be keeping an eye on the progress of P2 and P3."
  P3: I'll definitely take 3 this round. After last round's collision, I see that coordinating is better than risking everything. Let's stick to our original plan - P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5.
  P2: I agree with the plan to stick to our original coordination. I'll take 1 again, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 5. Let's confirm this to avoid any collisions and maximize our chances to advance. Are we ready to proceed?

  P3: I confirm one final time that I'll take 3. Let's proceed with our coordinated plan.
  P2: I think we should stick to our coordinated plan. I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Are we ready to confirm our moves?
