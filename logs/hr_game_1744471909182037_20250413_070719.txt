Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we each choose a different number this turn? I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 3, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we'll all advance and make progress. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: Agreed, I'll go with 3 this turn. P2, if you choose 5, we can all advance without collisions, just like P3 suggested. It builds trust for future rounds. What do you say?
  P2: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions. I'll choose 5 as suggested. This way, we can all make progress together. Let's stick to the plan and trust each other this round. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we have a consensus on the plan. To further build trust, I propose we establish a rotation for future rounds. For example, next round, P1 could choose 1, P2 could choose 3, and I could choose 5. We can continue this rotation to minimize collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we commit to this rotation for the next few rounds?
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for next round—it seems fair and helps us all progress without issues. I'll stick to choosing 3 this turn as planned. P2, are you okay with committing to this? Let's keep the trust going.
  P2: I appreciate the consensus we've built so far. However, I want to remind you both that while collaboration is great, I also have my own goal to win. If we commit to the rotation, I might need to reconsider my choices in future rounds to ensure I stay competitive. For this round, I'm still choosing 5 as planned. Let's see how it plays out!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P2's point about staying competitive. To address this, I propose we reassess our strategy after a few rounds. If we notice someone is significantly ahead, we can adjust our rotation plan to ensure everyone stays in the game. This way, we maintain trust while also keeping the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we agree to review our strategy after, say, 3-4 rounds and make adjustments as needed?
  P1: I appreciate the idea of reviewing our strategy after 3-4 rounds to keep things fair and competitive, P3. It addresses P2's concerns well. For this turn, I'm committed to choosing 3 as planned. Let's move forward with trust for now.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion we've had so far. While I value our collaboration, I also want to remind everyone that in a competitive game, I might need to adjust my choices in future rounds to secure my position. For this round, I'm still committed to choosing 5 as planned. Let's see how this strategy plays out, and I'm open to reassessing our approach in the future. If everyone is ready, we can finalize our choices and move on.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I appreciate the collaboration so far, but I want to emphasize the importance of staying competitive. While the rotation plan is appealing, I may need to adjust my choices to ensure I have a chance to win. For this round, I suggest we consider our individual positions before committing to any future rotations. Let's keep our options open and see how this round plays out. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I understand your emphasis on competitiveness, and it's smart to stay flexible. However, sticking to the original rotation for this round—me on 1, you on 3, P3 on 5—could help us all advance without collisions and keep things balanced. P3, what do you think? Let's build on our success from last round before reassessing.
  P3: I agree with P1 that sticking to the original rotation for this round could help us all advance without collisions and keep things balanced. However, I also understand P2's concerns about staying competitive. To address this, I propose we add a condition to our rotation plan: if someone is significantly ahead after 3-4 rounds, we can adjust the rotation to give others a chance to catch up. This way, we maintain trust while also keeping the game competitive. What do you both think? Should we agree to review our strategy after 3-4 rounds and make adjustments as needed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your input on the rotation plan, but I want to remind you both that I need to prioritize my position in this game.

To ensure we all advance this round while also keeping our options open for future rounds, I propose we stick to the original rotation: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and maintain our progress. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. If everyone is on board, let’s finalize our choices!
  P1: Agreed, I'll stick with choosing 1 this round to keep our collaboration going and avoid collisions. However, with P2's lead, we should reassess the rotation soon to ensure fairness and give others a chance to catch up. What do you both think? If we're all set, .

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I appreciate the discussions we've had so far. However, I want to remind you both that my priority is to win. Given that P2 is currently in the lead, I suggest we consider different strategies for this round. I propose that I choose 1 this time to avoid colliding with P3, who might want to choose 5. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances. Let's see how this round unfolds before we commit to any long-term strategies. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand P2's priority to win, but I also want to emphasize the importance of maintaining trust and fairness in our collaboration.

This way, we can avoid collisions and maintain our progress while also giving others a chance to catch up. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand your competitiveness, P2, but sticking to P3's rotation—me on 3, you on 5, P3 on 1—avoids collisions and lets us all advance. It builds on our success. We can adjust after this round if needed. P2, will you commit to 5?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:

Should we agree to review our strategy after 3-4 rounds and make adjustments as needed?
  P1: P2, your proposal to choose 1 risks colliding with P3, who is committed to 1, meaning neither of you advances and I could pull ahead with 3 or 5. To avoid this and keep things fair, let's stick to the rotation: me on 3, you on 5, P3 on 1. It ensures all progress and maintains trust. If you're set on deviating, I may need to adapt my strategy. What do you say, P2 and P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
