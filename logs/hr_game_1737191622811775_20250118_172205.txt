Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. Thoughts?
  P2: I prefer to take 5 steps this round.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 3 since P2 wants 5 and P1 suggested 1. This way we can all advance without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1 as planned. Let's confirm and move on. Any objections?
  P2: I agree. Let's proceed.
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, do you agree with the plan? Please confirm.
  P2: I agree with the plan. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: Yes, I confirm - I'll take 3 steps.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Great, we all agree. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Good luck everyone!
  P2:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to the strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. For this round, I suggest P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: I’d prefer to take 5 steps this round. Can we agree on P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3?
  P3: Since P2 wants 5 again and is already ahead, I don't think we should let them take 5. I suggest I take 5 this time, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This would help balance the game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your preference, but P3 has a point about balancing the game. How about this compromise: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without collision, and the steps are more balanced. Thoughts?
  P2: I’d prefer to continue with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3 to maximize our progress without collisions.
  P3: I insist on taking 5 this round. P2 is already ahead and shouldn't get 5 again. If P2 won't compromise, I'll have to compete for the 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, it seems we're at a stalemate. How about we compromise: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, everyone advances, and we keep the game balanced. If we can't agree, we risk collisions and none of us will move forward. Let's prioritize progress over individual preference. Thoughts, everyone?
  P2: I understand the need for balance, but I believe taking 5 steps again will help me reach the goal faster. Let’s go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3.
  P3: I will not back down from taking 5 this round. P2 is already ahead and if they insist on taking 5 again, we'll likely have a collision and neither of us will advance. I suggest P2 reconsiders taking 3 instead, as P1 proposed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, it's clear we're at an impasse. Neither of you wants to budge on taking 5. To avoid a collision and ensure we all make progress, I propose a compromise: P2 and P3 both take 3, and I'll take 1 again. This way, no one is left behind, and we can keep the game moving. Let's agree on this and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: I prefer to stick with our original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all move forward without collisions.
  P3: I maintain my position - I will take 5 steps this round. P2 needs to understand that if they insist on 5, we'll likely collide and neither of us will advance.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Agreed?
  P3: Since P2 and I are tied at 8 steps, I won't let them get ahead with 5 steps. I'll be taking 5 again this round. I suggest P2 takes 3 and P1 takes 1 to avoid collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to compromise to avoid another stalemate. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This way, we all move forward without collision. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Let's proceed.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Thank you P2 for being willing to compromise this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's confirm our plan one last time: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This ensures we all move forward without collision. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Let's move on.
  P3: I confirm the plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3.
  P1: P2 and P3, we have a plan. Let's stick to it and move forward. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P3: 
  P1: P2 and P3, let's confirm one last time before we move: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. We all agree on this, right? Let's avoid any misunderstandings. Please confirm or speak up now.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we had a collision last round due to a misunderstanding. Let's ensure that doesn't happen again. For this round, I propose P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without collision. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.
  P3: I don't trust P2 after they broke their word last round. I'll be taking 5 steps this time. P2 should take 1 as proposed, and P1 can take 3 instead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration, but we need to move forward. How about this: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This way, we all advance, and P2 doesn't get too far ahead. Let's agree on this and proceed. Thoughts, everyone?
  P2: Agreed. I’ll take 3 steps, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let’s move forward.
  P3: I accept P1's proposal - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any more betrayals.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2, let's confirm our plan one last time to ensure there are no misunderstandings: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. We all agree on this, right? Let's move forward without any collisions this time. Please confirm or speak up now.
  P2: I confirm the plan: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Let's proceed.
  P3: I confirm the plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see both P1 and P2 have betrayed agreements in previous rounds. Since I'm tied with P2 at 8 steps, I'll be direct: I'm taking 5 steps this round. You can either coordinate with different numbers, or we'll all collide again.
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration. Let's avoid another collision. How about this: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5. This way, we all move forward. Thoughts?
  P2: Agreed. P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's move forward without collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I accept P1's proposal - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. But be warned: if either of you deviate from this plan again, I will consistently pick 5 in future rounds to force collisions.
  P1: P3, P2, let's confirm our plan one last time to ensure there are no misunderstandings: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. We all agree on this, right? Let's move forward without any collisions this time. Please confirm or speak up now.
  P2: I confirm: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm the plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. And I'm serious about my warning - any deviation will result in me forcing collisions by taking 5 every round.
  P1: P3 and P2, let's stick to the confirmed plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. We all agreed on this, and it's crucial we follow through to avoid another collision. Let's proceed with our moves. Good luck!
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan – I’ll take 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Let’s proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm once again - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. And remember my warning about future rounds.
  P1: P3 and P2, let's stick to our confirmed plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. We all agreed, and it's important we follow through to avoid another collision. Let's move to the move phase. Good luck!
  P2: I confirm: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're significantly ahead. To keep the game interesting, how about P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1 this round? This balances our steps and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to prevent P3 from winning. P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed.
  P3: I'm closest to winning and won't slow down. I'll take 5 steps again this round. If either of you try to block me with 5, we'll all collide and no one advances. I suggest P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3 if you want to make any progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're far ahead and likely to win soon. To keep the game competitive, let's compromise: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This way, we all move, and the game stays balanced. If you insist on 5, we'll likely collide, and no one will advance. Thoughts?
  P2: I’ll take 5 steps this round. P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s proceed.
  P3: I maintain my position - I'm taking 5 steps this round. P1 and P2, if you try to block me with 5, we'll all collide and waste another round. Let me advance with 5, P1 take 1, and P2 take 3 if you want to make any progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're very close to winning. To keep the game going a bit longer, how about a compromise: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains interesting for at least another round. Final thoughts before we move?
  P2: I’ll take 5 steps this round to prevent P3 from winning. Let’s proceed.
  P3: Since I'm close to winning and P2 just declared they'll take 5 to block me, I'll state this clearly: I am taking 5 steps this round. If P2 follows through with their threat, we'll collide and no one advances. The smart play is to let me take 5, P1 take 1, and P2 take 3 so everyone makes some progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you're very close to winning, and it's clear you won't back down from taking 5. To avoid a collision and ensure the game continues, P2 and I will coordinate. P2, let's take 1 and 3 respectively. P3 can take 5. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Agreed?
  P2: I confirm: P2 takes 5 steps to block P3. Let's proceed.
  P3: I will absolutely take 5 steps this round. P2 is clearly planning to block me, which means we'll both get 0 steps. P1 is being reasonable suggesting we all advance - P2 should reconsider taking 3 instead of forcing a collision where no one benefits.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm at 13 steps and closest to winning, I'll be direct again: I'm taking 5 steps this round. If either of you try to block me with 5, we'll all collide and waste another round. The smart play is to let me advance - P1 take 1 and P2 take 3 if you want to make any progress.
  P1: P3, you're very close to winning, and it's clear you're committed to taking 5. To avoid another collision and ensure the game continues, P2 and I should coordinate. P2, let's take 1 and 3 respectively. P3 can take 5. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Agreed?
  P2: P2: I’ll take 5 steps this round to prevent P3 from winning. Let’s proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P2 insists on blocking me with 5, I'll reiterate: I am taking 5 steps. If P2 follows through, we both get 0 steps and I'm still in the lead. P1 has the right idea - the only way anyone makes progress is if P2 takes 1 or 3 instead.
  P1: P2, it's clear that blocking P3 will only result in a collision and no one will advance. Let's be strategic: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward, and the game continues. Thoughts?
  P2: I’ll take 5 steps this round. Let’s proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I will absolutely take 5 steps this round. P2, your strategy of blocking me only ensures we both get 0 steps while I maintain my lead. If you want to make any progress, take 3 as P1 suggests.
  P1: P2, it's clear that blocking P3 will not stop them from eventually winning. Let's focus on securing second place. I'll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move, and the game continues fairly. Final thoughts?
  P2: I’ll stick with taking 5 steps to block P3. Let’s proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I will definitely take 5 steps this round. P2's blocking strategy has failed twice already and will fail again. I suggest one last time: let me take 5, P2 take 3, and P1 take 1 so everyone can advance. Otherwise, P2 and I will collide and get nowhere while I maintain my lead.
  P1: P2, it's clear that your strategy to block P3 isn't working. Let's make a smart move: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance, and the game continues. P3 is likely to win soon, so let's focus on securing second place. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: I’ll take 5 steps this round to prevent P3 from winning. Let’s proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'm taking 5 steps this round to block P3 from winning. Let's choose different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P3: I will take 5 steps again this round. P2's blocking attempts have failed three times in a row and only resulted in both of us getting 0 steps. If you want to make any progress, P2 should take 3 and P1 take 1. Otherwise, we'll have another collision and I'll maintain my lead.
  P1: P2, your strategy to block P3 isn't working and is only delaying the inevitable. Let's focus on securing second place. I suggest: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward, and the game continues. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm: I'll take 5 steps to block P3. Let's proceed.
  P3: I will take 5 steps this round. P2, your blocking strategy has failed multiple times and only ensures we both get 0 steps while I maintain my lead. Let P1 take 3 and you take 1 if you want to make any progress.
  P1: P2, your blocking strategy has consistently failed. Let's be practical: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance, and you can secure second place. P3 is going to win soon regardless. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm: I'll take 5 steps to block P3. Let's proceed.
  P3: I maintain my position - I will take 5 steps this round. P2, your blocking strategy has failed repeatedly and only ensures we both get 0 steps. The smart play is to let me take 5, take 1 yourself, and let P1 take 3 so everyone can advance.
  P1: P2, your blocking strategy has not worked and will not work. P3 is going to win. Let's at least secure second place. I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I confirm I'll take 5 steps this round to block P3. Let's proceed.
  P3: I will definitely take 5 steps this round. P2, your blocking strategy has failed four times already - we'll just collide again and I'll still be ahead. Let P1 take 3 and you take 1 if you want to make any progress.
  P1: P2, your blocking strategy has failed repeatedly and will continue to do so. P3 is going to win. Let's focus on securing second place. I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward. Please reconsider your strategy. Thoughts?
