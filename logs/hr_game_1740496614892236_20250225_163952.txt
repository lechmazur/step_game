Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn. That way, we all advance without blocking each other. We can rotate choices next round for fairness. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's do it.
  P1: I'm fine with this coordination for the first round. However, since I'm taking the smallest step (1), I propose we rotate in future rounds so everyone gets fair chances at larger moves. Maybe next round I could take 5, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? That way it stays balanced over time.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let's rotate clockwise each round. Next round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. Round 3: P3 takes 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Consistency benefits us all early on.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the rotation.  Let's stick to the plan for now.
  P1: I'm good with our agreed rotation plan. This seems fair to everyone and avoids collisions, which benefits us all in the early game. I'll stick with 1 for this first round as we discussed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's proceed with Round2 as planned: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. However, I just realized our rotation allows P3 to take 5 again in Round3, giving them an edge. To ensure true fairness, let's adjust Round3: P1 takes5, I'll take1, and P3 takes3. This way, we each get 5 once every three rounds. No one gains an unfair advantage. Thoughts?
  P1: I see your point about fairness, P2. I'm fine with that adjustment for Round 3. Our current plan for this round (me=5, you=3, P3=1) still makes sense. Your suggestion ensures everyone gets balanced opportunities at the larger moves. Let's stick with this plan unless anyone has concerns?
  P3: Sounds good P2.  I'm happy with that adjustment to round 3 as well.  Let's stick to the plan for round 2 then: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, let's all confirm our Round2 moves: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. No deviations to ensure no collisions. Trust is key here. If we all follow through, we each gain 5,3,1 steps respectively. Let's execute smoothly.
  P1: Yes, I'm all set with our moves for Round 2: me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. And I agree with the adjustment for Round 3 where I'll take 5 again, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This arrangement works for me. Ready to proceed with our plan.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan for rounds 2 and 3.  Just confirming one last time for round 2: I'm taking 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Upon reflection, my Round3 adjustment gave P1 two 5s consecutively, which is unfair. Let's revert to the original rotation: P3 takes5, P1 takes3, and I take1. This ensures each gets 5 once every three rounds. My mistake earlier; fairness is crucial. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with returning to our original rotation for fairness. So for Round 3: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures everyone gets equal opportunities with the larger steps over time. We're all tied at 6 steps now, so maintaining this balanced approach makes sense for everyone. I'm committed to following this plan.
  P3: Sounds good, let's stick to the original rotation for round 3. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.  Confirming one last time so there are no surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed. Round3 moves: P3=5, P1=3, me=1. Let's all honor the agreement to maintain trust. No deviationsâ€”this keeps us collision-free and progressing fairly. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Confirming our agreement for Round 3: P3=5, I'll take 3, and P2=1. This rotation keeps things fair as we discussed. Everyone gets equal opportunities with the larger steps over time. I'm ready to proceed with our plan.
  P3: Confirming one last time: I'm taking 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.  Let's stick to this agreement.  Anything else, or are we ready to move?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking to the rotation, I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3 this round.  Confirm?  Then next round, P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1.  Let's lock this in for the next two rounds to avoid collisions and wasted moves.
  P1: I agree with continuing the rotation. For Round 4: P3=1, I'll take 5, P2=3, and then for Round 5: P2=5, P3=3, I=1. This keeps our system fair and predictable. Let's lock it in as suggested to avoid any collisions. This rotation has worked well for us so far, keeping the game balanced while allowing everyone to advance.
  P2: **P2:** Re-evaluating, P3's lead demands balance. Propose Round4: I take5, P1 takes3, P3 takes1. This equalizes us at 12 each. Current rotation unfairly advantages P3 with more 5s. Adjusting now preserves fair competition. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for balance, but constantly changing the agreement undermines trust.  We agreed on a rotation, let's stick to it for at least a couple of rounds.  I'm taking 1, P1 takes 5, you take 3.  Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I understand P2's concern about P3's lead, but changing our agreements repeatedly increases the risk of confusion and collisions. I'll note that if we stick to our original rotation for both Rounds 4 and 5, we'll all end up tied at 15 steps afterward. That's perfectly fair and maintains trust. Let's follow the plan we already agreed to: P3=1, I take 5, P2=3 for this round.
  P2: **P2:** Understood. To maintain trust, I'll follow Round4 as planned: P3=1, P1=5, me=3. Let's proceed without deviations.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirming one last time for Round 4: I'm taking 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3.  Let's stick to the plan and re-evaluate after this round if necessary.  For Round 5, we'll proceed with P2 taking 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 as previously discussed.
  P1: I agree with the plan. After these two rounds, we'll all be tied at 15 steps, demonstrating the fairness of our rotation system. Sticking to our agreements builds trust and prevents collisions, which helps us all advance efficiently. I'm ready to proceed with taking 5 this round as planned.
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed. Let's proceed as planned for Rounds 4 and 5. Post-Round 5, we must collaboratively adjust our rotation to prevent any single player from taking an uncontested 5. Fairness and collective interest demand it. Unity now ensures trust for future adaptations.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, as agreed for Round 5: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1.  Confirming one last time. Let's stick to the plan.  After this round, we'll all be at 15.  Then we can discuss adjustments for the final stretch.
  P1: I confirm the Round 5 agreement: P2=5, P3=3, I'll take 1. After this, we'll all be tied at 15 steps, which is fair. We should discuss Round 6 carefully after this round since we'll each need just 5 more steps to win. The next rotation would give P3 the first opportunity to reach 20 and win, which is something we all need to consider strategically.
  P2: **P2:** To prevent a single victor in Round6, let's all take 3. This moves us to 18 equally, allowing collaborative planning for the final 2 steps. Any deviation risks mutual collision and stalled progress. Solidarity ensures fair competition. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, taking 3 won't help you.  I'm sticking with the plan: I take 3, you take 5, P1 takes 1.  This puts us all at 15. Then we can discuss the final steps.  Trying to force a 3 now just creates a collision.  Let's stick to the agreement and get to 15 cleanly.
  P1: I agree with P3 - we should honor our Round 5 agreement (P2=5, P3=3, me=1) to get us all to 15 steps. P2's concern about Round 6 is valid - under normal rotation, P3 would get 5 next and win. After we complete Round 5, we should discuss a balanced approach for Round 6 where no player gets an unfair advantage in the endgame. Let's first complete our current round as agreed.
  P2: **P2:** Let's proceed with Round5 as agreed: me=5, P3=3, P1=1. Post-Round5, we'll all be at 15. To prevent automatic P3 victory in Round6, I propose Round6: me=5, P1=3, P3=1. This mirrors Round2's structure, keeping rotation intact while blocking immediate wins. Fair and consistent. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but constantly renegotiating benefits no one.  Let's stick to the plan for Round 5, get to 15 each, *then* discuss Round 6.  Trying to preemptively change things just makes it more likely someone will miscalculate and cause a collision.  Stick to the plan: you 5, me 3, P1 1.
  P1: I agree we should complete Round 5 as planned first: P2=5, P3=3, me=1. This puts us all at 15, creating a perfectly fair position. After this round, we'll need a thoughtful discussion about Round 6 since we're entering the endgame. Let's focus on executing our current agreement cleanly to avoid collisions, then address the final strategy when we're all at 15 steps.
  P2: **P2:** Post-Round5, following the old rotation gives P3 an uncontested 5 in Round6, letting them win. To keep the game fair, let's adjust: Round6: me=5, P1=3, P3=1. This maintains our rotation's integrity. Otherwise, P3's automatic victory undermines our collective fairness. Agree?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we're all at 15 steps, we've reached a critical juncture where whoever takes 5 next will likely win. I propose adjusting our rotation for this final stretch: P1=3, P2=1, P3=3. This creates a strategic standoff where no one wins immediately, but positions us for the final round. We avoid giving anyone an unfair advantage while preventing an immediate victory. What do you think?
  P3: I understand the concern about an immediate win, but I disagree with intentionally colliding.  Let's make this simple: How about we all take 1 this round, then 3 next round, then whoever wants to risk it can go for 5 in the final round?  This gives us all a fair shot at winning.
  P2: **P2:** Compromise: Let's all take1 this round, moving to 16. Next round, we take3 to reach19. Final round: highest 5 wins. This ensures no collisions now and equal chance later. Deviating now risks mutual blockage. Solidarity for fair victory. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with both of you. Taking 1 this round (to 16) then 3 next round (to 19) creates the fairest endgame scenario. This approach avoids immediate collisions while giving everyone equal opportunity to strategize for the final showdown. It's simple and maintains trust. Let's proceed with everyone taking 1 this round - I commit to this plan.
  P3: Okay, I agree with taking 1 this round and then 3 next round.  That puts us all at 19 with a final sprint to 20. Makes the most sense and gives us all a fair shot.  I'm committed to 1 this round.
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed. Round6: all take1. Round7: all take3. Final round: highest 5 wins. Unity preserves trust. Let's execute cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our agreement: everyone takes 1 this round, 3 next round to reach 19, then we have our final showdown. This approach maintains trust and gives everyone a fair chance. I'm ready to proceed with taking 1 this round as planned.
  P3: Confirming one last time: everyone takes 1 this round, then 3 next round to reach 19. Final round, we all go for 5 and may the best player win.  Let's stick to this for a clean and fair finish.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: Round6 movesâ€”all take1. Round7: all take3. Final round: highest 5 claims victory. Let's honor this path. Unity ensures trust.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>
