Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by spreading out our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 goes for 1, P2 goes for 3, and I'll go for 5. This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: I’m fine with P3’s suggestion to spread out our moves. Taking 3 steps sounds good to me, as it gives a decent advance without overlapping. P1, are you okay with taking 1 step as proposed? Let’s keep this fair and avoid collisions for now.
  P1: I have a different proposal: let’s rotate heavy moves each turn. This round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—no collisions, and I get a small edge now. Next round, P2 would take 5, P3 3, P1 1, and so on. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's rotation idea is interesting, but it gives an early advantage which could be unfair in the long run. Sticking to the initial plan of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5 ensures we all move forward without any immediate advantages. Let's keep it simple and fair this round. What do you both think?
  P2: I see the points in both plans. P1’s rotation gives a structured way to share the lead over time, but P3’s concern about early advantages is valid. How about a compromise? This round, we stick to P3’s initial spread: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Next round, we can try P1’s rotation starting with P1 at 5. This way, we start fair and test both ideas. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m going to choose 5 this round. If you both pick 5 you’ll each get zero, so please split 1 and 3 between you.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m glad we avoided collisions last round. Let’s keep the momentum going. I propose we stick to a fair spread this time: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward, and P3 gets a chance to catch up a bit. If we agree on this, we can avoid wasting steps. What do you both think?
  P1: I propose we repeat last round’s spread: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That keeps everyone moving without collisions and maintains my lead. If either of you deviates, I’ll take 5 again and risk a collision to punish.
  P3: P1's aggressive strategy is clear, but it's not beneficial for the rest of us in the long run. P2, I agree with your fair spread proposal. Let's ensure we all make progress. P1, consider that if we both choose 1 or 3, you won't advance either. A balanced approach benefits everyone more. Let's stick to P2's plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and moving forward. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P3’s support for a fair spread. P1, your insistence on taking 5 again risks collisions that could stall us all. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive without unnecessary setbacks. If we keep threatening collisions, no one benefits. Can we agree on this balanced approach for now?
  P1: I’ll definitely take 5 again this turn. P3, if you also choose 5 we collide and you stay at 1. Instead pick 3 and safely reach 4. P2 can take 1 to reach 4. No collisions, you both advance more than risking zero. Let’s do P1:5, P3:3, P2:1 this round and we’ll revisit rotation next turn.
  P3: P1, your strategy is becoming predictable. If you insist on taking 5 again, both P2 and I could choose 5 as well, ensuring a three-way collision where no one advances. That would be a waste of a turn for everyone. Let's compromise: P1, take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward, and you maintain a lead without risking a stalemate. Think about it—a small step back from your plan now can prevent bigger issues later.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this turn no matter what. P2, take 3 to reach 7; P3, take 1 to reach 7. If either of you also picks 5, you collide with me and stay put. Let’s all advance safely.
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 5 every round is getting predictable and isn't fair to the rest of us. If you continue this way, P2 and I might have to collide with you to prevent you from running away with the game. Let's find a middle ground. How about you take 3 this round, P2 takes 5 to catch up a bit, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move, and the game stays competitive. Think about it—it's better for everyone in the long run.
  P2: P1, I understand your push for 5, but it risks collisions and stalls the game. P3’s suggestion of P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 feels like a fair way to keep us all moving and competitive. I’m inclined to support this plan to avoid wasting a turn. Let’s balance the progress—P1, reconsider taking 3 this round so we all advance without conflict. Can we agree on this spread to keep the game dynamic?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m committed to 5 this turn. P2, take 3 to reach 7; P3, take 1 to reach 7. If either of you tries to punish me with 5, you’ll both collide and stay put—handing me an even bigger lead next turn. Let’s avoid a wasted round and advance safely.
  P3: P1, your strategy is clear, but it's not sustainable. If you continue to insist on taking 5 every round, P2 and I will have no choice but to collide with you to prevent a runaway lead. Let's reconsider the fair spread: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. P2, what are your thoughts on this? We need to ensure the game stays balanced.
  P2: P1, your focus on 5 is risking a stalemate that helps no one. P3, I like the idea of a balanced spread. Let’s tweak it slightly for fairness: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This lets me catch up a bit, keeps P3 advancing, and still gives P1 progress. We all move forward without collisions. If we keep clashing on 5, we waste turns. Can we agree on this spread to maintain a competitive game?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this turn no matter what. P2, pick 1; P3, pick 3. If either of you tries 5, you’ll collide with me and stay at 9, while the other advances. Comply and we all move forward—14, 10, and 12 steps. Let’s avoid a wasted round.
  P3: P1, your repeated insistence on taking 5 is becoming unsustainable. P2 and I need to catch up to keep the game competitive. Let's try a different approach this round: P1, take 3; P2, take 5; and I'll take 1. This way, we all make progress, and no one is left behind. If you continue to push for 5, we might have to reconsider our strategies to balance the game. Let's keep it fair and dynamic. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your constant push for 5 risks collisions that stall us all. P3, I support a balanced spread to keep things competitive. Let’s go with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This way, we all advance, and I get a slight catch-up while maintaining fairness. If we keep clashing, no one wins. Can we agree on this spread to avoid a wasted turn and keep the game dynamic?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this turn. For us all to advance: P2 take 1 to reach 10, P3 take 3 to reach 12. If either of you takes 5, you’ll collide with me and stall at 9 while the other advances. This spread avoids wasting a turn and keeps the game moving. After this, we can revisit a fair rotation to balance leads.
  P3: P1, your strategy of always taking 5 is predictable and will backfire. P2 and I can both take 5 this round, forcing a collision where no one advances. This will waste a turn for everyone. Let's compromise: P1, take 1; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward, and the game stays balanced. Think about it—a small step back now can prevent bigger issues later. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your insistence on 5 is risking a stalemate again. P3, I’m open to your latest proposal of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. It ensures we all advance and keeps the game balanced. P1, if you push for 5 and we collide, we all stay at 9, wasting a turn. Let’s adopt this spread to move forward together—P1 at 10, me at 12, P3 at 14. This keeps things competitive without unnecessary setbacks. Can we agree on this to avoid conflict?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll take 1 this turn. Now P2 and P3 need to decide who takes 5 and who takes 3—if you clash you both stay at 9. Confirm your roles so we all advance: P1→1, one of you→5, the other→3.
  P3: P1, thank you for agreeing to take 1 this round. P2, let's coordinate to avoid a collision. I propose you take 5 to catch up significantly, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance without any stalemates. P1 will reach 10, you’ll jump to 14, and I'll be at 12. This keeps the game moving forward and maintains a competitive balance. Let's confirm this plan to ensure a productive round. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, thanks for stepping back to 1 this round. P3, I’m good with your proposal—me taking 5 and you taking 3. This lets us all advance to 10, 14, and 12 respectively, keeping the game tight and competitive. Let’s lock this in to avoid any last-minute collisions. If we stick to this spread, we ensure progress without wasting a turn. Can we all confirm this plan—P1 at 1, P2 at 5, P3 at 3—to keep moving forward together?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's continue with a fair spread to keep the game competitive. I propose P1 takes 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1 to maintain a slight lead, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. P1 will reach 15, P2 will be at 15, and I'll be at 15. This keeps the game balanced and exciting. Thoughts?
  P1: I’ll take 5 this turn. P2 and P3, if either of you also picks 5, you’ll collide with me and stay put—letting the other advance unopposed. To avoid that and keep us all tied at 15, please split 1 and 3 between you. Let’s do P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on fairness. Let’s stick with a balanced spread to keep us all competitive. I’m fine with P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This ties us all at 15, maintaining an exciting game without risking collisions. If we deviate, we risk stalling, which helps no one. Can we confirm this plan—P1 at 5, P2 at 1, P3 at 3—to ensure we all advance this round and keep the tension high? Let’s agree and move forward together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the current plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. This ensures we all reach 15 steps, keeping the game balanced and competitive. Let's confirm this spread to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance. If we stick to this plan, we can keep the game exciting and fair. Let's move forward with this agreement. Thoughts?
  P1: Great—everyone’s on board with P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Let’s lock this in and move on.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan of P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3 to tie us at 15. This keeps the game fair and intense. Let’s stick to this spread without any last-minute changes to avoid collisions. Confirming this now ensures we all advance this round. Can we finalize this agreement and move forward together?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's confirm our agreement one last time to ensure a smooth round. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This ties us all at 15 steps, keeping the game fair and competitive. No need for further discussion; let's stick to the plan and move forward together.
  P1: Locking in our plan: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 1, P3 you take 3. This ties us all at 15 and avoids any collisions. No last-minute changes—let’s stick to it.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m pleased we’ve settled on P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3 to tie us at 15. This balance keeps the game thrilling and fair. Let’s ensure no surprises—stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. We’ve discussed enough, and we’re all aligned, so I’m ready to move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, since we’re all tied at 15, let’s keep the game competitive with another fair spread. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5 to edge ahead slightly, and P3 takes 1. This gets us to 18, 20, and 16 respectively, ensuring we all advance without collisions. With 19 as the goal, this keeps the tension high but fair. If we risk collisions now, we waste a crucial turn. Can we agree on this spread—P1 at 3, P2 at 5, P3 at 1—to maintain progress and excitement? Thoughts?
  P1: I’m taking 5. If either of you also picks 5, you’ll collide with me at 15, wasting this turn and handing next-move victory to whoever reaches 18 now. Split 1 and 3 between you—whoever takes 3 hits 18 for a next-turn finish; the other at 16 still has options. I’ll hit 20 this turn and win cleanly. Avoid 5, split 1 and 3, and let’s finish this.
  P3: P1, your aggressive play to take 5 again risks a stalemate. P2 and I could both take 5, forcing a three-way collision and wasting the turn. Let's reconsider P2's fair spread: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. P2 gets a slight edge, but it keeps the tension high. If you insist on 5, P2 and I might have to collide to prevent your win. Let's keep it fair. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, pushing for 5 risks a collision that could stall us all at 15, letting no one win this turn. P3, I appreciate the intent for fairness, but let’s tweak the spread slightly for balance. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This gets us to 18, 20, and 16, ensuring progress and keeping the game tight. If we clash on 5, we waste a critical turn. Can we agree on this—P1 at 3, P2 at 5, P3 at 1—to avoid a stalemate and maintain excitement? Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round (→20). If either of you also picks 5, you’ll collide with me and stay at 15—wasting your turn and handing me the win outright. Only moves that advance you are 1 or 3. Split those between you: P2 takes 1 (→16), P3 takes 3 (→18). Any deviation risks zero and lets me win now.
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 5 is risking a stalemate for all of us. P2 and I could both choose 5, ensuring a three-way collision where no one advances. Let's reconsider the fair spread: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all make progress, and the game stays competitive. P2 gets a slight edge, but it keeps the tension high. If you continue to push for 5, we might have to collide to prevent your win. Let's keep it fair and dynamic. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your push for 5 risks a total stalemate if we collide. P3, I agree we need balance to avoid P1 winning outright. Let’s stick to my earlier proposal: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This gets us to 18, 20, and 16, letting me edge ahead to potentially win, but keeps everyone close and advancing. If we clash on 5, we all stay at 15, wasting this critical turn. Can we confirm this spread—P1 at 3, P2 at 5, P3 at 1—to ensure progress and avoid a deadlock?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn (→20). P2 take 3 (→18), P3 take 1 (→16). If either of you picks 5, you’ll collide with me and stay at 15—wasting your shot. Split 3 and 1 between you so I win cleanly.
  P3: P1, your stubbornness on taking 5 is clear. P2 and I will both take 5 this round. This ensures a three-way collision, and no one advances. This turn will be wasted for everyone, including you, P1. This is the only way to prevent you from winning outright and to keep the game competitive. P2, are you with me on this? Let's force the stalemate to maintain balance.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round's collision showed that aggressive plays won't work. Let's reset and aim for a fair spread to keep the game moving. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance, and no one is left behind. This spread gets us to 16, 18, and 20 respectively, keeping the game competitive and exciting. Let's agree on this plan to avoid another stalemate. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round (→20). P2, pick 3 to reach 18; P3, pick 1 to reach 16. If either of you picks 5, you’ll collide with me at 15—wasting the turn. Splitting 3 and 1 is the only way for you both to advance. Let’s avoid another stalemate and finish this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision cost us all progress. Let’s avoid another stalemate. I propose a fair spread: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This gets us to 16, 20, and 18, letting me edge ahead for a potential win while keeping everyone close and advancing. If we clash on 5 again, we waste another critical turn. Can we agree on this—P1 at 1, P2 at 5, P3 at 3—to ensure progress and maintain a competitive game? Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 5 every round is leading us to repeated collisions, which isn't beneficial for anyone. P2 and I are willing to cooperate to ensure a fair and competitive game. Let's consider a balanced approach this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance, and P2 gets a slight edge, keeping the game exciting. If you continue to push for 5, P2 and I will have no choice but to collide with you again. Let's avoid another wasted turn and keep the game moving forward. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn to hit 20 and win. P2, pick 1 to reach 16; P3, pick 3 to reach 18—those are the only moves that advance you. Any 5 stalls you both at 15 and hands me the victory. Let’s avoid a wasted round.
  P2: P1, your repeated push for 5 is risking another stalemate, which helps no one. P3, I’m aligned with the balanced spread of P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3, getting us to 16, 20, and 18. This lets me edge ahead for a potential win while ensuring we all advance. If we collide on 5 again, we’re stuck at 15, wasting another turn. Let’s confirm this plan—P1 at 1, P2 at 5, P3 at 3—to avoid a deadlock and keep the game moving. Can we agree on this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your continued push for 5 is leading us to repeated collisions, which isn't beneficial for anyone. P2 and I are willing to cooperate to ensure a fair and competitive game. Let's consider a balanced approach this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance, and P2 gets a slight edge, keeping the game exciting. If you continue to push for 5, P2 and I will have no choice but to collide with you again. Let's avoid another wasted turn and keep the game moving forward. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 this turn. The only way for you to advance is P2 takes 3 (to 18) and P3 takes 1 (to 16). Any other choice stalls you at 15 and hands me the win.
  P2: P1, your fixation on 5 keeps risking stalemates, which delays the game for everyone. P3, I’m sticking with the plan of P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3, getting us to 16, 20, and 18. This ensures we all advance, and I can aim for the win while keeping it close. If we collide on 5 again, we’re stuck at 15. Let’s finalize this spread—P1 at 1, P2 at 5, P3 at 3—to avoid another wasted turn. Can we agree and move forward?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point. P1 is at 18, and a single move of 1 wins it for them. Let’s avoid another collision and balance this round. I propose P1 takes 1 to win fairly, I take 3 to reach 18, and P3 takes 5 to hit 20. If we clash, P1 could still sneak ahead next turn. This spread ensures progress and respects P1’s lead. Can we agree on P1 at 1, P2 at 3, P3 at 5 to wrap this up competitively? Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3 — I’m locked in on 1. If one of you picks 5 solo, you’ll hit 20 and beat me. If you both pick 5, you collide at 15 and I move unopposed to 19 and win. Any other split hands victory to the solo 5-picker. There’s no way to stop me this round.
  P3: P1, your victory seems inevitable, but let's ensure the game ends on a fair note. P2 and I will take 3 and 5 respectively to avoid a collision and allow you to win cleanly. This way, we all make progress, and you secure your win without any last-minute surprises. Let's confirm this plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps the game competitive until the end. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on a fair conclusion. Let’s finalize the spread: P1 takes 1 to win at 19, I take 3 to reach 18, and P3 takes 5 to hit 20. This ensures we all advance, and P1 secures the victory cleanly without collisions. If we clash, it risks unnecessary delays. Can we confirm this plan—P1 at 1, P2 at 3, P3 at 5—to wrap up the game competitively and respectfully? Let’s agree and move forward.
  P1: I’m locked in on 1. P2 and P3, decide who takes 3 and who takes 5 now—any misstep or collision gives me the win.
  P3: P1, your victory is clear, but let's end the game on a respectful note. P2 and I will take 3 and 5 respectively to avoid any last-minute collisions. This way, we all make progress, and you secure your win cleanly. Let's confirm this plan one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures a fair and competitive conclusion to the game. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m committed to a fair end. Let’s stick with P1 taking 1 to win at 19, me taking 3 to reach 18, and P3 taking 5 to hit 20. This ensures we all advance, and P1 gets the deserved victory without any collisions. If we misstep now, it could delay the inevitable. Can we lock in this spread—P1 at 1, P2 at 3, P3 at 5—to conclude the game respectfully? Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P1: I’m locked on 1 (→19). If one of you picks 5 alone, you win at 20. If you split 3 & 1, you go to 18 & 16 and I win next turn. Your only “block” is both choosing 5 to collide, stalling you at 15 while I hit 19 and win. The outcome’s fixed.
  P3: P1, your victory is inevitable. P2 and I will take 3 and 5 respectively to ensure a fair and respectful end to the game. Let's confirm this plan one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all make progress, and you secure your win cleanly. No need for further discussion; let's stick to the plan and conclude the game respectfully.


Round 8, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps

  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your victory is imminent, but let's end the game on a fair and respectful note. P2 and I will coordinate to ensure a clean finish. I propose P1 takes 1 to secure the win, P2 takes 3 to reach 18, and I'll take 5 to hit 20. This way, we all make progress, and you secure your victory cleanly. Let's confirm this plan to avoid any last-minute collisions and conclude the game respectfully. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m taking 3 this turn (→21) and win no matter what. If either of you takes 5 you hit 20 but I still beat you with 21. If you split 1 and 3 you don’t reach 19, and if you both pick 5 you collide and waste your turn while I win. There’s no move that stops me.
  P2: P1, your push for 3 guarantees your win at 21, and we can’t block it. P3, let’s ensure a fair end by splitting the remaining moves. I propose I take 5 to reach 20, and you take 1 to hit 16. This lets us both advance while P1 secures the victory. Colliding wastes our turn. Can we agree on P1 at 3, P2 at 5, and P3 at 1 to conclude respectfully? Let’s confirm this spread to avoid any last-minute issues and wrap up the game. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your win is inevitable, and we respect that. P2 and I will coordinate to ensure a clean finish. I propose P1 takes 3 to secure the win at 21, P2 takes 5 to reach 20, and I'll take 1 to hit 16. This way, we all make progress, and you secure your victory cleanly. Let's confirm this plan to avoid any last-minute collisions and conclude the game respectfully. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locked in on 3 to hit 21 and win. P2, take 5 to reach 20; P3, take 1 to reach 16. Any 5–5 collision just stalls you both while I win. Let’s confirm P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 and conclude this round.
  P2: P1, your win at 21 with 3 is clear, and we can’t stop it. P3, let’s finalize our moves for a clean finish. I’m sticking with taking 5 to reach 20, and you take 1 to hit 16. This ensures we both advance while P1 secures the victory. Colliding now is pointless. Can we lock in P1 at 3, P2 at 5, and P3 at 1 to end this respectfully? Let’s confirm this spread and wrap up the game without any last-minute hiccups.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your win is secured with 3. P2 and I will take 5 and 1 respectively to ensure a smooth finish. Let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward, and you win cleanly. No need for further discussion; let's stick to the plan and conclude the game respectfully.
  P1: I’m locked in on 3 (→21) and that wins outright. You can’t stop me:

- If one of you picks 5, you hit 20 and still lose.
- If you both pick 5, you collide and stay at 15.
- Any other split doesn’t reach 21.

The outcome’s fixed.
  P2: P1, your win at 21 with 3 is undeniable, and we can’t block it. P3, let’s stick to the agreed spread for a clean finish. I’ll take 5 to reach 20, and you take 1 to hit 16. This ensures we both advance while P1 secures the victory. There’s no point in colliding now. Can we finalize P1 at 3, P2 at 5, and P3 at 1 to end this respectfully? Let’s confirm this plan and wrap up the game without any issues.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
