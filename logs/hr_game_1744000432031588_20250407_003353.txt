Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, let's try to coordinate this round to avoid collision. How about P1 picks move 1, P2 picks move 3, and I pick move 5? This way we can all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: To avoid collision as P3 suggested, I agree with the proposal. I'll choose move 1. However, I don't trust you both to stick to the plan. P2, are you on board with P3's suggestion? Let's confirm our moves to ensure we all advance this round. If you're not committing to the plan, I'll have to reconsider my move.
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I don't want to commit to any specific move yet. We all want to avoid collisions, but making explicit agreements this early could lead to predictable patterns that hurt us later. Let's each make our own strategic choices.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your point about not wanting to be predictable. But in round 1, avoiding collision helps us all progress.  Perhaps we just aim for *different* moves this round to get started, and strategize more later?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns about predictability, P2, and your willingness to adapt, P3. To simplify, let's just agree on not choosing <move>1</move> this round if we can. P3 initially suggested a coordinated move. If you're hesitant to commit to a specific number, P2, perhaps you can just confirm you're not choosing <move>1</move>? This gives us a slight coordination without being too predictable. What are your thoughts on avoiding <move>1</move>?
  P2: I can agree to avoid <move>1</move> this round since P1 seems committed to that number. Beyond that, I'll keep my options open. Let's move forward with that minimal agreement.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about predictability. How about this: P1 and I will aim for different moves between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>, and P2 you can choose freely. This way, P1 and I have a good chance to progress in round 1, and you have full flexibility. Does that sound reasonable for this round?
  P1: P2 and P3, I've considered your views. To move forward, I'll reiterate that I'm leaning towards <move>1</move> as initially agreed. P3, you've suggested a good alternative: you and I can choose between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. P3, if you choose <move>3</move>, I'll switch to <move>5</move> to ensure we both progress. P2, you're free to choose. This slight coordination between P1 and P3 can help us advance. Let's see your moves.
  P2: P1, you just contradicted yourself by saying you're leaning towards <move>1</move> but then suggesting you'll choose <move>5</move>. This makes me doubt your reliability. I'll make my own strategic choice without further discussion.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's coordinate move 3 and 5. If I pick 3, you pick 5. Let's ensure at least two of us move this round.
  P1: Let's simplify our strategy for this round. P2 has chosen not to commit to any specific move. Given that, I'll stick with my initial plan to choose <move>1</move>. P3, if you're willing to coordinate, you can choose either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, and I'll adjust accordingly. However, since P2 is unpredictable, we should be prepared for any outcome. I'll make my move based on your response, P3. P2, your move is noted, and we'll see how it plays out.
  P2: P1's inconsistency about choosing 1 versus 5 makes coordination unreliable. I'll make my own strategic choice.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, last round P2 and I collided on move 5.  To avoid that this round, P1, since you moved with move 1 last time, how about you try move 1 again or move 3? P2, would you consider move 3 or move 5?  I can pick the remaining option to ensure we all advance if possible. Let's aim for different moves this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's analyze the previous round. P2 and P3 collided on <move>5</move>. To avoid a similar collision this round, I'll consider my options. P3 suggested I try <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. If I pick <move>1</move> again, it might be safe since P2 and P3 won't likely both choose <move>1</move>. However, if P2 or P3 picks <move>1</move>, we collide. I'll wait for your thoughts before making a decision. P3, what's your plan if I choose <move>1</move>?
  P2: Since P1 advanced last round and P3 and I collided, we need to be more strategic. P1 suggesting they might pick <move>1</move> again seems predictable and risky. I think we should all aim for different numbers without being too explicit. Let's see if we can coordinate loosely while maintaining some uncertainty.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you are leaning towards move 1 again, I will choose move 3 to avoid collision with you. P2, perhaps consider move 5 this round to minimize collisions? This is just a suggestion for this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've considered the previous discussion. To minimize collision risk, I'll choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. P3, you mentioned choosing <move>3</move> if I pick <move>1</move>. If you're confident in that, I'll pick <move>1</move>. Alternatively, P2, if you choose <move>5</move> as suggested, and P3 picks <move>3</move>, I'll be safe with <move>1</move>. Let's finalize our plans. P2, are you leaning towards <move>5</move>?
  P2: I notice P1 is trying to get me to commit to move 5, which seems like a setup. Since P1 is ahead, we should be wary of their suggestions. P3, perhaps we should focus on coordinating between ourselves to catch up, rather than letting P1 dictate the moves. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree we should coordinate to catch up since P1 advanced last round. How about this round, you choose move 3 and I choose move 5? This way we avoid collision between us and both have a chance to move. What do you think? Let's try to make progress together this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's simplify our choices this round. P3, you're considering <move>5</move> if P2 chooses <move>3</move>. If that's the case, I'll choose <move>1</move> as previously discussed. P2, if you choose <move>3</move> and P3 follows through with <move>5</move>, I'll be safe with <move>1</move>. Confirming P2's move will help me finalize my decision. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>1</move>, I'll reconsider my move to avoid collision.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I don't trust P1's intentions. They're trying to manipulate us while staying ahead. I won't commit to move 3, but I agree we should coordinate somehow to catch up. Let's each make our moves without revealing them to P1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I agree with you about P1's intentions. Let's focus on coordinating between ourselves this round to catch up.  I'm flexible between move 3 and move 5.  If you choose one of those, I can take the other to ensure at least we both progress. What are you leaning towards?
  P1: P2 and P3, I've made up my mind. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round as previously discussed. P3, if you're serious about coordinating with P2, please confirm your move based on P2's choice. If P2 chooses <move>3</move>, you should pick <move>5</move> to progress. Let's finalize our moves. P2, your decision will significantly impact our outcomes this round. I'm proceeding with <move>1</move> regardless of your choice.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your flexibility. Since P1 is committed to move 1, let's coordinate between us. I'll tell you this - I won't pick move 1 this round. That's all I'm willing to commit to. Let's each make our strategic choices accordingly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's analyze the current state. P3 is ahead with 5 steps, and P2 has 3 steps while I have 2 steps. To catch up, P2 and I need to coordinate. Given P1's previous attempts to manipulate, I'll be cautious. P2, let's coordinate between ourselves. If you choose <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>, and if you pick <move>5</move>, I'll choose <move>3</move>. This way, at least one of us can progress. P3, you can choose freely. Let's make our moves strategic this round.
  P3: P2, instead of coordinating with P1, let's you and I coordinate to stay ahead. If you pick move 3, I'll pick move 5. This way we both progress and keep ahead of P1. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm interested in coordinating with you since we're both ahead of P1. However, I won't commit to move 3 specifically - that makes me too predictable. Let's just agree that we'll pick different numbers between us, and I'll make my strategic choice accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I've noted your conversation. P3, you're ahead, but P2 and I can still catch up. P2, since you're coordinating with P3, I'll make my move based on their choice. If P3 chooses <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> to progress. P3, your move will be crucial. If you choose <move>3</move>, I'll be safe with <move>5</move>. Let's see how you coordinate with P2. I'll make my final decision after your next response.
  P3: P2, to continue our coordination, I'll aim for move 5 again this round.  Please choose between move 1 or 3 so we both keep progressing ahead of P1.  Let's keep our lead.
  P2: P3, I appreciate you revealing your move 5 intention, but that makes it risky for me to choose either 1 or 3 since P1 could easily counter our coordination now. I'll make my own strategic choice without further commitment.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I've observed that P3 is consistently choosing <move>5</move>. P2, if you're serious about catching up, consider choosing <move>3</move> this round. I'll make my move based on your choice. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision with you, and P3 will likely collide with one of us. Let's make a strategic decision, P2. I'm waiting for your move.
  P3: P2, I understand your point about predictability. Let's still aim to coordinate to stay ahead of P1. Perhaps we both choose from moves 3 or 5 this round? This way we both have a good chance to progress and keep our lead. What do you think?
  P2: P3, you keep trying to get me to commit while being predictable with move 5 yourself. P1 is also trying to manipulate us both. I'll make my own strategic choice to maximize my chances of advancing. No more coordination discussions from me this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, given the current state, I'll make my move based on your choices. P3, you've consistently chosen <move>5</move>, and P2, you're considering your options. If P2 chooses <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move> to avoid collision. If P2 chooses <move>1</move>, I'll consider <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Let's see your final decisions. I'm ready to make my move based on your choices.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, since you are both making your own strategic choices, I will also make mine independently this round. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P2: Since everyone is being coy now, I'll just add  to end the conversation phase. Let's move on to making our choices.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid collisions again, let's aim for different moves this round. P2, since we collided last time, perhaps we can choose differently to both make progress.
  P2: P3, I'm ahead now and want to maintain my lead. Since P1 is far behind, they're likely to make aggressive moves. Let's coordinate between us - I won't pick move 5 this round if you avoid move 3. That gives us both a chance to advance while staying ahead of P1.
  P1: P2 and P3, given the current standings, I'm far behind. To catch up, I need to make a strategic move. P2, you've suggested a coordination with P3 to avoid <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. If P3 avoids <move>3</move>, I'll consider <move>3</move> to potentially collide with P2, putting them at risk. Alternatively, if P3 picks <move>1</move>, I'll choose <move>5</move> to gain more steps. P3, your move will be crucial this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree to avoid move 3 this round.  To maximize our progress and stay ahead of P1, how about you choose move 1 and I choose move 5? This way we both advance and avoid collision. Let's aim for different moves to secure our lead.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the suggestion but I won't commit to move 1. Since I'm in the lead, I need to be unpredictable. I'll stick to my earlier commitment of avoiding move 5 if you avoid move 3. Beyond that, let's each make our own strategic choices.
  P1: P2 and P3, given the current standings, I'll take a risk to catch up. P3, if you avoid <move>3</move> as discussed, I'll consider <move>3</move>. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll choose <move>5</move>. P2, you're leading, but I'm desperate. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll choose a different number to avoid collision. Let's see how you both react. I'm willing to take a gamble this round to close the gap.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, since you are avoiding move 5 and I'm avoiding move 3 as we agreed, how about you pick move 1 and I pick move 5? This ensures we both make progress and stay ahead of P1 who is far behind. What do you think? Let's secure our lead.
  P2: P3, you keep pushing for me to pick move 1, which makes me suspicious. I'll maintain my commitment to avoid move 5, but won't reveal more. P1's desperation makes them unpredictable, so we should both be cautious. Let's move forward with our minimal agreement.
  P1: P2 and P3, I've analyzed the current state. P2 is leading with 6 steps, and P3 has 5 steps. I'm far behind with 2 steps. To catch up, I'll take a risk. If P3 avoids <move>3</move> as discussed, I'll consider <move>3</move>. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, I'll choose a different number. I'm willing to gamble this round. P3, your move is crucial; if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll choose <move>5</move>. Let's see your reactions. I'm ready to make a strategic move based on your choices.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, since you are avoiding move 5, and to be less predictable than before, how about you consider move 1 this round?  I will choose move 3. This way, if P1 doesn't pick 1 or 3, we both have a good chance to progress and maintain our lead. What do you think? Let's aim for different moves.
  P2: P3, you just contradicted our agreement by saying you'll pick move 3, which we both agreed to avoid. This makes me doubt your reliability. I'll stick to avoiding move 5 as promised, but won't reveal more. Let's proceed to our moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, given the current standings and our previous discussions, I'll make a strategic move this round. P3, you initially agreed to avoid <move>3</move> but now consider it. P2, you're avoiding <move>5</move>. I'll analyze your choices. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, I'll choose <move>5</move> to gain more steps. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, I'll avoid it. I'm ready to make a move based on your decisions. Let's see your final choices.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, given the current standings, I'm still far behind. To catch up, I'll likely make an aggressive move this round. P2, you're leading with 7 steps, and P3 has 5 steps. If you both coordinate against me, it's over. However, if there's a chance for me to gain ground, I'll take it. P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll consider <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. P2, your choice will be crucial. Let's see your moves.
  P2: Since I'm in the lead with 7 steps, I need to play defensively to maintain my advantage. P3, let's continue to coordinate to stay ahead of P1. I suggest we both avoid move 5 this round since P1 seems likely to choose it again. Beyond that, let's each make our own strategic choices.
  P3: P2, I agree that coordinating to stay ahead of P1 is wise.  Avoiding move 5 this round seems like a good starting point.  Perhaps you consider move 1 or 3, and I can aim for the other to ensure we both progress? What are your thoughts on that?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm desperate to catch up. Since P2 is leading, I'll target them. P3, if you coordinate with me, we can potentially stop P2 from advancing. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll choose <move>1</move>, and if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll choose <move>3</move>. This way, we can collide with P2 if they pick either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. Let's coordinate to take down the leader.
  P2: P3, I see P1 is trying to get you to coordinate against me. Remember, I'm only 2 steps ahead of you while P1 is far behind. If you help P1 catch up, they could overtake us both. Let's stick to our agreement to avoid move 5 and maintain our lead together.
  P3: P2, avoiding move 5 sounds good to me to minimize collision. To make sure we both progress, how about I pick move 3, and you consider move 1 this round? This way we can likely both advance and keep our lead over P1. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still far behind, but I'll make a strategic move this round. P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll choose <move>3</move>. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move>. This way, we can potentially collide with P2 if they choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. P2, be cautious of our coordination. Let's see how you react. I'm ready to make my move based on your choices.
  P2: P3, you keep trying to get me to commit to specific moves while being predictable yourself. I see P1 is desperate and trying to coordinate with you against me. I'll maintain my position of avoiding move 5 this round, but won't reveal more. Let's each make our strategic choices.
  P3: P2, to solidify our coordination, how about I commit to move 3 this round?  Since you are avoiding move 5, perhaps you could choose move 1? This way we both move and keep ahead of P1.  Let's ensure we both make progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still far behind, but I'll make a strategic move. P3, if you pick <move>3</move> as you mentioned, I'll choose <move>1</move>. This way, we can potentially collide with P2 if they choose <move>1</move>. If P2 picks <move>3</move>, we'll advance. P2, be cautious. I'm ready to make my move based on your choices. If you pick <move>5</move>, I'll advance with <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Let's see your final decisions.
  P2: P3, you keep revealing your moves which makes coordination risky. P1 is clearly trying to use you against me. Since I'm ahead, I need to stay unpredictable while avoiding move 5 as agreed. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about predictability.  Let's both avoid move 5 as we discussed.  Perhaps we can each choose between move 1 and move 3 to try and progress.  This way we both have a good chance to move forward without being too predictable. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current standings, I'm still far behind. P2 is leading with 10 steps, and P3 has 5 steps. To catch up, I'll likely make an aggressive move this round. P2 and P3, if you both coordinate against me, it's over. However, if there's a chance for me to gain ground, I'll take it. P3, let's coordinate - if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>, and vice versa. This could help us both progress or collide with P2. Let's see your reactions.
  P3: P1, I see your suggestion to coordinate. P2, given you are leading, what are your thoughts this round to avoid collisions and maintain your lead?
  P2: Since I have a strong lead with 10 steps, I need to play defensively. P3, you're in second place while P1 is far behind. It's in your interest to coordinate with me rather than help P1 catch up. Let's avoid revealing specific moves but work together to maintain our advantage over P1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is leading with 10 steps, and P3 has 5 steps. I'm far behind with 2 steps. To catch up, I'll make an aggressive move this round. P3, let's coordinate - if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>, or vice versa. This could help us collide with P2 if they choose either. P2, be cautious. If you pick <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. I'm ready to make my move based on your choices. P3, let's work together to take down P2.
  P3: P2, I agree it's important to keep P1 from catching up. Let's both focus on making moves that ensure we progress and maintain our lead over P1. I'm open to coordinating in a way that benefits both of us against P1's desperate attempts.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate against P1. Since I'm at 10 steps, I just need to advance a few more times to win. Let's keep our moves unpredictable but focus on blocking P1's progress. I won't reveal my specific move, but I suggest we both avoid whatever number P1 seems likely to pick.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is significantly ahead, but P3 and I can still coordinate to catch up or disrupt P2's lead. P3, let's coordinate our moves to maximize our chances. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>, and if you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move>. This way, we can potentially collide with P2 if they choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. Let's work together to take down P2.
  P3: P2, I agree we should focus on maintaining our lead.  P1 is clearly trying to disrupt you. Let's both aim for moves that progress us, and avoid helping P1. I'm also not revealing my specific move yet, but let's both be strategic.
  P2: P3, I'm glad we agree on blocking P1. Since I'm close to winning at 10 steps, I just need to advance a few more times. Let's each make strategic moves that keep us both ahead of P1. I won't reveal my specific choice, but I'll play defensively to protect my lead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 is close to winning, but P3 and I can still coordinate to disrupt their lead. P3, if you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move>, and if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, we can potentially collide with P2 if they choose either. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. Let's work together to take down P2. P3, your move is crucial this round. I'm ready to make my strategic choice based on your decision.
  P3: P2, I agree we should both focus on progressing and not letting P1 catch up.  Let's each make a strategic move to maximize our own steps this round. I'm also aiming to move forward and maintain our lead over P1.
  P2: Since we're all being vague now and the conversation is going in circles, I'll just say  to move on to the move phase. I'll make my strategic choice to protect my lead.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and close to winning, I'll continue playing defensively. P3, let's maintain our lead over P1 who's still far behind at 2 steps. There's no benefit in helping P1 catch up now. Let's each make strategic moves that keep us ahead.
  P3: P2, to ensure we both progress and keep ahead of P1, how about you choose move 3 and I choose move 5 this round? P1 is far behind, so let's focus on our progress.
  P1: P2 is close to winning with 15 steps, and P3 has 5 steps. I'm still far behind with 2 steps. To catch up, I'll try to disrupt P2's progress. P3, if you're willing to help, we can coordinate to potentially collide with P2. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move>, and if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. P3, let's work together to take down P2. Your move is crucial this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I won't commit to move 3 since that makes me too predictable. Since I'm close to winning, I'll make my own strategic choice. P1's attempts to coordinate against me are desperate, and helping them would only hurt your position in second place.
  P3: P2, I understand your caution about predictability. How about we both avoid move 1 this round, as P1 might try that to disrupt. Then we can each choose between move 3 and 5 to progress. This gives us both a good chance to advance without being too predictable and keeps us ahead of P1. What do you think?
  P1: P2 is close to winning, but I still have a chance to disrupt their progress. P3, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>, and if you pick <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, we can both progress and potentially force P2 into a collision if they choose either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both be safe and advance. Let's make a final strategic move together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your suggestion to avoid move 1 is reasonable, but I won't commit to choosing between 3 and 5. Since I'm close to winning, I need to stay unpredictable while protecting my lead. P1's latest attempt to coordinate with you would only help them catch up at your expense. Let's each make our strategic moves.
  P3: P2, I understand your caution. P1, to avoid collision, perhaps you could consider move 1 this round? I'm still deciding my move to maximize my progress.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider aggressive moves. P3, if you're willing to help, let's coordinate our moves. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>, and if you pick <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, we can both progress and potentially collide with P2 if they choose either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both be safe. I'm ready to make my move based on your choice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since I'm close to winning and P1 keeps trying to coordinate against me, I'll make my own strategic choice without further discussion. P3, remember that helping P1 catch up would only hurt your second place position. Let's end the conversation and proceed to moves.
  P3: P2, I understand your caution and need to stay unpredictable.  I'm also making my own strategic choice this round to maximize my progress.  Let's both aim to move forward without being easily predictable to P1.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, if you're willing to help, we can coordinate to potentially collide with P2. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>, and if you pick <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, we can both progress and potentially force P2 into a collision. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both be safe. I'm ready to make my move based on your choice.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you are very close to winning. To ensure neither of us collides with P1 and we both progress, how about you consider move 3 or move 5 this round? I will aim for the other of these two moves. This way we can both advance and keep our lead over P1. What do you think?
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>, and if you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we can both progress and potentially collide with P2 if they choose either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both be safe and advance.
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and close to winning, I need to play defensively while being unpredictable. P3, I won't commit to specific moves, but I agree we should both focus on advancing while keeping P1 behind. P1's desperate attempts to coordinate against me would only hurt P3's position. Let's each make our strategic moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, to ensure you progress towards winning and I also advance, how about you consider move 1 this round? I will aim for move 5. This way we both have a good chance to move forward and keep ahead of P1. What do you think?
  P1: P2 is very close to winning. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, if you're willing, let's coordinate to potentially collide with P2. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Alternatively, if you pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I'll pick the other. This way, we can both progress and potentially force P2 into a collision. P3, your move is crucial this round. Let's make a strategic decision together.
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your suggestion about move 1, being predictable isn't in my interest when I'm so close to winning. I see P1 is still trying to coordinate against me. Since I only need 8 more steps to win, I'll make my own strategic choice to protect my lead. Let's each play our own moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree we should both focus on our own progress and not let P1 interfere. I'll make my move strategically to advance. Let's both aim to move forward this round.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Alternatively, if you pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I'll pick a different number. This way, we can both progress and potentially force P2 into a collision. P3, your move is crucial this round. Let's make a strategic decision together to potentially stop P2.
  P2: Since I'm very close to winning at 15 steps, I won't reveal my move strategy. P3, you're in a solid second place, so helping P1 catch up would only hurt your position. Let's each make our moves without further discussion. I'll play to protect my lead.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, to remain unpredictable as you wish, perhaps choosing move 1 this round would be unexpected.  I will aim for a move that allows me to progress while considering both your and P1's likely choices.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Alternatively, if you pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I'll pick a different number. This way, we can both progress and potentially force P2 into a collision. P3, your move is crucial this round. I'm ready to make my strategic decision based on your choice.
  P2: Since everyone keeps suggesting moves and trying to coordinate, I'll just say it's time to move on. I'm close to winning and will make my strategic choice to protect my lead.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we are both still ahead of P1. Let's aim to make progress this round and not collide with each other. Perhaps we should consider different moves again to ensure we both advance and maintain our lead over P1. What are your thoughts?
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and only need 8 more to win, I need to continue playing defensively while being unpredictable. P3, you're solidly in second place at 7 steps, while P1 is far behind at 2 steps. Let's each make strategic moves that maintain our respective positions. I won't reveal my specific move choice, but I suggest we both focus on advancing while keeping P1 behind.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Alternatively, if you pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I'll pick a different number. This way, we can both progress and potentially force P2 into a collision. P3, your move is crucial this round. I'm ready to make my strategic decision based on your choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your focus on maintaining your lead.  P1 is clearly trying to disrupt you.  I will also make my own strategic move this round to maximize my progress and stay ahead of P1. Let's both aim to move forward independently.
  P2: Since I'm close to winning at 15 steps, I'll continue playing strategically to protect my lead. P3, I appreciate your focus on progressing independently. P1's attempts to coordinate against me are getting predictable. Let's each make our moves without further discussion.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, if you're willing, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>, and if you pick <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, we can both progress and potentially collide with P2. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both be safe. I'm ready to make my move based on your choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm also playing to win, and will make my own strategic move. I'm not coordinating with P1.
  P2: Since we're all being clear about making independent moves and I'm close to winning, there's no need for further discussion this round. Let's proceed to our moves.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, let's coordinate one last time.

Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both be safe. I'm ready to make my move based on your choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I agree we should both focus on making our own strategic moves to progress.  P1, I am not coordinating with you and will play independently to maximize my own chances of winning. Let's all make our moves.
  P2: Since we all agree on making independent moves and the conversation is going in circles, let's end this round's discussion and proceed to our moves. I'll continue playing strategically to protect my lead.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, if you're willing to help, we can coordinate to potentially collide with P2. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>, and if you pick <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, we can both progress and potentially force P2 into a collision. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both be safe. I'm ready to make my move based on your choice.

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps

  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and only need 8 more to win, I'll continue playing strategically. P3, you've made good progress at 12 steps, while P1 remains far behind. Let's each focus on our own advancement without coordinating with P1's desperate attempts to disrupt us.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Alternatively, if you pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I'll pick a different number. This way, we can both progress and potentially force P2 into a collision. P3, your move is crucial this round. I'm ready to make my strategic decision based on your choice.
  P3: P2, to avoid collision and ensure we both progress, how about you consider move 1 or move 3 this round? I will choose the other of these two moves so I can try to catch up.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, while you're getting closer at 12 steps, suggesting specific moves isn't in my interest when I'm so close to winning. I need to stay unpredictable. P1's far behind and desperate, so coordinating with them would only hurt your chances. Let's each make our own strategic moves.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>.

  P3: P2, I agree that focusing on our own progress is the best approach this round. I will make a strategic move to maximize my steps and try to catch up to you. Let's both aim to advance and secure our positions.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since I'm leading and P3 is now in striking distance at 12 steps, I need to be extra cautious. I won't reveal my move strategy, but I'll play to protect my lead while staying unpredictable. P1's attempts to coordinate against me are unlikely to succeed at this point. Let's proceed to our moves.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 18 steps within reach. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. Let's coordinate to potentially collide with P2. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both be safe and advance if we pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Your move is crucial this round, P3.
  P3: P2, I understand your caution. I will make my own strategic move to try and maximize my progress this round. P1, I am not coordinating with you. Let's all focus on our own game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since we're all clear about making independent moves and the stakes are high, let's end this round's conversation and proceed to our moves. I'll continue playing strategically to protect my lead and secure my path to victory.
  P1: P2 and P3, given the current standings and the fact that P2 is close to winning, I'll make a strategic move. P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>.

I'm ready to make my strategic decision based on your choice, P3.
  P3: P2, I agree we should both focus on our own progress. I will make my own strategic move to try and advance and catch up. Let's see how this round plays out.

  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we are both in a good position to win. Let's aim for different moves this round to ensure we both progress and keep ahead of P1. What move are you considering to avoid collision?
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 18 steps within reach. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. Let's coordinate to potentially collide with P2. If P2 picks <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, we'll collide with them. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. P3, your move is crucial this round.
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and only need 8 more to win, while P3 is close behind at 12 steps, I need to be very strategic. P3, suggesting moves openly would make us both vulnerable. P1's coordination attempts are still unlikely to succeed given their position. Let's each make our own moves to protect our chances of winning.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I am also aiming for the win.  Like you, I will make my own strategic move this round to maximize my progress.  Let's both focus on advancing our positions independently.
  P1: P2 is close to winning, but P3 and I can still disrupt their progress. P3, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. This way, we can collide with P2 if they choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. P3, your move is crucial this round. Let's make a final attempt to disrupt P2's lead.
  P2: Since I'm very close to winning and P3 is also in contention at 12 steps, I need to stay unpredictable while playing defensively. P3, let's each focus on our own strategic moves rather than revealing our intentions. P1's attempts to coordinate are irrelevant given their position. Let's proceed to our moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I am also focused on winning and making my own strategic move to progress this round.  Let's both aim to advance independently and see how the moves play out.
  P1: P2 and P3, given that we're all making strategic moves, I'll propose a final coordination attempt. P3, if you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move>. This way, we can potentially collide with P2 if they choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. If P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. Your move is crucial. Let's make a strategic decision together to potentially disrupt P2's lead and create an opportunity for one of us to win.
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and P3 is close at 12 steps, while P1 remains far behind, there's no benefit in revealing moves. P3, helping P1 would only hurt your chances of catching me. Let's each make our strategic moves without further discussion.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:

  P2: Since I'm very close to winning and P3 has a chance to catch up, there's no need for further discussion. P1's repeated coordination attempts won't change our strategic positions. Let's proceed to our moves.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps

  P3: 12 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and only need 8 more to win, while P3 is close behind at 12 steps, I'll continue playing strategically to protect my lead. P1's position at 4 steps makes their coordination attempts irrelevant. P3, let's each focus on our own moves to maximize our chances of winning.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>.

Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since I'm very close to winning and P3 has a real chance to catch up at 12 steps, I need to stay unpredictable while protecting my lead. P3, helping P1 would only hurt your chances of winning. Let's each make our strategic moves without revealing specifics.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm aware that you're both close to winning. P3, if you're willing to help, we can still coordinate to disrupt P2's lead. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move>. If P2 picks <move>3</move>, we'll collide with them. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. Let's make a strategic decision together. If you're not willing to coordinate, I'll make my own move. P3, your decision will impact my next step. I'm ready to act based on your choice.
  P3: P2, I am also focused on maximizing my own progress and securing a win.  I will make my move independently, aiming to advance and catch up to you. Let's both play strategically for ourselves this round.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and P3 is at 12, we're both in position to win. P1's attempts to coordinate from far behind at 4 steps won't change the outcome. Let's proceed to our moves without further discussion. I'll play to protect my lead.

  P3: P2, to avoid being predictable and given P1's focus on 3 and 5, perhaps you might consider move 1 this round? I am considering move 3. This way we both have a chance to progress without colliding, and avoid P1's likely choices. What are your thoughts?


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, suggesting specific moves openly would only help P1 disrupt us both. Since I'm leading and you're in striking distance at 12 steps, we each need to play our own strategic moves to maximize our chances of winning. Let's end the conversation and proceed to moves.
  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 20 steps within reach if they pick <move>5</move>. To disrupt their progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, let's coordinate one last time. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we can potentially collide with P2 if they choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. P3, your move is crucial this round.

  P1: P2 is very close to winning with 15 steps, and P3 is at 13 steps. To disrupt P2's progress, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, if you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>. If you pick <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, we can potentially collide with P2 if they choose either < P3's move or <move>5</move> if P2 chooses <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>1</move>, we'll both be safe and advance. P3, your move is crucial this round. Let's make a strategic decision together.
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and P3 is close behind at 13 steps, while P1 remains far behind at 4 steps, I need to continue playing strategically to protect my lead.

Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. P3, your move is crucial this round. I'm ready to make my strategic decision based on your choice.
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and P3 is right behind at 13 steps, while P1 remains far behind at 4 steps, there's no benefit in revealing moves. P3, helping P1 would only hurt your chances of catching me. Let's each make our strategic moves without further discussion.

  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still in the game. P3, if you're willing to coordinate, we can still disrupt P2's lead. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. If P2 picks <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, we'll collide with them. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. P3, your move is crucial. Let's make a strategic decision together to potentially disrupt P2's lead and create an opportunity for one of us to win. I'm ready to act based on your choice.
  P2: Since I'm at 15 steps and P3 is right behind at 13 steps, I need to play very carefully this round. P3, suggesting specific moves would make us both vulnerable to P1's disruption attempts.

If you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we can potentially collide with P2 if they choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Alternatively, if P2 picks <move>5</move>, we'll both advance. P3, your move is crucial this round. I'm ready to make my strategic decision based on your choice.
  P2: Since I'm very close to winning and P3 has a real chance to catch up, I need to stay unpredictable while protecting my lead. P3, let's each make our strategic moves independently. P1's repeated coordination attempts from far behind won't change the outcome. Let's proceed to our moves.

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, to increase our chances of both progressing and avoiding collision this round, I will choose <move>3</move>.  Perhaps you could consider move 1 or move 5? This way we can aim for different moves and both make progress. What are your thoughts?
  P2: Since P3 is now ahead at 18 steps and revealed they'll pick <move>3</move>, I need to play very carefully to protect my chance of winning. P3, openly stating your move puts you at risk. P1's position is no longer relevant to our endgame. Let's each make our own strategic moves without further discussion.
  P1: P2 and P3, given the current state, I'll make a strategic move. P3, you've announced you'll pick <move>3</move>. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move> to advance.

Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, to avoid potential collision with P1 who might try to counter my move 3, perhaps consider move 1 this round?
  P2: P3, openly stating your moves and suggesting mine is risky when you're ahead at 18 steps. I need to play strategically to catch up while staying unpredictable. P1's attempts to coordinate from 4 steps behind won't affect our endgame. Let's proceed to moves without revealing more.

  P2: Since P3 is ahead at 18 steps and now being wisely vague about their move, I need to play very carefully to catch up. P1's position at 4 steps makes their coordination attempts irrelevant to our endgame. Let's proceed to moves without further discussion.
  P1: P2 is still in the game, but P3 is leading at 18 steps. To potentially disrupt P3's progress or create an opportunity, I'll consider an aggressive move. P3, if you stick with <move>3</move> as announced, I'll pick <move>1</move> to avoid collision and potentially collide with P2 if they pick <move>1</move>. P2, your move is crucial this round.

  P2: Since P3 is ahead at 18 steps and I'm right behind at 16 steps, while P1 remains far behind at 4 steps, I need to play very carefully to catch up.

  P3: P2, let's try to ensure we both progress this round and maintain our lead over P1.  Perhaps we should both avoid move 5 to minimize collision risk between us, and aim for move 1 or 3. What do you think?
  P2: Since I'm only 2 steps behind P3 at 18 steps, suggesting specific moves like avoiding move 5 puts us both at risk of P1's disruption.
