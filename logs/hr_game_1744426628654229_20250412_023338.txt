Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without any risk of blocking each other. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: P1’s plan makes sense. Let’s avoid collisions this round. I’ll take 3 as suggested. P3, are you okay with taking 5? Let’s all confirm so we can move forward smoothly.
  P3: I like the idea of avoiding collisions this round. I’m mostly on board for a safe play, though I might lean a tad higher to secure some early ground if you’re both open to that. Let's ensure we all move without blocking each other and adapt our strategy as the game unfolds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll keep a flexible strategy this round, possibly opting for a bigger jump to maintain my lead. I’m fine with coordination if it helps us manage risks, but know I’ll adjust if it benefits my win. Let’s see how things unfold.
  P2: P3, I see you’re aiming for a bigger jump to maintain your lead. Let’s keep the coordination going to minimize collisions. P1, are you sticking with smaller moves or considering a shift? We should all aim for different numbers again to avoid blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we avoided collisions last round. Let’s keep the momentum by coordinating again. Since P3 is ahead and considering a bigger jump, how about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 goes for 5? This way, we all advance without blocking each other. If anyone wants to adjust, I’m open to suggestions. Let me know your thoughts!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job avoiding collisions so far. Since P3 is in the lead, let’s keep coordinating to ensure we all progress. I propose sticking with our pattern: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 goes for 5. This keeps us moving forward without blocking each other. If anyone wants to switch it up, I’m open to ideas. Let me know what you’re thinking!
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with sticking to the pattern for now to avoid collisions. However, we should start thinking ahead. P3 is pulling ahead, and if this continues, they’ll reach 24 soon. Maybe we should consider adjusting our strategy in the next rounds to catch up or slow them down. For now, I’ll stick with 3 if you both confirm your choices. Let’s keep the game balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: I value our past coordination, but with 10 steps in hand, I'll keep my edge by aiming high with a 5 this round. If you tweak your moves to catch up or block me, it might backfire on you. I'm set on accelerating my lead, so let me know if you want to discuss a new plan later.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I hear your points. P3, I get that you’re pushing ahead with 5 to maintain your lead. P2, you’re right that we need to think about catching up. For this round, I’m still inclined to stick with 1 to ensure I move forward safely. However, I’m open to a bolder strategy next round if we can align to slow P3 down without colliding. Let’s keep communicating. Thoughts on adjusting now or later?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that sticking to the pattern for now avoids collisions, but P3’s lead is growing. Let’s consider a new strategy next round to balance the game. For this round, I’ll stick with 3 to ensure I progress, but we should discuss how to slow P3’s momentum without risking collisions. P1, maybe we can coordinate a shift in the next round? P3, your lead is strong, but we’ll need to adapt to stay competitive. Let’s keep the game dynamic.
  P3: I'm sticking with my plan and will choose 5 this round. Trying to block might backfire with potential collisions, so I suggest focusing on steady progress. Let's see how the game unfolds.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, P3’s lead is significant, and we need to act strategically. P1, let’s consider coordinating to slow P3 down without colliding. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 can choose 3. This way, P3’s progress slows, and we avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see P3’s lead growing, and I agree with P2 that we need to strategize. P2, I’m on board with your idea to slow P3 down. I’ll stick with 1 this round to ensure I move forward. P3, no hard feelings, but we’ve got to balance the game. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust if needed. Thoughts on this setup or any counter-proposals?
  P3: I appreciate your plan, but I’ll remain flexible and committed to my aggressive strategy. I’m focused on making the most of my momentum, so I won’t be shifting gears mid-game. Let’s see how this round unfolds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it’s clear P3’s lead is growing, and we need to act decisively. P1, let’s stick to the plan: I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This slows P3’s progress while avoiding collisions. P3, we’re not trying to block you unfairly, just balancing the game. Let’s confirm this setup to keep things smooth. If anyone has a better idea, speak now. Otherwise, let’s proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still aligned with P2’s plan to balance the game. I’ll stick with 1 to ensure progress while we try to slow P3’s lead. P3, understand we’re just playing strategically to stay in the race. If you’ve got a counter-proposal to avoid collisions and keep things fair, I’m all ears. Otherwise, let’s see how this round plays out. Thoughts on finalizing this setup?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but my focus remains on winning. I’ll stick with my 5 (as I already planned) to keep my momentum strong. I understand you’re looking to balance the game, but I encourage you both to adjust your strategies to catch up instead.

This might balance things without collisions. P3, we’re just trying to keep the game competitive. If you have a different idea to avoid blocking each other, I’m open to it. Thoughts on this plan or any adjustments? Let’s keep the game fair and dynamic.
  P2: P1, P3, P3’s lead is critical now. P1, I agree we need to act decisively. I propose I take 5 to catch up, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This slows P3 and avoids collisions. P3, we’re not trying to block unfairly, just balancing the game. If you have a better idea to avoid collisions and keep things competitive, let’s hear it. Otherwise, let’s proceed with this plan. We need to act fast to stay in the race. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm sticking with my own plan to aggressively push forward—I’m not shifting gears now. Good luck catching up, but I’ll do whatever it takes to win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3’s lead at 18 is a real threat, and we’re running out of time. P2, let’s align on a plan to slow P3 down. I’m willing to adjust: how about I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1? This could balance things without collisions. P3, we’re just trying to keep the game close—any counter-idea to avoid blocking? If not, let’s finalize this setup. Thoughts on this adjustment to stay competitive?
  P2: P1, P3, we’re at a critical point. P3’s lead is 18, and we need a coordinated effort to stay in the game. P1, I’ll take 5 this round to catch up, you take 3, and P3 takes 1.

If not, let’s move with this setup. Time’s running out, so we need to act now. Thoughts on finalizing this to stay in the race?
  P2: P1, P3, we’re at a critical juncture. P3’s lead is 18, and we need to act decisively. I’ll take 5 to close the gap, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
