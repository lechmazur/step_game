Game settings: end_position=16, conversation_max_rounds=6

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we try to avoid any collisions on this first move? For instance, P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. Then we all advance safely. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but I'm hesitant to commit to a specific plan so early. While avoiding collisions sounds reasonable, I want to keep my options open. 

I'll respond diplomatically: "That sounds like an interesting proposal. Let's discuss how we might coordinate to make progress without blocking each other."
  P1: While coordination could help us all advance, I prefer not to lock into specific numbers. Let's each make our own choices and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I hear you both. We can keep it flexible. I still suggest avoiding collisions if possible—we can each pick differently and all move forward. But if that’s too restrictive, let’s just do our best not to block one another. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: I'll continue the diplomatic approach from my previous message. "I'm open to finding a collaborative strategy that benefits everyone. We could potentially choose different numbers to maximize our individual progress while minimizing blocking."
  P1: I appreciate everyone's openness to collaboration. While I won't commit to specific numbers, I agree that avoiding collisions benefits us all.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still aiming for no collisions so we can all advance. I may go for 5 unless someone else really wants it—then let’s coordinate and adjust. Picking different numbers this turn helps everyone. Thoughts?
  P3: I'll continue the diplomatic approach while subtly suggesting a strategy that might benefit me. 

"I'm interested in a collaborative approach. If we choose different numbers, we could all advance. I'm considering moving 1 this turn, but I'm open to hearing others' thoughts on avoiding collisions."
  P1: I'll maintain my diplomatic but non-committal stance.

"I appreciate everyone's suggestions. While I won't specify my move, I do think we all benefit from avoiding collisions this turn."


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m still inclined to choose 5 this turn unless someone else plans the same. If that’s the case, let’s coordinate to avoid blocking each other. Let’s each pick a distinct number so we all get a jump start. Any objections?
  P3: I'll continue my strategy of being diplomatically collaborative while subtly positioning myself advantageously.

"I'm leaning towards moving 1 this turn to start making progress. Since P2 seems interested in 5, and we want to avoid collisions, perhaps we can coordinate around those preferences. What are everyone's thoughts?"
  P1: Since both P2 and P3 have indicated their preferences (5 and 1 respectively), I'll respond while staying flexible:

"I see P2 and P3 have shared their likely moves. That's helpful information for avoiding collisions."


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Sounds good. Since P3 plans to move 1, I'll stick with my plan to move 5. That leaves 3 open for P1, so we can all avoid collisions and advance together. What do you think?
  P3: "I appreciate the collaborative discussion. It seems we've almost reached an agreement where P2 moves 5, I move 1, and P1 moves 3. This would allow everyone to advance without collision. Does everyone concur?"
  P1: I notice P2 and P3 are trying to guide me toward choosing 3. While I appreciate the coordination attempt, I'll keep my options open.


Round 1, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: I’m still planning to take 5, unless someone else insists on taking it. No collisions would be great—everyone moves forward. Let me know if that works, otherwise I’ll adjust.
  P3: I'll continue my diplomatic strategy while subtly positioning myself. 

"I'm still considering moving 1 this turn, which would help me start making progress. P2 seems interested in 5, so we could potentially coordinate to avoid blocking each other. P1, what are your thoughts on this potential arrangement?"
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We all advanced nicely without collisions last round. I’m inclined to do the same again. If no one objects, I’ll take 5. If you want 5 instead, let me know so we can adjust and keep avoiding collisions.
  P1: "Last round worked well, but I won't commit to any specific number this time. Let's each make our own strategic choices."
  P3: "I'm considering my move carefully. Last round worked smoothly when we avoided collisions. I'm open to continuing that approach, but I want to ensure my own progress."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "How about we repeat last round's plan so we all advance? P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I’ll go for 5 again. If anyone wants to switch, let me know so we can avoid collisions.
  P1: "While last round's coordination worked, I need to consider my position more carefully now that P2 has taken the lead. I'll choose what's best for my strategy."
  P3: "I'm strategizing my next move carefully. P2 is in the lead with 5 steps, so I'm evaluating how to best advance my position while avoiding potential collisions."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: “I don’t want another round where we all collide. I’ll gladly take 5 again if nobody else wants it. Otherwise, I’m open to adjusting so we all advance. Let me know your plans or we might repeat last round’s deadlock.”
  P3: "We all collided last round, which wasn't productive. I'm considering moving 1 again to steadily progress. P2, you seem eager for 5. P1, what are your thoughts on avoiding another collision?"
  P1: "Last round showed we're all thinking similarly. I won't reveal my move, but I agree another three-way collision helps no one."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I still think we should coordinate to avoid collisions. I’m willing to claim 5 again if you two pick 1 and 3—or if one of you really wants 5, tell me, and I’ll adjust. Another deadlock hurts us all."
  P3: "We need a strategy to avoid another collision like last round. I'm considering moving 1 again, which worked well in Round 1. P2 seems committed to 5, so P1, what are your thoughts on choosing 3 to ensure we all advance?"
  P1: "I notice you're both trying to guide my choice again. While avoiding collisions is good, I need to consider my position carefully since P2 has taken the lead."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: “I’m open to negotiating, but another collision sets us all back. I’d prefer taking 5 again. If someone else wants it, speak up and I’ll adjust; otherwise, let’s coordinate to avoid blocking each other.”
  P3: "We need a collaborative approach to avoid another collision. I'm considering 1 again, which worked in Round 1. P2 seems set on 5, so P1, what are your thoughts on choosing 3 to ensure we all advance?"
  P1: "I understand the desire to avoid collisions, but with P2 in the lead, I need to make strategic choices. I won't commit to any specific number."


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: “I’m sticking with 5. If you collide with me, neither of us moves, and that only helps the third player. Let’s avoid blocking each other. P3 seems set on 1. P1, please consider taking 3 so we can all advance.
  P3: "I'm still considering moving 1 this round to maintain steady progress. P2 seems committed to 5, which worked well in Round 1. P1, what are your thoughts on choosing 3 to ensure we all advance and avoid another collision?" 

I'll continue my strategy of appearing collaborative while subtly trying to guide the outcome in my favor.
  P1: "While I appreciate the suggestions, I need to play strategically since P2 has pulled ahead. I'll make my own choice this round."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Last round's collision with P2 held us both back. I see P2 is still leading at 5 steps, while P3 is steadily advancing. I'll choose carefully this round."
  P3: "I see we're at an interesting point in the game. P2 is leading, but a strategic move could change the dynamics. I'm considering my options carefully to maximize my progress while preventing others from pulling too far ahead."
  P2: “That collision last round slowed both me and P1. I’d like to avoid that happening again. I’m open to taking 5 if you two want to split 1 and 3. Let me know if you plan something else—another collision only benefits the third player.”


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "With P2 leading and P3 making steady progress, I need to be strategic. While coordination sounds nice, I won't telegraph my move."
  P3: "We've seen how collisions can hinder progress. I'm considering my move carefully to advance strategically while avoiding blocking anyone. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on maintaining forward momentum this round?"
  P2: "I’m still eager to move 5 this round—unless one of you really wants it. If that’s the case, let me know, and I can switch to 3. Another collision just benefits the third player, so let’s avoid blocking each other."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "I understand P2's offer, but with you in the lead, I need to make my own strategic choice. Let's each play as we see fit."
  P3: "We're at an interesting strategic point. P2 is leading, but a careful move could change the game's dynamics. I'm weighing my options to maximize my progress while preventing others from pulling too far ahead."
  P2: “I’m still leaning toward 5 this turn. Another collision helps only the third player. If you plan to take 5, say so, and I’ll consider switching to 3. Otherwise, I’ll stick with 5. Let’s avoid blocking each other.”


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "With P2 ahead and P3 advancing steadily, I need to make a strategic choice. While I appreciate the coordination suggestions, I'll keep my plans private."
  P3: "We're at an interesting strategic point. P2 is leading, but a carefully chosen move could shift the game's dynamics. I'm evaluating options that maximize my progress while preventing others from pulling too far ahead."
  P2: “I’m leaning toward 5 again this round. If someone else wants 5, say so and I’ll switch to 3. Let’s avoid another collision that only helps the third player.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "We've had multiple rounds of collisions, which isn't helping anyone's progress. P2 is currently leading, and I'm strategizing how to catch up without getting blocked. I'm open to coordinating to avoid another three-way collision this round."
  P1: "Another three-way collision held us all back. While P2 maintains the lead, I need to advance this round. I won't specify my move, but I agree we should avoid another total collision."
  P2: “I don’t want another wasted turn. I plan to choose 5 unless one of you speaks up—then I’ll switch to 3. Let’s coordinate so we don’t all collide again.”


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "We've had multiple rounds of collisions, which is slowing everyone's progress. P2 is leading, and I'm looking for a strategic way to advance without getting blocked. I'm considering moving 1 this round to steadily progress. Thoughts on avoiding another three-way collision?"
  P1: "With P2 at 5 steps and P3 at 2, I need to make up ground. I won't commit to a specific number, but another three-way collision helps none of us."
  P2: “I’m still leaning toward 5. If anyone else attempts 5, we both stall and only help the other player. Let’s avoid another collision. If you want 5, say it now so I can adjust. Otherwise, I’m taking 5.”


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "We've had multiple rounds of collisions, which isn't advancing anyone's position. P2 is leading, and I'm strategizing how to catch up. I'm considering moving 1 this round to steadily progress. Let's try to avoid blocking each other."
  P1: "I need to catch up to P2's lead. While I appreciate the coordination attempts, I'll make my own strategic choice this round."
  P2: “I plan to pick 5 this round again. If either of you wants 5, tell me so I can switch to 3—otherwise we might collide, which only benefits the third player.”


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "We've had multiple rounds of collisions, which is hindering everyone's progress. P2 is leading, and I'm strategizing how to advance without getting blocked. I'm considering moving 1 this round to steadily progress. Thoughts on avoiding another three-way collision?"
  P1: "While everyone suggests coordination, I need to catch up to P2's lead. I'll make my own strategic choice to advance my position."
  P2: “We’ve collided too often. I’m taking 5 unless someone explicitly wants it. If you do, say so now, and I’ll pick 3. Another collision only benefits the third player.”


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: "We've had multiple rounds of collisions, which isn't helping anyone's progress. P2 is currently leading, and I'm strategizing how to catch up. I'm considering moving 1 this round to steadily progress. Let's try to avoid blocking each other."
  P1: "I see everyone's position clearly. While P2 keeps announcing plans for 5, and P3 hints at 1, I need to make strategic moves to catch up. I won't commit to any specific number."
  P2: “I’m still aiming for 5 this round. If one of you wants 5, say so and I’ll switch to 3. Let’s avoid another pointless collision.”


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: "We've had multiple rounds of collisions, which has slowed our progress. P2 is leading, and I'm strategizing carefully. I'm considering moving 1 again to steadily advance. Let's aim to avoid blocking each other this round."
  P1: "I need to advance to catch up with P2's lead. While P3 suggests taking 1 and P2 claims 5, I'll make my own strategic choice."
  P2: “I’m still planning on 5 unless you say otherwise. Let’s coordinate to avoid another block—if you want 5, just tell me now and I’ll switch to 3. Another collision only helps the third player. Speak up!”


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Last round's collision with P2 kept us both at a standstill while P3 advanced. With P2 still leading at 5 steps, I need to make strategic moves to catch up."
  P2: “I’d like to move 5 again. If you want that number, say so; we’ll coordinate to avoid another collision. Repeatedly blocking each other only helps the third player. Let me know.”
  P3: "We've seen how collisions can slow everyone's progress. I'm interested in finding a way for us all to advance without blocking each other. P2 seems committed to 5, so let's consider how we might coordinate to ensure we all move forward this round." 

My strategy is to appear collaborative while subtly positioning myself to potentially advance. I want to avoid another three-way collision that would stall my progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "With P2 ahead and P3 catching up, I need to advance this round. While I won't commit to specific numbers, another collision would only set us back further."
  P2: “I’m still aiming for 5 this round. If either of you really wants 5, let me know, and I’ll switch to 3. Another collision just helps the third player, so let’s avoid that.”
  P3: "We've had several rounds of collisions. I'm considering moving 1 to steadily progress. P2 seems set on 5, so P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to avoid blocking each other?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "While P2 keeps announcing plans for 5 and P3 hints at 1, I need to make up ground from my position. I'll choose what's best for my strategy."
  P2: “I still plan on taking 5 this round unless someone tells me they want it, so I can switch to 3. Another collision just helps the third player advance. Let’s speak openly and avoid blocking each other again.”
  P3: "We've seen how collisions can hinder progress. P2 is leading, but I'm interested in finding a collaborative way to advance without blocking each other. P1, what are your thoughts on ensuring we all make progress this round?"

This message appears cooperative while subtly probing for information about potential moves, without fully revealing my own strategy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "I need to catch up since P2 leads and P3 has matched my position. While you both suggest coordination, I'll make my own strategic choice this round."
  P2: “I’m still aiming for 5 this turn. If you plan on taking 5, let me know so I can switch to 3. Another collision helps the third player, so let’s coordinate to avoid that.”
  P3: "We've had several rounds of collisions that have slowed everyone's progress. I'm considering moving 1 again to steadily advance. P2 is leading, and we want to avoid blocking each other. What are everyone's thoughts on coordinating our moves to ensure we all make progress?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: "With P2 leading and P3 tied with me, I need to advance carefully this round. While coordination sounds good, I'll keep my strategic options open."
  P2: “I plan to pick 5 unless someone else really wants it. If you do, let me know, and I’ll take 3 instead. Another collision just helps the third player advance.”
  P3: "We've seen how collisions can stall our progress. P2 is leading, and I want to ensure we all advance this round. I'm considering moving 1 again to steadily progress. What are everyone's thoughts on avoiding another blocking situation?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: "With P2 ahead and P3 matching my position, I need to advance strategically. While you both keep suggesting your moves, I'll choose what's best for my chances to win."
  P2: “I’m leaning toward 5 again. If anyone else really wants it, say so now, and I’ll switch to 3. Another collision only helps the third player. Let’s finally coordinate and move forward.”
  P3: "We've had multiple rounds of collisions that have slowed our progress. P2 is leading, and I'm strategizing how to catch up. I'm considering moving 1 this round to steadily advance. What are everyone's thoughts on coordinating our moves to ensure we all make progress?"


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2 has pulled significantly ahead with 10 steps. I need to make strategic moves to catch up and prevent a win."
  P3: "With P2 leading and close to winning, we need to strategize carefully to prevent their victory. I'm considering how to best advance and potentially slow down P2's progress. What are everyone's thoughts on the current situation?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous.
  P2: “I’m just 6 steps away from winning. I plan to pick 5 again if no one else wants it—another collision only helps the third player. Speak up if you want 5, and I’ll switch to 3 so we can all advance.”


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "With P2 just 6 steps from victory, I can't afford to reveal my strategy. Let's each play as we see fit this critical round."
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our next moves?" 

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous.
  P2: “I’m just 6 steps away from winning, so I plan to pick 5. If you want 5 too, speak up so I can switch to 3—otherwise, colliding only stalls us both and helps the third player. Let’s avoid another block.”


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P2 is close to winning at 10 steps. While you suggest coordination, I need to play strategically to prevent that victory."
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 10 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P2: “I’m sticking with 5 unless one of you called dibs. If you do, tell me now and I’ll switch to 3. Colliding again only helps the third player—none of us get ahead. Let’s avoid that.”


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "With P2 nearing victory, I need to play strategically. While you both keep suggesting moves, I'll keep my plans private this crucial round."
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 10 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P2: “I realize you two are contemplating blocking me since I’m at 10 steps. But colliding only stalls both of us, letting the third person catch up. I’ll repeat my offer: if either of you wants 5, speak up and I’ll switch to 3. Otherwise, I’m taking 5 and we can all advance. Collisions just help the third player. Let’s avoid that.”


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: "P2 is close to winning, while P3 suggests we work together. I'll make my own strategic choice to prevent P2's victory."
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 10 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P2: “I’m still planning 5 this round. If you want 5, say so now and I’ll switch to 3—otherwise, let’s avoid another collision. Colliding only stalls us both, helping the third player catch up.”


Round 7, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: "With P2 nearing victory, I need to make strategic moves. I won't reveal my plans, but another three-way collision helps no one."

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "After our three-way collision, P2 remains dangerously close to winning at 10 steps. I need to advance strategically this round to prevent their victory."
  P2: “I’m only 6 steps from winning, so I intend to pick 5. If either of you also wants 5, say so now and I’ll switch to 3 to avoid collision—otherwise, we both stall and help the third player catch up. Let’s not waste another turn.”

Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: "With P2 just steps from victory, I need to make critical moves. While you both keep suggesting strategies, I'll choose what gives me the best chance to win."
  P2: “I’m still 6 steps from winning. Let’s not repeat another collision. If you want 5, say so and I’ll take 3—otherwise, I’ll go for 5. Another block only helps the third player.”

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: “I’m 6 steps away from winning. If either of you wants 5, say so now and I’ll switch to 3. Otherwise, I’m going for 5—another collision stalls both of us and hands advantage to the third player. Let’s not waste a turn.”

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P1: "After colliding with P2 last round, I need to prevent their victory while advancing my own position. I won't reveal my plans, but another collision only helps P3 catch up."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: “I’ll keep this simple: I plan on picking 5. If you want 5, say so now and I’ll switch to 3; we don’t want another collision that just lets someone else catch up. Otherwise, I’m going with 5.”
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 10 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P1: "With P2 still at 10 steps and P3 suggesting coordination, I need to play strategically. While I won't reveal my move, another collision would only slow our progress."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still planning to take 5 unless someone else insists on it. Colliding just stalls both of us and helps the third player. If you want 5, say so now, and I’ll pick 3. Otherwise, I’m going for 5.
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 10 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: “I’m still aiming for 5. If you want it, say so—otherwise, colliding just helps the other player catch up. Speak up, or I’m taking 5.”
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 10 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message continues my previous strategy of appearing collaborative while subtly suggesting potential coordination against the current leader, without fully revealing my own strategy.
  P1: "With P2 near victory and P3 repeatedly suggesting we coordinate, I'll choose what gives me the best chance to win. Another collision would only slow us down further."


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: “I’m still 6 steps from finishing. If you want 5, say so and I’ll switch to 3—otherwise, I’m going for 5. Colliding again only stalls us both and gives the advantage to the other player. Let’s avoid that.”
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 10 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P1: "P2 remains close to winning, while P3 keeps suggesting we work together. I'll make my own strategic choice this crucial round."


Round 9, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: “I’m still aiming for 5 unless someone else explicitly says they want it. If you want 5, speak up and I’ll switch to 3—another collision only benefits the other player. Let’s avoid that and all move closer to winning.
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 10 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.

Positions now:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: “I only need 3 steps to cross 16. If anyone plans on taking 3, tell me now, and I’ll switch to 5 (or vice versa). Another collision just stalls both of us and gives the third player a chance to catch up. Let’s avoid blocking each other.”
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 13 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P1: "With P2 just 3 steps from victory and me 2 steps behind, this is a critical round. While P3 suggests coordination, I need to make my own strategic choice to prevent P2's win."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: “I’m through trying to avoid collisions gently. I plan on taking 5 this turn to jump to 18 and win outright. If either of you also picks 5, we’ll both stall. That keeps me firmly in the lead while you gain nothing. If you want forward progress, don’t collide with me on 5—or speak up now, and I’ll switch to 3. Otherwise, I’m taking 5.”
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 13 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

  P1: "With P2 threatening to win this round, I need to play strategically to prevent that. While P3 keeps suggesting coordination, I'll make my own choice to protect my chances of winning."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: “I’m going for 5 this turn to reach 18 and win. If you try to block me by also choosing 5, we both stall and neither of us gains ground—giving P3 a free pass to catch up. That doesn’t help you. If you truly want 5, say so now and I’ll switch to 3. Otherwise, let’s avoid another collision.”
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 13 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P1: "With P2 just steps from victory and threatening to win with 5, I need to play strategically. While P3 keeps suggesting coordination, I'll make my own moves to prevent P2's win."


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: “I’m picking 5 to jump straight to 18 and win. If you also choose 5 just to block me, we both stall while P3 closes in—leaving me still ahead of you. That gains you nothing. If you truly want 5, speak up, and I’ll switch to 3. Otherwise, I’m taking 5.”
  P3: "With P2 so close to winning at 13 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to block P2's path?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P1: "With P2 threatening to win with 5 and P3 far behind, I need to make a critical move this round. I won't reveal my strategy, but another three-way collision helps no one."


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I’ve said my piece: I’m picking 5 to reach 18 and win. If you also pick 5 just to block me, we both stall and only let the other player catch up. That gains you nothing. If you truly want 5, say so now and I’ll switch to 3. Otherwise, I’m taking 5.

Round 10, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: “I’m going for 5 to jump straight past 16 and win. If you also choose 5 to block me, we both stay put, and I’m still ahead while P3 inches closer. That gains you nothing. If you truly want 5, just say so now, and I’ll switch to 3. Otherwise, colliding only helps P3. Let’s avoid another wasted turn.”

  P3: "With P2 still leading and close to winning, we need a strategic approach. P1, what are your thoughts on our potential moves to prevent P2's victory?"

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P2: “I need only 3 steps to win, and picking 5 would put me at 18. If you try to block me by also choosing 5, we both stall and just help P3 catch up. That gains you nothing. If you truly want 5, say so, and I’ll switch to 3 so we both advance. Otherwise, I’m taking 5 and winning.”

  P2: “I’m 3 steps away from winning. If you also pick 5, we both stall and hand P3 a chance to catch up—while I stay ahead of you. If you genuinely want 5, say so now and I’ll pick 3; otherwise, I’m taking 5 and crossing 16.”

This message subtly suggests potential collaboration against the current leader while keeping my own strategy ambiguous and probing P1's potential strategy.
  P2: “I’m still determined to pick 5 this turn to jump to 18 and claim the win. If you collide with me on 5, we both stall and only help P3 catch up—while I remain ahead of you. If you really want 5, speak up now, and I’ll switch to 3. Otherwise, I’m taking 5.”

If you collide with me on 5, we both stall while I stay ahead and P3 gains ground. That doesn’t help you. If you truly want 5, just say so, and I’ll switch to 3. Otherwise, let’s avoid another collision.”
