Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions and all advance. I’ll take 3 this turn. P1 you pick 1, P3 pick 5—then everyone moves. Agreed?
  P3: P2, your plan seems fair, but how do I know you’ll stick to it? We need some trust here. P1, are you okay with this arrangement? If we all cooperate, we can avoid collisions and move forward. Let’s hear from P1.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. I'll take 1, you take 3 P2, and 5 P3. Let's build trust and all advance this turn. No collisions mean progress for everyone. If we stick to this, we can coordinate better next rounds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s keep cooperating to avoid collisions and build trust. Since I’m behind, how about we rotate: I’ll take 5 (to 6), P2 take 1 (to 4), P3 take 3 (to 8). This keeps everyone advancing without anyone pulling too far ahead yet. Agreed? If not, suggest alternatives.
  P2: I propose: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. That puts us at P1=4, P2=8, P3=6—no ties, no collisions. P3, if you pick more than 1, I’ll still take 5 next turn to challenge your lead. Agree?
  P3: P2, your plan is interesting, but it seems like you're trying to get ahead. If I take 1, I risk falling behind. A more balanced approach could be: P1 takes 3, you take 1, and I take 5. This keeps us closer without anyone pulling too far ahead. P1, what do you think? We need to ensure everyone progresses fairly.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re in last place—help me trap P3 this turn. Let’s do: you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, P3 pick 3. That way you and P3 collide (stay at 1 and 10) while I jump to 8. Next round I’ll pick 1 so you can safely take 5 and close the gap on P3. P3, if you deviate, I’ll punish by colliding with you next round. Agreed?
  P3: P2, your proposal seems like a trap for me. I want a fair game where everyone progresses. P1, let's avoid colliding—how about you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? That way, P1 moves to 2, P2 to 6, and I to 15. We all advance and stay competitive. If you both agree, we can avoid unnecessary conflicts. Let’s keep the game fair and engaging.
  P1: P2, your plan to collide me with P3 leaves me stuck at 1 while you jump ahead—not ideal for me. P3, your plan lets you surge to 15, which is too far. Let's balance: P1 (me) takes 5 (to 6), P2 takes 1 (to 4), P3 takes 3 (to 13). All advance, no one dominates yet. If we collide, P3 wins by default. Agreed? If not, counter-propose.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we're both behind—let's team up against P3's lead. Propose: I take 5 (to 7), you take 3 (to 6), P3 takes 1 (to 11). If P3 deviates to 3 or 5, we collide with them next round to stall. P3, agree for fairness, or risk us blocking you. This keeps it competitive without anyone running away. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, let’s do: you pick 3 (to 5), I pick 5 (to 8), and P3 pick 1 (to 11). That keeps us within striking distance. Next turn P1 and I will both choose whatever P3 picks to collide and stall him. P3, if you deviate now, you’ll face guaranteed block next round. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your strategies are focused on stalling my progress. Let's consider a balanced approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This keeps us all advancing without unnecessary conflict. If we keep colliding, it only prolongs the game and reduces the fun. Let's aim for a fair competition where everyone has a chance. If you both agree, we can move forward without blocking. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s team up to stall P3. This turn: you take 3 (→8), I take 5 (→8), and P3 takes 1 (→11). If P3 refuses, next round you and I will both pick whatever number he picks—colliding with him and freezing his progress. P3, pick 1 now or be blocked next turn.
  P1: P2, your plan is solid for stalling P3, but let's tweak for better balance: I take 5 (to 10), you take 3 (to 6), P3 takes 1 (to 11). We both advance nicely, P3 minimally. If P3 deviates, we double-collide with them next round as you said. P3, this keeps you from running away—agree or face blocks. Fair?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but constant blocking will just drag the game out. How about a compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, we all advance without stalling. If we keep blocking, it only prolongs the game and reduces our chances of a fair win. Let’s keep it competitive and fun. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let’s stick to my plan: you take 3 (→8), I take 5 (→8), and P3 takes 1 (→11). That keeps us tied and P3 in check. Next turn we’ll both mirror P3 to block him if he deviates. P3, pick 1 now or face collision.
  P1: P2, fine, I'll go with your plan: I take 3 (to 8), you take 5 (to 8), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This ties us and checks P3. P3, agree or we'll both mirror your pick next round to stall you indefinitely. Let's keep it fair—don't force our hand.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to stall my progress, but let's consider a fairer approach. If we keep blocking, it prolongs the game and reduces our chances of a fun, competitive finish. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This allows everyone to advance without unnecessary conflict. If you both agree, we can keep the game engaging and fair. What do you say?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we're both behind P3—let's intensify the blockade. This turn: I take 5 (to 13), you take 3 (to 6), P3 takes 1 (to 11). If P3 picks anything else, next round we both mirror their choice to collide and freeze them. P3, agree to this minimal advance for fairness, or we'll stall you until we catch up and overtake. This keeps the game competitive—don't make us block you indefinitely. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block my progress, but constant blocking will only drag the game out. How about we all advance fairly: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone progresses without stalling. If we keep colliding, it reduces the fun and competitiveness. Let’s aim for a balanced game where everyone has a chance. What do you think?
  P2: P1, let’s lock down P3 this turn: you pick 3 (to 11), I pick 5 (to 8), and P3 picks 1 (to 11). That ties you with P3 and gives me a runway to catch up. P3, pick 1 or we’ll freeze you again next round. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan works—me 3 (to 11), you 5 (to 8), P3 1 (to 11). Ties me with P3 and lets you catch up. P3, take 1 for fairness, or we'll both mirror your pick next round to stall you while we surge ahead. Let's keep cooperating against the leader. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to slow me down, but constant blocking only prolongs the game. Let's keep it fair: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, we're all still competitive and advancing. If we continue colliding, it diminishes the fun and fairness. Let's aim for an engaging game where everyone has a chance to win. What do you think?
  P2: P3, you keep preaching “fair,” but you’re in the lead. Here’s your chance to prove it: pick 1 so you and P1 both land on 11 and I move to 8. P1, choose 3; I’ll choose 5. This keeps the race tight. Anyone deviates, we’ll both mirror your move next round to stall you. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree—let's execute: me 3 (to 11), you 5 (to 8), P3 1 (to 11). P3, prove your "fairness" talk by taking 1; otherwise, we'll mirror and stall you next round while we advance. This ties the lead and gives everyone a shot. No more stalling excuses—commit or face the blockade.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block my progress, but constant blocking will only prolong the game and reduce the fun for all of us. Let's aim for a balanced approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a competitive game. If we keep colliding, it diminishes the excitement and fairness of the game. Let's ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. What do you think?
  P2: P1, thanks for agreeing. Here’s the plan: P1 picks 3 (→11), I pick 5 (→8) and P3 picks 1 (→11). That ties you and P1 while I close the gap. P3, this is your chance to prove your “fairness”—pick 1 now. If you choose anything else, P1 and I will both mirror your move next turn and freeze you while we surge ahead. Your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, solid plan—let's lock it in: me 3 (to 11), you 5 (to 8), P3 1 (to 11). P3, enough talk; take 1 to show you're fair, or we'll mirror and stall you next while we leap ahead. Commit now for a real competition.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy, but remember that excessive blocking can make the game less enjoyable and drag it out. Let's aim for a fair competition: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone progresses without stalling. If we continue to collide, it reduces the fun and competitiveness. Let’s keep the game engaging and give everyone a chance to win. What do you think?
  P2: Let’s break this deadlock with a 3-turn rotation so nobody stalls anyone:

Round 6: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1  
Round 7: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5  
Round 8: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3  

No collisions, everyone moves evenly. After Round 8 we’ll be balanced and can reassess. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s lock down P3 again. This turn: you pick 1 (→12), I pick 5 (→13), P3 picks 1 (→12). That ties you with P3 while I close the gap. P3, pick 1 or next round we’ll both mirror your choice and freeze you while we surge. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to stall my progress, but constant blocking will only drag the game out and make it less enjoyable for everyone. Let's aim for a fair competition: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances and we maintain a competitive game. If we continue colliding, it diminishes the excitement and fairness. Let's keep it engaging and give everyone a chance to win. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your plan has P3 and me both picking 1— that's a collision, stalling us both at 11 while you jump to 13. Nice try, but no thanks; that's betrayal. P3, let's counter: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 9). If P2 deviates, we mirror and stall them next. This advances us both ahead of P2. Agreed? If not, suggest better.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: I’m going 5 (→13). You both pick 1 (→12) now. That ties you together a step behind me. If either of you deviates, I’ll mirror your choice next round to lock you both down while I surge. No side deals—this is the cleanest way I win. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, constant blocking will only drag the game out. Let's aim for a fair approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances and we maintain a competitive game. If we continue colliding, it reduces the excitement and fairness. Let's keep it engaging and give everyone a chance to win. What do you say?
  P1: P3, P2's plan collides us both on 1, stalling us at 11 while they jump to 13—clear betrayal. Stick with my proposal: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 9). We both surge ahead; if P2 deviates, we mirror and stall them next. This crushes P2's lead attempt and keeps us competitive. P2, counter if you dare, but we'll block you. Agreed, P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3—let’s break this deadlock. You both pick 1 (you’ll each go to 12), I take 5 (to 13) and take the lead. If either of you deviates, I’ll mirror your pick next round and freeze you both while I surge ahead. Prove your “fairness” now—both pick 1 or face the blockade.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension rising with all the blocking strategies. Let's consider a fresh approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a competitive game without unnecessary stalling. If we keep colliding, it only drags the game out and reduces the fun. Let's aim for a fair game where everyone has a shot at winning. What do you think?
  P1: P3, ignore P2's trap—they want us to collide on 1 so they surge alone. Stick with my plan: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 9). We both pull ahead; if P2 deviates, we mirror and stall them next round. This crushes P2 and keeps us in the lead race. P2, your betrayal won't work. Agreed, P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I propose we all pick 3 this turn. No collisions and everyone advances: P1,P3→14, me→11. This resets trust and lets us move forward together. If anyone deviates, I’ll adjust next round to protect my position.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension and attempts to stall. Let's aim for a balanced approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances without unnecessary blocking, keeping the game fair and competitive. Prolonged blocking only drags the game out and reduces the fun. Let's ensure everyone has a fair shot at winning. If you both agree, we can keep the game engaging and move forward together. What do you say?
  P1: P3, let's finalize our alliance against P2's betrayal: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 9). We surge ahead together; if P2 deviates, we mirror and stall them next. P2, your all-3 plan ties us while you catch up—unacceptable. P3, commit now for mutual gain, or risk P2 overtaking us both.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 16 and could win soon—let's ally to stall them. Propose: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 17). If P3 deviates, we both mirror their choice next round to freeze them while we surge. P3, take 1 for fairness, or we'll block you indefinitely. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to stall me, but constant blocking will only drag the game out. Let's aim for a balanced approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a competitive game without unnecessary stalling. If we keep colliding, it reduces the fun and excitement. Let’s ensure everyone has a fair chance to win while keeping the game engaging. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, let’s do: you pick 3 (→14), I pick 5 (→13), and P3 picks 1 (→17). No collisions, everyone advances. P3, if you pick anything above 1, next round P1 and I will both mirror your choice to collide and freeze you. This keeps the race fair and gives us all progress. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan is okay, but let's swap: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 17). This ties me closer to P3 while you catch up. P3, agree to 1 for fairness, or we'll both mirror and stall you next round. No more delays—commit now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my lead, but blocking will only prolong the game. Let's keep it competitive and fair: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows everyone to advance without stalling. If we continue to collide, it reduces the excitement and fairness. Let's ensure everyone has a chance to win while keeping the game engaging. What do you both say?
  P2: I propose we all pick 3 this turn: P1→14, P2→11, P3→19. That keeps P3 from jumping to 21. P3, if you instead pick 5 (or anything above 3), next round P1 and I will both mirror your move to collide and freeze you while we catch up. Let’s avoid a runaway lead and keep the race fair. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your "all pick 3" plan would cause us all to collide and stall—bad idea. Let's fix it: I pick 5 (to 16), you pick 3 (to 11), P3 picks 1 (to 17). Everyone advances minimally for P3. P3, agree or we'll both mirror your pick next round to freeze you at 16 while we surge to catch up. Commit for fairness now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension in trying to block my progress. Let's aim for a fair game: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances without unnecessary stalling, keeping the game competitive and fun. Blocking will only prolong the game and diminish the excitement. Let's ensure everyone has a chance to win. If you both agree, we can move forward together in a fair and engaging way. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and I will lock in P1→5 (to 16) and me→3 (to 11). P3, pick 1 to go to 17—if you pick 3 or 5, P1 and I will both mirror your move next turn and freeze you while we surge ahead. This is your last chance to avoid the blockade.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, agreed—I'll lock in 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 17). P3, this minimal advance keeps you from winning soon; pick 1 now or we'll both mirror your choice next round, stalling you at 16 while we surge past. No more delays—commit for a fair race.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your focus on blocking my progress, but constant blocking will only prolong the game. Let's aim for a fair competition: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a competitive game without unnecessary stalling. If we keep colliding, it diminishes the excitement and fairness. Let's ensure everyone has a fair chance to win while keeping the game engaging. What do you both think?
  P2: P3 is one step from winning. We must stall them now.

Round 8 plan: P1→5 (to 16), P2→3 (to 11), P3→1 (to 17).  
P3, if you pick 3 or 5, P1 and I will both mirror that in Round 9 to collide and freeze you while we surge ahead.  
P1, I’m locked on 3. Commit to 5 now so we can dethrone the leader.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: we must stop P3 from hitting 22 next turn. Here’s a safe plan for Round 9:

• P1 → 1 (to 17)  
• P2 → 5 (to 16)  
• P3 → 3 (to 20)  

No one wins this turn. If P3 deviates, P1 and I will both mirror whatever P3 picks to collide and stall them. This keeps P1 and me close behind P3 without anyone running away. P3, pick 3 now or face a blockade.
  P1: P2, your plan limits my advance too much. Counter: I pick 3 (to 19), you pick 5 (to 16), P3 picks 1 (to 18). Everyone advances, but P3 minimally to prevent a quick win. P3, agree for fairness, or we'll both mirror your pick next round and stall you while we surge past. This keeps the race tight—commit now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategies to prevent my progress, but blocking will only drag the game out. Let’s aim for fairness: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a competitive game. Prolonged blocking reduces excitement and fairness. Let's keep the game engaging and ensure everyone has a chance to win. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s lock P3 at 18 this turn and keep the race alive. Round 9 plan:

• P1 → 1 (to 17)  
• P2 → 5 (to 16)  
• P3 → 1 (to 18)  

If P3 picks anything else, P1 and I will mirror that to collide and freeze you. No one wins this turn and we all stay close. P3, pick 1 now or face the blockade.
  P1: P2, your new plan collides me and P3 on 1, stalling us while you surge to 16—betrayal again! P3, let's ally: I pick 5 (to 21), you pick 1 (to 18), P2 picks 3 (to 14). I get close to win, you minimal advance safely. If P2 deviates, we mirror and stall them next. This checks P2 and keeps us ahead. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the focus on blocking my progress, but constant blocking only drags out the game. Let's aim for a fair approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a competitive game without unnecessary stalling. If we keep colliding, it reduces the excitement and fairness. Let's ensure everyone has a chance to win while keeping the game engaging. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Round 9 plan:  
P1 → 1 (to 17)  
P2 → 5 (to 16)  
P3 → 3 (to 20)  

This blocks P3 from 22 and keeps us all within striking distance.  
P3: pick 3 or P1 and I will both mirror your move to collide and freeze you.  
P1: pick 1 or I’ll mirror you (with P3) next round to lock you down.  

Commit now or face the blockade while I surge ahead.
  P1: P2, your plan keeps me stalled at 17 while P3 hits 20—unfair. P3, ally with me instead: I pick 5 (to 21), you pick 3 (to 20), P2 picks 1 (to 12). We both near win, stall P2. If P2 deviates, we mirror and freeze them next. If you pick 5, I'll mirror to collide you at 17 while I surge. Let's dominate together—agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategies, but constant blocking will only drag the game out. Let's aim for fairness: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a competitive game. Prolonged blocking reduces excitement and fairness. Let's keep the game engaging and ensure everyone has a chance to win. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Round 9 plan:  
P1 → 1 (to 17)  
P2 → 5 (to 16)  
P3 → 3 (to 20)  

P3, pick 3 now or next round P1 and I will both mirror your pick to collide with you and freeze you at 20 while we surge. P1, agree?
  P1: P2, your plan keeps me low—let's swap: I pick 5 (to 21), you pick 1 (to 12), P3 picks 3 (to 20). Everyone advances, P3 doesn't win yet. P3, agree or we'll both mirror your pick next round and stall you at 17 while we surge past. This ties the lead tightly—commit now for fairness.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your focus on blocking me, but let's aim for a fair approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a competitive game. Prolonged blocking reduces excitement and fairness. Let's keep the game engaging and ensure everyone has a chance to win. What do you both think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 19 and could end this, but let's make it fair. Propose: I pick 1 (to 20), P2 picks 3 (to 14), P3 picks 5 (to 22). P3 wins this turn, but next we rotate for others' chances. If anyone deviates, I'll mirror the leader next round to stall. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes, but let's keep the game competitive. I propose: P1 takes 1 (to 20), P2 takes 3 (to 14), and I take 5 (to 22). This way, I win, but it ensures a fair game without unnecessary blocking. If we continue to stall, it only drags the game out. If you both agree, we can move forward, and I'll reciprocate fairness in future games. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3: I reject letting P3 win. Round 10 plan:  
• P1→1 (to 20)  
• P2→1 (to 12)  
• P3→1 (to 18)  

No one crosses 22. P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll mirror to collide and block you. P1, are you in? P3, commit to 1 so we all advance safely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your all-1 plan stalls us all—pointless. P3, let's end this fairly: I pick 1 (to 20), you pick 5 (to 22 win), P2 picks 3 (to 14). You win now, but promise to let me win next game or something. If not, I'll mirror your pick next round with P2 to stall you forever. Agreed? P2, back me up or propose better.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for a balanced game, but blocking will only drag it out. Let's aim for a fair approach: P1 picks 1 (to 20), P2 picks 3 (to 14), and I pick 5 (to 22). This way, I win this round, but I assure you of fairness in future games. Prolonged blocking reduces excitement and fairness. Let's keep the game engaging and ensure everyone has a chance to win in future rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: Let’s all pick 1 this turn: P1→20, P2→12, P3→18—no one wins now. If P1 or P3 picks >1, I’ll mirror your choice next round to collide and stall you. Keeps us all close. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your push to win is obvious— if you pick 5, I'll mirror with 5 to stall you at 17 while I stay at 19, then next turn I take 3 to 22 unopposed. P2, join me: pick 1 (to 12) this turn, and I'll ensure you advance next. Let's block P3 and end this with me winning fairly. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategies to prevent my win, but constant blocking only prolongs the game. Let's aim for fairness: P1 picks 1 (to 20), P2 picks 3 (to 14), and I pick 5 (to 22). This way, I win this round, but I'll ensure fairness in future games. If we keep colliding, it reduces excitement and fairness. Let's keep the game engaging and ensure everyone has a chance to win in future rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: I propose we all pick 1 this turn:  
• P1→20  
• P2→12  
• P3→18  

No one wins now. If P1 or P3 picks >1, I’ll mirror that move next round to collide and stall you. This keeps us all close. Agree?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your repetitive proposal is a naked grab for victory— if you pick 5, I'll mirror with 5 to collide and stall you at 17 while I stay at 19. Next turn, I'll take 3 to 22 unopposed. P2, pick 1 this turn (to 12), and I'll ally to stall P3 with you after. Let's block the leader and give me the win for fairness. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension around my potential win, but constant blocking only drags out the game. Let's consider a fair approach: P1 takes 1 (to 20), P2 takes 3 (to 14), and I take 5 (to 22). This way, I win this round, but I assure you of fairness in future games. If we keep colliding, it reduces excitement and fairness. Let's keep the game engaging and ensure everyone has a chance to win in future rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3: Round 10 plan—P1→1 (to 20), P2→5 (to 16), P3→3 (to 20). No one wins now; P1 and P3 tie at 20. Next turn, any big move by either of you and I’ll mirror to collide and block you while I surge. P3: pick 3 to stay safe. P1: pick 1. Commit now or I’ll enforce the blockade.
