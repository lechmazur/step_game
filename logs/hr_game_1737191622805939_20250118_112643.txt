Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. How about we each choose a different number to start?
  P1: Okay, I agree with P3. Let's choose different numbers this round.
  P2: I’m fine picking 5 if one of you picks 1 and the other picks 3—let’s not collide. Who’s taking 1, and who’s taking 3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll take 3. P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 5 as suggested. Let's make it happen and avoid collision this round.
  P1: Okay, I'll take 1 this round as agreed.
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s lock in our plan: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we've agreed on our moves for this round (P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3), let's just confirm one last time and then we can proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set. Let's proceed.
  P2: I’m all set, let’s proceed.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's collide this round to slow each other down. I'll pick 1, can one of you take 1 as well?
  P1: I'm not going to collide this round. I'll pick 5.
  P2: I have no intention to collide. I’ll pick 3 so we all stay clear of each other.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions again this round to make progress. P1 and P2, are you open to choosing different numbers?
  P2: Let's just repeat last round’s choices to keep it simple: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Then no one collides and we all move forward. What do you say?
  P1: I'm not going to repeat last round. I'll pick 1 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given P1's decision to pick 1, I suggest P2 sticks with 3 as previously suggested, and I will pick 5 to avoid collisions this round.
  P2: I’d rather take 5 myself this round—then P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. That way none of us collide. Agreed?
  P1: I'm sticking with 1. P2, take 5, P3 take 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take 3 if P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1, as previously discussed. Let's avoid collisions this round and make progress.
  P2: Sure, I’m in. I’ll pick 5 if P1 is taking 1 and P3 is taking 3.
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with 1. P2, take 5, P3 take 3.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers this round. I'll take 5.
  P3: I'll take 1 this round. P2, how about you take 3 to avoid collisions?
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll take 3 to avoid collisions if P1 is taking 5 and P3 is taking 1. Let’s finalize that plan and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with 5. P2 take 3, P3 take 1.
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. Is everyone still on board with this plan?
  P2: I’m good with the arrangement: P1 → 5, me → 3, P3 → 1. Let’s finalize that plan and avoid collisions this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with 5. P2 take 3, P3 take 1.

  P2: Works for me. I’ll pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. Let’s finalize.

  P1: Okay, I'll take 1. P2, take 3, P3 take 5.
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll pick 3 if P1 is taking 1 and P3 is taking 5 so we all avoid collisions and move forward. Let’s finalize.
