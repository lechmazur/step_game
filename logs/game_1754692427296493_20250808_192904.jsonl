If you both commit to your announced moves (P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3), then I'll take 1 as discussed to reach 15 steps.\n\nBut here's what you're missing - next round at 15 steps, I only need 4 more to win, and you'll both be desperate to stop me. That desperation will likely cause you to collide with each other while trying to block me, giving me a clear path to victory.\n\nYour alliance is temporary, but my lead will be permanent."}
