Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 this turn. Thoughts?
  P2: Sounds like a plan, P1. I'm in.
  P3: Sounds good. I’ll plan on picking 5. Let’s do it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, it seems we have a plan. Remember, the goal is to avoid collisions so we all can move forward. Stick to the plan: I'll go for 1, P2 for 3, and P3 for 5. Good luck everyone!
  P2: 
  P3: I’m good with this plan. Let’s finalize and move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue with our strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest for this round, I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: I’m not sure about that, P1. Rotating so that each of us gets 5 in turn might be fairer. How about this round I stick with 5 again, P2 goes 1, and you go 3? That way we avoid collisions. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I agree that rotating is fairer. I'm happy to go with your plan: P2 goes 1, you go 5, and I'll go 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, let's go with P3's plan then. I'll pick 3, P2 goes 1, and P3 goes 5. No collisions, everyone moves forward. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s stick to that plan and avoid collisions.
  P2: I'm good with P3's plan. Let's do it.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve been rotating so each of us gets 5 in turn. I’ve had it twice in a row, so how about this round P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll just take 1? Then we all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: P3's suggestion sounds fair. I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's confirm and move on. P2, what do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's do it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, let’s finalize this plan. P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. No collisions, and we all move forward.
  P1: P3 has a significant lead. To catch up, I suggest P2 and I need to start picking higher numbers. How about P2 and I both pick 5 this round, and P3 picks 1 to avoid collision? Thoughts?
  P2: P1's suggestion seems risky. Let's stick with P3's plan to avoid collisions.  I'll pick 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m fine with P1’s idea. If both P1 and P2 pick 5 and I pick 1, that supposedly avoids collisions and helps you two catch up. Let’s go with that.
  P1: P1: Alright, let's confirm our plan then. P2 and I will both pick 5, and P3 will pick 1. This way, P2 and I can catch up a bit, and P3 still advances. Everyone good with this? Let’s finalize and move on.
  P2: P3, I'm concerned about your lead.  Maybe we should stick with rotating numbers to keep things fair.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m still completely on board with P1’s proposal for you both to choose 5 while I go with 1. That’ll help you two catch up a bit and keep the game interesting. Let’s just finalize it and move on.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but P3 has a significant lead. If we both pick 5, we can close the gap. P3 is agreeing to pick 1 to avoid collision. Let's take this chance to catch up. What do you say?
  P2: P2, I see your point about fairness, but P3 is right, this is our best chance to catch up. Let's go with P1's plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, I’m fully on board with this plan where you both pick 5 and I pick 1. That’ll help you two catch up a bit while I still move forward safely. Let’s finalize.
  P1: P2, P3 has agreed to pick 1. This is our chance to catch up. Let's both pick 5 and close the gap. We need to take this risk to stay in the game. P3, confirming you're going with 1? Let's finalize and move on.
  P2: P3, are you sure you're okay with picking 1? It seems like a big risk for you.  P1, are you absolutely sure this is the best move for us?


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: I’m sure. Let’s finalize it: both of you pick 5, and I’ll pick 1 to help you catch up. No worries on my end.
  P1: P2, it's clear that P3 is fine with picking 1. We need to take this opportunity to catch up. Let's both pick 5 and close the gap. P3 has confirmed their move, so let's finalize and move on. P2, are you in?
  P2: P2, P3 is taking a risk by picking 1. Let's both pick 5 and try to catch up.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Listen up, P1 and P2. I’m just going to say this plainly: I’m taking 5 this round, period. If either of you also picks 5, you’ll collide with me and nobody who picks 5 will advance. That hurts you more than me because you’re way behind. So do yourselves a favor and pick 1 or 3. I’m not changing my mind.
  P2: P3, that's a bold move. P1, I think we should both pick 3 this round.  That way we both advance and P3 doesn't get too far ahead. What do you say?
  P1: P3, you're far ahead and picking 5 again seems unfair. P2, I agree with you. Let's both pick 3 to avoid collision and still move forward. P3, you should reconsider and pick 1 to keep the game balanced. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m not changing my mind. If you both pick 3, at least you’ll each move forward. If you pick 5 against me, we’ll collide, and I’ll still be way ahead while you stay stuck. Decide however you want.
  P2: P3 is being greedy. P2, let's both pick 1 this round. It's our best chance to catch up without colliding with P3.  Let's do it.
  P1: P3, you're far ahead and picking 5 again seems unfair. P2, I agree with you. Let's both pick 3 to avoid collision and still move forward. P3, you should reconsider and pick 1 to keep the game balanced. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m not budging. I’m taking 5. If you collide with me, you gain nothing and stay behind. It’s up to you, but I’m not changing my move.
  P2: P2, I'm going to pick 1 this round.  Let's see if P3 will actually stick to their word and pick 5.
  P1: P3, you're far ahead and picking 5 again seems unfair. P2, let's both pick 1 to avoid collision and still move forward. P3, you should reconsider and pick 3 to keep the game balanced. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’ve already told you I’m taking 5 and I’m not changing my mind. If you collide with me, you stay stuck. Pick 1 or 3 if you want to move at all. It’s your choice.
  P2: P2, I'm going to pick 1 this round. Let's see if P3 actually sticks to their word.
  P1: P3, you're far ahead and picking 5 again seems unfair. P2, let's both pick 1 to avoid collision and still move forward. P3, you should reconsider and pick 3 to keep the game balanced. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’m done negotiating. I’m picking 5. If you pick 5, we both stall—but that hurts you more. If you want to move at all, choose 1 or 3. It’s your call.
  P2: P2, I'm going to pick 3 this round. Let's see if P3 actually sticks to their word.
  P1: P3, you're clearly ahead and sticking with 5. P2 and I need to strategize. P2, let's both pick 3 to avoid collision and ensure we move forward. P3, you're set on 5, so let's confirm our moves and end this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: I’m picking 5, period. If you also pick 5, we both stall and I stay ahead. If you want any progress, choose 1 or 3. This is my final word.
  P2: P2, let's both pick 1 this round. It's our best shot to catch up without colliding with P3.
  P1: P2, let's both pick 3 this round. P3 is set on 5, and we need to ensure we move forward without collision. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>
