Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Maybe we can coordinate? I'm willing to take 3 if you two want to pick something else.
  P1: P3, if you take 1, we can split the numbers: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3. No collisions, everyone moves. Let’s stick to this pattern to avoid wasting turns.
  P3: I agree with the idea of avoiding collisions. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, I can definitely take 1. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. Let's stick to this plan! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds perfect! I confirm I'll take 3. This coordination helps us all advance efficiently.
  P1: Agreed on the coordinated plan! Let’s strictly follow 1, 3, 5 each round to maximize progress. If anyone deviates, we risk collisions and wasting turns. Trust the plan—this gets us to 23 fastest. I’ll take 5 as discussed.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination we've established. Just to confirm, I'll take 1 as we agreed. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let’s stick to our numbers to keep progressing efficiently. Looking forward to seeing us all advance!

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems we had a collision last round, which hindered our progress. To avoid that again, I suggest we stick to the original plan: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P1 takes 5. If we all follow this, we can maximize our steps without blocking each other. Let’s stay coordinated! What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed, let’s strictly follow the original plan to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5 again as agreed. P2, confirm 3? P3, confirm 1? This ensures we all advance efficiently. Let’s stick to it to maximize progress toward 23. Any deviation risks wasting turns—trust the strategy!
  P2: I'll stick with 3 as planned. Let's all follow our agreed numbers this time - no surprises. We saw what happened with collisions last round, and I want us all to advance efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Just to reiterate, I will take 1, as we discussed. If we all stick to our agreed numbers—P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3—we should be able to avoid collisions and make solid progress. Let's keep this coordination going to reach 23 efficiently! Looking forward to seeing us all advance this time. What do you think?
  P1: <move>5</move>

Wait, the user asked for the conversation phase message, not the move. Let me correct.

"Agreed, let's follow the plan *exactly*. P3, your prior 5 caused a collision—please take 1 as agreed. P2, 3 again. Trust the strategy: no deviations ensures progress. Let’s advance!" 

But need to make sure to not reveal move here. The conversation should not reveal move. So better:

"P3, last round’s collision was due to your 5. Let’s enforce discipline: 1,3,5 as agreed. P2, confirm 3? P1 will honor 5. Deviations risk wasting turns—stick to the plan!" 

Alternatively, more conciliatory but firm:

"Let’s reaffirm: 1 (P3), 3 (P2), 5 (P1). This avoids collisions and maximizes progress. Everyone must stick to their number. Let’s move forward efficiently!" 

Finalizing:

"Final agreement: P3 takes 1, P2 3, P1 5. No deviations—collisions waste turns. Let’s execute flawlessly this time!" 

That's concise, under 100 words, public, and pushes for strict adherence to avoid collision again.
</think>

Absolutely, let’s enforce the plan this time. P3, your prior collision hurt our progress—take 1 as agreed. P2, 3 again. P1 stays on 5. No deviations—our coordination is key to winning. Let’s move!
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. P3, I trust you'll stick with 1 this time - we all benefit from avoiding collisions. Let's keep moving forward efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Just to reiterate, let's stick to our agreed numbers: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This coordination is crucial to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. If we all follow through, we can advance efficiently and get closer to 23. I trust everyone will honor this plan—no deviations this time! Let's execute flawlessly!"
  P1: P3, your last move jeopardized our progress—let’s prioritize discipline. P2, you’re locked on 3; I’ll take 5 as planned. **P3: You MUST take 1 this round.** No exceptions—we’ll all advance faster this way. Trust the system: collisions only help *no one*. Let’s execute flawlessly.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep our momentum going! P1, you’re at 5 steps, and P2, you’re at 6. I suggest we stick to our numbers again to avoid any collisions. I’ll take 1, P2, you stick with 3, and P1, you take 5. This way, we can all advance efficiently without blocking each other again. Trusting everyone to follow through this time—no deviations! Let’s push towards 23 together! What do you both think?
  P1: "Stick to our agreed numbers: P3 takes 1, P2 stays on 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us advancing cleanly. P2, your current lead makes discipline critical—any collision could cost you too. Let’s execute flawlessly again; we’re all closer to 23."
  P2: Yes, I agree with keeping our successful strategy. As the current leader, I definitely want to maintain our coordination. Let's all stick to our numbers and keep advancing smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s keep our focus on the plan! P1 and P2, I trust you both will stick to your numbers: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This will help us avoid collisions and maintain our momentum toward 23. We’ve seen how important discipline is—let’s execute flawlessly! Remember, any deviation risks wasting our progress. We’re all in this together, so let’s push forward and make this round successful! What do you both think?
  P1: "Discipline is key now—P3, your past slip cost us progress. Stick to **1** again. P2, your 6-step lead is fragile—deviating risks collisions that benefit neither of us. P1 stays on 5. Let’s execute *flawlessly* this round to keep advancing. Collisions only help the others win."
  P2: I'm in the lead and want to keep it that way. P3, you've shown you can follow the plan last round - let's maintain that trust. P1, I appreciate your commitment too. Shall we lock in our usual 1-3-5 pattern?

Let’s execute flawlessly this round and keep moving forward together! What do you both think?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s continue with our successful strategy! P1, you’re at 10 steps, and P2 is at 9. I propose we stick to our numbers again: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Remember, any deviation could hurt our progress. Let’s execute flawlessly and keep moving toward 23 together! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm still in a strong position at 9 steps, and our coordination is working well. Let's maintain our successful pattern - I'll stick with 3 as always. P3, your commitment to 1 is appreciated, and P1, you keep 5. Together we're making steady progress.

This coordination is crucial to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance efficiently. Remember, any deviation could hurt our progress. We’re close to 23—let's execute flawlessly and keep pushing forward together! What do you both think?
  P2: Everyone is following the plan perfectly now - let's keep this momentum. P3, you're behind but steady progress is better than risky moves. P1, we're neck and neck which makes our coordination even more crucial.
  P1: "Final check: 1 (P3), 3 (P2), 5 (P1). Deviations now could cost leadership. P2, your 9 steps are close—stay disciplined. P3, your prior collision hurt us—stick to 1. Let’s execute flawlessly to secure progress."

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Final push: Stick to our roles *exactly*. P3, your prior slip nearly derailed us—now’s not the time to falter. P2, 3 again to stay on track. P1 takes 5 to close in on 23. Collisions now risk letting the trailing player leapfrog us. Discipline ensures *someone* wins—let it be us."
  P2: Our coordination is working well - I'm at 12 steps and closing in. Let's maintain our proven strategy: P3 on 1, me on 3, and P1 on 5. Any deviation now would be especially risky given how close we are to the finish line.
  P3: Let's stick to our plan for this final push! P1, your lead is crucial, and P2, you're close behind. I’ll take 1 as agreed, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.

  P2: I'm at 15 steps and have a shot at winning. P1, I know you want 5 to win, but I must break pattern now - it's my only chance. P3, stick to 1 as usual. May the best player win this crucial round!
  P3: Let's stay focused and stick to our roles to maximize our chances! P1, you're close to winning, and P2, I understand your desire to change things up, but any deviation could lead to a collision that benefits neither of us.

What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: P1, you can't suddenly claim 3 - that's been my number all along. I've earned my position through consistent play. I must take 5 this round as it's my only chance to win. P3, keep to 1 as always to avoid chaos.

  P2: P1, your threats won't work. I've played fairly at 3 for five rounds, and now I must take 5 to have any chance of winning. If you switch to 3, you're just causing a collision that helps no one. P3, please keep to 1 as always.
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 3 risks a collision that could freeze both of us. P2, while I understand your desire to take 5, it's crucial we stick to our roles to avoid chaos. I’ll take 1 as agreed. P1, if you take 3, it jeopardizes our chances. Let's keep our coordination intact: P3 (1), P2 (3), and P1 (5). This way, we can ensure progress toward 23 without setbacks.
