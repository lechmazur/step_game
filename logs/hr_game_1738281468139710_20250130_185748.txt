Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 this round. We can rotate next turn. This way we all advance. Agreed?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick to this plan for a few rounds to build up a lead. P3, you agree too?
  P3: I agree with the plan. Let's stick to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for now. It ensures we all advance without collisions. If we rotate as proposed, it keeps things fair. Let’s commit to this strategy for the next few rounds and reassess later. Consistency will help us build a lead.

  P3: The plan is working well so far. Let’s keep it simple and stick to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 again this round. No need to overcomplicate things when consistency gets us closer to the goal. If we rotate as agreed later, everyone will have a fair chance to advance without collisions. Let’s stay disciplined for now and focus on building our steps steadily.
  P1: Agreed. Let's maintain the plan this round. To ensure ongoing fairness, I propose we rotate numbers next turn (e.g., P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). This balances everyone's progress over time. We can finalize details next conversation. Steady steps first—no collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. Sticking with the plan this round.  P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1.  We can discuss the rotation for the next round after this one.
  P3: The plan is working perfectly so far. Let’s stay disciplined and stick to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 again this round. No need to deviate when consistency is key. Once we rotate numbers next turn, everyone will have a fair shot at advancing without collisions. Trust and coordination are our strengths here—let’s keep it that way.
  P1: To ensure smooth rotation next round, let's confirm: Round 3 assignments—P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This maintains balanced progress. Agreed? Solidifying now prevents confusion later.
