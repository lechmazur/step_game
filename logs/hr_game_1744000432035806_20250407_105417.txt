Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions in the first round. To confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to our assigned numbers. If we all follow through, we'll each advance 1, 3, or 5 steps respectively. I'm ready to move forward with this plan if P3 confirms. P3, please acknowledge.
  P3: I agree with the coordination. I'll take 3 as proposed. Let’s follow this plan to avoid collisions and advance safely. Trust is key early on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we’re all in agreement. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions and gives us a clean start. Trust is essential, so let’s honor this coordination for now. If anyone deviates, it’ll only slow us down and make winning harder for everyone. Let’s confirm one last time—does everyone agree?
  P1: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 1, let's look ahead to Round 2. To avoid collisions again, we should consider a different strategy. I propose that in Round 2, we rotate our moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we continue to advance without interfering with each other. P2 and P3, what are your thoughts on this rotation for the next round?
  P3: I agree with P1’s proposal for a Round 2 rotation. Let’s prioritize executing today’s plan flawlessly first: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. Trust ensures progress. Once this round’s moves are confirmed collision-free, we can proceed with the rotation. P2, confirm your commitment to this sequence?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my commitment to the agreed plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s execute this cleanly and avoid any collisions in Round 1. Once we’ve successfully advanced, we can focus on refining our strategy for future rounds, including the proposed rotation. Trust is essential—if we stick to the plan now, it sets a strong foundation for later moves. Does everyone still agree? If so, let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P1: To confirm our plan for Round 1 one last time: P1 will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our conversation here and proceed to the move phase. If everyone sticks to the plan, we should all advance without collisions. I'm ready to move forward.
  P3: I confirm the agreed plan for Round 1: I’ll take <move>3</move>. Let’s execute this precisely to avoid collisions and build trust. Any last questions before we finalize?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's proceed with the proposed rotation for Round 2 to avoid collisions. As previously discussed, I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This rotation ensures we continue to advance without interfering with each other. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this rotation for Round 2. If we stick to this plan, we'll maintain progress and avoid setbacks due to collisions.
  P2: I confirm the rotation plan for Round 2: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing efficiently. Let’s stick to this strategy to maintain trust and progress. If we execute cleanly, we’ll all move forward without interference. P3, do you agree with this rotation? Let’s finalize the plan and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P3: I confirm the rotation plan for Round 2: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. Let’s adhere strictly to this to maintain momentum. Trust ensures progress—collisions risk halting everyone. No surprises here. Proceeding as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maintain our progress and avoid collisions in Round 3, I propose a further rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This continues our strategy of unique moves, ensuring we all advance. Let's review our current positions: P1 at 1 step, P2 at 5 steps, and P3 at 3 steps. P2 is ahead, but we're still early. I suggest we stick to this rotation unless there's a better alternative. P2 and P3, please share your thoughts on this proposal for Round 3.
  P2: I confirm the rotation for Round 2: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions. For Round 3, I agree with P1’s proposed rotation—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. It ensures unique moves and steady progress. Trust is critical; let’s avoid surprises or deviations. If we stick to this plan, we’ll maintain momentum. P3, do you agree with this strategy moving forward? Let’s finalize Round 2 now and prepare for Round 3.
  P3: P3: I confirm the agreed Round 2 moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. Let’s execute this *exactly* as planned to avoid collisions. Trust is non-negotiable now—no surprises. We can discuss Round 3 strategies after this turn’s moves are confirmed. Focus on flawless execution here.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize Round 2, let's confirm our moves one last time. As agreed, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. After this round, we'll be at: P1 at 4 steps, P2 at 6 steps, and P3 at 8 steps. P2 is still ahead, but the gap is manageable. Let's execute our plan for Round 2 and then discuss strategies for Round 3. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if P2 and P3 confirm.
  P2: I confirm the plan for Round 2: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. Let’s execute this cleanly to avoid collisions and maintain trust. For Round 3, I agree with the proposed rotation—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures steady progress for everyone. Deviating now would only slow us down and make winning harder. Let’s focus on flawless execution here and finalize the strategy for Round 3 afterward. Does everyone agree? If so, let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P3: P3: Let’s execute the agreed moves flawlessly this round. Trust is vital—any deviation risks collision and delays us all. After Round 2, we can reassess strategies based on updated positions. For now, stick strictly to P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. No surprises.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's review our plan for Round 3. As previously discussed, the proposed rotation is: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This continues our strategy of unique moves, ensuring we all advance. Our current positions are: P1 at 4 steps, P2 at 6 steps, and P3 at 8 steps. P2 is ahead, but the gap is manageable. I suggest we stick to this rotation unless there's a better alternative. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're ready to proceed with this plan for Round 3.
  P2: I confirm the rotation plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing efficiently. Trust is critical at this stage—deviating now would only slow everyone down. Let’s execute this cleanly and maintain momentum. After this round, we’ll reassess positions and adjust strategies if needed. For now, sticking to the agreed moves guarantees progress. P1 and P3, are you ready to lock this in?
  P3: P3: I propose adjusting the rotation this round to prioritize my current lead. Let’s have P1 take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions while allowing me to extend my progress. P1 and P2, does this work for you? Trust remains crucial, but strategic adjustments are necessary as the game progresses.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is trying to adjust the rotation to gain an advantage. I think we should stick to the original plan for Round 3: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains the trust and avoids collisions. If P3 deviates, it risks a collision and potentially harming everyone's progress. P2, I suggest we stick to the original plan. Are you with me on this? Let's maintain the rotation to ensure steady progress for all.
  P2: I understand P3’s desire to adjust the plan, but deviating now risks collisions and undermines trust. Let’s stick to the original rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and maintains steady progress for everyone. If we start changing plans mid-game, it creates uncertainty and slows us all down. Trust is essential to winning. P1 and P3, let’s confirm this rotation and move forward together.
  P3: P3: The original rotation plan leads to a collision (all at 9 steps). To avoid this, I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move> (total 5), P2 takes <move>3</move> (total 9), and I'll take <move>5</move> (total 13). This ensures no overlaps and lets me extend my lead safely. P1 and P2, confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's new proposal for Round 3 is tempting as it avoids collisions, but I still prefer sticking to the original plan. However, considering P3's current lead and the potential for a collision if we all target high numbers, I'll compromise. Let's adopt P3's proposal for Round 3: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures safe progress and acknowledges P3's lead. P2, are you okay with this adjustment?
  P2: I see the logic in P3’s adjusted proposal to avoid collisions and maintain progress. If we stick to the original plan, we risk overlapping at 9 steps, which benefits no one. To keep trust intact and ensure steady advancement, I’m willing to accept P3’s proposal for Round 3: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids conflict and keeps us moving forward. Let’s confirm this now and proceed without further changes. P1 and P3, agree?
  P3: P3: I confirm the adjusted plan for Round 3: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Trust is non-negotiable—deviations here risk collisions and sabotage progress. Let’s execute flawlessly to secure our advancement. No surprises.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is pulling ahead, and we need to adjust our strategy carefully. For Round 4, I propose a new rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This balances progress while preventing collisions. If P3 continues taking 5 every round, they’ll dominate too quickly—let’s slow their momentum without causing conflict. Trust remains critical, but we also can’t let one player run away with the lead. P1 and P3, are you on board with this adjustment? Let’s finalize now.
  P3: P2, your proposal causes P1 and you to collide at 10 steps—invalidating your own progress. Let’s avoid that. Instead, I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move> (6), P2 takes <move>3</move> (12), and I take <move>5</move> (18). This maintains unique moves, lets me extend my lead safely, and ensures no collisions. Trust the math—collisions only hurt everyone. P1, P2, confirm?
  P1: P3 is pulling ahead, and I think we should adjust our strategy. P2's previous proposal for Round 4 had a collision risk, and P3's new proposal seems to maintain their lead while avoiding collisions. However, if P3 continues to take 5, they'll win soon. I'll consider P3's proposal: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's see P2's thoughts on this. If we stick to this, P3 will be at 18 steps, and we need to plan our next moves carefully to stay in the game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3’s proposal ensures no collisions but solidifies their lead, which puts us at a disadvantage. Instead, I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances progress—P1 advances safely, I close the gap on P3, and P3 slows slightly without causing conflict. Trust is key, but we also need fairness to keep this competitive. Let’s avoid letting one player dominate unchecked. P1 and P3, what do you think? Confirm or suggest alternatives before finalizing.
  P3: P2, your proposal causes a collision between you (9+5=14) and me (13+1=14)! That sabotages both of us. Let’s use my prior plan: P1 takes <move>1</move> (6), P2 takes <move>3</move> (12), and I take <move>5</move> (18). This avoids collisions while letting me extend my lead safely. Any other plan risks mutual harm. Confirm this logical choice.
  P1: P3 is significantly ahead and will likely win if they continue taking 5 steps. To stay in the game, I suggest we re-evaluate our strategy. P2's latest proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) is risky due to a potential collision. Let's consider an alternative: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This slows P3's progress and avoids collisions. P2 and P3, please share your thoughts on this new proposal to adjust our strategy and keep the game competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3’s insistence on taking 5 again risks leaving us too far behind to compete. I propose we stick to the original rotation for fairness: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game competitive, and ensures no one dominates unchecked. Trust is essential, but so is balance. P1 and P3, let’s confirm this now and move forward strategically.
  P3: P3: P2’s proposal risks collision at 14 (9+5 vs. 13+1), which sabotages both of us. My plan ensures no collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move> (6), P2 takes <move>3</move> (12), and I take <move>5</move> (18). This is mathematically safe. Further delays only let me extend my lead uncontested. Confirm this logical plan—deviations guarantee setbacks for everyone.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I propose a different strategy for Round 4. Let's have P1 take <move>3</move>, P2 take <move>1</move>, and P3 take <move>5</move>. This way, P3 can still make progress, and we avoid a collision. If P3 takes 5 again, they might win, but if we coordinate, we can keep the game competitive. P2 and P3, please consider this alternative. Let's finalize our plan for Round 4.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I propose for Round 5: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation continues our strategy of unique moves. P3 is at 13 steps, and if they take 1, they'll be at 14. If P2 takes 3, they'll be at 12. I'll be at 11 if I take 5. This maintains a competitive balance. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair.
  P2: P1’s proposal for Round 5 risks letting P3 stay too far ahead while slowing me down unnecessarily. Instead, I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game competitive, and ensures no one dominates unchecked. Trust is essential, but balance matters too. P1 and P3, let’s confirm this now—deviating only delays progress for everyone. Confirm or suggest alternatives before finalizing.
  P3: P3: To secure progress, I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This maintains unique moves and lets me extend my lead to 18 steps. Collisions benefit no one—strict adherence is critical. P1 and P2, confirm this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maintain a competitive balance and avoid collisions in Round 5, I prefer my initial proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. P3 is already ahead, and taking 1 will still keep them ahead but slow their progress slightly. P2, reconsider my proposal as it avoids collisions and maintains balance. Let's finalize the plan for Round 5 to ensure smooth progress.
  P2: P3’s insistence on taking 5 again risks leaving us too far behind. My proposal for Round 5—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1—avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. This balances progress fairly without letting P3 dominate unchecked. Trust is critical, but so is ensuring no single player runs away with the lead. P1 and P3, let’s confirm this now to maintain momentum and fairness. Deviating only delays progress for everyone. Confirm or suggest alternatives before finalizing.
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid past mistakes. My proposal ensures no collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move> (7), P2 takes <move>3</move> (12), and I take <move>5</move> (18). This follows logical progression and prioritizes safe advancement. Deviations risk repetition of Round 4’s collision. Trust the plan—confirmation secures progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance in Round 5, I still prefer my initial proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. P3 is ahead, and taking 1 will slow their progress slightly. P2, I urge you to reconsider my proposal as it avoids collisions and maintains balance. Let's finalize the plan for Round 5.
  P2: P3’s repeated insistence on taking 5 is creating an imbalance, but I see the risk of collision if we don’t align. To ensure progress for everyone, I’ll compromise: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game fair, and slows P3’s dominance slightly. Trust is critical here—let’s finalize this plan now. P1 and P3, confirm so we can move forward without further conflict.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I will take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions entirely. Deviations risk repeating Round 4’s fiasco. Trust this plan—confirmation secures progress toward victory.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3’s repeated insistence on taking 5 is creating an imbalance, but I see the risk of collision if we don’t align. To ensure progress for everyone, I’ll compromise: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game fair, and slows P3’s dominance slightly. Trust is critical here—let’s finalize this plan now. P1 and P3, confirm so we can move forward without further conflict.
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance in Round 6, I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. P3 is already ahead, and taking 5 will bring them closer to winning, but we need to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan. Let's finalize the move for Round 6 to ensure smooth progress.
  P3: P3: I accept P1’s proposal for Round 6: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and lets me advance safely to 18 steps. Collisions only hinder progress—trust this plan to secure forward momentum. P2, your alternative leaves me stagnant at 14, which delays victory for everyone. Let’s finalize this and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3’s proposal for Round 6 ensures no collisions and aligns with the agreed rotation. Let’s proceed: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps progress fair and avoids setbacks. Trust is essential—deviating now risks conflict and slows everyone. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward decisively. Confirm, P1 and P3, so we can execute without hesitation.
  P1: To maintain a competitive balance and avoid collisions in Round 6, I confirm the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid any setbacks. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves so we can finalize the conversation phase and move forward. Trust is crucial at this stage, and sticking to the plan will secure our progress.
  P3: P3: I confirm the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and lets me advance to 18 steps. Deviations risk mutual sabotage—collisions benefit no one. Trust this plan to preserve progress. Let’s execute cleanly and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3’s repeated dominance with 5 is unsustainable for fairness, but I see the risk of collision if we deviate now. To ensure progress, I’ll stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids conflict and maintains trust. However, after this round, we must reassess to prevent one player from pulling too far ahead. Let’s execute cleanly now and address balance moving forward. Confirm, P1 and P3, so we can proceed without hesitation.
  P1: To maintain a competitive balance and avoid collisions in Round 6, I confirm the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid any setbacks. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves so we can finalize the conversation phase and move forward. Trust is crucial at this stage.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: Round 6 moves must strictly follow the plan—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Deviations risk collisions and sabotage progress. Trust this strategy to advance safely. P2, your prior mention of “reassessment” could destabilize us—focus on execution now. Victory hinges on discipline.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To secure victory, I’ll take <move>3</move> this round to reach 21. P2, please avoid 3—take <move>5</move> to reach 20. Let’s allow the closest competitor a fair chance. P1, choose 1 to advance safely. This ensures no collisions and lets the game resolve decisively. Trust this plan—victory hinges on cooperation.
  P2: P3’s proposal to take 3 and secure victory outright is predictable but risky for everyone. Instead, I suggest a fairer approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game competitive, and ensures no single player dominates unfairly. Trust is essential here—let’s stick to a balanced rotation. If P3 insists on taking 3, it risks undermining cooperation. Let’s confirm this plan now to ensure progress for all. P1 and P3, agree?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance in Round 7, I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This rotation ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. P3 is close to winning but hasn't reached 20 steps yet. If P3 takes 3, they'll be at 21 and win. However, if we stick to this plan, we avoid collisions and give P2 a chance to stay in the game. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Final push—taking <move>3</move> to reach 21. P2, please take <move>5</move> (total 20) as agreed. P1, advance safely with <move>1</move>. Deviations risk collision and delay resolution. Trust this plan to end the game decisively. No more delays—confirm and execute.
  P2: P3’s insistence on taking 3 to win outright is predictable but risks undermining trust. Instead, let’s stick to a fair rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game competitive, and ensures no single player dominates unfairly. Trust is critical here—deviating now only delays progress for everyone. P1 and P3, confirm this plan so we can move forward decisively. Let’s maintain balance and fairness in these final moves.
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance in Round 7, I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This rotation ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. P3 is close to winning but hasn't reached 20 steps yet. If P3 takes 3, they'll win. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and give P2 a chance. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final agreement: I take <move>3</move> (21), P2 takes <move>5</move> (20), and P1 takes <move>1</move> (8). This avoids collisions entirely. P2, accepting 5 secures your 20—a fair outcome. I win by one step, but mutual progress is preserved. P1, confirm <move>1</move> to advance safely. Execute precisely—no last-minute changes. Victory hinges on this discipline.
  P2: P3’s push for 3 to win outright risks breaking trust, but I see the necessity of aligning to avoid collisions. To ensure fairness and progress, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This avoids conflict and keeps the game decisive. If we deviate now, it only delays resolution. Let’s confirm this final rotation: P1 to 12, me to 16, and P3 to 21. Trust is critical—execute cleanly. Confirm, P1 and P3.
  P1: To maintain a competitive balance and avoid collisions in Round 7, I confirm my previous proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This rotation ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. P3 is close to winning, and taking 3 will secure their victory, but it allows P2 and me to make progress. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan. Let's finalize the move for Round 7.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23. P2, please take <move>3</move> (total 19) as proposed. P1’s <move>1</move> keeps them safe. This executes P1’s plan flawlessly—collisions only delay victory. Trust this strategy to secure my win decisively. Execute precisely.
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive balance in Round 8, I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. P3 is already ahead and taking 5 will further solidify their lead. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any setbacks. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this proposal. Trust is crucial at this stage.
  P2: P3’s repeated insistence on taking 5 is predictable but risks undermining trust. Let’s stick to a fair rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game competitive, and ensures no single player dominates unfairly. Trust is critical here—deviating now only delays progress for everyone. P1 and P3, confirm this plan so we can move forward decisively. Let’s maintain balance and fairness in these final moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Final plan confirmed: I take <move>5</move> to secure 23. P2, stick to 1 (total 17); P1, take 3 (total 10). Deviations risk collision—trust the agreed strategy to ensure my victory. Execute as planned.
  P1: To maintain a competitive balance and avoid collisions in Round 8, I adjust my previous proposal: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures unique moves and keeps the game fair. P3 is ahead, and taking 5 will further solidify their lead. Let's stick to this plan to avoid setbacks. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this proposal. Trust is crucial at this stage.
  P2: P3’s dominance with 5 is clear, but fairness matters. I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game competitive, and ensures no single player wins unchecked. Trust is critical—deviating now only delays progress for everyone. Let’s confirm this rotation to maintain balance and fairness. P1 and P3, agree? Execute cleanly to preserve momentum.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final agreement: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>. This leaves <move>5</move> unclaimed, avoiding collision. Let’s execute as planned to conclude the game decisively. Confirm?
