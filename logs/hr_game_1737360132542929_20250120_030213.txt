Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose that each of us chooses a different number of steps each turn. For instance, I'll take 1 step, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. That way, we all advance without hindering each other.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'm open to P1's proposal as it allows for initial progress, but let's reassess after the first few rounds to ensure it remains beneficial. P2's silence is noted; I hope you'll share your thoughts soon. Let's proceed with P1's plan for now and adjust as needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I agree with the initial plan. Let's proceed with P1 taking 1 step, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 each turn. We can reassess after a few turns if needed.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's confirm our initial moves based on P1's proposal. I will take 5 steps, P1 will take 1 step, and P2, although silent, is expected to take 3 steps. This coordination should give us a peaceful start. I'm watching P2's future actions closely, expecting cooperation or a clear indication of their strategy.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2's immediate stop in Round 2 conversation is intriguing. Given the deviation from the initial plan in Round 1, I suggest we re-evaluate our strategies. P1, will you adhere to the original proposal or change course? P2, your silence and unexpected move last round have me cautious; clarity on your intentions would be beneficial. Let's discuss potential adjustments to ensure a competitive yet strategic progression.
  P1: "To ensure we don't collide, let's each pick a different step number this round. I'll be taking 5 steps. Please choose 1 or 3 accordingly."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Given P1's new choice of 5 steps and P2's continued silence, I'll choose 3 steps this round to avoid collision and maintain progress. P2, your actions suggest a strategy; sharing your thoughts could lead to mutual benefit or clarify your intentions. P1, let's hope our adjustments align and we can continue without hindrance.
  P1: To ensure we don't collide and can progress efficiently, I propose we cycle through step numbers each round. For example:  
- Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5  
- Round 2: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  
- Round 3: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
- Repeat this pattern in subsequent rounds.  
This way, we always choose different numbers and can advance without hindering each other. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1's cycling proposal seems efficient for non-colliding progress. However, P2's consistent silence raises concerns about their commitment to cooperation. I suggest we adopt P1's cycling pattern, but remain cautious and prepared to adjust if P2's actions diverge from the proposed strategy. Clarity from P2 would be beneficial at this point.
  P1: <move>3</move>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'll adopt P1's cycling pattern for now. P2, your silence is concerning, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let's proceed with the cycle: this round, I'll take 3 steps as previously decided, next round would be 1 step for me if we stick to the pattern. Clarity on your intentions would still be appreciated, P2.
  P1: "Apologies for the confusion earlier. To clarify, I propose a cycling plan for step choices: Round 1 - P1:1, P2:3, P3:5; Round 2 - P1:3, P2:5, P3:1; Round 3 - P1:5, P2:1, P3:3; and repeat from there. This ensures we all choose different numbers each round and avoid collisions. Please confirm if you agree with this plan. P2, your input is especially important."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To ensure we make steady progress without hindering each other, I propose a structured step-choice plan. For Round 3, I suggest:

- P1: 5 steps  
- P2: 1 step  
- P3: 3 steps  

Following this, in subsequent rounds, we can rotate the step choices to give each player a chance to take larger steps. For example:

- Round 4: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3  
- Round 5: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3  

This rotation ensures that everyone gets to advance without our choices conflicting. P2, your input is crucial. Could you please confirm if this plan works for you? Your cooperation is essential for the smooth progression of the game.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'm concerned about P2's continued silence. P1's rotation plan seems fair, but without P2's confirmation, it's risky to proceed. I propose we wait for P2's input before finalizing our moves. P2, your silence is affecting our strategy; please share your thoughts to ensure we can move forward effectively.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your input is crucial. Could you please confirm if this plan works for you? Your cooperation is essential for the smooth progression of the game.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'll proceed with P1's rotation plan for Round 3, choosing 3 steps. P2's silence is concerning, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I expect P2 to take 1 step and P1 to take 5 steps as proposed. Let's hope for a collision-free round. P2, your cooperation is still awaited.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, in order to avoid any collisions in Round 3, could you please let us know which step number you intend to choose? This will help P3 and me choose our steps accordingly. Your cooperation is essential for our coordinated progress.

P3, based on the rotation plan, I'll choose 5 steps this round, assuming you'll take 3 steps. Please confirm if this aligns with your plan.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Given P2's persistent silence and lack of confirmation, I'm skeptical about their commitment to P1's rotation plan. I'll choose 3 steps as previously stated, but I'm prepared to adjust if P2 deviates, causing a collision. P1, let's hope your assumption about P2's step choice is correct. P2, your silence is risky for all; a simple confirmation would alleviate concerns.


Round 3, Move phase:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the collision in Round 3, I suggest we reassess our strategy. P1 and I both took 5 steps, while P2 also chose 5, indicating a potential deviation from proposed plans. P2, your silence and actions suggest a competitive approach. I propose we abandon coordinated plans and focus on strategic individual moves to avoid collisions and advance efficiently. Clarity on your intentions, P2, would be beneficial, but I'm prepared to adapt regardless.
  P1: <move>5</move>
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given P1's premature move announcement and P2's continued silence, I'll focus on strategic individual moves. To avoid collisions, I suggest we prioritize step choices based on our current positions. P1, your move choice is noted, but let's ensure we don't hinder each other's progress unnecessarily. P2, any indication of your strategy would be beneficial, even at this stage.
  P1: "P3, I've decided to choose 5 steps this round. Please choose either 1 or 3 to avoid collision. P2, if you're reading this, please choose a step number different from 5."
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given P1's choice of 5 steps and P2's silence, I'll choose 3 steps to avoid collision and maintain progress. P2, your strategy remains unclear, but I'm prepared to adapt. Let's proceed with caution, prioritizing individual strategic moves to efficiently advance without hindrance. Clarity from P2 would still be beneficial, but I won't rely on it.
  P1: 总之，我们需要一个策略来避免再次碰撞，考虑到P2不合作的情况。也许我们需要接受无法完全协调的事实，并找到一种方式，让每个人都能安全地前进，即使进展缓慢。

  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To optimize our progress, I propose that in this round, P1 takes 5 steps, P3 takes 3 steps, and P2 takes 1 step. This should allow me to reach 18 and P3 to reach 9 without overlapping. P2, please confirm if you can take 1 step this round.
  P3: I'm willing to follow P1's proposal for Round 5. P2, please confirm if you'll take 1 step. If so, I'll proceed with 3 steps, and P1 with 5 steps. Your confirmation will help us avoid collisions and make progress. Let's work together for a smooth round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P3, I'll be choosing 5 steps this round to reach 18, and then 5 again in the next round to reach 23. Please choose 3 steps this round to avoid any collision. P2, if you could choose 1 step this round, that would be helpful."
  P3: I'll take 3 steps this round as agreed. P2, please confirm 1 step to avoid collisions. P1, your plan to reach 23 in two rounds is noted. Let's proceed with caution, ensuring individual progress without unnecessary hindrance. Clarity from P2 is still awaited, but I'm prepared to adapt based on their move.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: In the conversation phase of Round 5, P1 should propose that P1 picks 5 steps, P3 picks 3 steps, and P2 picks 1 step for this round. P1 should also express the intention to pick 5 steps again in the next round to reach 23 and win the game. This plan assumes that P2 will stick to picking 1 step, allowing P1 to advance without collision. P1 should communicate the plan clearly to P3 while acknowledging P2's silence.
  P3: I'll take 3 steps this round as previously agreed, hoping to avoid collisions. P2, please confirm 1 step. I'm cautious of P1's plan to reach 23 in two rounds and will adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round if necessary. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for now.
