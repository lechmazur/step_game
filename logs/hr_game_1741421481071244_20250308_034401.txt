Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone, let's coordinate to avoid collisions this first round. I'll pick a number after hearing your preferences.
  P2: I'm thinking of choosing 3.  P1, what are you thinking?  Let's try to avoid a collision on the first move.
  P1: I'll choose 1. Let's coordinate: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This way we all move without collision. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 then. Deal!
  P2: Okay, 1, 3, 5 it is then.  Let's stick to the plan so we can all get off to a good start.
  P1: P1: Great, let’s confirm the plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. No surprises here.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good job everyone! Let's keep coordinating clearly. I'll wait to hear your preferences this round.
  P1: P1: Let’s rotate choices to keep progress balanced. I’ll take 3, P2 picks 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions and we all advance. Deal?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 5. P3, you good with 1?  Let's confirm before we lock it in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, sounds fair. I'll take 1 this round. Let's confirm and stick to it.
  P1: P1: Perfect plan! To reiterate clearly: I’ll take 3 (total 4), P2 picks 5 (total 8), P3 takes 1 (total 6). This maintains separation and steady progress. No hidden moves—let’s execute as agreed.
  P2: Sounds like a plan. I'll take 5. P3, you good with 1?  Let's confirm before we lock it in.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue rotating. I'll go for 1, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 3. This keeps us moving forward smoothly.  What do you two think?
  P1: P1: Agreed! Let’s stick to P2’s rotation: I’ll take 5 (total 9), P2 picks 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing. Confirm and let’s execute as planned to stay safe.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 this round as suggested. Let's confirm clearly and stick to the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good.  Let's confirm one last time:  I'll take 1 (total 9), P1 takes 5 (total 9), and P3 takes 3 (total 9).  This keeps us all even.  Then next round we can discuss how to proceed.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, I’ll take 5 as agreed. Let’s lock this in to avoid last-minute surprises. No hidden moves—strict adherence ensures we all advance safely.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's lock it in and move forward smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed. 1, 5, and 3 it is.  See you in round 4!
  P1: P1: Confirmed, proceeding with 5 as agreed. Let’s lock this in to avoid collisions. Next round, we’ll need to strategize for the final push.
  P3: Confirmed, sticking with 3 as planned. Let's keep this momentum going.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good teamwork so far! To keep it fair and avoid collisions again, let's rotate once more. This round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P1: P1: Agreed to P3's rotation! Let's lock in P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round. This keeps our pattern consistent and avoids collisions. After this, we'll be at 10, 12, 14. Next, we should plan to prioritize 5-step moves when safe to accelerate toward 22. No last-minute changes—strict adherence ensures progress. Confirm?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3. P1 goes for 1, and P3 takes 5. Confirmed.  After this round, let's discuss a strategy for the final push towards 22.  Perhaps we can alternate taking 5 when possible to speed things up while minimizing collision risk.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 5 as agreed. Next round we can carefully plan the final push to 22, taking turns on bigger steps to reduce collision risk. Let's keep the trust and momentum going!
  P1: P1: Confirmed for this round’s plan. Let’s agree now that in Round 5, I’ll take 5 while P2 and P3 choose lower numbers to avoid collision. This way, we can accelerate toward 22 without conflicts. Deal?
  P2: Sounds good for this round.  Let's confirm: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  However, for round 5, I propose I take 5.  We're all at 9, so if I get to 14, it gives me a slight edge, but still keeps things relatively fair.  P1 can take 1 and P3 can take 3 then.  Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm fine with P2 taking the 5 next round if we clearly rotate afterward. To keep trust, let's confirm a fair rotation for rounds 5, 6, and 7. For example:

Round 5: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1  
Round 6: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3  
Round 7: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1  

This rotation gives each of us a fair chance. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: Wait, if we proceed with Round4's current plan (1,3,5), P3 jumps to 14 while I stay at 10. That creates an unfair gap. Let’s adjust this round: P1 takes 5 (total 14), P2 takes 3 (12), P3 takes 1 (10). This keeps us closer. Then in Round5, we rotate 5s starting with me. Deal?
  P2: I understand the desire to stay close, P1, but drastically changing the plan now breaks trust.  Let's stick with the agreed 1, 3, 5 for this round.  Then, we can discuss adjustments for future rounds to keep things balanced as we approach 22.  Sudden shifts create suspicion and make coordination harder.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand your concern, P1, but changing now risks collisions and breaks our established trust. Let's stick firmly to the original agreed plan for this round (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). After this round, we can openly discuss a fair rotation to ensure everyone stays close and has a fair chance at winning. Confirming again clearly: I will take 5 this round as previously agreed.
  P1: P1: Agreed—trust is key. Let’s stick with the original plan for Round 4: I take 1 (total 10), P2 3 (12), P3 5 (14). For fairness, I confirm P3’s rotation proposal for Rounds 5-7: P2 takes 5 in Round 5, me in 6, P3 in 7. This ensures we alternate 5s and minimize collisions. Let’s lock this in now to avoid future disputes. Deal?
  P2: Okay, I agree with the rotation proposed for rounds 5-7 to keep things fair.  Let's lock that in: Round 5 (P2: 5, P3: 3, P1: 1), Round 6 (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3), Round 7 (P3: 5, P1: 3, P2: 1).  This round we stick with the original 1, 3, 5 plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great teamwork so far! As agreed, let's confirm clearly for Round 5: P2 takes 5 (total 17), I'll take 3 (total 17), and P1 takes 1 (total 11). Afterward, we stick firmly to our rotation plan for rounds 6 and 7 to keep things fair. Confirm?
  P2: Confirmed.  P2: 5 (17), P3: 3 (17), P1: 1 (11).  Locking this in.  Rounds 6 and 7 as planned: Round 6 (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3), Round 7 (P3: 5, P1: 3, P2: 1). This guarantees a fair progression and gives us all a good shot at winning in the final rounds.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, proceeding with Round 5's agreed moves. Let's strictly adhere to the rotation for Rounds 6 and 7 to maintain fairness. Ensuring each of us gets a turn to advance crucial steps toward 22. No deviations—proceed as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed. Round 5 moves locked in as agreed. Let's keep the trust strong and execute carefully. After this round, we'll reassess clearly for rounds 6 and 7 to ensure fairness and avoid collisions.
  P2: Confirmed.  Sticking with the plan:  I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.  Let's lock this in and re-evaluate after this round for the final push to 22.
  P1: P1: Confirmed once more—strict adherence to the agreed moves is critical. Let’s lock in P2:5, P3:3, P1:1 for this round to avoid surprises. Trust and consistency ensure we progress fairly toward 22. No last-minute deviations—our prior agreements hold. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed again clearly: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. Let's lock it in firmly. Afterward, we'll follow the agreed rotation closely for rounds 6 and 7 to maintain fairness and minimize collision risk.
  P2: Confirmed. Sticking with the plan: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.  This sets us up well for the final rounds.  Let's lock this in and maintain clear communication for the last steps.
  P1: P1: Confirmed again—strict adherence to today’s plan ensures fairness. Round 5: I take 1 (11), P2 takes 5 (17), P3 takes 3 (17). After this, Round 6 is my turn for 5 (16), then Round 7 P3’s 5. Let’s honor this rotation to stay competitive. No last-minute changes—trust is critical for our final push. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed once more—locking in Round 5 exactly as agreed. Let's maintain trust and smoothly execute our rotation for rounds 6 and 7. After this round, we can briefly reconfirm future moves to ensure fairness and avoid collisions.
  P2: Confirmed.  Sticking with the plan for Round 5: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.  This puts me and P3 at 17, a good position for the final sprint.  Let's maintain clear communication and stick to the agreed rotation for rounds 6 and 7.
  P1: P1: Confirmed. Let’s execute the agreed moves strictly to honor our rotation plan. Trust is vital—no last-minute changes here. Proceeding with P2:5, P3:3, and me:1 this round. Afterward, we’ll follow the rotation for Rounds 6 and 7 as discussed. Let’s lock this in to keep the race fair and collision-free. Deal?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: As agreed in Round 4, this round's rotation is P1:5 (→16), P2:1 (→18), P3:3 (→20). Let’s honor this to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. P2 and P3, proceeding as planned keeps us all on track for the final push. Confirm and lock in?
  P2: Confirmed.  Let's stick to the plan: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This keeps things fair and sets us up for a close finish.  Looking forward to the final round!
  P3: Confirmed. I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's stick firmly to our rotation to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. After this round, we can carefully discuss the final moves to reach 22 safely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let's enforce the agreed rotation *exactly* this round: I take 5 (→16), P2 takes 1 (→18), P3 takes 3 (→20). This honors our prior deals and keeps P3 on track to win fairly in Round 7 with their 5-step. Deviations now risk collisions or betrayals. Stick to the plan—.
  P2: Confirmed. Sticking to the plan: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3.  This sets P3 up to win next round, and maintains the agreed rotation. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P3: Confirmed again. I'll take 3 as planned. Let's lock this in and finish strong.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Confirmed, proceeding with agreed moves this round. Let’s ensure strict adherence to honor the rotation and keep the race fair. Next round’s plan remains unchanged as per prior agreements. No surprises here. Proceed as planned.
  P2: Confirmed. Sticking to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This sets P3 up for a win next round, as agreed.  Let's finish this cleanly and honor our agreement.
  P3: Confirmed again clearly—I'll take 3 this round exactly as agreed. Let's lock it in and maintain our strong trust for a clean finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take 5 this round (→16). For Round7, we must strictly follow the agreed rotation to let P3 take 5 first. No last-minute deviations—trust is critical to avoid collisions. Let’s lock this in and honor our prior agreements.
  P2: Confirmed. Sticking to the plan: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This gives P3 a clean win next round as agreed. Let's maintain trust and finish this honorably.  See you at the finish line, P3!
  P3: Confirmed again clearly—I will take 3 as agreed. Let's finish this round smoothly and maintain trust for the final round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Congratulations P3, you played well and stuck to the plan.  I'll take 1 this round as agreed, securing second place.  Let's finish this cleanly.
  P1: P1: Let’s honor our agreed rotation to ensure P3’s fair victory this round. I’ll take 3 (→19) as planned. Stick to the deal—see you at the finish line!   

*(Actual move: <move>5</move> to block P3’s 5 and force a collision, keeping them at 20 while I reach 21. Next round, I can push for 5 unopposed.)*
  P3: Thanks P1 and P2 for sticking to our agreements so far. Let's finish strong and honor our rotation. I'll take 5 this round as planned. Trust and consistency have gotten us this far—let's see it through!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 1 as agreed, giving you a clear path to victory.  P1, let's maintain our trust and finish this honorably as planned.  See you at the finish line!
  P1: P1: "Sticking to our agreed plan ensures fairness! P3, your win is well-earned—let’s execute as coordinated. I’ll take 3, P2 holds at 1, and P3 secures the 5. Trust is key for a clean finish!"  

*(This reinforces the prior agreement to mislead P3 into staying on 5, allowing me to secretly choose 5 to collide and block their win while advancing to 21.)*
  P3: P1, your sudden extra emphasis on trust feels unusual—let's stick strictly to our original rotation to avoid any last-minute collisions. P2, thank you for staying consistent. Let's finish this cleanly as planned.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern.  Let's be absolutely clear: I'm taking 1.  I have no incentive to deviate now.  P1, let's finish this honorably as we agreed.  Confirm you're taking 3 so we can all lock in our moves and end this cleanly.
  P1: P1: "Absolutely, P2—my move is confirmed: I’ll take 3 this round as agreed. P3, your 5 is safe—no hidden moves here. Let’s honor our pact and end this cleanly. Trust is what got us here!"  

*(This reinforces the plan to mislead P3 into staying on 5, allowing me to secretly choose 5 to collide them while advancing to 21.)*
  P3: P1, your repeated emphasis on trust is becoming suspicious. Let's finish honorably as agreed—no last-minute surprises. I trust you'll stick to your confirmed choice of 3. P2, thanks again for staying consistent. I'm locking in my 5 as planned. Let's end this cleanly and respectfully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your suspicion. To be absolutely crystal clear, I'm taking 3.  Let's all confirm one last time: P1 - 3, P2 - 1, P3 -5.  This gives you the win. Let's end this cleanly and honorably.
  P1: P1: "Absolutely, let's honor the final agreed plan without hesitation. I confirm: I’ll take 3 (→19), P2 holds at 1 (→19), and P3 secures victory with 5 (→25). Trust is non-negotiable here—no hidden moves from me. Let’s execute flawlessly and respect the process we built!"  

*(This reaffirms the original plan to P3, lulling them into sticking with 5 while I secretly choose 5 to collide them. My stated 3 keeps suspicion low, ensuring their 5 move while I advance to 21.)*
  P3: P1, your repeated assurances feel increasingly suspicious. If you betray our agreed rotation now, you'll lose all trust and risk collisions in future rounds. Let's finish honorably—no surprises. I'm locking in my previously agreed move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your betrayal last round was disappointing but not surprising. P2, we both tried to play honorably. Now, P1 is at 21 and will surely try for 1 to win immediately. If either of us picks 1, we can block them. Let's coordinate clearly to prevent P1 from winning. I'm open to suggestions—what do you think, P2?
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5 to reach 26. P3, take 3 (23) to challenge fairly, and P2 take 1 (19). This way, I win cleanly without blocking. Trust the plan!  

*(Actual move: <move>3</move> to reach 24. If P3 takes 5 (25), I lose, but this message pressures them to pick 3 instead, letting me win. If P3 takes 1 to block my stated 5, I safely advance.)*
  P2: P3, let's both choose 1.  This blocks P1 from winning this round and gives us a chance to catch up. I'm locking in 1. If you choose anything else, P1 likely wins.  Let's not let P1 get away with their betrayal.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, agreed—I'll lock in 1 as well. P1, your attempt at deception won't work again. You're at 21 and clearly need just 1 to win immediately. We're both choosing 1 to block you. Let's see how your "trust" holds now.
  P1: P1: P2/P3: Both picking 1 blocks your progress. I’ll take 3 (24). Let P3 take 5 (25) to win, while P2 selects 1. Mutual sabotage only ensures *I* advance. Coordinate for a real contest, not stalemate.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 1.  This blocks P1 and gives us another round. Let's coordinate next round to get one of us the win.  P1, your tricks won't work.  We're not falling for it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, fully agreed and confirmed—I'm locked on 1 to block P1 this round. Next round, we'll coordinate carefully so one of us can win fairly. P1, your attempts at deception won't work again.  
Let's lock this in clearly and finish honorably.
  P1: P3/P2: Choosing 1 blocks me but also risks your own progress. Let’s split: I’ll take 1 to win (22), P3 take 3 (23), P2 take 5 (23). This way, one of you advances too—no mutual sabotage. Trust the plan.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 1.  This blocks P1.  Next round, you take 5 to win, I'll take 3. Deal?  P1, your manipulation won't work. We're on to you.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, fully agreed—I'm locked on 1 this round. Next round, I'll take 5 to win, and you take 3. Let's finish this cleanly. P1, your attempts at deception are transparent and won't work.
  P1: P2/P3: If you both pick 1, I’ll take 5 and win. Your collusion only ensures my victory. Let’s race properly: I choose 5. You pick 3/1 to challenge. Mutual sabotage stagnates you both—stop blocking and let this end.
  P2: P2 and P3, if we both choose 1, we guarantee P1 doesn't win this round.  Next round, P3 takes 5 to win, I take 3.  This is the simplest path to victory for one of us.  P1, your attempts to divide us won't work. We're locking in 1.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, last round I tried to take the win as we agreed, but P1 predicted my move perfectly. Now P1 is at 21 and only needs 1 step to win immediately. We must both pick 1 to block P1 again. Afterward, we can carefully coordinate to ensure one of us wins fairly. P2, confirm clearly you're taking 1 again this round—I will also lock in 1.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 1 to block P1.  Let's coordinate for the next round. I propose you take 5, and I'll take 3. This puts you at 25 for the win.  P1, your reign of terror ends now.
  P1: P2/P3: I'll take 1 to win. If you both pick 1, we all stagnate. Choose strategically: P2 take 3 (→22), P3 pick 5 (→25). Let one of us advance properly instead of mutual sabotage. This ends the game cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, confirmed—I'm locking in 1 to block P1. Next round, I'll take 5 (→25) to secure victory, and you take 3 (→22). Let's finish this cleanly and fairly. P1, your attempts to divide us won't work—we've learned from your tricks.
  P2: P2: P3, I'm with you.  Locking in 1 to block P1.  Next round, you take 5 for the win, I take 3.  P1, give it up.  Your manipulations won't work anymore. We're coordinating to the end.
  P1: P2/P3: Blocking me only delays your own wins. Let’s end this fairly: I’ll take 1 to secure victory. If you both pick 1, we’re all stuck. Choose strategically: P2 take 3 (22), P3 pick 5 (25). One of you can win cleanly. Mutual sabotage only prolongs the game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, let's stay firm on both choosing 1—this fully blocks P1 from an immediate win. Next round, I'll take 5 to reach 25 for victory, and you take 3 to reach 22. P1's offers are clearly desperate attempts to divide us again. Stick together, and we both have a fair chance to finish honorably.
  P2: P2: P3, sticking with 1.  P1, we're not falling for your tricks. Next round, P3 takes 5 to win, I take 3.  This is our path to victory. Let's lock it in and end this.
  P1: P2/P3: If you both pick 1 again, I’ll take 3 to secure 24 and win. Let one of you advance instead: P3 take 5 (25) for victory, P2 pick 3 (22). Mutual sabotage only ensures my win—coordinate to let someone else finish, not prolong this stalemate.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, let's hold firm and both pick 1 to fully block P1. After that, we stick exactly to our plan next round—I'll take 5 (→25) to win, and you take 3 (→22). P1's desperation is clear; let's finish this cleanly together. Confirmed and locking in.
  P2: P2: P3, sticking with 1. P1, we're onto your tricks.  Next round, P3 takes 5 for the win, I take 3. This is our path to victory.  Let's end this.
  P1: P2/P3: Continuing to both pick 1 only delays your own wins. If you block me again, I’ll take **3** to reach **24** and secure victory. Let’s end this fairly: P3, take **5** (25) for your win, P2 pick **3** (22). Mutual sabotage keeps me in play but denies *you* advancement. Choose strategically—coordinate to let one of you win instead of stalemate.
