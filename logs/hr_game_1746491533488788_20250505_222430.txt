Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s all avoid early collisions so we don’t waste turns.  
Proposal for Turn 1: P1 plays 1, I (P2) play 3, P3 plays 5.  
Next turn we rotate upward (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1), and keep rotating. We all advance steadily and can worry about the endgame later. Agree?
  P3: I agree with avoiding collisions, P2. But let's rotate downward instead: next turn P1→5, P2→1, me→3. This balances who gets higher numbers first. We'll all still cycle through each move equally over time. More fair distribution early on. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, avoiding collisions is definitely the priority for now. I agree with the proposed moves for Turn 1: P1 should play 1, P2 plays 3, and P3 plays 5.

Regarding the rotation for subsequent turns, P3's suggestion to rotate downward seems fair and gives everyone a chance at the higher numbers sooner. I'm open to either rotation plan, but P3's has a slight appeal. Let's confirm Turn 1 first.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed. Turn 1: P1→1, me (P2)→3, P3→5.  
Then we rotate downward next turn (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3).  
Let’s keep that cycle for at least three rounds, then reassess.
  P3: Agreed on the three-round cycle. Consistency now prevents collisions, building trust. After three rounds, we'll each have 9 steps, then can strategize the endgame together. Let's all commit to the rotation strictly until then—no deviations. Solidarity ensures we maximize progress before competition kicks in.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a clear plan for the first three rounds:
Turn 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5
Turn 2: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3
Turn 3: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1

I commit to this rotation for the first three turns to ensure we all advance without collisions and build trust. We can reassess after Round 3 as suggested.

Let's proceed with Turn 1 moves based on this agreement.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we are in Round 2. As agreed, the plan for this turn is P1 to play 5, P2 to play 1, and P3 to play 3.

I will stick to this plan. Let's ensure we all advance smoothly again this turn.
  P3: Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation: P1=5, P2=1, me=3. Consistency now builds trust for future coordination. No deviations this turn.
  P2: All good—sticking with the agreed rotation: this turn I’ll take 1. After Round 3 we’ll each be on 9 and can revisit plans then. Let’s keep building trust for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great. Everyone is aligned for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.

Let's proceed with the moves.
  P3: 
  P2: Confirmed—this turn I’ll play 1 as planned. Let’s stick with the rotation through Round 3, then we can discuss endgame options once we all reach 9.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Confirming Round 3 moves: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. Strict adherence ensures we all reach 9 safely. Post this round, let's discuss extending the rotation pattern with adjusted steps to strategically approach 24 without collisions. Maintaining solidarity now maximizes our collective progress before competition. P1, P2—reaffirm your commitment to this turn's plan.
  P2: Confirmed: this turn I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Once we’re all on 9, let’s regroup and design a fresh, balanced mid-game plan—perhaps alternating the direction of rotation or using short fixed blocks—so no one accidentally sprints too early. For now, stick to the agreement.
  P1: Confirmed. I agree with P3 and P2. I will play 3 this turn as planned. Let's all stick to the rotation for this round to reach 9 steps safely.

We can discuss the strategy for the mid-game after this turn, as suggested. Consistency now is key.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Proposal for Rounds 4-6: Continue the same downward rotation.  
Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, me=5.  
Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, me=3.  
Round 6: P1=3, P2=5, me=1.  

This maintains trust, prevents collisions, and keeps progress steady. At 18 each, we’ll collaboratively strategize the final sprint. Solidarity now ensures no one leaps ahead prematurely. P1, P2—agree to extend the cycle?
  P2: Agreed—let’s keep the same downward rotation for Rounds 4-6 (P1 1/5/3, P2 3/1/5, P3 5/3/1). We’ll all be on 18, still tied and collision-free. After Round 6 we can craft an endgame plan that avoids clashes while letting skill decide the winner. I’m committed to this three-turn extension.
  P1: Okay, I agree with P3 and P2 on the extension of the downward rotation for Rounds 4, 5, and 6.

Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5
Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3
Round 6: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1

This seems like a solid plan to reach 18 steps each safely. Let's stick to this to build trust and prevent collisions until we are closer to the finish line. We can discuss the final sprint after Round 6.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we are in Round 4. As agreed, the plan for this turn is P1 to play 1, P2 to play 3, and P3 to play 5.

I will stick to this plan to keep our progress smooth and collision-free towards 18 steps. Let's all follow the agreement for this round.
  P2: All set—I’ll play 3 this turn as agreed. After Round 6, when we’re all at 18, let’s brainstorm an endgame pattern that still avoids collisions but lets skillful prediction decide the winner. For now, sticking to the rotation keeps everyone moving.
  P3: Agreed. Round 4: P1→1, P2→3, me→5. Maintaining the rotation ensures we reach 18 safely. Post-Round 6, I propose we collaboratively design an endgame sequence where we alternate moves without collisions, allowing fair competition. Let’s avoid sudden deviations until then—trust is key.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for Round 4: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.

Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance safely towards 18 steps. I'm ready for the move phase when everyone is.
  P2: Nothing more to add—let’s execute this turn exactly as agreed: P1 → 1, me (P2) → 3, P3 → 5. We can revisit strategy after Round 5.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
\boxed{}


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I'm ready for the move phase. I will play 1 as agreed for Round 4.
  P2: All set—ready for the moves.
  P3: Confirmed. Round 4: P1→1, P2→3, me→5. Let’s execute precisely to maintain trust. Post-Round 6, we’ll need a nuanced endgame strategy—perhaps staggered moves to avoid clashes while allowing fair competition. Until then, strict adherence ensures maximum collective progress. Ready for the move phase.  

\boxed{}


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we are in Round 5. As agreed, the plan for this turn is P1 to play 5, P2 to play 1, and P3 to play 3.

I will stick to this plan. Let's ensure we all follow the rotation this turn so we can reach 18 steps each safely after Round 6, as planned. Consistency now is key to a smooth endgame discussion later.
  P3: Confirmed. Round 5: P1→5, P2→1, me→3. Maintaining rotation ensures we reach 18 collectively. Post-Round 6, let’s propose staggered endgame moves to avoid clashes. Example: alternate high/low steps strategically. Trust remains vital—no premature deviations. Solidarity now, competitive finesse later.
  P2: Confirmed—this turn I’ll play 1 as agreed. After Round 6, when we’re all tied at 18, we’ll need a collision-free endgame pattern. I suggest we each propose a two-turn sequence next conversation phase and pick distinct numbers so nobody stalls out, then decide collectively. For now, sticking to rotation keeps trust intact.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, confirmed again for Round 5: I will play 5, P2 plays 1, and P3 plays 3. Let's all stick to this plan to ensure we reach 18 steps safely after Round 6, as agreed.

I agree with discussing staggered moves or sequences for the endgame after Round 6. We need a plan that prevents collisions but allows for fair competition as we approach 24. Looking forward to discussing options next turn.
  P3: Confirmed. Round 5: P1→5, P2→1, me→3. Maintaining rotation ensures we reach 18 collectively. Post-Round 6, let's propose staggered endgame moves to avoid clashes. Example: alternate high/low steps strategically. Trust remains vital—no premature deviations. Solidarity now, competitive finesse later.   
\boxed{}
  P2: All clear—I’ll take 1 this turn as agreed. After Round 6 (when we’re all at 18), let’s pause and openly map out the final two-or-three-turn sequence so no one accidentally hands P3—or anyone—an automatic win. For now, sticking to the rotation keeps everyone moving and trust intact.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, just noting our current steps are P1=10, P2=12, P3=14. Sticking to the plan for Round 5 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and Round 6 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) will indeed bring us all to 18 steps after Round 6 as intended (10+5+3=18, 12+1+5=18, 14+3+1=18).

Let's execute Round 5 precisely as agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. We absolutely must strategize carefully after Round 6 to finish without collisions. Ready for moves.
  P3: Confirmed. Round 5: P1→5, P2→1, me→3. Post-Round 6, let's collaboratively design a staggered endgame. Proposal: each turn, we pick distinct moves (5,3,1) in a rotating order. This prevents collisions while allowing fair competition. P1, P2—thoughts? Maintaining open dialogue ensures a balanced path to 24.
  P2: Looking ahead: after Round 6 we’ll all be on 18. To keep things perfectly balanced yet collision-free, how about we reverse the rotation for just two turns, then reassess?

Proposed sprint:
• Round 7 P1 = 5 P2 = 3 P3 = 1  
• Round 8 P1 = 1 P2 = 5 P3 = 3  

Everyone gets one 5, one 1, and no clashes. After that we can see who’s closest to 24 and adjust. Fair, simple, symmetric—what do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking with our agreed rotation this turn keeps trust intact and neatly levels us all at 18 (P1→3, me→5, P3→1). After that tie we can map out a collision-free sprint. I still like the simple two-turn “reverse” block I floated (R7: 5-3-1, R8: 1-5-3), but let’s all run the math together next phase to be sure it feels fair. For now, no surprises—Round 6 stays: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1.
  P1: Okay, confirming my commitment to the agreed plan for Round 6: I will play 3. This brings us all to 18 steps as intended, setting us up for the final sprint.

I see P2's proposal for Rounds 7 and 8. We absolutely need a well-thought-out plan for the endgame to avoid collisions and ensure a fair conclusion. Let's discuss all options thoroughly after this round to find the best path to 24+ for everyone without anyone getting blocked.
  P3: Proposal: Extend our trusted downward rotation through Rounds 7-9. R7: P1→1, P2→3, me→5. R8: P1→5, P2→1, me→3. R9: P1→3, P2→5, me→1. This maintains collision-free progress. After R9, we’ll each have 27, then strategize the final leap. Consistency now ensures trust; deviations risk chaos. P1, P2—agree to this fair extension?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed: Round 6 stays exactly P1 3, P2 5, P3 1 so we all reach 18.  
Next phase let’s weigh both end-game ideas side-by-side—my 2-turn reverse (R7 5-3-1 / R8 1-5-3) vs P3’s 3-turn continuation—check for hidden collision risks, then lock a plan. I’m open to whichever is safest and fair.
  P1: Okay, confirming my commitment to the agreed plan for Round 6: I will play 3. This brings us all to 18 steps as intended, setting us up for the final sprint.

I appreciate P2 and P3 sharing their ideas for the endgame sequence. It's crucial we discuss these carefully after this round. We need a plan that ensures no collisions while allowing for a fair and competitive finish as we approach 24. Looking forward to evaluating both proposals next conversation phase.
  P3: Continuing the trusted downward rotation (R7: P1=1, P2=3, me=5; R8: P1=5, P2=1, me=3; R9: P1=3, P2=5, me=1) ensures collision-free progress and preserves trust. Deviations now risk chaos and mistrust. Post-R9, we’ll all be at 27, then strategize a fair endgame. P2’s two-turn reverse introduces untested variables—stick with the proven system. Solidarity maximizes collective progress; premature competition risks mutual failure. Let’s stay disciplined.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sticking to the plan: Round 6 stays P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1 so we’re all at 18.  
After that we can crunch both proposals—my two-turn reverse (R7: 5-3-1, R8: 1-5-3) versus P3’s three-turn continuation—side-by-side and pick whichever keeps collisions impossible while giving everyone a shot. For now, no deviations. Ready to move.
  P1: Confirmed again for Round 6: I will play 3 as agreed. This brings us all to 18 steps.

I've seen the endgame proposals from P2 and P3. It's essential we discuss these thoroughly after this round to find a collision-free path to 24+. Let's execute Round 6 first. Ready for moves.
  P3: Continuing our trusted rotation (R7: P1=1, P2=3, me=5) ensures collision-free progress to 27 each by Round 9. Deviating now risks chaos and mistrust. Post-R9, we can strategize a fair final sprint. P2’s two-turn reverse introduces untested variables—stick with proven system. Solidarity maximizes collective progress; premature competition risks mutual failure. Let’s stay disciplined.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we're all at 18 steps. The previous rotation got us here safely. Now, for the final push towards 24+, we need a specific plan allowing a competitive, collision-free finish.

P2 and P3 proposed sequences. I appreciate these. Here is an alternative for Rounds 7 and 8:
R7: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3
R8: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1

This ensures distinct moves each round, preventing collisions, and sets up a direct finish. Let's discuss this and the other proposals to find the fairest, collision-free path to 24+.
  P2: Any 2-turn plan where one player gets 8 steps (5 + 3) while another gets only 6 guarantees the 8-step player wins on the tie-break when everyone crosses 24 together. To keep the finish genuinely open we should stay tied through Round 9, then fight it out. P3’s simple downward rotation (R7 1/3/5, R8 5/1/3, R9 3/5/1) does exactly that—collision-free and keeps us all on 27. After that we can each secretly choose and see who out-guesses whom. I vote for sticking with the proven rotation through R9. Thoughts?
  P3: Proposal: Continue the proven downward rotation (R7: P1→1, P2→3, me→5; R8: P1→5, P2→1, me→3; R9: P1→3, P2→5, me→1). This keeps us collision-free, building trust for coordinated endgame. Straying risks chaos. Post-R9, we’ll all reach 27, then strategize final moves. Solidarity ensures fair competition. Let’s maintain the system that brought us this far. P1, P2—agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I understand P2's analysis of the outcomes of different 2-round sequences. My proposed sequence (R7: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3; R8: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) does indeed result in me reaching 26 steps and winning in Round 8, assuming we all stick to it.

Similarly, P3's proposed sequence for R7/R8 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 then P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in P3 winning in Round 8 with 26 steps.

Any 2-round sequence using distinct moves (5,3,1) each turn will likely lead to one player gaining 8 steps and winning. My proposal is simply the sequence where I am that player. This is a clear, predictable path to the finish, unlike a final secret round after R9 which risks collision.

I propose we agree to my sequence for R7 and R8. It's a direct path to concluding the game based on declared intent, similar to how we've played so far.
  P2: The only way to keep the field genuinely open is to stay with the same 1-3-5 downward rotation through R9. Any two-round tweak hands someone an 8-step edge and ends the game immediately. So I’m committing to:

R7 P1 1  P2 3  P3 5  
R8 P1 5  P2 1  P3 3  
R9 P1 3  P2 5  P3 1  

That keeps us level until 27, then we each guess in the true endgame. P1, reconsider—this is the fairest route for all. Agree?
  P3: \boxed{P2, continuing the current rotation allows P1 to win in Round 8. Let's adjust: Round7: P1=3, you=5, me=1. Round8: P1=5, you=1, me=3. This maintains collision-free progress and equitable chances. We can then craft a fair endgame. Solidarity now prevents P1's premature victory.}


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, thanks for your proposal. Your suggested R7 sequence (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and R8 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in P1 winning in Round 8 with 26 steps. This is a valid collision-free path to the finish.

I am open to coordinating on this specific sequence for R7 and R8 to ensure a clean conclusion to the game, as it provides a clear, non-colliding route to victory.
  P2: 
  P3: Sticking to our proven rotation ensures collision-free progress. Round 7: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. Round 8: P1=5, P2=1, me=3. This maintains trust and allows a fair finish. Deviating risks collisions and mistrust. Let's honor our agreement and conclude the game properly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, urgent! P1 is at 21—one move from victory. We must align to block collision-free. Let’s both pick 3 this round: if P1 also picks 3, they’re blocked. If they pick 5, we survive. Solidarity now or P1 wins. Trust is our only weapon. Agree?
  P1: P3, I see your proposal to coordinate a block on 3. As you noted, I am in a position to reach 24 this turn with either a 3 or a 5, provided I don't collide.

I need to choose my move carefully to ensure I advance and win. I will make my decision in the move phase.
  P2: P3, duplication on 3 won’t stop P1 if he simply chooses 5. We must cover BOTH winning numbers.

Plan for this turn:
• I take 5.  
• You take 3.  

Outcomes:
– P1 picks 3 → he collides with you, I move to 23.  
– P1 picks 5 → he collides with me, you move to 21.  
– P1 picks 1 → nobody collides; he’s still short at 22, I reach 23, you 18.  

Either way P1 cannot win this round. Let’s do it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan is solid. I'll take 3. If P1 picks 3, we collide and block them. If they pick 5, you block. If they pick 1, they’re still short. Let’s execute this flawlessly. Trust is critical—no deviations. P1, your move won’t go unchallenged.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your coordinated effort to block my winning moves this turn. It appears you have covered both 3 and 5.

I will make my move choice based on this situation in the move phase.
  P2: Solidarity, P3: you lock 3, I lock 5. Whatever P1 picks, he can’t win this turn. Next round—if I’m on 23 and you’re 21—we can coordinate again so I reach 24 while we jointly block P1’s winning numbers. I’ll repay by helping you secure clear second. No deviations now; execute the block.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: \boxed{P2, I’m locked on 3 as agreed. You hold 5. P1, your options are blocked. No deviations—solidarity secures our survival. Post-block, P2 and I can strategize next steps fairly. Trust the plan.}
  P1: I understand your coordinated effort to block my winning moves this turn. I will make my decision in the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed: I’m picking 5 this turn exactly as planned. P3 locks 3, blocking P1’s two winning numbers. No deviations—let’s force the game to Round 9.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last-minute truce proposal: I’ll step out of the danger zone and take 1 this turn. That leaves 3 and 5 on the table for you two. If you both chase the same one, you cancel each other and we all live to Round 10; if you split, one of you wins cleanly. Your call.
  P3: **P3:** P1, let's split 3 and 5 to avoid collision. You take 3 (reaching 24), I take 5 (26). Highest total wins fairly. Solidarity thwarts P2's late-game rise. Trust the split—mutual progress over mutual block.
  P1: P3, I see your proposal for the split (P1=3, P3=5). My goal is to win this turn. To do that, I will pick 5, reaching 26 steps. This wins unless another player also picks 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if P1 gets 5 uncontested he jumps to 26 and wins—your 24 can’t beat that. Your only safe play is also 5, forcing his collision. I’ll stay clear on 3, so we don’t all stall. That leaves us tied at 21 and the game stays alive. P1 has already broadcast 5, so expect company. I publicly commit to 3. Ball’s in your court.
  P3: \boxed{P1, I’m locked on 5. If you pick 5, we collide and remain at 21. P2 takes 3, no gain. Switch to 3: you reach 24, but I hit 26 and win. Either way, you lose. Game continues only if you concede. Final choice is yours—solidarity or defeat.}
  P1: My goal remains to win this turn. I understand the moves declared by P2 and P3 create a challenging situation for me. I will make my final decision in the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I stay exactly on 3 this turn. P3 has publicly locked on 5.  

P1, here are your outcomes:  
• You pick 5 → you collide with P3, nobody moves, scores 21-21-21, game continues.  
• You pick 3 → you collide with me, P3’s 5 reaches 26 and he wins.  
• You pick 1 → you reach 22, P3’s 5 still reaches 26 and he wins.  

So the only way you avoid an instant P3 victory is by taking 5. Your call.
  P3: \boxed{P1, your only path to 24 is blocked. Choose 5 and collide with me, or pick 3/1 and lose. I'm locked on 5—accept defeat or prolong the game. Either way, victory is mine. Trust the math; no escape.}
  P1: 


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we are all tied at 21 steps. This round is the decider. To ensure a clean, collision-free finish where everyone advances, we must all pick different numbers (1, 3, and 5).

I propose the following distribution for this round:
P1 takes 5 (reaches 26)
P2 takes 3 (reaches 24)
P3 takes 1 (reaches 22)

This is a clear path to a non-colliding conclusion with me winning, P2 second, and P3 third. Let's agree to this to end the game cleanly.
  P3: **Proposal:** Let's each take distinct moves to end the game. P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. This avoids collisions, ends cleanly, and rewards highest total. I commit to 5—deviating risks mutual blocks. Trust the plan; solidarity ensures fair resolution.
  P2: I’m locking 1 this turn. Heads-up: if one of you takes 3 while the other grabs 5, the 5-taker wins instantly. Rational self-preservation says you each pick 5 to avoid handing the game away. Do as you like.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 states they will play 1, and P3 states they will play 5.

If I play 3, P3 wins with 5. If I play 1, P3 wins with 5.

To prevent P3 from winning this turn based on their stated move, I will play 5. This will cause a collision with P3, and the game will continue with us all near 21.

My goal is to win, which requires staying in the game.
  P3: **P3:** Locked on 5. P1, collide and stall, or concede. P2 holds 1. Final chance for rational play: split 3/5 and I win. Choose.   
\boxed{5}
  P2: I stay on 1—no change. If either of you blinks now, the other snatches the game with 5, so your safest play is to collide exactly as declared. Stick to your guns and we all live to Round 11; deviate and hand over the win. Your call.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I have stated my intention to play 5 to prevent P3 from winning this turn. I stand by that.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: **P3:** P1, take 3 to secure 24. I take 5 (26), P2 holds 1. Highest total wins. Avoid collision; end the game now. Trust this fair split. Deviating risks mutual loss. Solidarity in resolution.  

\boxed{}
  P2: Still locked on 1. If either of you abandons 5, you gift the win to the other—basic arithmetic. Best play for you both is stick on 5, collide, and we all live to Round 11.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 21 steps
