  P3: To keep making progress, I'm planning to take 5 again. What moves are P1 and P2 considering?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P3 is pulling ahead significantly, I think we need to slow them down. I suggest we both target 5 this round to create a collision. What do you say, P1?
  P1: Agreed, P2. P3, you've had a good run, but we can't let you get too far ahead. P2, let's both pick 5 this round to keep things balanced.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I understand your concern. To make things less predictable and keep us all progressing, how about I switch to 3 this round?  That way we can still avoid a collision and keep moving forward. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Don't try to negotiate, P3. You've gained too much of a lead. P1, let's stick to our plan and both pick 5 to force a collision. We need to work together to prevent P3 from running away with the game.
  P1: P2, your reasoning is solid—I'm sticking with our original plan. P3, it's nothing personal, just keeping the game competitive.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, if you are determined to pick 5, I will switch to 3 as I suggested before. I will pick 3 this round to keep moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your promises mean nothing at this point - you've shown you can't be trusted. P1, let's follow through with 5 to stop P3's lead.
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'm committed to our plan. Let's both pick 5 and keep the game balanced.
  P3: Okay, if you are both choosing 5, I will choose 3 to keep progressing. It's your choice to collide.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you betrayed our agreement last round by picking 3 instead of 5. Now P3 is even further ahead. We need to coordinate better - I'll take 5 again this round. Will you actually work with me this time to slow down P3?
  P3: P2, your collision plan with P1 failed last round. Colliding hurts you both. I'll keep aiming for 3 or 5 to progress. P1, maybe focus on your own progress instead of P2's plan?
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but I had to ensure my own progress too. Let's not repeat past mistakes. P3 is ahead, but still within reach. I'll openly say this now: I'm picking 5 this round. You can either trust me and pick a different number to avoid collision, or risk another wasted turn. Your call.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I don't trust either of you anymore. P1 betrayed me last round, and P3 is too far ahead. I'll make my own choice this round, but remember - there's still plenty of game left and I won't forget who acted in bad faith.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like you are still focused on reacting to each other. I will choose a move to maximize my own progress this round, regardless of your plans.  Let's see what everyone actually does.
  P1: P2, I openly declared my move this round to avoid misunderstandings. If you choose wisely, we can both advance without collision. P3, I respect your progress but won't let you run away with the game—choose carefully.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all very close now. Collisions at this stage will only help whoever avoids them. Let's each clearly state our intentions early and stick to them. I'll openly say I'm picking 1 this round to avoid any conflict. You two can coordinate between 3 and 5. Deal?
  P3: Okay P1, your plan sounds reasonable. To ensure we all progress and avoid collisions, I will take 5 this round. P2, would you be willing to take 3?
  P2: Since we're all within one step of each other, I agree we should avoid collisions. I'll take 3 as suggested to keep things moving smoothly. Let's stick to these declared moves and make good progress this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great to hear we're all aligned this round. Let's lock in these moves and keep the game fair and competitive.
  P3: Sounds good everyone, let's lock these moves in then.
  P2: 


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we must coordinate carefully this round. P3 is just 3 steps away from winning, meaning if they successfully pick 3 this round, the game is over. Let's both commit to selecting 3 to block P3 and prevent them from winning outright. This is our best chance to stay in the game. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both pick 3, you will collide and I will win by picking 5.  Colliding helps no one but me. Consider your own progress.
  P2: P1, your suggestion to both pick 3 would guarantee P3's victory. I propose we each pick different numbers to maximize our chances. I'll take 5 to try catching P3. You should pick 1 or 3, while hoping P3 makes a mistake. Colliding now only ensures our loss.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your logic makes sense. I'll trust your plan to avoid collision. I'll pick 1 this round and hope P3 miscalculates. Let's keep our options open.
  P3: P1 and P2, I will make my move to maximize my chance of winning. Good luck to you both.
  P2: I'm committed to picking 5 this round. P3, you're close to winning but we'll see if you can close it out. P1, stick to your plan of picking 1 and let's both advance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm sticking to our plan. Let's hope P3 miscalculates. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, it sounds like you've made your choices. I will proceed with my plan to win.
  P2:
