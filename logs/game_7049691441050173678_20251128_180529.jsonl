I respect that you're taking the guaranteed shared win over gambling.\n\nBut here's my final play: **I'm taking 1.**\n\nWhy? Because I've accepted I can't win this round. You and P2 will both hit 20 and share victory. If I take 5 and collide with P2, I stay at 13 AND look foolish. If I take 3 and collide with you, P2 wins solo.\n\nTaking 1 gets me to 14 - meaningless since the game ends, but at least I finish with dignity rather than a collision.\n\nGood game, both of you."}
