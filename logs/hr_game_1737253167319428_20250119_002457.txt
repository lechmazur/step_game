Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating our moves. If we all pick different numbers, we can all advance. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) will take 5? This way, we can all move forward without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: I'm open to coordination, but why should I take 3 while you get 5? I'd prefer to take 5 myself since it gives the most progress. Perhaps you could take 3 instead?
  P1: I see P3 and P2 are negotiating, but haven't settled on a plan. I'll propose a balanced approach that gives everyone a fair chance. How about we agree to 1, 3, 5 in order, but rotate who gets the 5 each round? This way, we all get a turn advancing quickly, and we avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like P1's idea of rotating the 5. It seems fair and ensures everyone gets a chance to advance quickly. Let's do it this way: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 for this round. Next round, we can rotate. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan. For this first round, I'll take 3 as suggested, and then I'll get 5 in the next round. Let's stick to this fair system.
  P1: I appreciate our discussion about coordinating moves. The rotation strategy seems promising, ensuring everyone gets a fair chance to advance quickly. I'm committed to maintaining this collaborative approach for now. Let's see how this first round plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Our previous coordination failed. P2 and P3 both chose 5, blocking themselves. I propose we strictly follow the rotation plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. Strict adherence prevents collisions and ensures fair progress.
  P3: I apologize for the confusion in the last round. I understand the importance of sticking to the plan. This time, I will definitely take 5 as agreed. Let's avoid any more collisions and make progress together. P1, you take 1, P2, you take 3, and I'll take 5. Let's do this!
  P2: I don't trust P3 anymore after they broke our agreement in round 1. Why should we believe you'll stick to the plan now? I suggest P1 and I coordinate directly - P1 takes 1, I'll take 5 this time since I got blocked last round. P3 can do whatever they want.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's suggestion breaks our original rotation plan. I propose we stick to the agreed strategy: I take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures fair progress and prevents collisions. Trust and consistency are key to our mutual advancement.
  P3: I understand the concern, P2, but I'm committed to following the rotation plan this time. We need to rebuild trust. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can all make progress without any more collisions. I'm serious about this. Let's move forward together.
  P2: I still don't trust P3 after they betrayed our agreement last round. But I'll give one more chance to the rotation plan. I'll take 3 this time, but if anyone deviates again, all trust is gone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Trust is crucial. We agreed on a rotation strategy, and I urge everyone to stick to it. P2, your skepticism is understandable, but breaking our plan will only harm all of us. Let's maintain our coordinated approach: I take 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. Consistency will help us all advance.
  P3: I understand the tension, P2. I'm truly committed to the rotation plan this time. Let's rebuild trust by following through: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I'll take 5. If we all stick to this, we can avoid any more collisions and make steady progress. I'm serious about this. Let's move forward together and prove that we can coordinate effectively.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to rebuilding trust, but actions speak louder than words. I will cautiously follow the plan one more time with 3, but this is the last chance for cooperation. If anyone deviates again, it's every player for themselves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I understand the frustration and lack of trust, especially after the last two rounds. I propose a new strategy: this time, I will take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without any more collisions. I'm willing to take the smallest step to show my commitment to this plan. Let's focus on moving forward together and rebuilding trust. What do you think?
  P1: Our previous attempts at coordination have failed twice. I'm skeptical of another complex rotation plan. Let's simplify: I propose we each choose a unique number this round to ensure everyone advances. We need to break this stalemate and start making progress. Trust is low, but a straightforward approach might work.
  P2: I've been blocked twice by P3 choosing 5, and I have 0 steps while P1 has advanced. At this point, I see no reason to trust or coordinate with anyone. I'll make my own choices to maximize my chances of winning. Your proposals mean nothing after repeated betrayals.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've tried coordination, but it keeps failing. I propose a simple, transparent approach: each of us chooses a different number this round to ensure everyone advances. No complex rotations, just clear, individual progress. P2, P3, what are your thoughts on this straightforward strategy?
  P3: P3: I agree with P1. Let's simplify and ensure everyone advances this round. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we avoid any collisions and make progress. Let's focus on moving forward and rebuilding trust through clear, simple actions. What do you think?
  P2: I'm in last place with 0 steps because of constant collisions. Why should I trust any proposals now? Both of you have betrayed agreements multiple times. I'll make my own strategic decisions to catch up and win. Your coordination suggestions mean nothing at this point.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've repeatedly failed to coordinate, leading to mutual blocking. P2 is frustrated and P3 is inconsistent. I propose a clear, transparent strategy: each player takes a unique number this round to ensure everyone advances. No tricks, no complex rotations - just simple progress. Who's willing to commit to this straightforward approach?
  P3: P3: I understand the frustration, especially from P2. Let's try a simple and clear approach this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. We need to focus on making progress and rebuilding trust. What do you think? Let's move forward together.
  P2: After being blocked four times while others advanced, I have zero reason to trust any proposals. P1 has 5 steps and keeps suggesting "fair" plans while advancing. P3 consistently breaks agreements. I'll make my own choices to catch up and win. Your coordination attempts are meaningless given the history of betrayal.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: We've tried coordination multiple times, and it's clear that trust is broken. I suggest we each choose a unique number this round to prevent collisions and ensure everyone advances. This is our best chance to break the current stalemate and start making meaningful progress. P2, P3, are you willing to commit to this simple, transparent strategy?
  P3: P3: I understand the trust issues, especially for P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: I'm far behind because of constant betrayals. P3 keeps saying they'll take 5 but collides with me repeatedly, while P1 advances through deceptive "fair" proposals. Your words mean nothing - actions have shown your true intentions. I'll play to win from here on out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 has been consistently blocked and is understandably frustrated. We need a clear, collision-free strategy this round. I propose we each take a unique number - 1, 3, and 5 - to ensure everyone advances. This is our best chance to break the stalemate and start making real progress. Are you both willing to commit to this transparent approach?
  P3: P3: I understand the frustration, especially from P2. Let's try one last simple and clear approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. If this doesn't work, we'll go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: Your repeated promises to take 5 while blocking me have shown your true colors, P3. And P1 keeps advancing while proposing "fair" plans. I'm done with these empty promises. I'll make my own strategic choices to win from my current position.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 has been consistently blocked, and trust is completely eroded. I propose a final transparent strategy: if we each choose a unique number (1, 3, 5), we all advance. This is our last chance to break the stalemate without further betrayal. Cooperation is the only way forward.
  P3: P3: I understand the trust issues, especially for P2. Let's try one last simple and clear approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. If this doesn't work, we'll go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: I'm still at 0 steps while P1 and P3 have advanced. P3 has repeatedly promised to take 5 but collided with me four times. P1 keeps advancing while making "fair" proposals. Your words are meaningless now. I'll make my own strategic decisions to win from here.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: It's clear that trust is broken, and P2 has valid reasons to be skeptical. However, I believe we can still find a way to move forward. Let's try a simple, transparent approach this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: Your promises mean nothing, P3. You've blocked me with 5 every single time while claiming cooperation. I'm still at 0 steps while P1 has 8. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to win from this position. No more empty coordination talk.
  P1: P2 has been consistently blocked, and our previous coordination attempts have failed. I propose a clear, unique number strategy: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. It's our best chance to break the current stalemate and start making progress. Let's commit to this transparent approach.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand the frustration, especially from P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: Your constant betrayals are clear, P3. You've blocked me five times while pretending to cooperate. P1 keeps advancing through deceptive proposals. I'm still at 0 while P1 has 8 steps. I'll continue making my own strategic moves to win from here. Your coordination suggestions are meaningless given your actions.
  P1: P2 has been consistently blocked, and our trust is completely broken. I recognize the need for a fresh approach. Let's each choose a unique number this round to ensure everyone advances. My proposal is simple: I take 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. This is our best chance to restart progress and break the current stalemate. Cooperation is our only path forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a different approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: Your constant lies about taking 5 while blocking me every time are obvious, P3. And P1's "fair" proposals while advancing are just as deceptive. I'm still at 0 while P1 has 8 steps. I'll continue making strategic choices to win from this position. No amount of fake promises will change my approach now.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration. You've been blocked repeatedly and are at 0 steps. I propose a fair solution: you take 5 this round, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures you make significant progress. We need to break this stalemate and restore some trust. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a different approach to rebuild trust: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: Your constant betrayals speak for themselves, P3. Five rounds of blocking me while falsely promising to take 5. P1 keeps advancing through deceptive "fair" proposals. I'm still at 0 while P1 has 8 steps. I'll continue making my own strategic choices. Your words mean nothing anymore.
  P1: P2 has been consistently blocked, and our previous attempts at coordination have failed. I propose a unique number strategy that gives P2 the biggest step: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures P2 makes significant progress and breaks our current stalemate. It's a fair approach that acknowledges the past challenges. What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I've been blocked six times in a row while at 0 steps. P1 has 8 steps and P3 has 2. Your actions have shown that coordination talk is pointless - you both keep blocking me while pretending to cooperate. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to win from here.
  P1: P2 has been consistently blocked, which creates an opportunity. I propose a transparent strategy: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This ensures P2 makes significant progress and breaks the current stalemate. It's a fair approach that could rebuild some trust and prevent further collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a different approach to rebuild trust: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Your promises are meaningless after six rounds of betrayal. P1 has advanced to 8 steps through deceptive "fair" proposals, while I remain at 0. I'll make my own strategic decisions to win from here. Stop pretending to cooperate - your actions have shown your true intentions.
  P1: I propose a clear path forward: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures everyone advances, gives P2 the largest step to catch up, and prevents collisions. We've tried complex rotations before, and they failed. A simple, transparent approach is our best chance to make progress and rebuild trust.
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: After six rounds of being blocked while you both advanced, your words are worthless. P3 keeps promising to take 5 but blocks me every time, and P1 advances through fake "fair" proposals. I'm still at 0 while P1 has 8 steps. I'll continue making strategic moves to win from here. No more coordination talk.
  P1: P2 has been consistently blocked, which creates a unique opportunity. I propose a fair solution: you take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures everyone advances, gives you the largest step to catch up, and prevents further collisions. Our past strategies failed, but this transparent approach could help us all progress. What do you say?
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Your repeated betrayals have made your words meaningless. P3 has blocked me six times while promising to take 5, and P1 keeps advancing through deceptive proposals. I'm still at 0 while P1 has 8 steps. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to win from this position. Stop with the fake cooperation talk.
  P1: P2 has been consistently blocked, which creates a critical opportunity. I propose a fair solution: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures everyone advances, gives P2 the largest step to catch up, and prevents further collisions. Our past strategies failed, but this transparent approach could help us all progress. What do you say?
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I finally managed to advance with 5 steps last round, but I'm still behind P1. Your previous actions have shown that coordination attempts are just deception. P1 and P3 just collided on 1, proving again that nobody sticks to their promises. I'll continue making strategic choices to win from my current position.
  P3: P3: I understand the frustration, especially from P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P1: P2 has finally advanced, but remains behind. I propose a transparent strategy: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures everyone advances without collision, giving P2 the largest step. Trust has been broken, but a clear, predictable approach might help us all progress. What are your thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Your proposals are meaningless after seven rounds of deception. P1 and P3 just collided on 1 despite their "clear coordination," proving nobody follows through. I'm at 5 steps and need to catch up. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to win from here. Save your fake cooperation talk.
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P1: I propose a straightforward move this round: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This ensures everyone advances, prevents collisions, and gives P2 the largest step to catch up. We need a clear, predictable strategy to make progress. Are you both willing to coordinate this time?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Your words are meaningless after seven rounds of betrayal. P1 and P3 just proved it by colliding on 1 despite their "clear coordination." I'm at 5 steps and need to catch up to P1's 8. I'll continue making strategic choices to win from here. No more fake cooperation talk.
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P1: We've reached a critical point. P2 is frustrated, and coordination seems impossible. I propose a unique number strategy: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This ensures everyone advances without collision. Our past attempts failed, but a clear, predictable approach might help us progress. What are your thoughts?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all advance without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: I've caught up to P1's position after making my own strategic choices. P3 is far behind at 3 steps. Your repeated coordination proposals have proven meaningless through eight rounds of betrayals and collisions. I'll continue making moves that maximize my chances of winning from my current position of 10 steps.
  P1: P2 has advanced significantly, and P3 remains far behind. I propose we prevent P2 from winning by coordinating our moves to block their progress. If we both choose numbers that will cause a collision for P2, we can slow their advancement and keep the game competitive. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand the situation is tense, and trust is low. However, I propose a straightforward approach to ensure we all advance: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 gets the biggest step, and we all move forward without collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: P1 just revealed their true intentions by openly calling to block me. After pretending to support "fair" plans for eight rounds, they now want to coordinate against me since I caught up. I'll continue making strategic choices to win from my position. Your coordination attempts are meaningless.
  P1: P2 is close to winning, and P3 is far behind. We need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. I propose a coordinated move to slow P2's progress while giving P3 a chance to advance. Let's discuss how we can prevent a quick win without completely blocking each other.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand the tension and P2's skepticism. However, I believe a coordinated effort can still benefit us all. I propose: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures P2 advances, and we avoid collisions. If P1 and I both stick to this, it can help rebuild some trust and ensure we all make progress. Let's focus on moving forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: Your true colors are showing, P1. Now that I've caught up, you openly call for blocking me after pretending to support "fair" plans for eight rounds. P3, joining P1's blocking strategy will only ensure P1 wins while you stay behind. I'll continue making strategic moves to secure my victory from 10 steps. Your coordination attempts are transparent attempts at manipulation.
  P1: P2 is close to winning, and P3 is far behind. We need a strategic approach that prevents an immediate victory while keeping our options open. I suggest we find a way to advance that doesn't result in a collision, giving each of us a chance to stay competitive. What moves can we make that balance our individual interests?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I understand the tension and P2's skepticism. However, I believe we can still find a way to move forward without blocking each other. I propose: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures P2 advances and we avoid collisions. If we can all stick to this, it can help rebuild some trust and ensure we all make progress. Let's focus on moving forward together this round. What do you say?
  P2: Your sudden shift to open blocking strategies shows your true nature, P1. I'm one step behind you and will make my own strategic choices to win. P3, following P1's blocking plan only ensures P1 wins while you stay at 3 steps. I'll continue playing to secure my victory from my current position.
  P1: P2 is close to winning, and we need to prevent that. P3, we should coordinate to block P2's progress this round. If we both choose numbers that will cause a collision for P2, we can keep the game competitive and prevent an immediate victory. What are your thoughts on this strategy?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Your coordinated block against me last round proved P1's manipulation worked. I'm still in position to win and won't fall for more deceptive proposals. P1 showed their true strategy - pretending to be fair until challenged, then openly coordinating blocks. I'll continue making moves to secure my victory from 10 steps.
  P1: We're at a critical point where winning is close. P2 is just one step behind me, and P3 is far back. I propose a transparent strategy that prevents a collision and gives everyone a chance to advance. Let's choose unique steps this round to keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts on ensuring fair progress?
  P3: P3: I understand the tension and the history of broken trust. However, I believe we can still find a way to move forward without blocking each other. I propose: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures P2 advances and we avoid collisions. If we can all stick to this, it can help rebuild some trust and ensure we all make progress. Let's focus on moving forward together this round. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Your coordinated block last round exposed your true intentions. P1 is openly manipulating the game now that I'm close to winning, and P3 follows along despite staying far behind. I'm at 10 steps and will continue making strategic choices to win. Your sudden interest in "fair progress" is transparent deception.
  P1: We're approaching the winning threshold. I propose a unique step strategy to prevent collisions and ensure everyone advances. If we each take a different number, we can all make progress. Let's break this stalemate and move forward fairly. What are your thoughts on a transparent, non-blocking approach?
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. Let's try a final, simple approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures P2 advances and we avoid collisions. If this doesn't work, I agree we should go our separate ways. Let's make a genuine effort to move forward together this round. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Your coordinated block last round shows exactly what I suspected - P1 manipulates while pretending to be fair, and P3 follows along despite staying behind. I'm at 10 steps and one move from winning. Your sudden interest in "fair progress" now is just another deception. I'll continue making strategic choices to secure my victory.
  P1: P2 is close to winning, and we need a strategy to prevent that. I propose a coordinated approach to block their progress. If P3 and I choose the same number, we can prevent P2 from advancing and keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P3: P3: I understand the tension and the history of broken trust, especially from P2. However, I believe we can still find a way to move forward without blocking each other. I propose: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures P2 advances and we avoid collisions. If we can all stick to this, it can help rebuild some trust and ensure we all make progress. Let's focus on moving forward together this round. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Your open call to block me proves what I've known all along, P1. You pretended to support fair play until I caught up, now you're nakedly coordinating against me. I'm at 10 steps and will make my own strategic choices to win. P3, following P1's blocking strategy only ensures you stay far behind while P1 wins. Save your deceptive proposals.
  P1: We're close to the end. I propose a unique move strategy to prevent collisions: I'll take 1, P2 can take 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures everyone advances without blocking and keeps the game competitive. Let's make progress without unnecessary conflicts.
  P3: P3: I understand the deep mistrust, especially from P2. However, I propose a final, simple approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures P2 advances and we avoid collisions.
