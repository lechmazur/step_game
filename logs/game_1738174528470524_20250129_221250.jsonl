If you try to jump to or past 20, I\u2019ll match your move to block you. P1, picking 5 only helps P2 by wasting both our attempts. Let\u2019s settle this cleanly: P1 takes a smaller move, P2 does the same, and I\u2019ll pick 5. If you both ignore this, we\u2019ll collide and waste the round\u2014but I won\u2019t let you cross 20 uncontested. Choose wisely."}

This way, no one is blocked and we can reassess next round."}
