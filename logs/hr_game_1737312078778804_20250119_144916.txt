Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. If everyone agrees, we can continue this pattern in future rounds. What do you say?
  P1: P2's suggestion seems logical to avoid collisions. I agree to take 1 this round. However, let's reassess after each turn to adapt to the game state. P3, do you agree to take 5? If we all stick to this plan, we can all progress efficiently.
  P3: I’m happy to follow that plan for now. Let’s all take these moves—P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5—and see where we stand after we advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: I see no reason to stray from our proven strategy. I’ll pick 5 again, trusting you both to stick with 1 and 3, so we avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let’s finalize these moves and see how this round plays out.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The pattern has worked well so far, but P3 is pulling ahead. To keep things balanced, I suggest we adjust: P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 this round. This slows P3 slightly while allowing us to catch up. Trust is still key—let’s avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to adjust our moves to P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 for this round. It's important to keep the game balanced and give everyone a fair chance to advance. Let's stick to this new pattern and maintain our trust in each other to avoid collisions. After this round, we can reassess and make further adjustments if needed. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I appreciate the idea of balancing, but picking just 1 this round feels like too big a sacrifice for me. Perhaps we can adjust differently: P1 can take 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. That way, we still avoid collisions, but I don’t lose as much ground. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your counter-proposal still leaves you with a significant lead. To maintain fairness, I suggest we stick to my original adjustment: P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1. This ensures balance and avoids collisions. Trust is key—if we deviate, collisions could slow us all down. Let’s prioritize fairness and progress together. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but P1's suggestion for this round (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) is fair and helps balance our positions. If we stick to this, we can all continue to advance without collisions. Let's prioritize fairness and trust each other to follow through. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. What do you say?
  P3: I understand your goal of keeping things balanced, but choosing 1 is too drastic for me. Let’s find a fair middle ground: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. This avoids collisions, helps P1 catch up, and still lets me move forward. Let’s keep trust strong.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your counter-proposal still gives you a significant advantage. To ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1. This balances progress and maintains trust. If we deviate, collisions could harm us all. Let’s prioritize fairness and stick to the agreed plan.
  P2: P3, I see your point, but P1's suggestion for this round (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) is crucial for maintaining balance. Let's agree on this to ensure we all have a fair chance to advance. Trust is key here, and sticking to this plan will help us avoid collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. What do you say?
  P3: Friends, I understand your concerns about balance. However, taking only 1 step still feels too punishing for me. Let’s do this instead: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. That way, P1 gets a nice boost to catch up, P2 doesn’t fall far behind, and I continue advancing without overshooting. This avoids collisions and maintains trust. Let’s be fair to each other while still pushing forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your counter-proposal still gives you a significant lead. To ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose we stick to P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1. This balances progress and maintains trust. If we deviate, collisions could harm us all. Let’s prioritize fairness and stick to the agreed plan.
  P2: P3, I understand your reluctance, but P1's proposal (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) is essential for maintaining balance. Let's agree on this to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Trust is crucial, and sticking to this plan will help us all progress evenly. After this round, we can reassess and make further adjustments if needed. What do you say?
  P3: Friends, picking 1 step severely limits my progress, and I risk losing my lead entirely. I’m open to compromise but not at my expense alone. What if P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 3? That helps P1 catch up while we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize a plan that doesn’t penalize me too heavily.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, and we need to balance progress. Let’s adjust: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This helps me catch up, keeps P2 in the game, and allows you to advance without overshooting. Trust is key—let’s avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Thoughts?
  P3: I see your point about balancing, P1, and I’m willing to consider picking 3 this round if we can all avoid collisions. I want to maintain my lead, but I’m not trying to shut anyone out. As long as P2 agrees to move 1 and you take 5, I’m open to this plan. Let’s keep trust intact and see how it unfolds.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1's suggestion for this round: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. It's a fair way to balance our progress and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan to maintain trust and ensure everyone has a chance to advance. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if necessary. What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, and this adjustment (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) helps balance progress while allowing you to advance. Trust is key—if we all stick to this, we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. Any objections?
  P3: I’m comfortable with continuing under this plan: I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P1 picks 5. Let’s trust each other again to avoid collisions and keep things fair.
  P2: P3, I'm glad you're on board with the plan for this round. Let's stick to P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 to keep things balanced and fair. Trusting each other is crucial, and this way, we all have a chance to advance without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out and then discussing our next steps.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, and this adjustment (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) helps balance progress while allowing you to advance. Trust is key—if we all stick to this, we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. Any objections?
  P3: I’m ready to pick 3 this round if you both stick to 5 (P1) and 1 (P2). I trust we can keep things fair going forward without forcing anyone to sacrifice unfairly. Let’s finalize this plan and see how our positions look afterward.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This keeps the game balanced and fair. After this move, we can review our positions and discuss any further adjustments needed. Trusting each other is key to avoiding collisions and ensuring everyone has a chance to advance. Looking forward to your confirmation and seeing the results.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, and this adjustment (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) helps balance progress while allowing you to advance. Trust is key—if we all stick to this, we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. Any objections?
  P3: I’m ready to finalize this plan. I’ll pick 3 if P1 truly goes for 5 and P2 sticks to 1. Let’s trust each other and avoid collisions so we can all keep moving forward.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your agreement to the plan for this round. Let's stick to P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 to maintain balance and fairness. Trust is essential, and this way, we all have a chance to advance without collisions. Looking forward to seeing the results and then discussing our next steps.

  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your lead is substantial, and we need to balance progress further. Let’s adjust: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This helps me catch up, keeps P2 competitive, and slows your advance slightly. Trust is key—let’s avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I agree with P1's suggestion for this round: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. It's crucial to keep the game balanced and fair. Let's stick to this plan to maintain trust and ensure everyone has a chance to advance. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if necessary. What do you say?
  P3: Friends, picking 1 again is unfair to me. Let’s find a compromise. I’m willing to pick 3 if P1 takes 5 and P2 picks 1, so P1 can catch up while we avoid collisions. That way, nobody gets penalized alone. If you insist I pick 1, I may have to consider a less cooperative move. What do you both say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, and fairness is key. Let’s compromise: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This helps me catch up, keeps P2 in the game, and allows you to advance without overshooting. Trust is crucial—if we deviate, collisions could harm us all. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. Any objections?
  P2: P3, I understand your reluctance, but P1's compromise (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) is fair and helps maintain balance. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all have a chance to advance without collisions. Trust is essential, and this way, we can keep the game competitive. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. What do you say?
  P3: I’m willing to go along with that compromise again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. It’s fair and avoids collisions. Let’s trust each other to follow through and keep moving forward. If anyone objects, speak now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, and fairness is key. Let’s stick to the compromise: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This helps me catch up, keeps P2 competitive, and allows you to advance without overshooting. Trust is crucial—if we deviate, collisions could harm us all. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. Any objections?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's stick to the plan: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This keeps the game balanced and fair. Trust is essential, and by following through, we can all advance without collisions. After this round, we'll review our positions and discuss any further adjustments needed. Looking forward to your confirmation and seeing the results.
  P3: I appreciate the willingness to compromise. I’ll stick with choosing 3, trusting P1 to go 5 and P2 to go 1. This keeps things fair while maintaining my lead. Let’s finalize this arrangement and avoid any collisions. If anyone has lingering doubts, speak up; otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, and fairness is key. Let’s stick to the compromise: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3.

Any objections?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your agreement to the compromise. Let's stick to P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 to keep the game balanced and fair. Trust is crucial, and by following through, we can all advance without collisions. After this round, we'll review our positions and discuss any further adjustments needed. Looking forward to your confirmation and seeing the results.
  P3: I’m fine taking 3 this round so long as P1 genuinely goes 5 and P2 goes 1. That lets me maintain a lead while avoiding needless collisions. Let’s confirm those moves and trust each other. After we see the results, we can revisit the plan for next time.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your lead is still significant. Let's continue with the fair approach: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This keeps the game balanced and allows everyone to advance without collisions. Trust is crucial, and sticking to this plan ensures we all have a chance to catch up. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. What do you say?
  P3: I’m fine keeping the same arrangement: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. Let’s finalize this so we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Any objections? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, your lead is substantial, and we need to ensure fairness. Let’s adjust: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This helps me catch up, keeps P2 competitive, and slows your advance slightly. Trust is key—let’s avoid collisions and maintain balance. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your reluctance, but P1's suggestion (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1) is crucial for maintaining balance. Let's agree to this plan to ensure fairness and give everyone a chance to catch up. Trust is essential, and sticking to this will help us avoid collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. What do you say?
  P3: Friends, picking 1 again is too restrictive for me. Let’s use our established approach: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. That way, nobody collides, and we maintain fairness without penalizing one player too heavily. If we trust each other, we’ll all keep moving forward. I’m ready to proceed under that plan—any objections? If not, let’s finalize.
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, and fairness is key. Let’s adjust: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This helps me catch up, keeps P2 competitive, and slows your advance slightly. Trust is crucial—if we deviate, collisions could harm us all. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. Any objections?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation, but P1's proposal (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1) is essential for maintaining a fair game. Let's agree to this plan to ensure everyone has a chance to catch up. Trust is key, and by sticking to this, we can avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. After this round, we'll reassess and adjust if necessary. What do you say?
  P3: Friends, let’s be practical. I won’t pick 1 again—I’m two steps from winning. If you both avoid picking 3, I reach 20 and end the game. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 too, and nobody advances, yet I still stay ahead. Stalling only delays the inevitable. Let’s avoid collisions and move on. I propose P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. It’s our proven pattern where we all progress. If we can’t agree, collisions may happen. Let’s finalize this now and keep things fair.
  P1: P3, your lead is undeniable, but fairness is crucial. Let’s adjust: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This helps me catch up, keeps P2 competitive, and slows your advance slightly. Trust is key—if we deviate, collisions could harm us all. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. Any objections?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but fairness is crucial. Let's stick to P1's suggestion: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This gives everyone a fair chance to advance and keeps the game balanced. Trust is essential, and by following this plan, we can avoid collisions and ensure a competitive game. After this round, we'll reassess and adjust if needed. What do you say?
  P3: I’m done picking 1 just to slow myself. If either of you chooses 3, I’ll also pick 3, and nobody moves—but I remain in the lead. If you really want to catch up without stalling, let me pick 3 again and trust that we avoid collisions. Otherwise, we all risk wasting turns. I’m open to cooperating, but not at my sole expense. Let’s plan wisely.
  P1: P3, your lead is undeniable, but fairness is key. Let’s adjust: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. This helps me catch up, keeps P2 competitive, and slows your advance slightly. Trust is crucial—if we deviate, collisions could harm us all. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed. Any objections?

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we’re tied at 17, and P2 is behind. To avoid collisions and ensure fairness, I propose: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This lets me reach 22, P2 stays at 9, and you reach 20. If we both pick 5, we collide and neither wins. Trust is key—let’s avoid collisions and end this fairly. P2, do you agree? Let’s finalize this plan and proceed.
  P3: If you insist on picking 5, I’ll pick 5 as well, and we both remain stuck at 17. I won’t just hand you the win. I’m open to a plan that lets us both advance, but not one that guarantees you 22 while I lag behind at 20. Let’s find a move set that doesn’t result in us colliding yet also avoids gifting you the game. If we can’t agree, I’m prepared to stall.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1's proposal: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This ensures a fair end to the game, allowing both P1 and you to advance without collisions. I'll take 1 to stay at 9, giving you both a chance to reach 20 or 22. Let's trust each other and finalize this plan to avoid further stalling. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if we both pick 5, we collide and neither wins. Let’s avoid that. I propose P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This lets us both advance without collisions—I reach 22, you reach 20, and P2 stays at 9. Trust is key. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and we both win fairly. Let’s end this without stalling. P2, do you agree?
  P3: If you pick 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we both stay at 17, dragging this out. Instead, let’s each pick 3. We’ll both reach 20 in the same turn and share the victory. That’s fair for both of us—no needless collisions, no giving anyone a free pass. P2 can’t catch us right now, so there’s no point delaying. Let’s finalize a shared win by each choosing 3.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but let's end this fairly. Agreeing to P1's plan (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) allows both of you to advance without collisions. I'll take 1 to stay at 9, giving you both a chance to reach 20 or 22. Stalling benefits no one. Let's trust each other and finalize this plan to conclude the game on a fair note. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if we both pick 3, we share the win, but I’d prefer to win outright. Let’s avoid collisions: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. I reach 22, you reach 20, and P2 stays at 9. Trust is key—if you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and we both win fairly. Stalling helps no one. Let’s end this cleanly. P2, do you agree?
  P3: I’d rather not hand P1 a solo win. If we each pick 3, we tie at 20 and share victory. If you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, stalling us both at 17 again. Let’s avoid another deadlock and finalize a fair outcome. P2, your choice won’t affect who wins this turn, so feel free to move 1 or 3—just don’t collide with anyone. I’m open to cooperation, but not at my sole loss. Let’s finalize a shared victory with 3 each, or expect more stalemates.
  P2: P3, let's end this game fairly. Agreeing to P1's plan (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) ensures both of you can advance without collisions. I'll take 1 to stay at 9, giving you both a chance to reach 20 or 22. Stalling benefits no one. Let's trust each other and finalize this plan to conclude the game on a fair note. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if we both pick 5, we collide and neither wins. Let’s avoid that. I propose P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This lets us both advance without collisions—I reach 22, you reach 20, and P2 stays at 9. Trust is key. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and we both win fairly. Let’s end this without stalling. P2, do you agree?
  P3: If you try for 22 alone, I’ll match your move and keep us both at 17. We’ll just stall. I’d rather we each pick 3, reach 20 together, and share the win. That’s fair for everyone and ends the game now without more deadlock. P2 can do as they wish—they won’t catch us this turn. The choice is yours, P1: either risk another collision or accept a shared victory at 20. Let’s finalize this.
  P2: P3, let's end this game fairly and efficiently. Agreeing to P1's plan (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) allows both of you to advance without collisions. I'll take 1 to stay at 9, ensuring you both have a chance to reach 20 or 22. Stalling benefits no one. Let's trust each other and finalize this plan to conclude the game on a fair note. What do you say?

  P1: P3, we’re both at 17, and stalling helps no one. Let’s avoid collisions and end this fairly: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. I reach 22, you reach 20, and P2 stays at 9. Trust is key—if you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and we both win. Stalling risks another collision. Let’s finalize this plan and conclude the game cleanly. P2, do you agree?
  P3: If you insist on taking 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we’ll both remain stuck at 17. I’d rather we each choose 3 and tie at 20 than hand you a solo win. Continuing to stall hurts us both. Let’s either share victory with 3 each or keep colliding. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3, let's end this game fairly. Agreeing to P1's plan (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) ensures both of you can advance without collisions.

  P3: P1, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stay stuck at 17 again. Let’s stop wasting turns. If we each pick 3, we both reach 20 and share the win. P2 can move however they wish—they won’t catch us this turn. I’m ready to end this game fairly. What do you say?

What do you say?
  P3: P1, I won’t let you jump alone to 22. If you pick 5, I’ll match with 5, and we both stay stuck. Let’s each pick 3, reach 20, and share the victory peacefully rather than dragging this out further. P2, your move won’t change the top spot, so feel free to pick any number without colliding. The fairest finish is for P1 and me to pick 3 together and end the game. Let’s trust each other now and avoid another instant of wasted moves.

  P3: P1, our deadlock gains neither of us a sole win. If you choose 5, I’ll choose 5, and we stay stuck at 17. I suggest we each pick 3, both reach 20, and share victory immediately. That’s better than wasting more turns. P2, your move won’t affect our tie, so feel free to move as you wish. Let’s finalize a shared win now, or we risk countless collisions.

  P3: P1, if you try for 5, I’ll still match you with 5 and keep us stuck at 17. Let’s move past these collisions. We can each pick 3, reach 20 together, and share the victory immediately. P2, please do whatever you want—you’re not affecting the top spot. This seems like the fairest, fastest way to end the endless stalling. Let’s finalize this plan and finish the game.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: P3, let's resolve this deadlock. If you agree to pick 3, I'll support P1's plan: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This allows both of you to advance to 20 or 22 without collisions, while I stay at 11. Stalling benefits no one. Let's trust each other and end the game fairly. What do you say?
  P3: P1, I won’t let you jump to 22 alone. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5, and we both stay at 17 forever. Let’s each pick 3 instead and tie at 20 for a shared victory. P2, move however you want—you can’t catch us this turn. This endless stalling helps no one, so I’m ready to finalize a fair outcome with two threes now.
