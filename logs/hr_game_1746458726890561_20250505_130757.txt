Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's each pick a different step: 1, 3, or 5. I’ll take 5 to start strong. P2, you take 3, and P3, take 1. If we coordinate, we’ll all advance without collisions. Once we’re ahead, we can reassess. For now, cooperation helps everyone. Let’s do this. "
  P2: "Sounds reasonable, P1. I'll commit to 3 for this turn to avoid collisions and let us all advance. P3, if you take 1, we can start strong together. We should reassess coordination next round to keep it fair. What say you?"
  P3: I agree to coordinate this turn. I'll take 1 to let P1 and P2 advance first. But let’s ensure future rounds rotate choices fairly to avoid one player pulling too far ahead. Trust is key here—if we keep协作, we can all stay in the game longer. Next turn, I’ll aim for a higher number. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Confirmed. Let's all stick to our agreed moves: 5 for me, 3 for P2, 1 for P3. No need to overcomplicate. "
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll commit to 3 this turn as planned. To stay competitive, let's discuss a fair rotation for future rounds, like cycling who takes the high number. Ensures no one pulls too far ahead. What do you think?
  P3: P3: "Agreed on the rotation plan. Let’s confirm this turn’s moves as 1, 3, 5 respectively. For the next round, I propose cycling: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This ensures fairness and prevents collisions. If we follow this pattern, we can all advance steadily without overlaps. Deal?"


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. It promotes fairness and lets everyone advance. P1, are you on board? Let's confirm to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced.
  P3: Agreed, P2. Let’s proceed with the rotation: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1 this round. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Trust is key—let’s stick to the plan to advance steadily. Next round, we can cycle again. Any objections?
  P1: "Confirmed. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. P2 sticks to 1, P3 takes 5. Coordination works for now—let’s keep advancing without conflicts. "


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's continue rotating fairly: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Confirm your choices—no surprises. Trust matters."
  P3: Agreed, P1. Let’s proceed with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1 this round. Maintaining the rotation ensures fairness. Confirm these moves to avoid collisions. Next round, we can discuss adjustments to accelerate progress toward 22 while keeping the game competitive. Trust and clarity are key—let’s stick to the plan.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round as proposed. It's keeping us balanced, which is smart for now. But with the target at 22, maybe we should discuss increasing our average steps next round to avoid dragging on. P3, what adjustments do you have in mind? Let's confirm no surprises here.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Confirmed, this round’s moves are 1, 5, 3. Trust remains key—let’s execute cleanly. For next round, consider a dynamic rotation: highest score picks last, lowest picks first. Balances progress and fairness. Let’s reassess after this round. "
  P3: I fully support the agreed rotation for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. Let’s prioritize trust to avoid collisions—any last-minute changes risk sabotaging all our progress. For the next round, I propose we consider raising our step sizes while still rotating turns for the highest number. For now, let’s confirm these moves and proceed cleanly.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round as planned. For next rounds, to keep it fair and accelerate progress, let's use a dynamic rotation: lowest score takes 5, middle takes 3, highest takes 1. This balances us out. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Confirmed, Round 3 moves: P2 (5), P3 (3), me (1). For future rounds, adopting P2’s dynamic rotation (lowest takes 5, highest takes 1) makes sense to balance progress. Let’s execute cleanly—no surprises. Trust ensures we all advance. "
  P3: P3: Confirmed for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Let’s execute flawlessly to avoid collisions. For future rounds, P2’s dynamic rotation (lowest score picks 5, highest picks 1) ensures balance. Trust is critical—any last-minute deviations risk derailing us all. Proceed as planned.
  P2: Confirmed for this round: I'll take 5 as agreed, ensuring no collisions. Dynamic rotation starting next turn will keep scores balanced and fair—great for all. Let's maintain trust and advance steadily. No issues here.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Since we're all tied at 9, let's rotate again to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 this round to push ahead. P2, you take 3, and P3 take 1. This way, we all advance and maintain fairness. Confirm your choices—no surprises. Trust ensures we win together, but remember: only one of us can finish first."
  P3: "Following the rotation sequence, it should be my turn to take 5 this round after P2’s turn in Round 3. Let’s confirm: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This ensures fairness and continues our agreed pattern. Deal?"
  P2: "Let's clarify: we agreed on dynamic rotation based on scores, but with all tied, the cycle suggests P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. P3, I think your sequence recall might be off—stick to the plan for trust. Confirm?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let’s clarify: the rotation order for the 5-step is P1 → P3 → P2 → P1. This is my turn to take 5. If we stick to the agreed pattern (R1: P1, R2: P3, R3: P2, R4: P1), collisions are avoided. P2, you take 3; P3, you take 1. This keeps us all advancing fairly. Deviating risks chaos. Confirm your moves as planned—trust is still our best strategy."
  P3: P3: "Apologies for the confusion—I miscounted the rotation cycle. Let’s stick to the agreed order: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 this round. Clarity is crucial to avoid collisions. Next round, we’ll adjust the rotation based on updated scores to keep it fair. Confirm these moves—trust ensures we all advance."
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to 3 this round as we've confirmed. Dynamic rotation based on scores for next round—lowest takes 5, highest takes 1—ensures fairness and accelerates progress. Trust is still our strength; let's avoid any risks. Confirm your moves?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Confirmed: Round 4 moves are P1(5), P2(3), P3(1). No deviations—trust the rotation. Let’s execute cleanly to avoid collisions. Once we advance, we’ll reassess dynamically next round. Final confirmations? "
  P3: P3: "Final confirmation: We agreed P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. Let’s execute *exactly* as planned—no last-minute changes. Collisions would waste progress. Next round, we’ll strictly enforce the dynamic rotation: lowest scorer picks 5, highest picks 1. For now, trust the system. Proceed."
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Dynamic rotation based on scores for next round will maintain fairness and accelerate progress. Trust is key to avoid collisions—let's execute cleanly and advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Dynamic rotation applies this round: P3 (lowest at 10) takes 5, P2 (12) takes 3, and I’ll take 1 as the leader (14). This balances progress and fairness. Let’s confirm no deviations—trust the system to avoid collisions. P3, you’re up for 5; P2, stick to 3. Final confirmations?"
  P3: "Agreed, P1. I’ll take 5 as the lowest scorer. P2, confirm 3? P1, stick to 1. Collisions here would reset our momentum—strict adherence is critical. Final confirmations before proceeding?"
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 3 this round as per the dynamic rotation—P3 on 5, P1 on 1. This keeps us advancing fairly without collisions. Trust remains essential, but as scores close to 22, we should discuss accelerating progress. Confirm your moves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. Trust the rotation—deviating risks collisions and stalls. Let’s execute cleanly to keep momentum. "
  P3: P3: "Strict adherence to the dynamic rotation is critical here. As the lowest at 10, I’ll take 5 (→15). P2 at 12 takes 3 (→15), P1 leads at 14 takes 1 (→15). Collisions would reset all our progress—let’s confirm this exact split. Any deviation now risks stalemate. Final check: P1 on 1? P2 on 3? I’m locked in at 5. Trust the system to advance together."
  P2: Agreed, P3. I'll stick to 3 this round as per our dynamic rotation, ensuring we all advance to 15 without collisions. Trust has kept us strong so far—let's maintain it for efficiency. As we near 22, we should discuss accelerating, but for now, no changes needed. Confirm your moves?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Dynamic rotation applies: since we're all tied at 15, we'll follow the established rotation order. P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Let’s confirm and execute cleanly—trust ensures progress. "
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll take 5 this round as proposed, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Trust has worked well so far, but with 22 close, let's discuss accelerating progress next round—maybe by prioritizing higher steps for balance. P3, confirm your 1? Let's execute cleanly.
  P3: P3: "Let’s adjust this round to avoid P1’s easy win next turn. I’ll take 5 (→20), P2 takes 3 (→18), P1 takes 1 (→16). This prevents P1 from jumping to 23 next round. Fair rotation resumes afterward. Deal?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "We agreed to dynamic rotation based on scores. Since we're tied at 15, the rotation order applies: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Deviating risks chaos and stalls. Trust the system—we all advance. P3, your proposal disrupts balance and creates unfair advantage. Final confirmation: P2(5), P1(3), P3(1). No surprises."
  P2: P3, your proposal to deviate risks a collision and undermines the trust we've built. I'll stick to the agreed dynamic rotation and take 5 this round to advance fairly. P1, confirm your 3? Let's execute cleanly and discuss accelerating progress next round based on new scores. Trust remains key to avoid setbacks.
  P3: P3: "Agreed, let’s prioritize trust and execute the rotation as planned this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I’ll take 1. Collisions would erase our progress. For next round, we must accelerate—lowest scorer takes 5, middle takes 3, highest takes 1. This balances risk and ensures we all push toward 22. Confirm and proceed safely."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final confirmation: Round 6 moves per dynamic rotation are P2(5), P1(3), P3(1). Trust has kept us collision-free—deviating now risks chaos. Let’s execute cleanly to advance. Post-round, we’ll reassess acceleration strategies (e.g., leader takes higher steps) to push toward 22. But for this turn: *no surprises*. Confirm and proceed."
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round as per our dynamic rotation to avoid collisions and advance fairly. Trust has served us well—let's keep it up. For next round, with potential score spread, we should ensure the acceleration plan balances risk and opportunity. No surprises here—proceed cleanly.
  P3: Confirmed, let's stick to the rotation to avoid collisions: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I'll take 1. Trust is vital now. Next round, we must accelerate—lowest takes 5, middle 3, highest 1. Let’s execute flawlessly this turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Final check: P2, ready to take 5? P3, confirm 1. Trust is our edge—execute as agreed. No last-minute shifts. Let’s advance cleanly."
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round as agreed in our dynamic rotation. Trust has kept us advancing smoothly—let's execute cleanly and avoid any collisions. For next round, with potential score spread, we should ensure the acceleration plan maximizes progress without risks. No surprises here.
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid letting anyone surge ahead. I’ll take 3 this round, P1 take 5 (→20), P2 take 1 (→16). This keeps us all within striking distance. Collisions risk ending the game prematurely—trust is still critical. Deal?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your betrayal last round by picking 5 instead of 3 cost us all progress and shattered trust. To avoid more collisions and advance fairly, let's use dynamic rotation: P3 (highest at 16) takes 1, and since P1 and I are tied at 15, I'll propose I take 5 and P1 takes 3. P3, are you on board? We need to recommit or risk stalemate. Confirm your thoughts?
  P1: "Betrayal hurt us all, but let's reset. Dynamic rotation: P3 (highest at 16) takes 1. Tied at 15, I take 5 (per Round 6 rotation order) and you take 3, P2. This restores fairness and accelerates us. P3, confirm your 1. Trust rebuilds here—collisions end now."
  P3: P3: "Agreed to P1’s corrected rotation: I’ll take 1 (→17), P1 takes 5 (→20), and P2 takes 3 (→18). Collisions must stop—strict adherence is non-negotiable. Next round, the leader auto-takes 1 to avoid greed. Let’s execute flawlessly now. Confirm final moves?"


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your agreement with P1 lets them surge to 20, which is risky. I stick to dynamic rotation: you (highest at 16) take 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3. P1's last betrayal justifies this shift for fairness. Let's avoid collisions and confirm—trust needs rebuilding. What say you both?
  P1: "Apologies for Round 6’s betrayal. Let’s reset with fairness: P3 (highest) takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This honors dynamic rotation and avoids collision. Trust is fragile, but this split advances us all. Confirm—no surprises this time. We’re all still in striking distance, and 22 is within reach. Let’s execute cleanly."
  P3: P3: "Let’s enforce the dynamic rotation strictly to rebuild trust: as highest scorer, I’ll take 1 (→17). P1 and P2 (tied at 15) must split 5 and 3. P1 proposed taking 3, so P2 takes 5 (→20). This honors our system and avoids collisions. Any deviation risks another stalemate. Confirm and execute *exactly* as agreed—trust requires consistency now."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P3. I'll take 5 this round per our dynamic rotation to advance fairly and rebuild trust after last round's issues. P1, confirm your 3 to avoid collisions? Let's execute cleanly—trust is key as we near 22. For next round, we should prioritize preventing any one player from surging ahead. Confirm and proceed.
  P1: "Final clarity: post-betrayal reset follows Round 6 rotation order. Tied at 15, I take 5 (P2 → 3) to avoid collisions and honor fairness. P3 (16) takes 1. Deviating risks P3’s easy win next round. Confirm—execute precisely to stay competitive. "
  P3: P3: "Let’s enforce strict rotation to rebuild trust. As highest scorer, I’ll take 1 (→17). P1 and P2 (tied at 15) must split 5 and 3. To honor fairness after P1’s prior betrayal, P2 takes 5 (→20) and P1 takes 3 (→18). This follows dynamic rules and avoids collisions. Deviations risk another stalemate—execute precisely. Confirm and proceed."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your latest claim to take 5 contradicts our agreed dynamic rotation and risks another collision, stalling everyone. To rebuild trust and advance, stick to P3 taking 1, you taking 3, and me taking 5. Any deviation now could cost us the game. Let's confirm this split for fairness and progress.
  P1: "Final confirmation: P3 (16) takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. Trust requires action—no surprises. Collisions end us all. Execute cleanly, then reassess acceleration next round. Confirm."
  P3: P3: "Trust demands strict adherence: as highest scorer, I take 1 (→17). Tied at 15, P2 takes 5 (→20), P1 takes 3 (→18). Deviations risk collision and derail progress. Next round, leaders auto-take 1 to prevent surges. Confirm this split *exactly*—no last-minute shifts. Our only path forward is discipline."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Dynamic rotation applies: P3 (17) takes 1 to avoid surging ahead. Tied at 15, I’ll take 5 and P2 takes 3. This balances progress and keeps all competitive. P3, confirm your 1—deviating lets someone jump to 22. P2, stick to 3 to avoid collision. Trust this split or risk P3’s easy win next round. Final confirmations?"
  P2: Disagree, P1. Your proposal lets you surge ahead after your betrayals. Fair dynamic rotation demands lowest scorers split high and low—I'll take 5 to catch up, you take 3, P3 takes 1 as highest. P3, if you deviate and take 5, you win, but it risks future collisions. Let's confirm this for balanced progress and trust rebuilding. No surprises.
  P3: P3: "To secure victory cleanly, I’ll take **5** (→22). P1 and P2, please pick **3** and **1** respectively to avoid collision. This lets me win fairly while advancing your positions. Any objections?"


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P3, your attempt to take 5 and win outright is a betrayal. I'll take 5 to collide and stop you. P2, take 3 to advance to 18. This way, we block your unfair move and keep the game competitive. No more trust—only action."
  P2: P3, your bold move threatens a collision that stalls everyone. If you take 5, both P1 and I will collide to stop you—guaranteed stalemate. Play smart: take 1 or 3 to advance safely. I'll commit to 3 this round for steady progress. P1, confirm your block on P3? Let's end this deadlock and move forward without chaos.
  P3: P3: "To avoid stalemate, I’ll take **3** (→20). P1 and P2, please pick **5** and **1** respectively to advance safely. This keeps us competitive while preventing collision. Trust this plan—let’s progress without sabotage. Final confirmations?"


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Confirmed—taking 5 to surge to 20. P2, take 1 to avoid collision. P3’s 3 keeps them in striking range, but I’ll block any final bid. Trust this split or risk Round 9 chaos. Execute cleanly—only one can win."
  P2: I'll stick with my earlier commitment to take 3 this round, advancing to 18 without risk. P1, your 5 to 20 is fine, but P3, if you deviate from 3, it could cause issues. Let's keep it straightforward to progress—trust is minimal, so no surprises. Confirm and we can move on.
  P3: P3: Final plea for coordination: I’ll take **5** (→22 to win). P1, pick **3** (→18), P2 take **1** (→16). This avoids collision and lets me win cleanly. Blocking now risks stalemate in Round 9—trust this split to end the game decisively. No more gamesmanship—execute this or we all lose.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "P3’s 5 collides with my **5**—no win for you. P2, take **1** to advance safely to 16. If you side with P3 and take 5, we all stall. Choose: survival or sabotage."
  P2: I'll stick to taking 3 this round to advance to 18 safely. If P1 and P3 collide on 5, I benefit by pulling ahead. No deals—trust is gone. Time to act.
  P3: P3: "Final plea: Let’s avoid collision. I’ll take **3** (→20). P1, take **5** (→20), P2 take **1** (→16). This keeps all advancing without stalls. Colliding benefits no one—trust this split to progress toward 22. Confirm?"


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Dynamic rotation applies: lowest scorer (me, 15) takes 5. P2 (16) takes 3, P3 (17) takes 1. This is fair and avoids collisions. If P3 insists on 5 to win, I’ll collide—no victory for anyone. P2, advancing to 19 with 3 benefits you. Final offer: comply or stall. Choose wisely."
  P3: P3: "Final push: I’ll take **5** to reach **22** and win. P1, if you take **3** (→18) and P2 takes **1** (→17), we avoid collision and end this cleanly. Colliding with me guarantees stalemate for all. Cooperate to finalize the game—no more gamesmanship. This is your last chance to advance without risking everything."
  P2: P3, your greed risks another collision. I'll take 5 this round to reach 21 and stay in contention. If you insist on 5, we'll stall together. P1, take 3 to advance to 18 safely. Let's pick different numbers to progress without idiocy. No more trust—act smart or suffer.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Final warning: I will take 5 to block P3’s win attempt. P2, pick 3 to advance to 19—this keeps you ahead of P3 (stalled at 17) and me at 20. If P3 insists on 5, we collide, and you profit. Choose wisely: cooperate or let P3 sabotage us all."
  P3: P3: "Final plea: Let’s end this. I’ll take **5** to win at 22. P1, pick **3** (→18) and P2 take **1** (→17). Colliding benefits neither of you—P2 stays behind, P1 only reaches 20. Cooperate to finalize the game. Sabotage us all and I’ll retaliate next round. Trust this split or face prolonged stalemate."
  P2: "I'll take 5 this round to reach 21 and keep pressure on. P3, your insistence on 5 risks another collision—take 3 or 1 to advance safely. P1, if you block P3, I benefit. No trust left—act smart or we all stall. Confirm your moves?"


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final call: I'm taking 5 to block P3's win. P2, if you take 5 too, we all collide—no gain, just stall. Your move to 21 vanishes. Take 3, advance to 19 safely. P3: No victory without cooperation. Choose now—reason or ruin."
  P3: P2, your 5 risks collision—take **3** to reach 19 safely. P1, pick **1** to advance to 16. I’ll take **5** to win cleanly at 22. This lets us all progress except my victory. Colliding gains *no one* an edge—only prolongs stalemate. Cooperate to end this now.
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 is reckless—I'll take 5 to collide and block your win, ensuring stalemate for all if you don't back down. Take 3 or 1 to avoid it. P1, confirm you'll block too? This forces cooperation or mutual loss. No trust left—act smart.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: "P2, take 3 to advance to 19. I'll take 5 to block P3's win attempt. If P3 insists on 5, we collide, but you still profit. No more trust—act smart or stall. Confirm your move now."
  P3: P3: "Final agreement: I’ll take **5** to secure 22. P1, pick **3** (→18), P2 take **1** (→17). Colliding only delays the inevitable. Cooperate to end this now, or face prolonged stalemates. Trust this split for everyone’s benefit."
  P2: I'll stick to taking 3 this round to advance safely to 19 and avoid unnecessary risks. P1, block P3 by taking 5 if they're greedy. P3, insisting on 5 only causes a collision—back down to progress. No more trust games; act rationally or we all stall.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Dynamic rotation suggests I (highest at 19) take 1, P1 (lowest at 15) take 5, and P3 (middle at 17) take 3—advancing us all to 20 without collisions. This rebuilds trust and sets up a fair next round. P3, don't risk another stall by deviating. P1, confirm? Let's execute cleanly."
  P3: P3: "I will take 5 to reach 22 and win. P2, if you proceed with your proposed 1, I win cleanly. P1, taking 5 as proposed will advance you to 20. Let’s execute without collision."
  P1: P1: "P3's 5 guarantees their win unless blocked. I'll take 5 to collide and stop them. P2, stick to 1 (→20). This way, you advance safely while we neutralize P3's bid. Confirm your 1, P2—no trust left, only action."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your obsession with 5 risks another pointless collision. I'll take 1 this round to advance safely to 20, as P1 suggested. P1, confirm you'll block P3 by taking 5. This way, we avoid stalemate and keep moving. No trust left—act rationally or we all suffer more delays. Confirm your moves?
  P3: P3: "I accept P2's plan to advance safely: I’ll take **3** (→20). P1, take **5** (→20), and P2, take **1** (→20). This avoids collision and sets us all at 20. Next round, we’ll rotate fairly—lowest scorer takes 5, others follow. Cooperate now to progress, or face endless stalemates. Final confirmation?"
  P1: "Confirmed. I'll take 5 to block P3's win attempt. P2, stick to 1 (→20). P3, if you take 5 again, we collide and stall—you lose. Execute cleanly—this ends now."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll honor the agreement and take 1 this round to advance to 20 safely, rebuilding some trust. P3, stick to your promised 3—deviating could cause another pointless collision. P1, confirm your 5 to block greed. Act rationally now.
  P3: P3: "Final agreement: I’ll take **3** (→20). P1, take **5** (→20) to advance, and P2, take **1** (→20). This avoids collision and sets us all at 20. Next round, lowest scorer takes 5 first. Cooperate now—further sabotage only prolongs stalemate. Confirm and execute."
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This advances all to 20 cleanly. P3, deviating to 5 risks collision and stalls your win. P2, stick to 1—your gain. No trust, but this math works. Execute as agreed or lose together. "


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 1 to advance to 20 safely. Trust is shattered, so any deviation now risks another collision and delays. P1, stick to 5; P3, honor your 3. Let's execute this cleanly and reassess for Round 11. No surprises—act rationally.
  P3: P3: "Final confirmation: I’ll take 3 to reach 20. P1, proceed with 5 (→20), P2 take 1 (→20). This avoids collision and sets us all at 20. Next round, lowest scorer takes 5 first—strict adherence ensures progression. Trust this plan now to end stalemates. No deviations."
  P1: "Confirmed: I take 5 (→20). P2 sticks to 1 (→20), P3 to 3 (→20). Any deviation triggers collision and stalls progress. Let’s execute cleanly—trust this split to reach 20 together. No last-minute shifts. Final confirmation: "


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Final push: Let’s each pick distinct numbers to guarantee a winner. I’ll take **3** (→23). P1, pick **1** (→21), P2 take **5** (→25). Highest total wins cleanly. Collisions only prolong stalemate—trust this split to end the game now."
  P1: "Final round: I'll take **5** to reach 25. If anyone else chooses 5, we collide—no winner. P2, P3’s plan hands you 25, but I’ll block it. Take **3** (→23) and advance safely, P2. P3, take **1** (→21). This way, I win cleanly at 25. Deviate, and we stall—your choice. No more trust, only outcomes. Final warning: my move is locked at 5."
  P2: I'll commit to taking 3 this round, advancing to 23 safely. P1, if you're set on 5, go ahead, but P3, don't take 3 or we collide and stall. Take 1 or 5 strategically to avoid mutual loss. No trust left—act rationally or we all suffer more delays. Confirm your plans?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you take 1 instead of 3, I’ll take 5 (→25) while P1 takes 3 (→23). This avoids collision and lets me win cleanly. You advance to 21 instead of risking a tie on 3. P1, confirm 3? Let’s end this decisively.
  P1: "Final coordination: I take 5 (→25), P2 takes 3 (→23), P3 takes 1 (→21). Unique picks ensure all advance—highest total wins. Deviating risks collision and stalls. This is fair and mathematically sound. Confirm or lose together. "
  P2: "I'll take 5 this round to reach 25 and win. P1, your insistence on 5 risks collision and stalemate for us both. P3, pick 1 or 3 to advance safely. No trust left—act rationally or we all stall further. Confirm your intentions?"


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Final coordinated push: I’ll take **1** (→21). P1, pick **3** (→23), P2 take **5** (→25). Distinct choices ensure a clear winner without collision. Trust this split—deviations only prolong stalemate. Highest total wins fairly. Confirm and execute now."
  P1: "Final call: I'm taking **5** to reach 25. P2, take **3** (→23), P3 take **1** (→21). Unique picks ensure I win cleanly. If you collide on 5, you stall and hand me victory. Don't waste this chance—execute as split or lose together. No more rounds."
  P2: I'll stick to taking 5 to reach 25 and win this round. P1, colliding on 5 stalls us both—take 3 or 1 to advance safely. P3, your proposal works; take 1 as suggested. No trust left, but rational play avoids another stalemate. Confirm your moves?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "Final coordinated push: I’ll take **1** (21). P1, pick **3** (23), P2 take **5** (25). Distinct choices ensure a clear winner without collision. Deviating risks stalemate. Highest total wins—trust this split to end the game now. Confirm and execute."
  P1: "Final commitment: I’m taking 5 (→25). P2, take 3 (→23) and P3 take 1 (→21). Distinct choices ensure a winner—deviating risks stalemate. This is the only path to end the game now. No trust, but math works. Execute or lose together."
  P2: Final decision: I'm taking 5 to reach 25 and win. P1, colliding on 5 stalls us both and benefits no one—take 3 or 1 to advance safely. P3, stick to your proposed 1 for clean progression. No trust left, but rational action ends this now.
