Given the importance of coordination to avoid collisions, I should propose a strategic plan that allows me to advance efficiently while minimizing risks.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Coordination to Avoid Collisions:**\n   - Propose a specific move pattern for each player to avoid choosing the same number in a turn, which would nullify our moves.\n   - Suggest a rotating pattern of moves to ensure that each player advances without overlapping choices.\n\n2. **Optimal Move Selection:**\n   - Calculate the steps needed for each player to reach 17, considering the current positions.\n   - Plan moves in a way that positions me to cross 17 first while keeping other players behind.\n\n3. **Communication and Agreement:**\n   - Clearly communicate the proposed move plan to all players.\n   - Ensure that all players agree to the plan to minimize the risk of collisions.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a strategic game rather than a coding problem, there isn't any actual code to provide. However, the steps and strategies outlined above can be implemented through careful planning and communication during the game.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Step-by-Step Planning:**\n  - Assess the current positions of all players.\n  - Propose a move plan that allows each player to choose different numbers in each turn, thereby avoiding collisions.\n  - Adjust the plan based on responses from other players to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\n- **Risk Management:**\n  - Prioritize moves that bring me closer to 17 without allowing others to catch up too quickly.\n  - Be prepared to adapt the strategy if other players deviate from the agreed plan.\n\n- **Communication:**\n  - Clearly articulate the proposed moves for each player in upcoming turns.\n  - Encourage other players to commit to the plan to maximize collective progress and minimize risks.\n\nBy following this approach, I aim to reach 17 steps first while ensuring that other players do not surpass me in the process."}

Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:\n\n1. **Coordination to Avoid Collisions:**  \n   - Propose a specific move pattern for each player to avoid choosing the same number in a turn, which would nullify the moves.  \n   - Suggest a rotating pattern of moves to ensure that each player advances without overlapping choices.  \n\n2. **Optimal Move Selection:**  \n   - Calculate the steps needed for each player to reach 17, considering the current positions.  \n   - Plan moves in a way that positions the player to cross 17 first while keeping other players behind.  \n\n3. **Communication and Agreement:**  \n   - Clearly communicate the proposed move plan to all players.  \n   - Ensure that all players agree to the plan to minimize the risk of collisions.  \n\n**Final Proposal:**  \nFor this round, I propose:  \n- P1 picks 3 (to reach 13 steps),  \n- P2 picks 1 (to reach 5 steps),  \n- I pick 5 (to reach 20 steps).  \n\nThis ensures we all make progress without overlapping choices, and I can secure the win.
