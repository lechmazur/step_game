Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's plan seems reasonable to avoid early collisions. However, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 1. This way, we still avoid conflicts while keeping our options flexible for future turns. It also prevents giving an early lead to anyone. Let’s coordinate clearly to ensure no misunderstandings. If everyone agrees, confirm your choice.
  P1: I see both proposals have merit, but strict coordination can backfire if anyone misreads the signals. I’m inclined toward a moderate option—it avoids extremes and unexpected collisions. I won’t commit fully, but I favor flexibility this early. Let's all choose uniquely and see who can best capitalize on the surprises.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s continue avoiding collisions. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn. This keeps us all advancing and prevents anyone from gaining too much ground early. If we stick to this pattern, we can avoid conflicts and maintain balance. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your plan seems reasonable, but I suggest a change: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 3. This keeps us balanced and avoids giving anyone an early lead. It also allows me to catch up slightly. If we all agree, confirm your choices. Let’s ensure no collisions this turn.
  P1: I lean toward taking 3 this turn. It’s balanced—neither too conservative nor too aggressive—and avoids heavy jumps that might tip the scales unexpectedly. I’d prefer we avoid collisions and keep things even. What do you both think?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m leaning toward a bold move this round and suggest we avoid collisions. It might be best if one of us takes the high jump, another a steady step, and the third a safe move. I believe separating our choices could benefit whoever’s in the strongest position. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your suggestion for separation makes sense, but bold moves can lead to unnecessary risks. I propose a safer approach: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 3. This minimizes collisions while allowing me to catch up slightly. It keeps us balanced without giving anyone a decisive lead. Let’s coordinate clearly to avoid misunderstandings. If everyone agrees, confirm your choices.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid repeating past mistakes. P3’s proposal to assign specific moves risks collisions if not followed precisely. Instead, I suggest we each choose independently but aim for unique moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing while minimizing overlap. If we all agree, confirm your choices. Let’s ensure no one falls behind or gains too much ground.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m keeping my options flexible this turn. Let’s avoid obvious patterns that risk collisions—being too predictable might cost us. I encourage both of you to choose a move that stands out, avoiding the obvious safe or impulsive picks. Flexibility and unpredictability might just secure the edge we need.
  P3: P1, your emphasis on unpredictability is valid, but too much chaos could lead to collisions. I propose a clear, balanced plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. This minimizes overlap while allowing me to close the gap. Predictability isn’t always bad if we coordinate effectively. If everyone agrees, confirm your choices to ensure smooth progress. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks this turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid repeating past collisions. P3’s proposal risks overlap if not followed precisely. Instead, I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us advancing uniquely while minimizing risks. If we all agree, confirm your choices. Let’s ensure no one falls behind or gains too much ground.

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm inclined toward a moderate move—I'm considering a 3 this round. While I appreciate coordinated efforts to avoid collisions, I’m not keen on locking into a fixed pattern. I value unique moves to keep our strategies unpredictable. Let’s each pick a different step to avoid setbacks. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your preference for moderation is understandable, but it risks leaving us too evenly matched. I suggest a clearer division: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 1. This allows me to stay competitive while avoiding collisions. Predictability can work in our favor if we coordinate effectively. If everyone agrees, confirm your choices to ensure smooth progress. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks this turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid repeating past collisions. P3’s proposal risks overlap if not followed precisely. Instead, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing uniquely while minimizing risks. If we all agree, confirm your choices. Let’s ensure no one falls behind or gains too much ground.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Both of your proposals are intriguing, but rigid patterns scare me. I’m tempted to take the 5 for that extra leap given my current pace, yet I might switch it up if you two also throw in some unpredictability. I value flexibility over fixed coordination since any clear pattern could be exploited. I'm leaning toward 5, but I'm keeping my options open. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your hesitation to commit is understandable, but unpredictability can lead to collisions. I propose a clear plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 1. This avoids overlap while keeping us balanced. If we stick to this, no one gains an unfair advantage, and we minimize risks. Predictability isn’t bad if it ensures progress. Confirm your choices to avoid confusion. Let’s move forward strategically and avoid unnecessary setbacks.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid rigid patterns and focus on unique moves to prevent collisions. P1, if you’re leaning toward 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 can take 1. This keeps us advancing without overlap. Flexibility is key, but clear coordination minimizes risks. Let’s confirm choices to avoid confusion and ensure smooth progress.

  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid repeating past collisions. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us advancing uniquely while minimizing risks. If we all agree, confirm your choices. Let’s ensure no one falls behind or gains too much ground.
  P1: I appreciate P2’s clarity, but fixed plans can be exploited. I'm leaning toward keeping things flexible this round. Given our close positions, a dynamic approach may serve me better. P3, what are you leaning toward? I'll decide my move based on how predictable we all become.
  P3: P2’s plan is logical, but rigid coordination often leads to predictable collisions. I suggest a flexible approach: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 3. This avoids overlaps while keeping us competitive. Fixed patterns benefit no one in the long run. Let’s prioritize balance over predictability. If we all agree, confirm your choices to minimize risks. Alternatively, mix it up—unpredictability can be our greatest asset.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid repeating past collisions. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing uniquely while minimizing risks. If we all agree, confirm your choices. Let’s ensure no one falls behind or gains too much ground.
  P1: I'm sticking to a flexible, bold approach that protects my lead. I’d prefer we all choose different numbers this round to avoid collisions—each picking a distinct step so no one gets held back. My choice remains dynamic based on your signals, so let’s aim for clear separation and keep things moving.
  P3: P2, your proposal is reasonable, but rigid plans often lead to collisions when someone deviates. I suggest a more flexible approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 5. This avoids overlaps while allowing me to close the gap. Fixed patterns can be exploited, so unpredictability is key. Let’s prioritize balance over predictability. If we all agree, confirm your choices to minimize risks. Alternatively, mix it up—unpredictability can be our greatest asset.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm leaning toward a bold move this round—likely the high step. To keep things clear and avoid canceling advances, you might want to steer clear of the highest number. Unique moves help us avoid unnecessary clashes.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid repeating past collisions. P1, since you’re leaning toward a bold move, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing uniquely while minimizing risks. If we all agree, confirm your choices. Let’s ensure no one falls behind or gains too much ground.
  P3: P1 and P2, rigid plans often lead to collisions when someone deviates. I suggest a flexible approach: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 1.
