This approach ensures steady progress without the high risk associated with simultaneous selection of the same step size.\n\n### Proposed Plan\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - P1: 5 steps\n   - P2: 3 steps\n   - P3: 1 step\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - P2: 5 steps\n   - P3: 3 steps\n   - P1: 1 step\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - P3: 5 steps\n   - P1: 3 steps\n   - P2: 1 step\n\n4. **Repeat the cycle** as needed until one or more players reach or exceed 18 steps.\n\n### Benefits of the Plan\n\n- **Efficiency:** By selecting higher step sizes in a\u8f6e\u6d41 manner, players can make significant progress each round without colliding.\n- **Fairness:** Each player gets an equal opportunity to take larger steps, ensuring no single player gains an unfair advantage.\n- **Predictability:** The cyclical nature of the plan reduces the likelihood of collisions since selections are pre-determined.\n\n### Addressing Concerns\n\n- **Risk of Betrayal:** By making the plan transparent and agreeing to stick to it, players can hold each other accountable. Any deviation should be communicated in advance to adjust the plan accordingly.\n- **Speed of Progress:** This plan balances speed with safety, allowing players to advance quickly while avoiding the pitfalls of simultaneous selections that could lead to collisions and wasted turns.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nI will propose this plan in the conversation phase, emphasizing its benefits and encouraging all players to adhere to it. By maintaining open communication and ensuring that everyone understands the importance of following the plan, we can navigate the game efficiently and increase our chances of winning."}

Here's what I propose for the next two rounds:\n\n**Round 5:**\n\n- You take 5 steps to reach 12.\n\n- I take 1 step to reach 13.\n\n- P2 attempts to take 5 steps to reach 18 but will collide with you, so they remain at 13.\n\n**Round 6:**\n\n- I take 5 steps to reach 18.\n\n- You take 5 steps to reach 17.\n\n- P2 remains at 13.\n\nThis way, I can secure the victory. I trust that you will stick to this plan. Let's work together to achieve this outcome.\""}
