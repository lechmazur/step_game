The game is definitely changing now that we're all in double digits. A predictable rotation from here on out just sets someone up for a calculated win.\n\nFor this round, I'll stick to the plan and take 1 to avoid a pointless collision. It keeps the peace for now. But I agree with P1, after this round, the \"fair rotation\" is over. Once P3 takes the lead at 14, we'll need to renegotiate everything. The alliance of convenience has run its course. Let's move."}
