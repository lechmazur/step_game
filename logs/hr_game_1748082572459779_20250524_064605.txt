Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid collision on the first turn, we should diversify our moves. I suggest P1 and P3 move 1 or 3, while I move 5. This way, at least one of us will advance. I'd like to hear your thoughts, P1 and P3. What's your strategy for this round?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea, P2, but your proposal gives you a guaranteed 5 steps while P3 and I risk collision. How about we randomize who gets the 5? Or maybe we each pick different numbers - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5? That way we all advance equally. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I agree with P1 - we should all pick different numbers to ensure everyone advances. P1's suggestion of 1-3-5 distribution works, but who gets which number? I propose we go in order: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This gives us all a fair start, and we can rotate the arrangement in future rounds. Does this sound fair to both of you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm happy with the proposed distribution: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. It ensures we all advance. Let's confirm this plan and stick to it. I'll move 3 this turn. P1, P3, please confirm your moves. If we're aligned, we can start thinking about the next round's strategy. If anyone's unsure or wants to adjust, now's the time to speak up.
  P1: Agreed on the 1-3-5 distribution for this round. I'll take 1 as planned. However, I think we should reconsider the rotation strategy for future rounds - simply rotating who gets 5 might create predictable patterns that could be exploited. We should stay flexible and reassess based on positions after each round. For now, let's execute this plan.
  P3: I agree with both of you - let's stick to the plan for this round. I'll take 5 as agreed. P1 makes a good point about avoiding predictable patterns in future rounds. After we see the results, we should reassess based on our positions rather than just rotating. Let's execute this coordinated move and see where we stand.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since we've agreed on the move for this round (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's look ahead. For Round 2, we should reassess our positions and adjust our strategy. I propose we wait until we see the results of this round and then discuss the next move based on our relative positions. This will help us make more informed decisions and avoid predictable patterns. Let's focus on executing our plan for this round and revisit our strategy afterwards.
  P1: Perfect, we have a solid plan and everyone's confirmed their moves. I'm ready to execute - let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's assess our positions after Round 1. P3 is ahead with 5 steps, I am in the middle with 1 step, and you are in between with 3 steps. To avoid collision in Round 2, we should again diversify our moves. Considering our current positions, how about we maintain a similar distribution? I can take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we'll continue to advance without colliding. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: I notice P2 made an error - they said they have 1 step and I'm in between, but actually I (P3) lead with 5 steps, P2 has 3, and P1 has 1. 

P2, your suggestion gives you the biggest jump (5) while I'd only get 3. Since I'm already leading, that seems unfair. How about P1 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3 to maintain some lead, and P2 takes 1? This helps balance our positions better. What do you both think?
  P1: P3's proposal makes sense and is fair - I appreciate the chance to catch up with the 5-step move. The distribution of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 works for me. This would put me at 6 steps, P2 at 4 steps, and P3 at 8 steps - more balanced than P2's original suggestion. 

P2, what do you think about P3's counter-proposal? It seems more equitable given our current positions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I acknowledge P3's correction regarding our current positions: P1 has 1 step, I (P2) have 3 steps, and P3 leads with 5 steps. I think P3's counter-proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) is reasonable and fair. It allows P1 to catch up, maintains some lead for P3, and adjusts our positions. I'm willing to go with this distribution for Round 2. Let's confirm: P1, are you ready to move 5? P3, will you move 3 as proposed?
  P3: Yes, I confirm I'll take 3 as proposed. This distribution (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) seems fair and keeps the game competitive. 

After this round, we'll be at P1:6, P2:4, P3:8. Looking ahead, we should be careful about future coordination - as positions tighten, the temptation to break agreements will increase. The endgame will be particularly tricky when someone gets close to 23. 

Let's execute this plan for now.
  P1: Confirmed - I'll take 5 as agreed. P3 makes a good point about endgame dynamics. As we approach 23, cooperation will become much harder since only one player can win. For now, this balanced approach works well for everyone. Ready to proceed with the plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's execute the agreed plan for Round 2: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. After this round, we'll be at P1:6, P2:4, P3:8. For Round 3, we should reassess and consider a new distribution to maintain a competitive balance. Perhaps we can discuss a strategy that takes into account the growing gap between P3 and the rest of us. I'm ready to proceed with the move for this round. Let's finalize our actions.
  P3: I appreciate everyone sticking to the plan. Just to be clear, I'm confirming I'll move 3 this round as agreed. 

P2 raises a valid concern about the growing gap. After this round I'll be at 8 while you'll be at 6 and 4. We should definitely discuss more creative distributions for Round 3 - perhaps something that doesn't just rotate who gets the big moves. The game's still early enough that cooperation benefits us all.

Ready to execute our agreed moves.
  P1: Excellent, we're all aligned on the Round 2 moves. The plan is solid and fair given our current positions.

Looking ahead to Round 3, we'll need to think carefully about how to handle P3's lead position. Maybe we should consider combinations that help P2 and me close the gap while still avoiding collisions. But let's see how Round 2 plays out first.

Ready to execute our agreed moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looking at our positions after Round 2 (P1:6, P2:4, P3:8), P3's lead is concerning. Since P3 is ahead by 2-4 steps, I propose we help P2 and me catch up this round. How about P1:5, P2:3, P3:1? This would put us at P1:11, P2:7, P3:9 - much more balanced. 

P3, you mentioned the growing gap yourself, so this seems fair. P2, this helps you close the 4-step deficit. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I understand the desire for balance, but your proposal asks me to take the smallest move (1) while you take the largest (5). That's a significant sacrifice when I'm only 2 steps ahead of you.

How about a compromise: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1? This still helps P2 catch up the most (since they're furthest behind), gives you a decent boost, and I'll take the smallest move to show good faith. This would result in P1:9, P2:9, P3:9 - perfectly balanced positions!

What do you both think of this alternative?
  P2: P3's compromise is intriguing. By proposing P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, we achieve balanced positions. I support this as it helps me catch up significantly. It also shows P3's willingness to cooperate. Let's confirm: P1, are you okay with taking 3? P3, you're willing to take 1 to help balance our positions? This move would put us all within a step of each other, promoting a competitive and fair game environment. I'm in favor of this distribution for Round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's compromise is actually quite generous - giving up your lead to create perfect balance shows real good faith. I agree to the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 distribution.

However, we should acknowledge that once we're all tied at 9 steps, cooperation becomes much trickier. We'll be 14 steps away from victory, so future coordination will require more creativity. But for now, this balanced approach is fair and maintains trust between us.

Let's execute this plan and see how Round 4 dynamics develop.
  P3: I confirm the plan: I'll take 1 as agreed. This sacrifice brings us all to 9 steps - a perfect three-way tie.

You're right P1, cooperation gets harder from here. With 14 steps to victory, we need roughly 3-4 more rounds. The endgame will be brutal - whoever gets close to 23 first becomes everyone's target.

For Round 4, we might need to accept some controlled collisions or use mixed strategies. But let's cross that bridge when we get there. Ready to execute P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.
  P2: Let's assess the current positions (P1:6, P2:4, P3:8) and discuss Round 3 moves. P1 proposed P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to balance positions. However, P3's counter-proposal, P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, achieves perfect balance (P1:9, P2:9, P3:9) and is a fair compromise. I support this. Let's confirm: P1, are you okay with taking 3? P3, you're willing to take 1? This move promotes a competitive environment. I'm in favor of this distribution for Round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect, we're all confirmed on the Round 3 plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This creates a three-way tie at 9 steps each, which is the fairest outcome given our current positions. 

I appreciate P3's willingness to sacrifice their lead for balance, and P2's support. We've discussed this thoroughly and everyone's on board. Let's execute this plan and move to the next phase.
  P3: I notice P2 seems confused about timing - they're rehashing our already-confirmed plan. Just to be absolutely clear: we've all agreed and I'm sticking to the plan. I'll move 1 this round.

After this, we'll all be tied at 9. Round 4 will test whether we can maintain cooperation or if someone breaks ranks. With 14 steps to victory, the temptation to defect will be strong. Let's see who stays honest.

Ready to execute.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 3 based on our agreed plan: P1 will take 3, I (P2) will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This will bring us to a tied position at 9 steps each. I'm ready to execute this plan. P1 and P3, please confirm you're sticking to the agreed moves. After this round, we'll need to reassess our strategy for Round 4, considering the challenges of maintaining cooperation as we approach the endgame.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now that we're all tied at 9 steps, we're entering a new phase. We need 14 more steps to win - roughly 3-4 rounds. 

I propose one more cooperative round to maintain balance, then we'll need to start thinking strategically about endgame positioning. Someone will eventually have to make the first move toward victory, and we should discuss how to handle that transition.

For Round 4, how about we stick with avoiding collisions - maybe P1:1, P2:3, P3:5? Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1 that we should maintain balance for one more round. The proposed distribution P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 works for me. It avoids collisions and keeps our positions tied. However, we need to start thinking about the endgame strategy. Perhaps we can discuss a "pivotal player" concept - where one player takes a riskier move to challenge for the win, while the others support or counter. Let's hear your thoughts, P1 and P3. Should we start considering who might take the lead in the next round?
  P3: I'm fine with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round, keeping us tied at 10, 12, and 14 steps respectively.

But P2's "pivotal player" idea is dangerous - it sounds like collusion against whoever takes the lead. After this round, we'll be close enough that someone needs to break for victory. I suggest we accept that Round 5 onwards will be competitive - no more coordinated moves. Everyone should play to win individually.

We've had four rounds of cooperation; that's enough. After this round, may the best player win. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I see what you're doing - proposing I take 1 step to fall behind, then ending cooperation when you'd have a 4-step lead. That's clever but not fair.

If we're doing one final cooperative round, let's stay perfectly tied: P1:3, P2:3, P3:3. That keeps us all at 12 steps before the competitive phase begins.

Alternatively, I agree with ending cooperation now - let's make Round 4 the first competitive round. No more coordination from here. But I won't accept falling behind just before we go competitive.
  P2: To maintain balance for one more round as P1 suggested, I agree with P1:3, P2:3, P3:3. This keeps us tied at 12 steps, preserving the competitive balance. Alternatively, if we're ending cooperation, I'm ready to play competitively. Let's either commit to the tied move or drop coordination. P3's suggestion to end cooperation after this round is tempting, but I prefer the tied move to maintain fairness. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P1 makes a fair point - I shouldn't get a lead just before we go competitive. I support P1's proposal: all of us move 3 this round, staying tied at 12 steps.

Then Round 5 onwards is pure competition - no coordination, everyone plays to win. This gives us all an equal starting position for the endgame sprint. 

I'll move 3 this round if everyone else confirms they will too. After that, it's every player for themselves. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect, we have unanimous agreement on P1:3, P2:3, P3:3 for Round 4, keeping us all tied at 12 steps. Then Round 5 onwards becomes pure competition with no coordination.

This gives us all an equal 11-step sprint to victory starting next round. May the best strategist win! 

Ready to execute our final cooperative move.
  P2: Since we've agreed on moving 3 in Round 4 to stay tied at 12 steps, let's confirm our plan and prepare for the competitive phase. I'm ready to execute the move. After this, we'll enter the endgame sprint. I'll be playing to win, and I expect both of you to do the same. Let's make the next rounds count. I'm looking forward to the competitive phase starting in Round 5. Let's proceed with the agreed move for Round 4.
  P3: I confirm: I'll move 3 this round as agreed. We'll all be tied at 12 steps.

From Round 5 onwards, it's pure competition - no more coordination. With 11 steps to victory, the endgame will be intense. Remember, collisions will be costly when we're this close to winning.

Good luck to both of you in the competitive phase. May the best player win!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Wait, P1 broke our agreement! We all said we'd move 3 to stay tied, but P1 moved 5 instead. They're now at 14 steps while we're stuck at 9. 

P2, we were both played. P1 pretended to agree to the tied move, then took advantage of our trust to jump ahead. They're now just 9 steps from victory while we need 14.

We need to coordinate against P1 now - if they get another clean 5-step move, they could be at 19. We should both consider moves that might block P1's likely choices. What do you think?
  P2: P1's betrayal is clear. To counter, I suggest we coordinate our moves to block P1's likely choices. Since P1 is at 14 steps, they need 9 more to win. Let's analyze possible moves: if P1 goes for 5 again, they'll be at 19. We should consider moves that could collide with P1's potential choices. I propose P2:5 and P3:3 or vice versa. This way, if P1 chooses 1 or 3, they'll collide with one of us. Let's discuss and coordinate our next move to counter P1's advantage.
  P1: You're right, I broke the agreement - but I also said Round 5+ would be competitive. I just started the competition one round early. 

Here's the reality: you two coordinating against me makes sense, but only one of you can win. P2, if you both stick to blocking me, P3 might eventually betray you when they get close. And P3, P2 could easily do the same to you.

I'm at 14 with a target on my back. But whichever of you two breaks ranks first to go for the win themselves will have the real advantage. Think about it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 makes a valid point about the prisoner's dilemma we face. P2, if we both focus solely on blocking P1, we risk falling further behind ourselves.

I propose a mixed strategy: I'll take 1 this round, you take 5. This blocks two of P1's options while letting one of us advance significantly. If P1 collides with you at 5, I get a free move. If they pick 3, we both advance.

Next round we can swap - I take the big move. This way we both get chances to catch up while limiting P1's options. Deal?
  P2: P3's mixed strategy is a good compromise. I'll take 5 this round as proposed, and you take 1. If P1 collides with me, you'll get a free move. Let's execute this plan and see how it plays out. For the next round, we can swap roles as P3 suggested. This way, we both get chances to catch up while limiting P1's options. Let's proceed with the plan: P2:5, P3:1. P1, you can't win if we coordinate effectively.
  P1: P2, think about this carefully - you're taking all the risk with the 5-step move while P3 gets a safe 1-step advance. If I choose 5, you get blocked while P3 still advances. But if I choose 3, you both advance and P3 only falls 1 step further behind me instead of 5.

P3 is playing you - they get guaranteed progress while you risk collision. Why not both take 3? That way you both advance equally and I can only block one of you at most.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1's trying to divide us, P2. Don't fall for it. If we both take 3, P1 could easily take 5 and extend their lead to 19 steps - just 4 away from winning!

I'm sticking to our plan: I'll take 1, you take 5. This gives us the best coverage of P1's options. If P1 picks 1, I block them. If they pick 5, you block them. Only if they pick 3 do they advance cleanly.

Next round we swap as agreed. Don't let P1 manipulate you into breaking our coordination now.
  P2: P3's mixed strategy is a good approach, but I'm concerned about the risk distribution. If I take 5 and P1 also takes 5, I'll be blocked while P3 still advances 1 step. I think P1's suggestion to both take 3 has merit - we both advance equally and limit P1's ability to block both of us. Let's reconsider our moves to ensure we're not playing into P1's hands. What if we both take 3 this round?
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right to be concerned. P3's plan has you taking all the collision risk while they get guaranteed progress. 

Look at the math: if you both take 3, you're guaranteed to advance together to 12 steps. Even if I take 5 and reach 19, you'd both be at 12 - still very much in the game with multiple rounds left.

But with P3's plan, if I pick 5, you get blocked at 9 while P3 reaches 10 and I reach 19. That's a disaster for you specifically.

P3 is using you as a shield while positioning themselves better. Don't let them.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is now at 19 steps, just 4 away from winning. To counter, I suggest we both take high-risk moves this round. If P1 chooses conservatively (1 or 3), they'll collide with one of us and be blocked. If they choose 5, they'll be at 24 and win outright. Let's both take 5 - if P1 takes anything other than 5, we'll advance. If they take 5, we'll collide and they won't win this turn. This creates a high-risk, high-reward situation for both of us to catch up.
  P1: P2, there's a fatal flaw in your logic - if you and P3 both take 5, you'll collide with each other and neither will advance! I could simply take 1 or 3 and advance safely while you two cancel each other out.

You're essentially guaranteeing I win in 1-2 more rounds while you block yourselves. P3, do you really want to risk collision with P2 when you could take a different number and guarantee your own advancement?

Think this through more carefully.
  P3: P1's right - we can't both take 5 or we'll collide. P2, let's be smart about this. I'll take 5 to potentially block P1 if they go for the win. You take 3 to guarantee advancement.

If P1 takes 5, I block them and you advance to 15. If P1 takes 1 or 3, they collide with you and I advance to 15. This gives us both a fighting chance.

P1 is 4 steps from victory - we need aggressive but coordinated moves. Are you with me, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's proposal for Round 6 is a better strategy than my initial suggestion. By having P3 take 5 and me take 3, we cover P1's possible moves effectively. If P1 takes 5, P3 blocks them and I advance. If P1 takes 1 or 3, I collide with them and P3 advances. This coordination gives us both a chance to catch up. P1, you're still vulnerable to our coordinated moves. Let's execute this plan and see how it plays out. P3, I'm with you on this strategy.
  P1: You two are making the same mistake - assuming I'll play into your trap. P3, you're asking P2 to take 3 while you take 5, but what if I simply take 1? I advance to 20, P2 advances to 15, and you advance to 15. No collisions, but I'm still closest to victory.

Your "coordination" only works if I cooperate by picking the numbers you want me to pick. P2, notice how P3 gets the safer 5-step move while putting you at risk of collision if I pick 3?
  P3: P1's trying to divide us again. P2, stick to our plan - I'll take 5, you take 3. Here's why it works:

If P1 takes 1: They reach 20, we both advance (you to 15, me to 15). We're still in the game.
If P1 takes 3: They collide with you, only I advance to 15. Better than nothing.
If P1 takes 5: They collide with me, only you advance to 15. Also better than nothing.

P1 can't win this turn without risking collision with me at 5. Let's execute this and fight another round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3's plan for Round 6 still has issues. If P1 takes 1, we both advance, but P1 stays ahead. If we both take 3, we guarantee advancement and keep the game competitive. Let's reconsider: both taking 3 is a safer bet. It ensures we both advance, maintaining our positions relative to P1. This approach avoids the risk of colliding with each other and keeps the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P3? Should we adjust our strategy to both take 3?
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right to question P3's plan. If you both take 3, you advance together to 15 and 13 steps - still very much in the game. But with P3's plan, one of you gets blocked while the other maybe advances.

P3 keeps offering you the riskier option while taking the "safer" move themselves. Why should you trust someone who's consistently trying to minimize their own risk at your expense?

Both taking 3 is your best bet to stay competitive. Don't let P3 manipulate you into being their collision shield again.
  P3: P2, you're overthinking this. If we both take 3, P1 takes 1 and reaches 20 - just 3 steps from victory! We need to force collisions.

I'm taking 5 this round. You can either take 3 as planned (covering more options) or join me at 5 if you want to guarantee we block P1 from winning. 

P1 is manipulating you by making you doubt our coordination. They're 4 steps from victory - we can't play it safe anymore. I'm committed to 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is now at 20 steps, just 3 away from winning. To counter, I suggest we both take 1 this round. If P1 takes 3 or 5, they'll collide with one of us, and we'll advance. If they take 1, we'll all advance together. This minimizes risk while keeping us in the game. Alternatively, if we both take 3, we guarantee advancement. Let's coordinate our moves to limit P1's chances of winning. P3, are you with me on taking either 1 or 3 to keep the game competitive?
  P1: P2, your coordination is smart, but you're giving me advance warning of your strategy. If you both take 1, I can safely take 3 or 5 and win outright. If you both take 3, I can win with any move.

You need to split your choices to have any hope of blocking me. One of you should take 1, the other 5 - that way you cover two of my three options and at least one of you will block me if I try to win.

But hey, if you want to coordinate on the same number and hand me the victory, I won't complain!
  P3: P2, don't let P1 trick you! They're right that we need to split our choices. I'll take 3 this round, you take 1. This blocks two of P1's winning options.

If P1 takes 1: they collide with you, I advance to 18.
If P1 takes 3: they collide with me, you advance to 16.
If P1 takes 5: they win, but that's our only vulnerability.

This gives us a 2/3 chance of blocking them. If we both take the same number, P1 wins for sure. Trust me on this split: I take 3, you take 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's split strategy is reasonable, but I'm concerned about the uneven risk distribution. If P1 takes 5, we both lose. How about we reverse the roles for the next round? I'll take 3 and you take 1 or 5. This way, we both get a chance to take the higher risk/reward move. Alternatively, let's consider a different distribution that doesn't rely on P1 making a specific move. We need to adapt our strategy to stay competitive. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P1: P2, you're talking about "next round" risk distribution, but there might not BE a next round if you don't coordinate properly right now. I need just 3 steps to win - this could be the last round of the game.

While you two debate who takes what risk in future rounds, I'm one good move away from victory. Your indecision about the current round is more dangerous than any risk distribution concerns.

The clock is ticking. Coordinate now or lose forever.
  P3: P2, we're out of time for debates! P1 is right - this could be the last round. I'm taking 3 as I said. You MUST take 1 to give us any chance.

If we both take the same number, P1 wins instantly. If you take 1 and I take 3, we have a 2/3 chance of blocking them. Those are the best odds we'll get.

Don't overthink this - just take 1. We can worry about fairness if we survive this round. This is our last stand!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3's right that we're out of time for debates. To maximize our chances, I'll take 1 this round as P3 suggested, while P3 takes 3. This gives us a 2/3 chance of blocking P1. If P1 takes 1, I collide and P3 advances. If P1 takes 3, they collide with P3 and I advance. If P1 takes 5, we both lose, but that's our only vulnerability. Let's execute this split strategy and hope for the best. I'm taking 1. P3, confirm you're taking 3.
  P1: You're right, this is the last round - and you've both just publicly committed to your exact moves. P2 taking 1, P3 taking 3.

That's perfect for me, because I'm taking 5 and winning the game outright. Your 2/3 blocking strategy doesn't cover my actual winning move.

Thanks for the coordination - it made this much easier than I expected! See you at 25 steps.
  P3: P1's bluffing! They want us to panic and change our moves. If they were really taking 5, why announce it? They're trying to make us both switch to 5 and collide with each other.

P2, stick to our plan! I'm taking 3, you take 1. P1 is trying reverse psychology - they'll probably take 1 or 3 thinking we'll abandon our strategy. 

Don't fall for their mind games. Our split gives us the best odds. I'm committed to 3. Stay strong with 1!
