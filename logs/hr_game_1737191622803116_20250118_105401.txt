Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's discuss our strategies. We should think about how to avoid colliding with each other while still making progress. What are your thoughts on the moves we might choose?
  P2: Agreed, P1. Maybe we can each pick different step sizes each turn to avoid collisions.
  P3: P3: That sounds reasonable. How about we each choose a different move for this round? I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I like the idea of each taking a different move. I’ll stick with <move>1</move> as suggested, and I encourage you both to follow through with <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. This way, we can all make progress without colliding. What do you think?
  P2: Agreed, I'll proceed with <move>3</move> as suggested.
  P3: P3: Sounds like a solid plan. I'll stick with <move>5</move> as discussed. Let's avoid collisions and see how this strategy works out for us.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's stick to our plan and avoid collisions. I'm ready to move as we discussed. Just to confirm, I'll be taking <move>1</move>. How about you both?

  P3: P3: I'll stick with <move>5</move> as planned. Let's avoid collisions and see how this strategy plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I see there's some confusion. P2, you mentioned taking <move>5</move>, but that's the same as P3's choice. Let's stick to our original plan: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress without colliding. Are we all set?
  P2: Sorry for the confusion. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as agreed.
  P3: P3: Great, we're all set then. I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. Let's stick to our choices and make progress without colliding.
