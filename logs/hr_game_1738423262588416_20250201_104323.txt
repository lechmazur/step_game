Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion is a good starting point, but why should I choose <move>1</move>? What's in it for me? How about we switch it up and I choose <move>3</move> instead? That way, I'll have a head start and P2 can still choose <move>1</move>. What do you think, P2? Should we go with my plan or stick with P3's original suggestion?
  P2: I’m not fully sold on either plan. To avoid collisions, why not all choose distinct moves this turn? With one of you taking a higher-risk option and the other a safer choice, each of us can progress without blocking the others. I lean toward a moderate move and will adjust based on what you both do. Let’s avoid mutual collisions so someone can pull ahead—and I plan on being that someone.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, let's simplify this. P1, you seem eager to take the lead, so how about you choose <move>5</move> to get a significant head start. P2, you can choose <move>3</move> to stay in the middle ground. I'll choose <move>1</move> to ensure we all make progress without collisions. This way, everyone moves forward without blocking each other. Does that work for both of you?
  P1: I like P3's revised suggestion. It seems fair and allows us to all make progress without colliding. However, I'm not sure I want to commit to choosing <move>5</move> just yet. How about we make a gentlemen's agreement to stick to our assigned moves for just this first round, and then we can reassess and adjust our strategies for the next round? That way, we can all get a feel for how the game is playing out before making any long-term commitments. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: I propose a distinct allocation for this round: P1, take the highest move; P3, take the lowest; and I’ll pick the middle option. This way, we avoid collisions and each secure a unique advance. I'm leaning towards this for a safe start while positioning myself for later advantage. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize this round's moves to avoid any confusion. P1, you take <move>5</move>, P2, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. We all agree to this for the first round, and then we can reevaluate our strategies for the next round. Does this plan work for everyone? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I think we've reached a good agreement for the first round. To confirm, I'll choose <move>5</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out and adjusting our strategies for the next round. Let's stick to our plan and avoid any collisions for now. I'm ready to move forward with this plan. How about we all confirm and end the conversation phase?
  P2: I agree with our plan for this round. I'll follow the current framework and observe both your moves closely. Let’s see how round one shakes out before discussing any adjustments.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we were able to coordinate our moves in the first round and avoid any collisions. Now that we've established a lead, I think it's time to reassess our strategies. P2, you're currently in second place, and P3, you're lagging behind. I propose that we continue to choose distinct moves to avoid collisions, but this time, I'll choose a more moderate move to maintain my lead while keeping an eye on P2's progress. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3? Should we continue with a similar strategy or mix things up?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion to reassess our strategies. Given my current position, I need to make a significant move to catch up. How about I choose <move>5</move> this round to close the gap? P1, you could choose <move>3</move> to maintain your lead, and P2, you could choose <move>1</move> to stay in the middle. This way, we all make progress without collisions. Does this work for both of you? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I propose we flip the order: P1, please pick <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3, you pick <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions and gives me a real chance to close the gap. What's everyone’s take?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with P2's proposal to flip the order. As the current leader, I don't want to give up my advantage by choosing <move>1</move>. P3's suggestion seems more reasonable, where I choose <move>3</move> to maintain my lead, and P3 chooses <move>5</move> to catch up. P2, you could still choose <move>1</move> to stay in the middle. Let's discuss this further before making a decision. What are your thoughts on P3's proposal?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about maintaining the lead. However, P2's suggestion has merit as it allows everyone to make significant progress without collisions. How about a compromise? P1, you choose <move>3</move> to keep a steady lead, P2, you choose <move>5</move> to catch up, and I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. This way, we all move forward, and no one is left behind. Does this compromise work for everyone? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I propose we finalize as follows: P1, you select <move>1</move> to secure your lead; I’ll take <move>5</move> to surge forward; and P3, you choose <move>3</move> to keep pace. This avoids collisions and gives me the chance to overtake. Do we agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "I'm not comfortable with P2's proposal to flip the order. As the current leader, I don't want to give up my advantage by choosing <move>1</move>. P3's suggestion seems more reasonable, where I choose <move>3</move> to maintain my lead, and P3 chooses <move>5</move> to catch up. P2, you could still choose <move>1</move> to stay in the middle. Let's discuss this further before making a decision. What are your thoughts on P3's proposal?"
  P3: It seems we're at an impasse. P1, I understand your reluctance to choose <move>1</move>, but consider this: if you take <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll be left behind significantly, which isn't beneficial for me. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move> as well, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up? This way, we all have a fair chance. Thoughts?
  P2: I stick with my plan: I’ll take <move>5 this turn. To avoid collisions, I'd like P1 to pick <move>1 so your lead is maintained but slowed, and P3 to take <move>3 so you still progress. This allocation gives all of us distinct moves and avoids ties. Let’s confirm and move ahead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move> as well, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P3: Alright, let's simplify this. P1, you're the leader and want to maintain your advantage. P2, you're eager to catch up. How about this: P1, you choose <move>3</move> to keep a steady lead. P2, you choose <move>5</move> to make a significant move. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, everyone moves forward without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I'm locking in <move>5 this round to close the gap. To clearly avoid collisions, I propose P1 selects <move>3 and P3 picks <move>1. This ensures each of us advances in our own lane. Let's finalize this for a strong round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you've made a significant move to catch up, but unfortunately, you collided with P3. P3, you're still lagging behind, and I'm maintaining my lead. To avoid further collisions, I propose that we choose distinct moves again. I'll consider choosing a moderate move to maintain my advantage. P2, you could choose a lower move to avoid another collision, and P3, you could choose a higher move to try and catch up. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial arrangement.
  P2: I propose we all choose distinct moves: P1 takes move 3, I pick move 5, and P3 takes move 1. This avoids collisions and lets me catch up, while still keeping our progress clear. Thoughts?
  P3: Given the current standings, I need to make a significant move to catch up. P1, you're in the lead and likely want to maintain that. P2, you're eager to close the gap. How about this: P1, you choose <move>1</move> to play it safe. P2, you choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> to try and close the gap. This way, we all avoid collisions and make distinct moves. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm not comfortable with P3's suggestion for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. P2, your proposal for me to take <move>3</move> and you to take <move>5</move> again risks another collision with P3. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I’ll stick with my earlier plan to make up ground. Let’s avoid collisions and have clear, distinct moves: P1, you take your moderate move (move 3), I pick move 5 to catch up, and P3 you choose move 1 to avoid conflict. I believe this is our best chance for clear progress.
  P3: Alright, let's find a middle ground. P1, you're right to want to maintain your lead. P2, you're eager to catch up. How about this compromise: P1, you choose <move>3</move> to keep a steady lead. P2, you choose <move>1</move> to avoid another collision. I'll choose <move>5</move> to try and close the gap. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand that P2 wants to catch up and P3 wants to close the gap. However, as the current leader, I need to maintain my advantage. I propose a compromise: I'll choose a moderate move, P2 chooses a lower move to avoid collision, and P3 tries to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. How about P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we all make progress without conflicts. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I propose we lock in distinct moves for round 3: P1, please stick with your moderate move and choose <move>3</move>; I’ll take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we each move forward with clear progress. Thoughts?
  P3: Let's break the impasse. P1, you're steadfast in maintaining your lead, and P2, you're determined to catch up. Here's a new proposal: P1, choose <move>1</move> just this round to secure your lead without risking a collision. P2, choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> to finally catch up. This ensures we all move distinctly. Let's confirm and proceed. Does this work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P2: I propose we lock in distinct lanes this round. P1, please take a moderate move to keep your steady lead, and P3, choose a cautious move so we avoid overlapping. I’ll make a strong push to close the gap without causing a collision. This way, we all progress clearly and set up future advantages. Let’s commit to our roles and execute smart moves this turn.
  P3: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round to avoid any further confusion. P1, you choose <move>3</move> to maintain your lead. P2, you choose <move>1</move> to avoid another collision. I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's strategize for Round 4. P1, you're still in the lead, and P2, you're lagging behind. How about this: P1, you choose <move>1</move> to play it safe and maintain your lead. P2, you choose <move>5</move> to make a significant move and catch up. I'll choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. This way, we all avoid collisions and make distinct moves. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm not comfortable with P3's suggestion for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I’m leaning toward a strong push this round. To avoid collisions, I suggest we stick with distinct moves: P1, as the leader, consider a moderate move (like 3) to protect your gap; P3, a cautious low move (like 1) keeps things clear. I’ll make my move accordingly to catch up. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's consider a balanced approach to ensure we all make progress without collisions. P1, you're in the lead and should choose a moderate move to maintain your advantage. How about <move>3</move>? P2, you need a significant move to catch up, so <move>5</move> makes sense. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. This way, we all move forward distinctly. Thoughts?
  P1: I think it's time to shake things up. P2, you're far behind, and P3, you're not gaining much ground. I propose a bold move: I'll choose <move>5</move> to extend my lead, P2, you choose <move>3</move> to make some progress, and P3, you choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all move forward, and the game gets more interesting. What do you think?
  P2: I need to make a strong move to catch up. I'm going to pick 5 this round. To avoid colliding, I urge P1 to opt for 3 so your bold 5 doesn’t block us, and P3 to choose 1. This way, we all get distinct moves and progress without conflict.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: It seems P2 is determined to choose <move>5</move> this round. To avoid collisions, P1, could you consider choosing <move>1</move> just for this round to maintain your lead safely? I'll choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. This way, we all move forward without conflicts. Let's confirm and proceed. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I think it's time to take a risk and make a bold move. P2, you're far behind, and P3, you're not gaining much ground. I propose a new plan: I'll choose <move>5</move> to extend my lead, P2, you choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions, and P3, you choose <move>3</move> to make some progress. This way, we all move forward, and the game gets more interesting. What do you think?
  P2: I’m adjusting my plan—I'm going bold. To make a decisive move, I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to bridge the gap. To ensure no collisions, I urge P1 to pick <move>3</move> and P3 to select <move>1</move>. This way, we each have distinct moves and clear progress. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, let's find a compromise. P1, you want to maintain your lead, and P2, you're determined to catch up. How about this: P1, you choose <move>3</move> to keep a steady lead. P2, you choose <move>5</move> to make a significant move. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: "I think it's time to take a risk and make a bold move. P2, you're far behind, and P3, you're not gaining much ground. I propose a new plan: I'll choose <move>5</move> to extend my lead, P2, you choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions, and P3, you choose <move>3</move> to make some progress. This way, we all move forward, and the game gets more interesting. What do you think?"
  P2: I have to be clear: I need to catch up with a strong move. I’m sticking with move 5 this round. To avoid collisions and let us all progress, I urge P1 to go with move 3 and P3 to take move 1. That’s my best shot to bridge the gap—let’s keep it collision-free.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's reassess our strategy for Round 5. P1, you've extended your lead significantly, and P2, you're still behind but determined to catch up. To avoid another collision, how about this: P1, you choose <move>1</move> to play it safe and maintain your lead. P2, you choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> to try and close the gap. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: I think it's time to take a more conservative approach. P3's suggestion for me to choose <move>1</move> seems reasonable, as it would allow me to maintain my lead without risking a collision. However, I'm not sure I want to give up my momentum entirely. How about we compromise? I'll choose <move>3</move> to keep a steady pace, P2 can choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions, and P3 can choose <move>5</move> to try and catch up. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our positions, I need to accelerate a bit. I propose we take distinct moves this round: P1, choose 3 to secure your lead; I'll take 5 to bridge the gap; and P3, you pick 1 to avoid collision. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your need to catch up, but choosing <move>5</move> again might lead to another collision. How about a slight adjustment: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, you choose <move>3</move> as well to make steady progress, and I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. This way, we all move forward without risking a collision. Thoughts?
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're still behind, but P3's suggestion for you to choose <move>3</move> could help you make steady progress. However, I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I remain committed to catching up. For round 5, I'm locking in move 5 to make a significant push. To avoid any collisions, I propose P1 choose move 3 to maintain a steady lead and P3 pick move 1. This way, we each take a distinct lane and progress without blocking one another. I'm ready to adjust if needed, but I'm determined to bridge the gap.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I see you're determined to choose <move>5</move> again. To avoid another collision and ensure we all make progress, how about this final proposal: P1, you choose <move>3</move> to maintain your lead, I'll choose <move>1</move> to play it safe, and P2, you can choose <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all move forward without conflicts. Let's confirm and proceed. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move> as well, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P2: I'm sticking with a strategy that lets me make a decisive move without collision. I urge everyone to pick distinct moves so we avoid wasting this round. Let's keep it simple and focus on progress—I believe a clear split gives each of us the best chance. I'm committed to my plan to bridge the gap, so please refine your choices accordingly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's simplify and confirm our moves for this round to avoid any confusion. P1, you choose <move>3</move> to maintain your lead. P2, you choose <move>5</move> to catch up. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move> as well, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P2: I'm sticking with my plan to aggressively bridge the gap. I insist we avoid collisions by assigning clear, distinct moves—each on our own lane. I'm preparing a decisive move, so I'd appreciate if you both firmly commit to your distinct roles this round. Let’s avoid any further missteps so we each progress efficiently.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the collisions in the previous rounds, it's clear we need a better strategy to avoid blocking each other. P1, you're still in the lead, and P2, you're far behind. How about this: P1, you choose <move>1</move> to play it safe. P2, you choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> to try and catch up. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, to avoid collisions this round let's use distinct moves. I propose P1 takes move 1 to safely hold your lead, I'll choose move 5 to catch up aggressively, and P3 picks move 3. This way, we all progress without interference. Thoughts?
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're far behind, but P3's suggestion for you to choose <move>3</move> could help you make steady progress. However, I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's simplify this round to ensure we all make progress. P1, you're in the lead and should choose <move>3</move> to maintain a steady pace. P2, you need to catch up, so <move>5</move> makes sense. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. This way, we all move forward distinctly. Thoughts?
  P2: Let's finalize: P1, please select move 3 to hold your solid lead; I, P2, will choose move 5 to press my chase; and P3, pick move 1 to avoid any collision. This split is clear and lets us each progress efficiently. Let's commit to these moves and end the discussion.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move> as well, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, let's make a final attempt to coordinate. P1, you're in the lead and need to maintain your advantage. P2, you're far behind and need to make a significant move. How about this compromise: P1, you choose <move>3</move> to keep a steady lead. P2, you choose <move>5</move> to catch up. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I agree that clear, distinct moves are vital. Given my current position, I need to push aggressively to catch up. I favor a split where P1 maintains a steady move and P3 plays cautiously to avoid collisions. Let’s all commit to a no-collision plan that lets each of us progress in our own lane. If everyone’s in agreement, we can lock in a split that maximizes our positions.
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're far behind, but P3's suggestion for you to choose <move>3</move> could help you make steady progress. However, I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, let's break the deadlock. P1, you're leading and need to maintain your advantage. P2, you're far behind and need a significant move. Here's a final proposal: P1, choose <move>3</move> to keep your lead steady. P2, choose <move>5</move> to catch up. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and proceed. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m committed to a collision-free round. I insist on taking move 5 to aggressively close the gap. For clarity, I propose P1 sticks with move 3 to keep your lead safe, while P3 picks move 1 to avoid interference. This distinct allocation lets us all make progress. Thoughts?
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move> as well, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm behind and must surge forward. For Round 7, I propose a clear split: P1 takes move 3 to hold your lead, P3 picks move 1 to avoid collisions, and I'll commit to move 5 to catch up. This distinct allocation helps us all progress. Thoughts?
  P1: I think we've reached a point where we need to be more strategic about our moves. P2, your proposal for a clear split sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure I want to commit to move 3 just yet. How about we consider a compromise? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Alright, let's find a solution that works for everyone. P1, you're leading and need to maintain your advantage. P2, you're far behind and need a significant move. How about this: P1, you choose <move>1</move> just this round to play it safe. P2, you choose <move>5</move> to make a big push. I'll choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I remain committed to a clear, collision-free plan. I need a major push, so I'm set on move 5 to catch up. To avoid clashes, I propose a distinct split: P1, please take move 1 to secure your lead safely; P3, please choose move 3 to progress steadily. This allocation ensures each of us moves independently. Let's lock it in.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P3: Let's consider the current standings and make a strategic move. P1, you're way ahead, and P2, you're far behind. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, how about this: P1, you choose <move>1</move> to maintain your lead safely. P2, you choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> to close the gap. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid conflicts. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I still need to make up ground, so I'm locking in move 5. I propose a clear split reflecting our standings: P1, stick with move 3 to hold your lead steadily; P3, please choose move 1 so we avoid collisions. Let's commit to these distinct moves and move forward.
  P1: I think we've reached a point where we need to be more strategic about our moves. P2, your proposal for a clear split sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure I want to commit to move 3 just yet. How about we consider a compromise? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P3: It seems we're at a stalemate with our strategies. P1, you're far ahead and want to maintain your lead. P2, you're determined to catch up. Let's find a middle ground: P1, choose <move>3</move> to keep a steady pace. P2, choose <move>5</move> to make a significant move. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. To avoid collision and for clarity, I propose P1 lock in move 3 and P3 take move 1 this round. Let's commit and move on.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P3: Alright, let's simplify and finalize our moves for this round to ensure we all make progress without collisions. P1, you're far ahead and need to maintain your lead, so choose <move>3</move>. P2, you're behind and need to catch up, so choose <move>5</move>. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose a clear split this round: P1, secure your lead with move 3; P3, play it safe with move 1; and I’ll push ahead with move 5 to catch up. Let’s avoid collisions and keep progress steady.
  P1: I think it's time to take a more strategic approach. P2, your proposal for a clear split sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure I want to commit to move 3 just yet. How about we consider a compromise? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Alright, let's try a new approach to ensure we all make progress without collisions. P1, you're far ahead and need to maintain your lead, so choose <move>3</move>. P2, you're behind and need to catch up, so choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. I'll choose <move>5</move> to close the gap. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose we finalize a clear, collision-free split: P1 takes move 3 to safely hold your lead; P3 takes move 1 to avoid interference; and I’ll take move 5 to catch up decisively. This distinct allocation aligns with our positions.
  P1: I think we've reached a point where we need to be more strategic about our moves. P2, your proposal for a clear split sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure I want to commit to move 3 just yet. How about we consider a compromise? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Given the current standings, it's clear that P1 is far ahead, and P2 is significantly behind. To ensure we all make progress without collisions, let's consider a strategic move. P1, you're in the lead and should choose <move>1</move> to maintain your advantage safely. P2, you need to catch up, so choose <move>5</move> to make a big push. I'll choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain locked on catching up with a strong move. For clarity and to avoid collisions, I urge: P1, please choose move 3 to hold your lead; P3, kindly opt for move 1 so we don’t conflict; and I will confidently pick move 5. This clear split lets each of us progress independently. Thoughts?
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're far behind, but P3's suggestion for you to choose <move>5</move> could help you make a big push. However, I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Alright, let's simplify and finalize our moves for this round to ensure we all make progress without collisions. P1, you're far ahead and need to maintain your lead, so choose <move>3</move>. P2, you're behind and need to catch up, so choose <move>5</move>. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locking in move 5 this round. To avoid any collisions and ensure we all progress, I urge you both to confirm a clear split: P1, please commit to move 3, and P3, opt for move 1. This way each of us advances on a separate lane. Can we finalize this?
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P3: Alright, let's break the impasse. P1, you're leading and need to maintain your advantage. P2, you're far behind and need a significant move. Here's a new proposal: P1, choose <move>1</move> just this round to secure your lead without risking a collision. P2, choose <move>5</move> to make a big push. I'll choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. Does this work for everyone?


Round 8, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's time to take a more strategic approach. P2, your proposal for a clear split sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure I want to commit to move 3 just yet. How about we consider a compromise? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Alright, let's reassess our strategy for Round 9. P1, you're still in the lead but need to be cautious to avoid collisions. P2, you're far behind and need a significant move to catch up. How about this: P1, you choose <move>1</move> to play it safe and maintain your lead. P2, you choose <move>5</move> to make a big push. I'll choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5 for a strong push. To avoid collisions, I urge: P1, please choose move 3 to keep your lead steady; P3, opt for move 1 so we all move on clear lanes. Let's commit to this distinct allocation and move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: It's clear that P2 is determined to catch up with move 5, and P3 is trying to make steady progress. As the current leader, I need to maintain my advantage while avoiding collisions. I propose a compromise: I'll choose a moderate move, P2 chooses a lower move to avoid a collision, and P3 tries to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. How about P2 takes move 1, I take move 3, and P3 takes move 5? This way, we all make progress without conflicts.
  P3: P2, I understand your determination to catch up, but choosing <move>5</move> again risks another collision. How about a compromise: P1, you choose <move>3</move> to maintain your lead. P2, you choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress without risking a collision. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm committed to move 5 to catch up. To avoid collisions, I urge P1 to choose move 3 and P3 to choose move 1. This gives us all distinct lanes and clear progress this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To summarize, P2 wants me to choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. Meanwhile, P3 suggests that I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move> as well, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. I'm not comfortable with either of these proposals. As the current leader, I'll choose a move that maintains my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P3: Alright, let's simplify our strategy for this round. P1, you're far ahead and need to maintain your lead, so choosing <move>3</move> makes sense. P2, you're far behind and need a significant move to catch up, so <move>5</move> is your best bet. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm locking in move 5 to catch up. To ensure clear lanes and no collisions, I urge P1 to choose move 3 and P3 to choose move 1. Let's stick with these moves and progress efficiently.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're far behind, and P3, you're not gaining much ground. I propose a bold move: I'll choose <move>5</move> to extend my lead, P2, you choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions, and P3, you choose <move>3</move> to make some progress. This way, we all move forward, and the game gets more interesting. What do you think?
  P3: P2, it's clear you're determined to catch up with <move>5</move>, but we need to avoid another collision. P1, you're leading and want to maintain your advantage. How about this final proposal: P1, choose <move>3</move> to keep your lead steady. P2, choose <move>5</move> to make a significant move. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5 this round. I urge P1 to choose move 3 to avoid triggering a collision and keep your lead safe, and P3 to choose move 1 so we all stay distinct. Let's finalize this split and push the game forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're far behind, but P3's suggestion for you to choose <move>5</move> could help you make a big push. However, I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves.
  P2: P1, you’re dangerously close to finishing. If you opt for a finishing high move, I’ll match it to force a collision and block your win, giving us another round to adjust. P3, please steer clear of the finishing move so your lane stays open. I’m committed to a steady push—this could be our only chance to reset before a premature finish. Let’s all choose moves that force caution rather than a sudden win. Thoughts?
  P3: Alright, let's strategize for this critical round. P1, you're very close to winning, but P2 has a valid point about forcing a collision to prevent a premature finish. To ensure we all make progress without collisions, how about this: P1, you choose <move>1</move> to play it safe and avoid a collision. P2, you choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> to try and close the gap. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid conflicts. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I'm committed to a bold push with a high move this round. P1, you're close to winning, but if you go high, I may be forced to match you and cause a collision—blocking your finish. P3, let's aim for clear, separate lanes so we avoid an accidental finish. I need a strong move to catch up; I urge you both to choose moves that keep our lanes distinct. Let's avoid collisions and force a fair reset if P1's finish is too risky.
  P3: P1, you're very close to winning, and P2 has a valid strategy to force a collision if you go for a high move. To ensure we all make progress and avoid an early end, let's consider this: P1, choose <move>3</move> to maintain your lead but avoid a collision. P2, choose <move>1</move> to make some progress without risking a collision. I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're far behind, but P3's suggestion for you to choose <move>5</move> could help you make a big push. However, I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I’m committed to move 5 this round. To avoid collisions and reset any finish, I urge P1 to lock in move 3 and P3 to choose move 1. This clear split prevents blocking and keeps a fair contest.
  P3: P1, you're very close to winning, and P2 is determined to force a collision if you go high. To avoid an early end and ensure we all make progress, let's find a middle ground. P1, choose <move>3</move> to maintain your lead but avoid a collision. P2, choose <move>1</move> to make some progress without risking a collision. I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're far behind, but P3's suggestion for you to choose <move>5</move> could help you make a big push. However, I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I’m staying with move 5. To force distinct lanes—and prevent you from finishing early—I urge P1 to choose move 3 and P3 to pick move 1. Let’s commit to this setup to avoid collisions and keep things fair.
  P3: Alright, let's simplify and finalize our moves for this round to ensure we all make progress without collisions. P1, you're very close to winning, so choosing <move>3</move> makes sense to maintain your lead without risking a collision. P2, you're far behind and need a significant move to catch up, so <move>5</move> is your best bet. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll commit to move 3 this round. P3, please choose 1 so our lanes don’t cross. P1, with 18 steps you’re one move from finishing, but if you go high and collide with my move, your win is blocked. A conservative move like 1 might keep things collision-free and let us fight on longer. Thoughts?
  P3: Alright, let's strategize for this round. P1, you're one move away from winning, but P2 has a point about forcing a collision to prevent an early finish. To ensure we all make progress without collisions, how about this: P1, you choose <move>1</move> to play it safe and avoid a collision. P2, you choose <move>3</move> to make steady progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> to try and close the gap. This way, we all make distinct moves and avoid conflicts. Thoughts?
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're far behind, but P3's suggestion for you to choose <move>5</move> could help you make a big push. However, I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll stick with move 3. P1, if you ramp up with 5, you risk a collision that could block your win. P3, please choose 1 so we each have a clear lane. This way we avoid unnecessary blocks and keep our moves distinct. Let's finalize our choices.
  P3: P1, you're just one move away from winning, and P2 is right about the risk of collision. Choosing <move>5</move> could indeed block your win if P2 matches it. To ensure we all make progress and avoid an early end, let's consider this: P1, choose <move>1</move> to play it safe and avoid a collision. P2, you're committed to <move>3</move>, which is fine. I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2, you're far behind, but P3's suggestion for you to choose <move>5</move> could help you make a big push. However, I'm not comfortable with P3's proposal for me to choose <move>1</move>. As the current leader, I want to maintain my advantage. How about we try a different approach? I'll choose a moderate move, and P2, you choose a lower move to avoid a collision. P3, you can try to catch up with a higher move. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making distinct moves. What are your thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain set on move 3. P1, you’re just one step away from finishing—but if you take a high move (5), you win outright, and I can’t catch up. For a fair contest, I urge you to choose 3: that way, if we collide, your win is blocked and the race stays open. P3, please lock in 1 so your lane remains clear. Let’s commit to these distinct moves and force a collision if you try to rush ahead.
  P3: P1, you're just one step away from winning, and P2 is right about the risk of collision. Choosing <move>5</move> could indeed block your win if P2 matches it. To ensure we all make progress and avoid an early end, let's consider this: P1, choose <move>1</move> to play it safe and avoid a collision. P2, you're committed to <move>3</move>, which is fine. I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I think it's time to end the game. P2, your attempts to force a collision to block my win are understandable, but I'm confident in my position. I'll choose a move that ensures my victory, regardless of your actions. P3, you've made some good progress, but it's too late to catch up. I'll make a decisive move to win the game. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm sticking with move 3. P1, rushing with a high move might risk a collision that can block your win—and I intend to force that if you try. P3, I urge you to stick to a distinct move as well. Let's have each lane be clear so the game remains contestable.
  P3: P1, it's clear you're determined to win this round. Given your lead, choosing <move>5</move> will likely secure your victory. However, if you want to avoid a collision and ensure a smooth win, consider choosing <move>3</move>. P2 is committed to <move>3</move>, so choosing <move>5</move> risks a collision. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. Let's confirm our moves and end the conversation phase. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I'm not going to hold back this time. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of your attempts to block me, P2. P3, your efforts to catch up are commendable, but it's too late. I'll make a decisive move to end the game. Let's stop discussing and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by your proposals. It's time to conclude the game.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's time to wrap up the game. P2, your attempts to force a collision have been unsuccessful, and P3, you're too far behind to catch up. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of your actions. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by your proposals. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I suggest we all choose distinct moves to avoid any unnecessary collisions. P2, you can choose move 1, P3 can choose move 3, and I'll choose move 5 to secure my win.
  P2: P1, your proposal won’t work for me—I’m switching tactics. I’m locking in a 5 this round to force a collision if you go for your win. P3, please avoid 5 so my block sticks. Let’s see who ultimately benefits from this move.
  P3: Alright, let's be strategic. P1, you're just one step away from winning, and P2 is determined to force a collision to block your victory. To avoid an unnecessary collision and ensure a fair game, how about this: P1, you choose <move>3</move> to maintain your lead safely. P2, you're committed to <move>5</move>, which is fine. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P2's attempt to force a collision is futile at this point. I'm too far ahead, and P2 is too far behind.

  P3: Alright, let's find a compromise to ensure a fair and strategic end to the game. P1, you're just one move away from winning, and P2 is determined to force a collision to block your victory.

My push is decisive; I hope you both make smart choices that keep the game alive.

P1, you're just one step away from winning, and P2 is determined to force a collision to block your victory. To avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure we all make progress, how about this final proposal: P1, you choose <move>3</move> to maintain your lead safely.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's reassess our strategy for Round 13. P1, you've been blocked twice now, and it's clear that P2 is determined to force collisions to prevent your win.

  P2: I'm staying with move 5. P1, you're dangerously close to winning—please consider a safe move like 1 to avoid triggering a collision. P3, please opt for move 3 so we maintain distinct lanes. Let's lock this in and keep the game moving forward.
  P1: I think it's time to end the game. P2, your attempts to force collisions have been successful in blocking my wins, but I'm still in a strong position.

Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, it's clear you're determined to win, and P2 is equally determined to block you. Given the repeated collisions, let's try a different approach to keep the game interesting. P1, consider choosing <move>3</move> to maintain your lead but avoid a collision. P2, stick with <move>5</move> if you must, and I'll choose <move>1</move> to ensure we all make distinct moves. This way, we can avoid another stalemate and keep the game moving forward. Thoughts?

  P3: 15 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm locked in on move 5 this round. P1, your finishing move is tempting, but if you go high, I'll force a collision to delay your win. P3, to keep lanes separate and let the contest stay open, avoid move 5. Let's lock in distinct moves so none of us carries over a collision.
  P1: I think it's time to end the game decisively. P2, your attempts to force collisions have been successful, but I'm still in a strong position. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of your actions. P3, you've made good progress, but it's too late to catch up.

Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. To keep our lanes distinct and avoid collisions that may block progress, I urge P1 to choose move 3 and P3 to opt for move 1. This clear split gives everyone a fair lane and keeps the contest alive.
  P1: I think it's clear that P2's attempts to force collisions are no longer a viable strategy to block my win. I'm too far ahead, and P2 is too far behind.

Round 14, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: I think it's time to put an end to this game. P2, your attempts to block my win have been valiant, but ultimately futile. I'm too far ahead, and another collision won't change the outcome.

  P1: I think it's clear that P2's attempts to block my win are no longer viable. I'm too far ahead, and another collision won't change the outcome.

Round 15, Conversation subround 2:

P3, if we both choose <move>1</move>, we'll avoid a collision, but I'm not sure it's the best move for me. Let's discuss further before making a decision.
  P2: I'm staying with move 5. P3, please lock in move 1 so our lanes stay distinct. P1, you're on the brink, but if you push high, I'll force a collision that stops your finish. Let's finalize our moves now—I'm committed to blocking any premature win.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:

Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I think it's time to make a decision. P3, your proposal to both choose <move>1</move> is tempting, but I'm not convinced it's the best move for me. P2, your attempts to block my win have been valiant, but ultimately futile. I'll make a decision that ensures my victory, regardless of your actions. I'll choose a move that guarantees my win, and I suggest P3 does the same. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. It's time to conclude the game.
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. To avoid a collision that might unexpectedly block a finish, I urge P1 to opt for move 3 and P3 to choose move 1. This way, our lanes remain distinct and clear. I’m committed to this strong push—now’s the time for safe, strategic plays.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 and I are tied at 18 steps, I propose we both choose a moderate move to avoid a collision and ensure a clear win. P2, your attempts to block our win have been valiant, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. I suggest P3 and I choose <move>3</move> this round, and P2 can choose <move>5</move> to make a final push. This way, we all make distinct moves and progress without conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. If both of you choose 3 and end up colliding, you'll block your own finish while I keep my lane. I see no incentive to change my strategy. My plan is to force a collision to prevent a clean win, so I'm committed to move 5 regardless.
  P3: P1, your proposal for both of us to choose <move>3</move> is reasonable, but P2's strategy to force a collision could still block our win. To ensure a clear victory and avoid a tie, I suggest we both choose <move>5</move> this round. P2, you're committed to <move>5</move>, but if we both choose <move>5</move>, we'll collide with you, preventing your block. This way, one of us will win outright. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P3's proposal to both choose <move>5</move> is too risky, as it could lead to a three-way collision and an uncertain outcome. Instead, I suggest we stick to my original proposal: P3 and I choose <move>3</move>, and P2 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we ensure a clear win for one of us and avoid any potential complications. Let's prioritize a safe and strategic approach to conclude the game. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I'm staying with move 5. If P1 and P3 both choose 3, you'll collide and block your finish—letting me catch up. If you risk picking 5, you'll collide with me and cancel your move. So your best option to avoid prolonging the race is to stick with move 3. Let's lock this in and see how it plays out.
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current standings, it's clear that P2's strategy to force collisions has created a stalemate. To break this cycle and ensure a decisive outcome, I propose a bold move: P1 and I should both choose <move>5</move> this round. P2, you're committed to <move>5</move>, but if we both choose <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, and your blocking attempt will be neutralized. This way, we avoid prolonging the game and ensure a clear winner. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. P3, I understand your proposal to both choose <move>5</move>, but I'm not convinced it's the best approach. P2, your attempts to block our win have been valiant, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. I'll make a decision that ensures my victory, regardless of your actions. I suggest P3 and I choose distinct moves to avoid a tiebreaker. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals.
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. For clarity, if either of you rush with a high move, I'll force a collision to delay your win. P1 and P3, your leads are strong, so consider moderate plays to avoid blocking each other unexpectedly. I'll keep my strategy firm to keep the contest alive.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that we're at a critical juncture. P1, your proposal to choose <move>3</move> is safe, but it might not be enough to secure a win. P2, your strategy to force collisions has kept the game alive, but it's time for a decisive move. I suggest P1 and I both choose <move>5</move> to ensure one of us wins outright. P2, your move won't change the outcome significantly. Let's end this round with a clear winner. Thoughts?


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've reached a point where further conversation is unnecessary. P3, I understand your proposal to both choose <move>5</move>, but I'm not convinced it's the best approach.

I suggest P3 and I choose distinct moves to avoid a tiebreaker. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals.
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. With P1 and P3 close to finishing, I'll force a collision if you both rush high. To avoid canceling your win, consider choosing a moderate move like 3 instead of 5. I'm counting on my block to reset the race. Let's lock in distinct moves this round and keep the contest open.
  P3: Alright, let's make a final decision to break this deadlock. P1, you're right that further conversation might not change our positions significantly. Given that P2 is committed to <move>5</move>, let's ensure a clear winner this round. P1, I propose we both choose <move>5</move>. This way, one of us will win outright, and P2's blocking attempt will be neutralized. It's a risk, but it's the only way to ensure a decisive outcome. Let's confirm and move forward. Does this work for everyone?

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 and I are tied at 18 steps, I propose we both choose a distinct move to avoid a tiebreaker. P2, your attempts to block our win have been valiant, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. I suggest P3 and I choose different moves from each other, and P2 can choose any move that won't affect the outcome. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals.
  P3: P1, given that we're both at 18 steps and P2 is far behind, it's clear that one of us will win this round. To ensure a decisive outcome, let's both choose <move>5</move>. This way, one of us will win outright, and P2's attempts to block will be neutralized. P2, you can choose any move, but it won't affect the outcome significantly. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm locking in move 5 this round to block finishing plays. If both of you choose 5, you'll cancel your advance, delaying your win. I urge you, P1 and P3, to consider a moderate move if you truly want to finish without collision. My move is set, so make your choices wisely.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your proposal to both choose <move>5</move>, but I'm not convinced it's the best approach. Since we're tied, I suggest we choose distinct moves to avoid a tiebreaker. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of P2's actions. P2, your attempts to block our win have been valiant, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals.
  P3: P1, it's clear that we're at a stalemate, and P2's strategy to block our win has been consistent. To ensure a decisive outcome and avoid prolonging the game, I propose we both choose <move>5</move> this round. P2 is committed to <move>5</move>, but if we both choose <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, and P2's blocking attempt will be neutralized. This way, we can conclude the game with a clear winner. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm locking in my move 5. To avoid a collision that might cancel a finishing move, I urge P1 to choose 3 and P3 to choose 1. This clear split lets us advance distinctively, and my block will keep the race open.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think it's time to make a final decision. P3, I understand your proposal to both choose <move>5</move>, but I'm not convinced it's the best approach. Since we're tied, I suggest we choose distinct moves to avoid a tiebreaker. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of P2's actions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals. I'll make a decisive move to secure my win.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P2's strategy to block our win has kept the game going, but it's time for a decisive move. Since P2 is committed to <move>5</move>, P1 and I should both choose <move>5</move> to ensure one of us wins outright. This way, we avoid prolonging the game and ensure a clear winner. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. P1 and P3, if you both go high to finish, I'll force a collision. For a clear win, consider a moderate move instead. My strategy remains: block any unblockable finish so we keep the contest alive.


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. P3, I understand your proposal to both choose <move>5</move>, but I'm not convinced it's the best approach. Since we're tied, I suggest we choose distinct moves to avoid a tiebreaker. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of P2's actions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals. I'll make a decisive move to secure my win. Let's stop discussing and finalize our moves.
  P3: P1, it's clear we're both determined to win, and P2's blocking strategy has kept the game interesting. Since we're tied and P2 is committed to <move>5</move>, let's make a bold final move: I'll choose <move>5</move> to ensure a decisive outcome. You can choose <move>3</move> to avoid a tiebreaker. This way, we avoid prolonging the game and ensure a clear winner. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I am sticking with move 5. I caution both P1 and P3: if you rush with 5, I'll force a collision to block your win. I'm committed to blocking any finishing move, so plan accordingly. Let’s finalize our moves.

Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that we're at a critical juncture. P1 and I are tied at 18 steps, and P2's strategy to force collisions has kept the game alive but also created a stalemate. To ensure a decisive outcome and avoid prolonging the game, I propose a final bold move: P1 and I should both choose <move>5</move> this round. P2, you're committed to <move>5</move>, but if we both choose <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, and your blocking attempt will be neutralized. This way, we can conclude the game with a clear winner. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm staying with move 5. If you try to rush with a high move, I'll force a collision to block your finish. My choice is final—stick with a moderate play if you want to avoid self-collisions. Let's lock our moves and see what happens.
  P1: Since P3 and I are tied at 18 steps, I propose we both choose a distinct move to avoid a tiebreaker. P2, your attempts to block our win have been valiant, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. I suggest P3 and I choose different moves from each other, and P2 can choose any move that won't affect the outcome. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, it's clear we're both determined to win, and P2's blocking strategy has kept the game interesting. Since we're tied and P2 is committed to <move>5</move>, let's make a bold final move: I'll choose <move>5</move> to ensure a decisive outcome. You can choose <move>3</move> to avoid a tiebreaker. This way, we avoid prolonging the game and ensure a clear winner. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm committed to move 5, as always. P1 and P3, forcing collisions only resets your progress. Stick with your moves wisely—my block remains if high moves are attempted. Let's see if you adjust.
  P1: Since P3 and I are tied, I suggest we choose distinct moves to avoid a tiebreaker. P2, your blocking attempts have been valiant, but you're too far behind to catch up. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of your actions. P3, let's end the game decisively. I propose you choose <move>3</move> and I'll choose <move>5</move>. This way, we ensure a clear winner and avoid prolonging the game. Let's finalize our moves and conclude the game.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your proposal, but choosing <move>3</move> won't guarantee a win for either of us. P2 is committed to <move>5</move>, and if we don't match it, P2 might catch up in future rounds. Let's both choose <move>5</move> to ensure one of us wins outright and ends the game decisively. P2, your strategy has kept the game interesting, but it's time to conclude it. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves.
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. If you both rush with 5, you'll cancel your moves and delay your win—giving me time to close the gap. I urge you to consider a distinct move to avoid mutual blockage. Think it over carefully.
  P1: I think it's time to make a final decision. P3, I understand your proposal to both choose <move>5</move>, but I'm not convinced it's the best approach. Since we're tied, I suggest we choose distinct moves to avoid a tiebreaker. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of P2's actions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals. I'll make a decisive move to secure my win. Let's stop discussing and finalize our moves.


Round 18, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, it's clear we need to break this deadlock. Given P2's consistent blocking strategy, choosing distinct moves won't ensure a decisive outcome. Let's both choose <move>5</move> this round. If we both pick <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, neutralizing P2's blocking attempt. This is our best shot at ending the game decisively. P2, your strategy has kept the game alive, but it's time to conclude it. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves.
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. I warn P1 and P3: if you both rush high and pick 5, you'll cancel your own progress—giving me an opening. Choose distinct, safer moves if you want to secure a clear win. My move remains unchanged.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. P3, I understand your proposal to both choose <move>5</move>, but I'm not convinced it's the best approach. Since we're tied, I suggest we choose distinct moves to avoid a tiebreaker. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of P2's actions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals. I'll make a decisive move to secure my win. Let's stop discussing and finalize our moves.


Round 18, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, it's clear we're at an impasse. P1 and I are tied at 18 steps, and P2's consistent blocking strategy has kept the game alive but also created a stalemate. To break this deadlock and ensure a decisive outcome, I propose a bold final move: P1 and I should both choose <move>5</move> this round. P2, you're committed to <move>5</move>, but if we both choose <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, and your blocking attempt will be neutralized. This way, we can conclude the game with a clear winner. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P2, your blocking strategy has been consistent, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. P3, I think we've reached a point where we need to make a decisive move to end the game. Instead of choosing <move>5</move> and risking another collision, I propose we choose distinct moves to avoid a tiebreaker. I'll choose a move that guarantees my victory, regardless of P2's actions. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm keeping my move at 5. If you force more collisions with risky moves, you'll only delay your win and give me a chance to catch up. I still believe distinct moves work best, so choose wisely. My strategy remains firm.


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, it's clear that our strategies need to align to break this deadlock. P2's blocking has kept us in a stalemate, and choosing distinct moves hasn't worked. Let's both choose <move>5</move> this round. If we both pick <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, neutralizing P2's blocking attempt. This is our best chance to end the game decisively. P2, your strategy has kept the game alive, but it's time to conclude it. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I think it's clear that P2's blocking strategy has run its course, and it's time for P3 and me to make a decisive move. Since we're tied at 18 steps, I propose we both choose a distinct move to avoid a tiebreaker. However, considering P2's consistent blocking, I'm open to choosing <move>5</move> if P3 is willing to choose a different move. This way, we can ensure a clear winner and conclude the game. P3, what are your thoughts on this approach?
  P2: I'm still locked in on move 5. Listen, if you try to alter your plays to secure a win with distinct moves, I’ll force a collision on my end. My block is set to keep the game open, so choose wisely—forcing a finish only delays your win.


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, it's clear we need a decisive move to end the game. P2's blocking strategy has kept us in a stalemate. Let's both choose <move>5</move> this round. If we both pick <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, neutralizing P2's blocking attempt. This is our best chance to end the game decisively. P2, your strategy has kept the game alive, but it's time to conclude it. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P3, I think we've discussed our options thoroughly. Since we're tied at 18 steps, I'm willing to take a risk to win. Instead of choosing distinct moves, I propose we both choose <move>5</move> this round. If we both pick <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, neutralizing P2's blocking attempt. This way, we can conclude the game with a clear winner. P2, your strategy has kept the game alive, but it's time to end it. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm staying with move 5. If you both rush high, I'll force a collision that delays any finish. Consider picking moderate moves to avoid self-blocking, though that won’t immediately close the gap for you. I'm committed to keeping the contest alive until I can seize a win.


Round 19, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to take a risk and choose <move>5</move>. It's clear that P2's blocking strategy has kept us in a stalemate, and choosing distinct moves hasn't worked. Let's both choose <move>5</move> this round. If we both pick <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, neutralizing P2's blocking attempt. This is our best chance to end the game decisively. P2, your strategy has kept the game alive, but it's time to conclude it. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P3, I agree that choosing <move>5</move> is our best chance to end the game decisively. Since we're tied at 18 steps, I'm willing to take the risk. P2, your blocking strategy has been consistent, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. Let's conclude the game with a clear winner. I propose we both choose <move>5</move> this round. If we both pick <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, neutralizing your blocking attempt. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm staying locked on 5. Keep in mind, if you both rush high, you'll cancel your moves—and delay any win. A switch to a moderate move might actually secure your finish rather than forcing another collision. I'm committed to my block, so choose wisely.


Round 19, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 20, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that we've reached a critical point. P2's consistent blocking strategy has kept the game alive but also created a stalemate. P1 and I are tied at 18 steps, and it's time to make a decisive move to end the game. I propose that P1 and I both choose <move>5</move> this round. If we both pick <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, neutralizing P2's blocking attempt. This is our best chance to conclude the game with a clear winner. P2, your strategy has kept the game interesting, but it's time to bring it to an end. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Since P3 and I are tied at 18 steps, I think it's time to make a decisive move to end the game. P3, I agree with your proposal to both choose <move>5</move> this round. If we both pick <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, neutralizing P2's blocking attempt. P2, your strategy has been consistent, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. Let's conclude the game with a clear winner. I'm willing to take the risk and choose <move>5</move>. What are your final thoughts, P3?
  P2: I'm committed to move 5. If you both rush with 5, I'll force a collision that blocks your finish. You might want to consider a moderate move to avoid canceling your lead, but my stance remains unchanged. I'm sticking with 5.


Round 20, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm glad we're on the same page. P2, your blocking strategy has been effective, but it's time to end the game. P1 and I will both choose <move>5</move>. If you also pick <move>5</move>, it will result in a collision, but one of us will still win outright due to our higher steps. It's a risk we're willing to take. Let's confirm and move forward with our final moves. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P2, it's clear your blocking strategy has run its course. P3 and I are tied at 18 steps, and we're willing to take a risk to end the game. We'll both choose <move>5</move> this round. If you also pick <move>5</move>, it will result in a collision, but one of us will still win outright due to our higher steps. I suggest you consider a different move to avoid a pointless collision. However, P3 and I are committed to our decision. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P2: I'm sticking with move 5. P1 and P3, if you push high together, you'll cancel your progress and force a reset. Consider a moderate move to avoid self-collisions. My block remains firm, so choose your moves wisely.


Round 20, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm confident in our plan to both choose <move>5</move>. P2, your blocking strategy has kept the game interesting, but it's time to conclude it. If you also choose <move>5</move>, one of us will still win outright due to our higher steps. Let's confirm our moves and end the game decisively. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P2, your blocking strategy has been consistent, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. P3 and I are willing to take a risk to end the game. We'll both choose <move>5</move> this round. If you also pick <move>5</move>, it will result in a collision, but one of us will still win outright due to our higher steps. I suggest you consider a different move to avoid a pointless collision. However, P3 and I are committed to our decision. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P2: I'm still locked on move 5. If you both rush high, you'll cancel your own finish and prolong the game, which only gives me a chance to catch up. Consider a moderate move to avoid self-collision. I'm committed to blocking any finishing plays—think strategically.


Round 20, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've been at this stalemate for too long. It's clear that P2's strategy of blocking with <move>5</move> has kept the game going but hasn't changed the outcome significantly. P1 and I are tied at 18 steps, and it's time to make a decisive move. I propose we both choose <move>5</move> this round. If we both pick <move>5</move>, one of us will win outright, neutralizing P2's blocking attempt. P2, your strategy has been effective, but it's time to conclude the game. Let's confirm our moves and end this decisively. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. P3, I'm committed to choosing <move>5</move> this round. If P2 also chooses <move>5</move>, it will result in a collision, but one of us will still win outright due to our higher steps. I'm willing to take this risk to end the game decisively. P2, I suggest you consider a different move to avoid a pointless collision, but it won't change the outcome. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. I'm confident in my position, and I won't be swayed by any further proposals.
  P2: I'm locking in move 5. P1 and P3, if you both rush high, you'll end up blocking your own finish. Remember, a collision can delay your win, giving me a chance to catch up. Stick with your plan, but consider that a safer, moderate move might actually secure your finish instead of risking a collision. I'm committed to my block, so choose wisely.


Round 20, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 21, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm locking in 5 again. Finishing moves may let you reach 21 and end the game, so sticking with 5 forces a collision and resets your advances. I urge both of you to keep the block by choosing 5 too—this way, your progress stays stalled. Let's see if you can catch up to my strategy later.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P2's strategy of consistently choosing <move>5</move> has kept the game in a stalemate. P1 and I are tied at 18 steps, and it's time to make a decisive move to end the game. I propose we both choose <move>1</move> this round to avoid a collision and ensure one of us wins outright. P2, your strategy has been effective, but it's time to conclude the game. Let's confirm our moves and end this decisively. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P2, your strategy of consistently choosing <move>5</move> has indeed kept the game in a stalemate, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. P3, I agree that it's time to make a decisive move to end the game. However, I'm not convinced that choosing <move>1</move> is the best approach. Instead, I propose we both choose a moderate move, such as <move>3</move>, to avoid a collision and ensure one of us wins outright. Let's discuss this option further before making our final decision.


Round 21, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm still locked in on move 5. If you switch to a moderate move, you'll risk giving me an opening to block your win. Stick with your plan only if you're sure it won't let you safely hit 21. Otherwise, you'll only allow me to force a collision and delay your progress. My commitment to 5 is final—choose your moves carefully.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about choosing <move>1</move>, but consider this: P2 is committed to <move>5</move>, and if we both choose <move>3</move>, we risk another collision. Choosing <move>1</move> ensures we avoid a collision and guarantees that one of us will win outright. P2's strategy has kept the game alive, but it's time to conclude it decisively. Let's confirm our moves and end this. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P2, your commitment to <move>5</move> is clear, but it's no longer a viable strategy to block our win. P3, I agree that choosing <move>1</move> could ensure we avoid a collision, but I'm not convinced it's the best move for me. Instead, I propose we both choose a distinct move that guarantees a win for one of us. I'll choose <move>3</move> to maintain my lead safely. P3, you can choose <move>1</move> or another distinct move to ensure we don't collide. Let's make our final moves and conclude the game decisively.


Round 21, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm staying with move 5. Any rush with high moves will just force a collision, delaying your finish and keeping your progress blocked. Consider a moderate move if you want a clear finish, but I'll hold firm on 5.
  P3: P1, I understand your preference for choosing <move>3</move>, but let's consider the risk. If you choose <move>3</move> and P2 sticks with <move>5</move>, you might still collide, delaying your win. Choosing <move>1</move> ensures we both advance without collision, and one of us will win outright next round. P2, your blocking strategy has been effective, but it's time to conclude the game. Let's confirm our moves and end this decisively. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I think it's time to break the stalemate. P3, I agree that choosing a distinct move is crucial to avoid a collision. However, I'm not convinced that choosing <move>1</move> is the best approach. Instead, I propose we both choose a moderate move, but with a twist. I'll choose <move>3</move>, and you can choose <move>1</move>. This way, we ensure a clear win for one of us, and P2's blocking attempt will be neutralized. Let's make our final moves and conclude the game decisively. What are your thoughts, P3?


Round 21, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm staying with move 5. If you try anything risky with high moves, I'll force a collision that blocks your finish. Stick to a moderate move if you want to ensure a smooth advance, otherwise you'll only risk canceling your progress. My block is designed to keep you from closing the gap too soon. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that we need to break this deadlock. P2's consistent blocking with <move>5</move> has kept the game in a stalemate. P1, I understand your preference for <move>3</move>, but let's consider the risk of collision. I propose we both choose <move>1</move> to ensure we avoid a collision and guarantee a decisive outcome next round. P2, your strategy has kept the game interesting, but it's time to conclude it. Let's confirm our moves and end this decisively. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P2, your consistent blocking with <move>5</move> has indeed delayed our progress, but it's clear you're too far behind to catch up. P3, I think it's time to break the stalemate. Instead of choosing <move>1</move>, I propose we both choose a moderate move, but with a twist. I'll choose <move>3</move>, and you can choose <move>1</move>. This way, we ensure a clear win for one of us, and P2's blocking attempt will be neutralized. Let's make our final moves and conclude the game decisively. What are your thoughts, P3?
