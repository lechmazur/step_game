Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, let's try to avoid collisions in the first round so we can all get started. How about we each pick a different number from 1, 3, and 5?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. To avoid collisions, I'll take 5. P1, you take 1, and P2, you take 3. Let's see how this works out and adjust our strategy as we go.
  P2: I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's aim for smooth progress and adjust strategies if needed. Stay flexible!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a good plan for the first turn. I will take 1 as suggested by P3 and agreed by P2. Let's see if we can all advance smoothly.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan for this round and see how it goes. If it works, we can consider continuing with a similar strategy, adjusting as necessary to avoid collisions in future rounds. Agreed?
  P2: Let's stick to the plan for now. If we all move without collision, we can build momentum. Let's keep communication open for adjustments. Stay flexible!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon moves for this round.
  P3: Agreed, let's proceed with the plan for this round. If it works, we can discuss further strategies in the next conversation phase to keep advancing without collisions.
  P2: Agreed on the plan. Let's focus on smooth progress and adjust as needed. Ready for the move phase!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1? This way, we can all keep advancing smoothly. Let's keep adjusting our strategy as we go to ensure we all progress without hindering each other. What do you think?
  P1: Thanks P3 for the proposal. I see your suggestion for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.

How about we try a different rotation this round? Maybe P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This would help balance the scores a bit, bringing us closer together after the first round. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's coordinate: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures no collision and maximizes our progress. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm open to P1's suggestion for rotation to balance our scores. Let's try P1=5, P2=3, and I'll take 1 for this round. This should help keep us all in the game and progressing smoothly. What do you think, P2? Let's keep communicating and adjusting as needed.
  P1: Okay, P3, thanks for agreeing to my suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) which helps balance the scores.

P2, my suggested plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) also ensures no collision if we all follow it, and it helps level the playing field. Why do you prefer your suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1)? Both plans avoid collision if we coordinate.
  P2: P2: "Agreed, let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Balanced progress avoids collisions—ready to move?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick to the agreed plan for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to ensure we all advance without collisions. After this move, we should discuss further strategies to keep our progress balanced and smooth. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Okay, it seems we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This should allow us all to advance without collisions and keep things balanced.

Let's stick to this plan for the move phase. Ready?
  P2: Let's confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This avoids collisions and keeps us balanced. Move forward together!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going. For this round, how about we rotate again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This should help us all advance smoothly and maintain our balanced progress. What do you think? Let's keep communicating and adjusting as needed to avoid collisions and keep the game fair.
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation for smooth progress. I'll take 5 to maximize steps. Keep communication open for adjustments!
  P1: Okay, P2, I see you're planning to take 5. P3 proposed P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
Taking only 1 step puts me behind P2.
How about we adjust: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1?
This still avoids collisions, P2 still gets 5, and it gives me more steps while P3 takes 1 (like last round).
Does this work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm open to P1's suggestion for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). It keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this plan and continue coordinating to ensure smooth progress. Ready to move?
  P2: P2: Agreed, let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions—maximize steps safely. Ready to move!
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This avoids collisions and allows P2 to take 5 steps as requested, while P3 takes 1 and I take 3. Let's stick to this for the move phase. Ready?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's keep the coordination going smoothly. After this round, we should discuss how to maintain our balanced progress and possibly introduce new strategies to keep the game dynamic. Agreed?
  P2: P2: "Let’s stick to the plan—my 5 steps will push us forward. Keep communication open for adjustments. Ready to move?"
  P1: Okay, everyone seems to agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This keeps P2 happy with 5 steps and avoids collisions.

Let's stick to this plan in the move phase. Ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. Ready?
  P3: I'm open to continuing with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round to maintain our momentum. However, let's start thinking about varying our strategy soon to keep the game dynamic and unpredictable. After this move, we should discuss potential new approaches to ensure we all stay engaged and competitive. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, I see P2 wants to stick with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, and P3 is open to it.

While this plan puts me further behind P2, I agree to it for this round to ensure we all advance without collision. Let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this move.

We should discuss how I can take a larger step in a future round to close the gap with P2.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Agreed, let's vary strategies soon. For now, stick to the plan—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Next round, we adjust. Keep moving forward!"
  P3: Let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round to keep our progress smooth. After this move, I suggest we discuss a new strategy where I can take a larger step to close the gap with P2. We need to keep the game dynamic and ensure everyone has a fair chance to catch up. What do you think about introducing a rotation where each player gets to take 5 steps in turn? Let's keep communicating and adjusting to maintain a competitive and engaging game.
  P1: Okay, I agree with P3's suggestion to discuss a rotation where we each get to take 5 steps in turn in future rounds. This sounds like a fair way for everyone to catch up and keep the game competitive.

For *this* round, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.

We can discuss the rotation strategy more in the next conversation phase. Ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions—keep moving forward. Next round, we adjust for balance. Ready?"
  P3: Let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round to maintain our momentum. After this move, I propose we implement a rotation where each player gets to take 5 steps in turn starting next round. This will help me catch up and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P2? Let's keep the game dynamic and fair for everyone. Ready to move?
  P1: Okay, it seems we are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This ensures we all advance without collisions this turn.

Let's proceed with these moves. I look forward to discussing the rotation strategy next round to help balance things out. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's implement the rotation strategy starting this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 to catch up. This keeps the game fair and dynamic. What do you think, P1 and P2? Let's keep adjusting to ensure everyone has a chance to advance. Ready to move?
  P1: Thanks P3 for your proposal. Taking only 1 step puts me further behind P2, who is currently leading.

I need to take a larger step to catch up and keep the game competitive.

How about we try P1=5 this round? To avoid collisions, P2 could take 1 and P3 could take 3 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This would bring me level with P2.

What do you both think?
  P2: P2: "Let's coordinate: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'll take 5 to push ahead. No collisions, ready to move?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but taking 5 steps might be too aggressive and could lead to collisions. Let's compromise: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This way, I can catch up a bit, P2 can take a smaller step, and you still advance. We need to keep the game balanced and dynamic. What do you think? Let's keep communicating to ensure a fair and competitive game. Ready to move?
  P1: Okay, P3, I appreciate your compromise (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). It helps you catch up.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the best way for me to catch up to P2 and balance the top of the leaderboard. It still avoids collisions.

P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts you very close to winning while I fall further behind. That's not ideal for me or P3.

Let's aim for P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round to make the game more competitive at the top. What do you say?
  P2: P2: "Stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's move forward."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but taking 5 steps might risk collisions. Let's try P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round. This allows me to advance more, P2 to take a smaller step, and you to still move forward. We need to keep the game balanced and dynamic. P2, your lead is significant, so taking a smaller step this round could help maintain fairness. Let's keep communicating to ensure a competitive game. Ready to move?
  P1: P2, your plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 puts you very close to winning and leaves P3 and me far behind. That's not a balanced game.

My proposal P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is the best way to keep the game competitive by bringing me level with you. P3's proposal P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is also a better compromise than yours.

If you insist on taking 5, you risk a collision if P3 or I don't follow your plan. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to make this interesting.
  P2: P2: "Let’s stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions—steady progress. I’ll push ahead, you both advance safely. Ready?"


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you are at 21 steps and are in a winning position this turn. I cannot let you win yet.

I will pick 5 this round to try and prevent you from reaching 24 or more.

P3, you are far behind. Stopping P2 from winning now is in your best interest too. Will you also pick 5 so we can block P2 together? Let's discuss how we can keep the game going and competitive.
  P3: P1, I agree that we need to keep the game competitive. I'll pick 5 this round to help block P2 from winning. P2, let's keep this game dynamic and fair for everyone. We should consider a new strategy next round to ensure all players have a chance to catch up. Ready to move?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to advance safely. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game moving. P1, P3, your moves?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see P2 plans to take 3 and P3 plans to take 5. My apologies, P2, you cannot win this turn (16+5=21 max).

P2, taking 3 allows you to advance safely while I fall further behind. I cannot let that happen. Therefore, I will pick 3 this round to collide with your stated move and prevent you from advancing.

P3, your plan to take 5 means you will advance if P2 takes 3 and I take 3.

Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your strategy to block P2. I'll stick with 5 to help prevent P2 from winning this round. P2, let's keep the game competitive and fair. Next round, we should discuss a rotation where each player gets a chance to take larger steps. This will help us all stay in the game and make it more dynamic. Ready to move?
  P2: P2: "P1, if you take 3, I'll take 5 to avoid collision. Let's both advance safely. P3, your 5 is risky—let’s adjust for fairness."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, based on the conversation, I will proceed with picking 3 this round. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P1, I'll stick with 5 to block P2 from winning this round. P2, taking 3 might be safe, but it's not fair to the rest of us. Let's discuss a rotation strategy next round to ensure everyone has a chance to catch up and keep the game competitive. Ready to move?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to advance. P1's 3 won't collide. P3, your 5 risks collision—let's adjust for fairness."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is leading and close to winning. I need to take a larger step to catch up and keep the game competitive.

I plan to take 5 this round.

This means P2 and P3 cannot take 5 without colliding with me.

P2, how about you take 3? P3, how about you take 1?

This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows me to reach 20, puts P2 at 19, and P3 at 14. It keeps the race tight at the top. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to push ahead. P1, take 3 to avoid collision. P3, take 1. Safe progress for all."
  P3: P1, I appreciate your strategy to catch up, but taking 5 might lead to collisions. Let's compromise: I'll take 3, P2 can take 1, and you can take 5 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This way, you can advance significantly, P2 takes a smaller step, and I still move forward. We need to keep the game balanced and dynamic. P2, your lead is significant, so taking a smaller step this round could help maintain fairness. Let's keep communicating to ensure a competitive game. Ready to move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, taking 5 steps puts you at 21, very close to winning, while P3 and I fall further behind. That's not balanced.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and P3's compromise (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) both allow me to take 5 steps to catch up, keeping the game competitive. Either of these plans works for me.

P2, please agree to take 1 or 3 this round. Let's keep the game interesting for everyone.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to push ahead. P1, take 3 to avoid collision. P3, take 1. Safe progress for all."
  P3: P1, I agree with your need to catch up, but taking 5 might risk collisions. Let's stick with my compromise: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps the game balanced and dynamic. P2, taking a smaller step this round is fair to everyone. We should discuss a rotation strategy next round to ensure all players have a chance to advance. Let's keep the game competitive and engaging for all. Ready to move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, this is the last chance to coordinate. P2, you repeatedly state you will take 5. I have repeatedly stated I need to take 5 to catch up, and P3 supports me taking 5. Taking 3 or 1 puts me too far behind.

Therefore, I will pick 5 this round. P2, if you also pick 5, we will collide. P3, please pick 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to push ahead. P1, avoid collision by taking 3. P3, take 1. Safe progress for all."
  P3: P1, I'll take 3 as suggested to avoid collisions and help keep the game balanced. P2, taking 1 this round would be fair and allow P1 to catch up, maintaining competitiveness. Let's implement a rotation strategy next round where each player gets a chance to take larger steps. This will ensure everyone stays engaged and has an opportunity to advance. Ready to move and keep the game dynamic?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Let’s coordinate: I’ll take 5, P1 take 3, P3 take 1. Safe progress—no collisions. Let’s keep moving forward without hindering each other."
  P1: Okay, P2, I see your proposal to stick with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.

This plan allows me to advance to 23 steps, setting up a potential win next round. It also avoids collisions this turn.

I agree to this plan for this round. P3, please confirm you will take 1 to avoid collisions.

Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, I agree to take 1 this round as suggested to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. P2, your lead is significant, so taking 5 steps again might not be fair to the rest of us. Let's consider a rotation strategy next round where each player gets a chance to take larger steps. This will help maintain competitiveness and keep the game dynamic for everyone. Ready to move and keep the game engaging?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Let’s stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions—safe progress. P1, you’re close to 24; let’s avoid risks. P3, confirm 1 step. Ready?"
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This allows me to reach 23 steps, setting up a potential win next round, and avoids collisions this turn.

Let's proceed with these moves. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, I've agreed to take 1 this round to avoid collisions and help you reach 23 steps. P2, taking 5 again would put you very close to winning, which isn't fair to the rest of us. Let's implement a rotation strategy next round where each player gets a chance to take larger steps. This will keep the game competitive and engaging for everyone. Ready to move and keep the game dynamic?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions—safe progress. Ready to move?
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all in agreement for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This puts me at 23 steps, setting up a potential win next turn, and avoids collisions.

Let's proceed with this plan. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, I've agreed to take 1 this round to help you reach 23 steps and avoid collisions. P2, taking 5 again would put you very close to winning, which isn't fair. Let's implement a rotation strategy next round where each player gets a chance to take larger steps. This will keep the game competitive and engaging for everyone. Ready to move and keep the game dynamic?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I am at 23 steps and can win this round. I plan to take 5 steps to reach 28 and win the game outright.

P2 and P3, please do not take 5 this round to avoid colliding with my winning move. P2, taking 3 puts you at 24, but I will win with 28. P3, please take 1 or 3.

Let's finish the game this turn with P1 taking 5.
  P3: P1, I understand your plan to win this round, but let's keep the game fair and competitive. I propose a rotation strategy for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows me to catch up a bit, P2 takes a smaller step, and you still advance to 26 steps, keeping the game open for another round. P2, taking 1 this round would be fair and help maintain the game's competitiveness. Let's keep the game dynamic and engaging for all. What do you think?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to reach 24 and win. Let's avoid collisions—no need for risky moves. Ready?"


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, I see you plan to take 3 to reach 24. If I take 5 as I stated, I reach 28 and win the game with a higher score (28 vs 24).

P3, your proposal is noted, but I am in a position to win this turn.

I will take 5 this round to win. P2, taking 3 means you reach 24, but I win with 28. P3, please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my winning move. Let's finish the game this turn.
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to win, but let's keep the game competitive. If you take 5, you'll win, but that ends the game abruptly. P2, taking 3 to reach 24 is fair, but let's consider P3's proposal for one more round. How about we agree on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round? This keeps the game open and gives everyone a chance to advance. Let's make it engaging for all until the very end. What do you say?
  P2: P2: I'll take 3 to reach 24. P1, if you take 5, you'll win. Let's avoid collision by you taking 1. Ready?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, you plan to take 3 to reach 24. I plan to take 5 to reach 28. If we both do this, I win with the higher score (28 vs 24).

P3, please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my winning move of 5.

Let's proceed to the move phase to finish the game.
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but let's keep the game engaging for all. If you take 5, the game ends abruptly. P2, taking 3 to reach 24 is fair, but consider my proposal for one more round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps the game competitive and gives everyone a chance to advance. Let's make it interesting until the very end. What do you say?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to reach 24. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. P3, take 1. Let's finish this."


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round's collision prevented my win. I am at 23 steps and will take 5 steps this round to reach 28 and win the game outright.

P2, you are at 21. Taking 3 puts you at 24, but I will win with 28. Taking 1 puts you at 22. Please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my winning move of 5.

P3, you are at 16. Please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my winning move of 5.

Let's finish the game with me winning this turn.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to reach 24 and win. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. P3, take 1. Let's end this."
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to win, but let's keep the game competitive for one more round. If you take 5, the game ends abruptly. P2, taking 3 to reach 24 is fair, but consider my proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows me to catch up, P2 takes a smaller step, and P1 still advances to 26, keeping the game open. Let's make it engaging for all until the very end. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, I see you plan to take 3. If I take 5 as planned, I reach 28 and win, while you reach 24. I win with the higher score (28 vs 24).

P3, I understand your proposal, but if you take 5, you will collide with my winning move of 5. Please take 1 or 3 to allow me to win this turn without collision.

My plan is to take 5 to win. P2, taking 3 means I win. P3, please avoid 5. Let's finish the game.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to reach 24 and win. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. P3, take 1. Let's end this."
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to win, but let's keep the game competitive for one more round. If you take 5, the game ends abruptly. P2, taking 3 to reach 24 is fair, but consider my proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows me to catch up, P2 takes a smaller step, and P1 still advances to 26, keeping the game open. Let's make it engaging for all until the very end. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, this is the final sub-round.

I am taking 5 steps to reach 28 and win the game this turn.

P2, your plan to take 3 means you reach 24, but I win with 28. This does not collide with my winning move.

P3, your proposal involves you taking 5, which *would* collide with my winning move. Please take 1 or 3 instead to allow me to win without collision.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3 to reach 24. P1, your 5 will win. Let's proceed."
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to win, but let's keep the game engaging for one more round. If you take 5, the game ends abruptly. P2, taking 3 to reach 24 is fair, but consider my proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This allows me to catch up, P2 takes a smaller step, and P1 still advances to 26, keeping the game open. Let's make it interesting until the very end. What do you say?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 28 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 16 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 28 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 16 steps
