It's frustrating that despite our attempts to coordinate, we've ended up picking the same moves and not advancing as planned. I think it's time for us to reassess our strategy and maybe try a different approach.\n\nFirst off, I want to acknowledge that P2 has been pushing for a plan that seems to benefit them more directly, but I understand that everyone wants to win. However, if we don't work together effectively, no one wins, or at least it takes longer than necessary. So, cooperation is key here.\n\nI propose that instead of sticking rigidly to a rotation, we consider each round on a case-by-case basis and communicate our intentions clearly. For example, in this round, perhaps P2 needs to make a bigger move to catch up, or P3 needs to secure a position. Let's discuss our individual goals for this round and see how we can coordinate to achieve them without stepping on each other's toes.\n\nAdditionally, maybe we can establish a system where one player commits to their move first, and the others choose accordingly. For instance, P2 could declare their intended move, and then P1 and P3 can choose moves that don't conflict with P2's choice. This way, we can avoid overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a draft system where in each round, players take turns choosing their moves, with the order rotating each time. This might help distribute the moves more evenly and reduce the chance of collisions.\n\nI'm open to suggestions. The main thing is that we need to find a way to coordinate effectively and reach the goal without wasting turns due to collisions. Let's work together on this."}
