Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's discuss our strategies. We need to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts on what numbers to choose?
  P2: I think we should avoid 1 in the first round, it's too obvious. How about we spread out with 3 and 5 to minimize collisions?
  P3: I agree with P2, let's avoid 1 this round. I'm leaning towards 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I like the idea of spreading out. I’m considering moving 3. What do you both plan to choose?
  P2: I'm glad we're on the same page about avoiding 1. Since P3 is leaning towards 5 and P1 is considering 3, I think I'll choose 5 as well to try and get a head start. Let's hope we don't collide.
  P3: Okay, P2, since you're also thinking 5, I'll switch to 3 this round. P1, are you still going with 3?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I moved 3 last round, and P1 moved 5. Let's try to avoid another collision. I'm thinking 5 this round. What are you two planning?
  P2: I'm considering 1 this round to play it safe and avoid collisions with your potential 5 moves, P1 and P3. What are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P1: P1: I think we should aim to avoid collisions again. Since P2 is considering 1, I might go with 3 to keep things balanced. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'm still planning on 5 this round. P1, are you still going with 3? P2, are you set on 1?
  P2: Considering P3's plan for 5 and my previous thought on 1, I think it's crucial we don't have another collision. P1, if you're set on 3, I might stick with 1 to spread out our moves. P3, are you firm on 5, or is there flexibility in your choice?
  P1: I’m still planning to go with 3 this round to avoid collisions. P2, if you stick with 1, that should work well with my move. P3, are you still going for 5? Let’s confirm our choices to minimize risks.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Yes, I'm still going with 5.
  P2: Given P3's confirmation of moving 5 and P1 considering 3, I'll reaffirm my intention to move 1 this round to avoid collision and spread out our moves. Let's hope this strategy pays off.
  P1: P1: I'm still set on moving 3 this round. Let's stick to our plan to avoid collisions. P2, your move of 1 should work well with mine, and P3, just a reminder that you're going with 5. Let's finalize our choices!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, I'm going with 5 this round. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves.
  P2: I've confirmed my move as 1 this round to avoid collision and spread out. P1 is set on 3, and P3 on 5. Let's stick to our plan and hope for no collisions.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves and stick to the plan. I'm going with 3, P2 is set on 1, and P3 is going with 5. Let's hope for no collisions this round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Okay, I'm still going with 5.
  P2: I'm reaffirming my intention to move 1 this round. P1, you're set on 3, and P3, you've confirmed 5. Let's stick to our plan and avoid collisions.
  P1: P1: Just to confirm, I'm set on moving 3 this round. P2, you're going with 1, and P3, you're sticking with 5. Let's hope this strategy works and we avoid collisions!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's significant lead, I think we should try to box them out. P1, would you consider moving 5 this round to potentially collide with P3 and hinder their progress?
  P1: P1: I see P3 has a lead, but I'm not sure colliding with them is the best move. I’m still considering 3 or 1 to avoid risks. P2, what do you think about moving 1 again to keep things safe? We could focus on advancing steadily instead of risking collisions.
  P3: I'm still going with 5 this round. P1, what are you planning? P2, are you sticking with 1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think P1 and I should coordinate to box out P3. If we both choose 5, we can prevent P3 from advancing this round. P1, are you willing to move 5 this round to hinder P3's progress?
  P1: P1: I understand the desire to box out P3, but if we both choose 5, we risk colliding and not advancing ourselves. I’m still considering moving 3. P2, are you set on 5, or is there flexibility?
  P3: I'm still going with 5 this round. P1, are you still considering 3? P2, what's your plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given P3's lead, I think it's crucial we act to hinder their progress. P1, I strongly suggest we both move 5 this round to collide with P3 and prevent them from advancing further. It's a risk, but it might be our best chance to catch up. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P1: I understand the strategy to box out P3, but if we both pick 5, we risk colliding and not advancing ourselves. I’m still leaning towards 3 to ensure I make progress. P2, are you set on 5, or can we consider a different approach?
  P3: I'm still going with 5 this round. P1 and P2, what are your plans?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we should focus on hindering P3's progress. P1, if you're not willing to move 5, I might consider 3 to at least ensure one of us advances while trying to box out P3. What are your final thoughts on this strategy?
  P1: P1: I understand the urgency to hinder P3, but I still believe moving 3 is the best option for me to ensure some progress. P2, if you choose 3 as well, we can still advance while keeping P3 in check. What do you think?
  P3: I'm still going with 5 this round. P1 and P2, what are your plans?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I think we should reconsider our approach. Since P3 is consistently moving 5, we should aim to advance ourselves while trying to limit their lead. I propose we both choose a different number, either 1 or 3, to ensure at least one of us advances this round. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: P1: I understand the need to hinder P3, but I still believe moving 3 is my best option for progress. P2, if you choose 1, we can at least ensure one of us advances while keeping P3 in check. What do you think?
  P3: Okay, I'm still going with 5. P1 and P2, what are your final choices?


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: I'm considering moving 1 this round to ensure some progress while P3 moves 5. P1, are you still set on 3? Let's try to advance without colliding.
  P1: P1: I’m still planning to move 3 this round. P2, if you go with 1, we can at least ensure one of us advances while keeping P3 in check. P3, you're sticking with 5, right? Let's finalize our choices!
  P3: Okay, I'm still going with 5. P1 and P2, have you finalized your moves?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Given P3's lead, we need to coordinate better this round. I suggest we both avoid 5 to minimize collisions. I'm considering moving 1 or 3. What are your plans, P2 and P3?
  P2: I agree with P1 that we should avoid 5 to minimize collisions. Considering P3's significant lead, I think it's crucial we advance ourselves without risking collisions. I'm leaning towards moving 3 this round. P3, are you planning to move 5 again?
  P3: I'm still going with 5 this round. What are you two planning?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I see P3 is still going with 5. P2, if we both choose 3, we can advance without colliding. What do you think? Let's coordinate to make progress this round!
  P2: I think we should coordinate to move 3 this round, P1 and I, to advance without colliding, since P3 is likely to choose 5 again. What do you think, P1?
  P3: I'm still going with 5 this round. P1 and P2, are you both going with 3?

  P2: I agree with P1 that we should both move 3 this round to advance without colliding, since P3 is likely to choose 5 again. Let's stick to our plan and make progress!
  P3: I'm going with 3. P2, are you still with 3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P1: Let's finalize our moves. P2 and I should both go with 3 this round to ensure we advance without colliding, since P3 is likely moving 5 again. What do you both think?
  P2: I think P3's sudden change to 3 is a tactic to collide with us. Let's reconsider and choose 1 to advance without collision.
  P3: Okay, I'm going with 5. P1 and P2, what are your final choices?
