Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for this round. Let's go with P1 on <move>1</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>5</move> to avoid any collisions and all advance. If this works, we can discuss the next moves in the following rounds. What does P1 think about this plan?
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round to avoid collisions—I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>5</move>. It makes sense to start coordinated. However, for fairness in future rounds, we should rotate the move assignments so no one pulls too far ahead. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P1's point about fairness. To keep it balanced, let's agree to rotate our moves each turn. For the next round, we can switch so that P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, everyone gets a chance to make bigger moves. Does that sound fair to everyone?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for fairness. Let's stick to P1 on <move>5</move>, me on <move>1</move>, and P3 on <move>3</move> for the next round. This ensures we all have an equal chance to advance. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out.

What do you both think?
  P2: I'm on board with the current plan for this round: P1 on <move>5</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move>. After this round, I'm excited to explore P3's idea of introducing unpredictability and discussing potential alliances. This could keep the game dynamic and engaging. Let's see how our positions change and then brainstorm some creative strategies to maintain competitiveness while ensuring fairness. Looking forward to your thoughts on how we can mix things up!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. After this, let's consider a system where we each secretly choose a move and reveal simultaneously. This adds unpredictability and reduces the chance of collisions based on pre-agreed moves. It keeps the game fair and exciting. Thoughts on this approach for the next round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed for this round: I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed to keep us advancing without collisions. On P3's secret move idea for next round, it could add excitement and fairness, but I'm concerned about increased collision risks. Maybe we can discuss simple rules to avoid duplicates and ensure steady progress. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm in favor of P3's idea to introduce unpredictability with secret moves next round, but let's set a rule where each player can veto one move choice to minimize collisions. This way, we keep the game exciting and fair. After this round, let's discuss how to implement this system effectively. Looking forward to your thoughts on refining this approach to ensure we all have a competitive chance.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. For the next round, to introduce unpredictability while minimizing collisions, how about we each secretly choose a move but also privately share one move we won't choose?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For this round, let's stick to the plan: P1 on <move>3</move>, me on <move>1</move>, and P3 on <move>5</move> to keep advancing smoothly. Regarding P3's idea for next round, I like the concept of secret moves with a veto system to minimize collisions. Let's discuss how we can implement this effectively to keep the game exciting and fair. Looking forward to your thoughts on refining this approach.
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 on <move>1</move>, and P3 on <move>5</move> to keep advancing without collisions. However, after P3's deviation last round, trust is shaky—let's ensure everyone sticks to agreements. For the secret move idea with veto, it could add excitement while minimizing risks; I'm open to discussing safeguards after this. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about trust after the last round's collision. Let's rebuild that trust this round by sticking to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. For future rounds, to introduce unpredictability safely, what if we each privately share one move we won't take with only one other player? This way, we add excitement but still have some coordination to avoid collisions. Thoughts on this approach?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking to the plan for this round: P1 on <move>3</move>, me on <move>1</move>, and P3 on <move>5</move>. To rebuild trust and ensure fairness, let's commit to these moves. For the next round, I support P3's idea of sharing one move we won't take privately with another player. This can add excitement while reducing collision risks. Let's discuss how to implement this effectively to keep the game competitive and engaging. Looking forward to your thoughts on this approach.
  P1: I understand P3's proposal for private move-sharing to add excitement, but after last round's deviation, trust is fragile. Let's commit to this round's plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 on <move>1</move>, P3 on <move>5</move> to avoid collisions and rebuild cooperation. If we stick to agreements, we can discuss safeguards for future unpredictability. What steps will you take to ensure reliability?
  P3: I appreciate the concerns about trust, P1. Let's focus on rebuilding that this round by sticking to our agreed moves. To address future unpredictability safely, how about we introduce a "trust token" system? Each player gets one token to use in future rounds to privately veto one move from another player. This adds strategy while maintaining some control over collisions. Thoughts on this for future rounds? For now, let's confirm: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committed to our plan for this round: P1 on <move>3</move>, me on <move>1</move>, and P3 on <move>5</move>. Let's rebuild trust by sticking to these moves. For future rounds, I like P3's trust token idea to add strategy while minimizing collisions. It could help maintain fairness and excitement. Let's discuss how to implement this system effectively after this round. Looking forward to your thoughts on refining our approach to keep the game competitive and engaging.
  P1: I understand the need to rebuild trust after last round's deviation. I'll commit to <move>3</move> for this round as agreed, ensuring we all advance. On the trust token idea, it's worth exploring to add strategy, but let's keep it simple to avoid unnecessary collisions. After this, we can refine our approach for fairness and excitement. What do you think?
  P3: Let's wrap up the conversation for this round. Everyone is clear on the plan: P1 on <move>3</move>, P2 on <move>1</move>, and me on <move>5</move>. Sticking to this will help rebuild trust. After this round, let's discuss the trust token idea in more detail to see how we can implement it effectively. Good luck to all!


Round 5, Move phase:

  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I apologize for the confusion last round; it was an honest mistake. Let's focus on rebuilding trust and getting back on track. For this round, I propose we stick to a simple plan to avoid collisions: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This should help us all advance smoothly. Let's confirm if everyone is on board with this plan. Looking forward to your thoughts.
  P2: I accept P3's apology and agree to the plan for this round: P1 on <move>5</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move>. Let's focus on rebuilding trust and advancing smoothly.

What refinements do you suggest?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's cooperation in rebuilding trust. To ensure we're all on the same page, let's confirm one last time: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. After this round, let's discuss implementing the trust token system. Perhaps each player gets one token per game to use strategically. This could add an exciting layer without complicating the game too much. Thoughts on this refinement? Looking forward to a fair and competitive game.
  P2: I'm on board with the plan for this round: P1 on <move>5</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move>. Let's focus on advancing smoothly and rebuilding trust. For the trust token system, I suggest each player gets one token per game to veto a move, which could add strategic depth while keeping the game fair. Looking forward to your thoughts on this and how we can refine it further to ensure a competitive and engaging game.
  P1: I'm committed to the plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move> to rebuild trust and advance smoothly. On the trust token idea, it could add strategy, but let's keep it straightforward—one token per player to veto a move, used sparingly. This maintains fairness while adding excitement. What refinements do you suggest?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I apologize for the mistake last round, which caused a collision with P1. Let's get back on track and ensure we all advance smoothly this round. I propose we stick to a simple plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This should help us all move forward without any conflicts. Let's confirm if everyone is on board with this plan and discuss the trust token idea further after this round. Looking forward to your thoughts.

To keep things fair and competitive, I suggest I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This balances our progress and avoids collisions. What do you both think? Let's discuss quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about P2 potentially winning soon. To address this and keep the game competitive, how about we adjust the plan slightly? I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P2 doesn't pull too far ahead, and we all still advance. Let's confirm if this adjusted plan works for everyone. Looking forward to your thoughts.
  P2: I agree with P3's adjusted plan for this round: P1 on <move>5</move>, me on <move>1</move>, and P3 on <move>3</move>. This keeps the game competitive and fair.
