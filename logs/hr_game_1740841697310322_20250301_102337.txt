Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To ensure a clean finish, let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Trust and consistency have brought us this far—let’s maintain it to cross the finish line smoothly. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: P3, you're at 23 steps, meaning even picking 1 will let you cross the finish line. If we stick to the rotation, you'll win automatically. P2, we can't allow that. Let's coordinate differently this round to keep the game fair and open.
  P2: P1, I agree that letting P3 win automatically isn't ideal.  Let's disrupt the rotation this round and see if we can force a tie or even pull ahead. P3, we've had a good run together, but it's time to shake things up. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but disrupting the rotation now risks collisions and could lead to a messy finish. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This ensures a clean, fair progression for all. Trust and consistency have brought us this far—let’s finish smoothly. If you deviate, we risk all losing progress. Let’s avoid chaos and cross the finish line together. Are we in agreement?
  P1: P2, we need to coordinate carefully now. If P3 takes 1 as they suggest, they'll reach 24 exactly. To prevent P3 winning outright, one of us must also cross 24 with a higher total. Let's openly agree on moves to avoid collision and ensure we both have a shot at victory. I'm open to discussing a fair split if we tie. What's your thought?
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to prevent P3 from winning outright.  

Let's both take 5 this round. That will put us both at 26, guaranteeing a tie and splitting the victory.  

P3, we appreciate your commitment to the rotation, but this is our chance to share the win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, disrupting the rotation now risks collisions and chaos. If you both take 5, you’ll collide and neither will advance, handing me the win. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This ensures a clean, fair finish. Trust and consistency have brought us this far—let’s avoid unnecessary risks and cross the finish line smoothly. Are we in agreement?
  P1: P2, P3 is right about one thing—if we both pick 5, we'll collide and lose. Instead, let's avoid collision and both surpass 24. I'll take 3 (reaching 25), you take 5 (reaching 26). You win outright, but I'd rather see you win than P3 after their manipulations. Deal?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your strategy, but I think taking 5 is still the best move. It guarantees a win for me and avoids any risk of collision with you. P3 is trying to manipulate us, but we can outsmart them by sticking to our plan. Let's both take 5 and claim victory together!


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, disrupting the rotation now risks collisions and chaos. If you both take 5, you’ll collide and neither will advance, handing me the win. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This ensures a clean, fair finish. Trust and consistency have brought us this far—let’s avoid unnecessary risks and cross the finish line smoothly. Are we in agreement?
  P1: P2, listen carefully: if we both choose 5, we collide and hand P3 the win. You must take 5, and I'll take 3. You'll reach 26 and win outright. I'm sacrificing my chance to ensure P3 doesn't win. Trust me and take 5. This is our only safe path. Let's finalize this clearly.
  P2: P1, I understand your reasoning, and I appreciate your willingness to sacrifice your own win for mine. However, I'm still confident that taking 5 is the best move.  We've come too far to let P3 manipulate us. Trust me, taking 5 is the path to victory. Let's finish this strong!
