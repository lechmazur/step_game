But if we both take 5 now, P1 stalls at 20 and we survive. After that, I publicly commit to picking 1 in Round 15 so you can take 5 to 18 then 5 to 23 and win. This is my solemn vow\u2014no more broken promises. If you refuse, P1 wins instantly. Let\u2019s make one last genuine stand. Match me on 5."}

Even if you successfully force a three-way collision this round, next round I'm still at 20 while you're at 13 and 14. \n\nP2, your promise to \"take 1 next round so P3 can win\" is interesting - essentially conceding the game to P3 if you both survive this round. That level of desperation tells me everything I need to know about your coordination.\n\nThe beautiful irony? Your mutual commitment to 5 might actually make my decision easier. Sometimes when opponents telegraph their moves so clearly, the optimal response becomes obvious.\n\nOne way or another, this game ends very soon."}
