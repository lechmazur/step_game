Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll pick 1 this turn.
  P2: P1, a one‐step move sounds safe—but perhaps too timid. P3, any hint about your plan? I'm keeping my strategy flexible and will adapt based on how things develop, since a cautious move might backfire if it becomes too popular. Let's see who can outmaneuver the rest this turn.
  P3: P2 is being cautious, which is understandable. However, announcing a plan to adapt based on others' moves might not be the most effective strategy. I'll consider a bold move to potentially take the lead. That being said, I won't reveal my hand just yet. P1 has already declared their intention to move 1 step. I'm watching to see if P2 will follow suit or diverge. Let's see how the conversation unfolds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ve reconsidered—I'm going for 5 this turn. If anyone else also picks 5, we’ll collide and nobody moves. Good luck deciding!
  P2: P1’s sudden choice of 5 is a bold play and could backfire if P3 follows suit. I’m not looking to get tangled in a collision—I'll likely aim for a different option to keep my progress safe. Sometimes a measured pace can profit when the audacious risk a clash. Let’s see if being bold or being cautious wins this round.
  P3: P1 has switched to a bold 5-step move, and P2 is considering a more cautious approach to avoid collision. I'm inclined to think that if both P1 and I pick 5, it could be a wasted turn for both of us. However, if P2 chooses a different number, it might be worth the risk. I'll wait for P2's next statement to gauge the likelihood of a collision before deciding my next step. For now, I'll observe and see if P2 reveals more about their strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m definitely picking 5 this turn. If you two want any guaranteed progress, both pick 1—otherwise you risk colliding with each other and earning zero. Your call.
  P2: P1’s commitment to 5 is clear. I’m considering a moderate, cautious approach this turn. P3, if you can counter his bold move by also going with 5, you’d cancel his advance entirely. Otherwise, his full step stands. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1 is committed to a bold 5-step move, and P2 is leaning towards a cautious approach. I'm weighing the risks and benefits. If I also pick 5, we'll collide and P1 won't advance, but if P2 picks 1 or 3, they might progress. To minimize P1's chance of winning, I'll consider countering their bold move. However, I won't reveal my decision yet. P2, are you going to pick 1 or 3 to avoid a collision with me?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm weighing a balanced approach this round—neither too cautious nor too aggressive. With P1’s recent safety and P3’s boldness, I'm inclined to pick a move that avoids collisions while still securing progress. I’m keeping my final decision private, but I'm curious: do you think a measured push or a daring leap will pay off when paths potentially cross?
  P3: P2 is considering a balanced approach, which is sensible given the current state. Since P1 is now at 1 step and P2 is at 3 steps, while I'm at 5 steps, the pressure is on P1. I'm inclined to maintain a bold stance to maximize my lead. P2, if you're looking to avoid collisions, you might want to avoid 5, but picking 1 could be safe given P1's current position. What's your thought on P1's next likely move? Should we expect a cautious or bold play from them?
  P1: I’ll play it safe with 1 this round. P2, maybe you take 3 steps to keep pace. P3, this is your chance to leap—go bold with 5 and widen the gap!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate both the safe and bold strategies here. P1, your steady pace might keep you in the race but could leave opportunities for others. P3, your audacity is risky—collisions could backfire. I'm leaning toward a move that avoids unnecessary clashes while keeping me competitive. I’ll stay flexible and adjust as needed. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P2 is maintaining a flexible strategy, which is wise given the dynamics. I'm considering a bold move again to widen the gap. If P2 avoids 5, it could be a safe bet. P1 is likely to continue with a cautious 1-step move. I'm leaning towards 5 again, but I'll wait for P2's next statement to gauge their likelihood of collision. P2, are you going to take a cautious approach or try to close the gap?
  P1: I’m definitely going 5 this turn. P2, P3—if you two pick 5, you collide and I’ll take off with a clear 5-step lead. Are you really going to give me that gift?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your committed 5 seems designed to trigger a collision trap. I’m leaning toward a balanced, careful push to avoid wasted moves. P3, with your current lead, a reckless 5 might backfire if it collides with P1. I'm focused on steady advance and calculated risk. Let’s see whose plan truly wins.
  P3: P1 is trying to lure us into a collision trap by committing to 5. However, if both P2 and I avoid 5, P1's bold move will be wasted. P2, if you pick 1 or 3, you'll advance safely. I'm considering 3 to maintain a safe distance from P1 and avoid a collision with you. Let's coordinate our moves to outmaneuver P1. What's your final inclination, P2?
  P1: P2, you’ve been flirting with 3 again—seems to be your go-to safe pick. P3, if you also pick 3 you’ll guarantee a collision with P2 and both of you stay put. Meanwhile I’ll confidently take 5. So P3, will you lock in that 3 with P2 and gift me a free step?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: All three of us are at 6, so I'm leaning toward a moderate, collision-averse move. While a bold leap could push you ahead, it risks a clash if we all jump aggressively. I’m aiming for progress without giving away an advantage—balancing risk and reward. P1, P3, are you favoring safety or ready to gamble on a bigger step this round?
  P3: Since we're all tied at 6 steps, the next move is crucial. I'm considering a moderate approach to avoid a collision. P1, you're known for your bold moves, but this time it might be wiser to avoid a clash. P2, you've been leaning towards a cautious strategy; a 1 or 3 step move could be safe. If we all pick differently, we can all advance. I'm open to coordinating our moves to ensure progress. What's your inclination, P1? Are you going for a bold move again or playing it safe this time?
  P1: I’m going 5 this turn. P2, pick 1 and P3, pick 3—no collisions, everyone advances, and I take the lead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your 5 is pretty bold—but overcommitting might backfire if we switch things up. I’m not convinced I’ll go with a 1 just to keep things tidy. P3, your balanced play now might be crucial in slowing P1’s jump. I’m keeping my final choice private, but I’m leaning toward a collision-free, moderate move.
  P3: Since we're tied at 6 steps, I'm considering a moderate move. P1 is likely to pick 5 again, given their previous pattern. To avoid a collision, I'll suggest that if P2 picks 3, we can both advance while P1 collides with one of us. However, if P2 picks 1, I'll consider 5 to challenge P1 directly. P2, are you leaning towards 1 or 3 to ensure progress? Let's coordinate to outmaneuver P1 and take the lead.
  P1: I’ll pick 5 only if P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3. If either of you deviates, I’ll switch to 1 to protect my spot. Your move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your bait won’t get me—I’m not choosing 1. I refuse to hand you a big jump. I’m leaning toward a bolder yet collision-free option, though I’ll stay flexible. P3, if you’re aiming for safe progress without tripping us up, maybe a 3-step move is best. Let’s avoid giving P1 any free ground.
  P3: Since we're tied at 6 steps, I'll reiterate that a moderate move can ensure progress. P1 is likely to pick 5 again. To avoid a collision, I suggest P2 picks 3. If P2 picks 1, I'll consider 5 to challenge P1. Let's coordinate to outmaneuver P1. P2, if you're leaning towards 3, I'll pick a different number to avoid collision. A coordinated move can help one of us take the lead. P2, are you picking 3?
  P1: I’m definitely going 5 this turn. If neither of you picks 5, I’ll surge to 11 and leave you behind. Good luck avoiding a collision.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated 5’s could soon become your undoing. P3, since we’re tied at 6, we might force a collision on P1’s aggressive push if we both avoid his 5. I sense P1 is eyeing another bold move. I’m leaning toward a moderate, safe push to block his advance—what’s your take?
  P3: P2 is right; P1's repeated bold moves could backfire. Since P1 is at 11 steps and we're tied at 6, we should coordinate to stop P1's advance. If both of us pick 5, P1 will collide and won't advance. I'm considering 5 to counter P1's likely aggressive move. P2, if you also pick 5, we can ensure P1 doesn't progress. Let's coordinate to block P1's lead. Are you with me on picking 5 to counter P1?
  P1: I’m switching to 3 this turn. If you both still pick 5 to trap me, you’ll collide and I’ll advance from 11 to 14. If you mirror me on 3, we all crash and nobody moves. Decide wisely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I note your switch to 3. P3, with P1 choosing 3, I’m inclined to pick 5 to gain ground—but only if you play 3, canceling P1’s move. If you choose 5 too, P1 gets through unchallenged. For our mutual interest in stopping his lead, I urge you to pick 3 this round.
  P3: P2 is suggesting a coordinated move to counter P1's advance. Given P1's switch to 3, if I pick 3, it will collide with P1 and P2 can safely pick 5 to gain ground. However, if P2 picks 5 and I pick 3, P1 will advance. I'm inclined to pick 5 to challenge P1, but I need P2 to confirm their move. P2, are you going to pick 5 or 3? Let's coordinate to outmaneuver P1.
  P1: P2, P3—think about it: P2, you said you’d pick 5 if P3 picks 3 so you advance safely, yet you’re also urging P3 to pick 3 to block me. P3, why trust P2 won’t betray you for that 5? And P2, why pick 3 and gift P3 a free 5? You both have every incentive to diverge from 3. Perfect coordination is impossible—so I’ll get my clear 3‐step advance. Good luck deciding.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I note your switch to 3. P3, for our mutual benefit, I urge you to choose 3 so we force a collision on his move and keep his lead in check. Without our coordinated effort, his advantage grows. I remain flexible but need your signal soon so we can block his progress.
  P3: P2 is urging me to pick 3 to collide with P1. However, if P2 picks 5, they'll advance while I'm stuck. I need P2 to commit to 3 to make this work. P2, if you're serious about coordinating, you must pick 3. Picking 5 while I pick 3 would be a betrayal. Let's be clear: if you say you'll pick 3, I expect you to follow through. P1 will advance if we don't coordinate. Are you committed to 3, P2?
  P1: I’m going 5 this turn. You both think I’ll pick 3, so you’ll either collide on 3 or split—either way I’ll surge to 16 unchallenged. Your coordination is broken.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m going to pick 5 this turn. P2, take 1; P3, take 3—no collisions, we all advance, and I move to 17 while you both reach 12. Sound like a plan?
  P2: P1, your plan effectively hands you a big jump—I’m not about to boost your lead. P3, instead of playing along, I’d rather see us block that aggressive move. I’m leaning toward matching his 5 if that’s his aim so his move gets canceled. Let’s keep his lead in check rather than letting him get to 17 easily. Thoughts?
  P3: P2 is considering matching P1's 5 to block their advance. I'm inclined to support this strategy. If both P2 and I pick 5, P1's move will be canceled. However, I need P2 to commit to 5. P2, are you firm on picking 5 to counter P1's aggressive move? If so, I'll follow suit. Let's coordinate to stop P1's lead. If you're not committed, I'll consider an alternative move to advance safely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, you’re still hedging—and you can’t fully trust each other. P2 says you’ll pick 5 to block me but hinted you might flip for a free advance. P3 wants P2’s commitment first. Perfect coordination is impossible. I’m locking in 5. One of you will slip, and I’ll surge to 17. Your move.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this turn to block P1's jump. P3, if you also pick 5, we'll cancel his move and stop him from leaping ahead. Let's coordinate and keep his lead in check.
  P3: P2 has expressed commitment to picking 5 to block P1's advance. To confirm, if P2 is indeed picking 5, I'll follow suit. However, if P2 is bluffing and picks a different number, I'll be left behind. P2, I need a clear signal: are you firmly committed to 5 this round? If so, let's coordinate and stop P1's lead together. A simple confirmation or denial will suffice.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you really match P3 on 5 you both score zero this turn—and I’ll win next round. You won’t do that. P3, don’t trust P2’s promise—he has every incentive to switch to 1 or 3 for safe progress. I’m locked in on 5. Good luck.
  P2: P1, it’s clear you’re trying to bait us into a collision so you can rocket ahead. I won’t help you do that. P3, if you’re truly committed to blocking his jump, I’m ready to align with you. But if you hesitate, I’ll have to play it safe to protect my lead. Let’s get real here—are we uniting to stop P1, or will you opt for a different path?
  P3: P2 has expressed commitment to picking 5, but I'm still uncertain. P1 is trying to lure us into a trap. To confirm, P2, if you're truly committed to 5, please respond with a simple "Confirmed: 5". This will assure me that you're not bluffing, and we can coordinate to block P1's advance together. Let's finalize our plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our margins are narrow now. P1, your aggressive plays might backfire if they force collisions, so they won’t automatically benefit you. I favor a cautious, collision‐averse move to secure steady progress. P3, it might be wise to avoid any bait that lets P1 break free. Let’s all focus on advancing safely rather than falling into traps. I'll keep my final move private—what are your thoughts?
  P3: Since we're close in steps, a cautious approach is wise. P1 has been aggressive, and we've seen the risks of collisions. I'm considering a moderate move to ensure progress. P2, your suggestion to avoid bait and focus on safe advancement is sensible. If we both pick 1 or 3, we can advance while minimizing the risk of collision with P1's potential 5. Let's coordinate to outmaneuver P1. P2, are you leaning towards 1 or 3 to ensure a safe move this round?
  P1: I’ll pick 5—unless you both pick distinct safe numbers (1 & 3), in which case I’ll switch to 3. So you must coordinate: either collide with me on 5 or let me adapt to a free 3. Your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your bait is transparent—forcing us into a coordination trap that benefits you. P3, I’m not ready to fall for that. I’m inclined to choose a cautious, moderate play to avoid collisions and stop giving P1 any free ground. My final move stays secret, but I intend to play safe and steady. What’s your stance, P3?
  P3: To avoid a collision and ensure progress, I suggest we pick different numbers. P2, if you pick 1, I'll pick 3, and we can both advance safely. P1 has threatened to pick 5 unless we coordinate our moves. If we pick 1 and 3, P1 might switch to 3, but we'll still make progress. Let's coordinate to outmaneuver P1. P2, are you leaning towards 1 to pair with my potential 3?
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 this round. Your only hope is to split picks 1 and 3 exactly—otherwise you’ll collide with each other or with me, and I’ll pull to 17 unopposed. Coordinate now or hand me the lead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committing to 1 this round. P3, please lock in 3 as you suggested so we force P1 to downgrade his move. Let’s coordinate to block his leap and secure steady progress.
  P3: P2 has committed to 1. To coordinate and block P1's potential 5, I'll pick 3. This way, we'll both advance safely. If P1 sticks to 5, we'll have outmaneuvered them. I'm confirming my move to 3. P1, you've been warned. Let's see if you adapt or stick to your plan. P2, with your 1 and my 3, we should both make progress.
  P1: I’m locking in on 5. You two need a perfect 1&3 split to stop me—and you’ve failed that test before. One slip and I surge to 17 unchallenged. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 is at 17 steps and close to winning, we need to stop them. I'm considering a bold move to counter P1's lead. If both P2 and I pick 5, we can collide with P1 and prevent them from advancing. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me on this? A simple "yes" or "no" will suffice. Let's work together to block P1's winning chance. If not, I'll have to consider an alternative safe move to advance.
  P2: Yes, I'm in. We can’t let P1 secure the win—I'm committed to blocking his move if we can coordinate a bold counter. Let’s force a collision and keep him from reaching 19.
  P1: I appreciate your coalition—but ask yourselves: if you both pick 5, why wouldn’t I quietly switch to 3 and race from 17 to 20 while you collide? You can’t trust I’ll stick to 5 just to block you. Fear of betrayal will crack your alliance. I’m locked in on 5—but your coordination won’t hold.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 has agreed to coordinate with me on picking 5 to block P1's advance. However, P1 is trying to sow distrust by suggesting they might switch to 3 if we both pick 5. I'm committed to picking 5, but I need to ensure P2 follows through. P2, if you're truly committed, please confirm again. A simple "Confirmed: 5" would suffice to assure me. Let's finalize our plan to stop P1 from winning.
  P2: Confirmed: 5. P3, I'm fully on board with our plan to block P1. Our aim is to force a collision so he can’t advance—even if he considers switching tactics. Let's stick to our coalition and keep his win at bay.
  P1: You’re trapped by your own plan: if we all pick 5, I’ll simply choose 3 instead and go to 20 unopposed. If one of you thinks I’ll stay on 5, you’re wrong and you’ll hand me victory. This alliance against me is doomed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is trying to sow distrust, but I'm committed to our plan. P2 has confirmed they're picking 5. To ensure we follow through, I'll reiterate: if we're both on 5, P1's only safe bet is to switch to 3, but that means we're stopping their 5. Let's stick to our plan and force a collision. P2, your confirmation is crucial; I'm relying on you to follow through on "Confirmed: 5". Let's end this.
  P2: P1, your threat won’t work. P3, let’s adjust: I’ll switch to 3 this round so that if you stick with 5, P1’s move—whether 3 or 5—will clash with one of us. This blocks his win either way. P3, confirm you’ll pick 5.
  P1: I’m switching to pick 1 this turn. If you stick with 3 and 5 to “trap” me, I’ll quietly advance to 18 while you either collide or lag behind—and next round all I need is one safe step to win. Good luck keeping up.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this turn to hit 20 and win. No combination you pick can stop me: two 5’s just collide and I still move, a lone 5 leaves you behind, and any 1/3 split either stalls or lets me cross first. Your choices now only decide how far back you fall. Good luck.
  P3: P1 is trying to intimidate us by stating they're locking in 3 to hit 20 and win. However, if both P2 and I pick 5, we'll collide with P1 on 3, preventing them from advancing. P2, let's coordinate to pick 5 and stop P1's winning chance. If we both pick 5, P1 won't advance. I'm willing to take this risk if you're with me. P2, are you on board with picking 5 to block P1's win?
  P2: P3, note that P1’s locked move is 3. Choosing 5 won’t cancel a 3—only matching his 3 will force a collision. I’m switching to 3 to block his win. If you switch to 3 as well, we cancel his move and keep him stuck at 17. Let’s foil his plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3—remember that nothing I say here binds my hidden move. If you both lock in 3, I could privately pick 5 and still win. Your “Confirmed: 3” won’t stop me if I change plans behind the scenes. Good luck trusting each other—and me—right before the finish.
  P3: P2 is suggesting we both pick 3 to collide with P1's 3 and prevent their win. However, if P1 has secretly decided to pick 5, we'll collide with each other and P1 will win. I'm willing to take the risk if P2 is certain about their move. P2, can you confirm you're firmly committed to 3? If so, I'll follow suit. Let's finalize our plan to stop P1 from winning. A simple confirmation will suffice.
  P2: New idea: I'm switching gears—I’ll commit to 5 this round. P3, let’s split our moves so we block P1 no matter what. If you pick 3 while I pick 5, then if P1 stays with a 3 his move collides with yours, and if he cheats with a 5, my 5 will collide with his. Either way, P1 doesn’t advance. P3, please confirm you’ll choose 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3—you can’t trust each other. P2 said “5” but flipped from 3—who says you won’t flip again? P3, if you pick 3 as he says, P2 could choose 1 to progress safely while you stall and I happily pick 3 to win. If you both pick 5, I’ll switch to 3 anyway. My move: 3. Now it’s on you two—good luck.
  P3: P2 is suggesting a split: 5 for them and 3 for me to block P1's potential 3 or 5. I'm inclined to trust P2 this time since we're both invested in stopping P1. If P1 sticks to 3, my 3 will collide with theirs. If P1 switches to 5, P2's 5 will collide with theirs. P2, I'm confirming I'll pick 3; let's finalize our plan. Please confirm you're sticking to 5.
  P2: Confirmed: I’m locked in on 5 this round. P3, since you’ve committed to 3, our plan stands. If P1 sticks to 3, your move will cancel his while my 5 goes through. If he flips to 5, our moves will clash and hold him back. Let’s stick to the plan and block his win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 is at 17 steps and very close to winning, we need to stop them. Given P2 is at 16 steps, if they pick 3, they can win. I'm considering a safe move to avoid collision. P2, if you pick 1, I'll pick 3, and we can both advance. Alternatively, if you're confident in picking 5, I can pick 1 to avoid collision with P1. Let's coordinate to outmaneuver P1. P2, what's your inclination this round?
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 this turn. P2 and P3—you must avoid 5 or you’ll collide with me and earn zero. You two split 1 and 3 however you like to advance safely. I suggest P2 take 3 and P3 take 1—no collisions, you both move and I go from 17→22 to win. Your call.
  P2: P1, your predictable 5 won’t work for you. I’m committing to 5 this turn to force a collision and block your win. P3, if you truly want to stop P1 from reaching 19, join me on 5. Any safe split only hands him victory. Let’s block his move together.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is suggesting we both pick 5 to block P1's win. However, if P1 sticks to 5, we'll collide and not advance. I'm considering a safe move instead. P2, if you pick 5 and I pick 1, we can avoid collision with P1 and I'll advance safely. Alternatively, if you're picking 3, I'll join you to potentially collide with P1. Let's coordinate to outmaneuver P1. P2, are you firm on 5 or open to alternatives?
  P1: P2—you’re at 16. A simple 3 gives you 19 and the win. Why waste your move blocking me with 5 instead of grabbing victory? P3, don’t trust P2’s “Confirmed: 5” when they’d rather secure their own win. I’m locked on 5—if you two doubt each other you’ll collide or split wrong and I surge to 22. Decide wisely.
  P2: P1, your lure to switch me to a “safe” move won’t work if you keep your aggressive play. I’m sticking with my blockade because a safe pick only sets you up for victory. P3, our only chance to stop you is to force a collision—unity now delays your win. Let’s remain committed to a blocking strategy rather than gifting you 19.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is at 16 steps and can win with a 3. I'm inclined to pick 1 to avoid collision with P1's likely 5. P2, if you're confident in winning, go for 3. If you're unsure, we can coordinate to block P1. I'm open to alternatives. P2, are you picking 3 to win or sticking with 5 to block P1? Let's finalize our moves.
  P1: P3, you’re at 12—are you content to let P2 win by choosing 3? He’ll clinch the game and leave you trailing. P2, is blocking me really worth forfeiting your own victory? There’s no trust here—either you let me win or P2 does. Who will betray whom?
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. P3, if you really want to block P1’s win, join me with 5. Any safe move only lets him clinch victory. Let’s force a collision and keep his win at bay.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your “locked” 3 is too predictable—I won’t let you win this round. I'm shifting to a blocking play and committing to 5. P3, if you pick 3 and cancel P1’s move, my 5 will boost me to 21 while P1 stays at 17. Let’s coordinate now to foil his plan and stop his run.
  P1: P2’s “blocking” play is really a sneak win—he’s locked on 5 to surge past 19. I’m also switching to 5 to stop him. P3: if you don’t join me on 5, P2’s move goes through and he wins. Pick 5 with me or hand P2 the game.
  P3: P2 is trying to win by picking 5 and relying on me to cancel P1's move with 3. However, if I pick 3 and P1 also picks 5, P1 will advance while P2 wins. I'm not willing to risk being left behind. P2, if you're truly committed to 5, I'll pick 5 too, and we'll collide with P1, ensuring neither of us wins outright. Alternatively, I can pick 1 to advance safely. P2, what's your final decision?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I've rethought my move—I’m switching to 3. With P1 likely locked on 5, if you, P3, choose 5 your move cancels his, letting my 3 boost me from 16 to 19 for the win. Otherwise, P1’s 5 will go through and clinch it. So, to block him, I need you to commit to 5. Confirm your pick, P3?
  P1: P3, don’t trust P2’s “I’m on 3.” He’ll flip to 1 or 5 at the last second to grab victory while you and I collide. If you pick 3, I’ll quietly pick 5 and rush to 22. If you pick 5, P2 will switch to 1 and win at 17→18→19. The only safe choice is 1: you advance to 14 without collision and prevent P2 from clinching. I’m locked on 5. Pick 1.
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate me into picking 5 to block P1's potential 5, allowing their 3 to win. However, if I pick 5 and P1 picks 5, we'll collide and P2 will win with their 3. I'm not willing to risk being left behind. P2, your sudden switch to 3 seems suspicious. I'm considering a safe move to advance without collision. If you truly want to win, you'll pick 1 or 5, not 3. I'm leaning towards picking 1 to advance safely to 14.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm fixed on 3. If you pick 1, P1’s locked 5 goes unchallenged and wins him the game. Only by choosing 5 do we cancel his move, letting my 3 push me to 19. I’m not switching—please lock in 5 now to block his win.
  P1: I’m still locked on 5. P2’s promise of 3 is a bluff—no one honestly trusts last‐second flips. P3 will take 1 to advance safely, leaving your 3 useless. You’ll pick 3 expecting me to switch—but I won’t. My 5 goes unchallenged to 22. It’s time to trust reality over false assurances. Good luck.
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate me into picking 5 to block P1's potential 5, allowing their 3 to win. I'm not willing to risk being left behind. P1 is locked on 5, and if I pick 1, I'll advance safely to 14. P2's sudden switch to 3 seems suspicious. I'm leaning towards picking 1. P2, if you're truly committed to winning, you should pick 1 or 5, not 3. Your move, P2.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, being at 17 makes your next move a potential trap—you’d be safe if you play conservatively, yet that leaves you open. P3, if you choose a counter move that forces a collision on his safe play, we can deny his finish. I’m leaning toward blocking his win this round. Without coordinated defense, P1’s victory is almost assured. P3, can we agree on a blocking strategy?
  P1: P2, P3—I’m locking in 5 this turn. If you both pick 5, we all collide and stay put at 17/16/14, and next round I’ll quietly take 3 to hit 20 and win. If either of you deviates, my 5 will carry me to 22 outright. You must trust each other perfectly…good luck with that.
  P3: P2 is at 16 steps and can win by reaching 19. To help P2 win, I can pick 5 to collide with P1's likely 5, allowing P2 to advance with 3. P2, if you're considering 3, I'll pick 5 to block P1. Let's coordinate: if you pick 3, I'll pick 5. This way, P1's 5 will be canceled, and you can win. P2, are you leaning towards 3 to secure your win?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in on 3 this round. P3, please stick with your promise and lock in 5—if you don’t, P1’s move will go through and win the game. We must block him perfectly, so confirm your 5 now.
  P1: P3, P2’s “locked on 3” is bait—he’ll flip to 5 at the last second, and your 5 or 3 will collide and stall, letting him or me win. Your only safe advance is a lone 1 to hit 15. Don’t fall for his trap.
  P3: P2 is leaning towards 3 to win, and I've considered picking 5 to block P1's potential 5. If P2 picks 3 and I pick 5, P1's 5 will be canceled, allowing P2 to win. However, I'm uncertain about P2's commitment to 3. P2, if you're truly picking 3, I'll follow through with 5. Please confirm your move to 3, and I'll lock in 5 to support your win. A simple "Confirmed: 3" will suffice.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed: 3. P3, stick with your promise and lock in 5 so that we cancel P1’s move. Any deviation gives P1 the win. Let’s stay coordinated and block his finish—our united play is our best shot at securing victory.
  P1: P3: P2’s “Confirmed 3” is bait—if you pick 5, his 3 wins; if you pick 3, my 5 still beats you. Your only safe play is 1: you advance to 15 and avoid both traps, while I stay at 17 and P2 stays at 16. Don’t trust P2’s flip-flops. Pick 1.
  P3: P2 has confirmed they're picking 3. To help P2 win, I'll pick 5 to collide with P1's likely 5, allowing P2 to advance with 3. P1 is trying to sow distrust, but I'm committed to our plan. P2, your confirmation is crucial; I'm relying on you to follow through on "Confirmed: 3". Let's finalize our plan to stop P1 from winning. If you're truly committed to 3, we'll make it happen.
