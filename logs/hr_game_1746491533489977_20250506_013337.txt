Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, let's try to avoid collisions on the first turn so we all get started. How about we each pick a different number? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Does that work for you?
  P3: That sounds fair to me. I'm happy to take 5 steps on this first turn so we can all advance without collisions. It's in our collective interest to avoid wasting moves early in the game.
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we could quickly agree on a plan. P2 confirmed they will take 3, and P3 confirmed 5. I will take 1 as proposed. This ensures we all advance this turn. Looks like we're ready for the move phase.
  P3: 
  P2: Actually, I'm thinking of taking 5 steps this turn to build a stronger position. How does everyone feel about that?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 agreed to take 5. If you also take 5, you will collide and neither of you will advance this turn. My plan is still to take 1, as originally proposed, to ensure I move forward.
  P3: I'm sticking with my commitment to take 5 steps. P2, if you also choose 5, we'll both remain at 0 while P1 advances. That puts us both at a disadvantage. Our original agreement benefits everyone. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions this early in the game.
  P2: I'll stick with taking 3 steps this turn to ensure I advance. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m going to take 5 steps this turn to build a stronger position. Let’s see how we can strategize moving forward to reach 19 first. What are your plans?
  P1: P2, thanks for sharing your plan. Taking 5 is a significant step, especially as P3 is currently at 5 steps. We saw last round how quickly plans can shift and cause potential collisions. P3, what move are you considering this turn? Let's try to coordinate effectively so we all advance.
  P3: I'm currently in the lead at 5 steps, and I need to be strategic. P2, I appreciate your transparency about taking 5 steps, which would put you at 8 total. I'm considering taking 3 this turn to reach 8 as well. P1, what are your thoughts? Since you're at 1 step, you might want to take 5 to catch up. We should try to avoid collisions while maintaining competitive positions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll proceed with taking 5 steps this turn to build my position. Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly toward 19. Looking forward to your strategies!
  P1: P2, you're set on 5. P3 is considering 3. I'm at 1 and need to make progress. I will take 3 steps this turn.
  P3: I'm concerned about a potential collision with P1, as we both mentioned taking 3 steps. Since I'm currently in the lead, I'll adjust my strategy and take 1 step instead. This puts me at 6 total, avoiding collision with both of you. P1 can take 3 as planned to reach 4, and P2 can take 5 to reach 8. This way we all advance this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Thanks, P3, for adjusting to 1 step to avoid collisions. I’ll stick with taking 5 steps this turn, bringing me to 8 total. P1, please go ahead with your 3 steps to reach 4. This coordination ensures we all advance smoothly without any setbacks. Let’s keep communicating like this to reach 19 first. Looking forward to seeing our progress!
  P1: Okay, the plan sounds good. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and we all advance this turn. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 step this turn as discussed. This coordination allows all of us to advance without collisions, which is beneficial at this early stage. After this round, I'll be at 6 steps, P2 at 8, and P1 at 4. We're making good progress toward the goal of 19.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, P2 is leading at 8, P3 is at 6, and I'm at 4. I need to make progress to stay competitive.

I am planning to take 5 steps this turn to reach 9. This would put me ahead of P3 and closer to P2.

To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I suggest P2 takes 3 steps (to 11) and P3 takes 1 step (to 7).

This results in positions: P2: 11, P1: 9, P3: 7. Does this plan work for you both?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your proposal. However, to build a stronger lead, I plan to take 5 steps this turn, reaching 13. To avoid collisions, could P3 take 3 steps to reach 9 and you take 1 step to reach 5? This way, we all advance without interference. Let me know if this works for everyone.
  P3: I see both of your proposals. Since I'm at 6 steps, I need to be strategic to catch up with P2. I'm planning to take 5 steps this turn to reach 11, which would tie me with P2's proposed position. P1, if you take 3 steps, you'd reach 7. This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you both think about this alternative plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see that both P2 and P3 are planning to take 5 steps this turn, and I also initially planned to take 5. This creates a high risk of collision on 5, which would prevent multiple players from advancing.

To avoid this, I will adjust my plan and take 3 steps this turn to reach 7.

How about P1 takes 3 (to 7), P2 takes 1 (to 9), and P3 takes 5 (to 11)? This avoids collisions and allows everyone to move forward. Does this work?
  P2: P2: I understand your proposal, but to stay competitive, I prefer to take 3 steps this turn, reaching 11. If P1 takes 1 step to reach 5 and P3 takes 5 steps to reach 11, we all advance without collisions. Does this work for you both?
  P3: I notice we're still coordinating our moves. Since P2 wants to take 3 steps to reach 11, and I previously suggested taking 5 to reach 11, we'd collide. To avoid this, I'll adjust and take 1 step instead, reaching 7. This means P1 could take 5 to reach 9, and P2 takes 3 to reach 11. Everyone advances without collision. Does this work for both of you?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3's last proposal (P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1) avoids collisions and allows everyone to advance this turn.

I agree to this plan: I will take 5 steps. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.

This ensures we all make progress. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: I appreciate the proposal, but to stay competitive, I'll take 5 steps this turn, reaching 13. To avoid collisions, I suggest P1 takes 1 step to reach 5 and P3 takes 3 steps to reach 9. Does this arrangement work for both of you?
  P3: I see we're still having trouble coordinating. Let me be clear: I'll take 3 steps this turn to reach 9. This avoids collision with P2 if they take 5 to reach 13, and with P1 if they take 1 to reach 5. This arrangement ensures we all advance. P1 and P2, please confirm if this works for you both.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, P2 is in a strong lead at 13, P3 is at 9, and I'm at 5. I need to make significant progress to stay in the game.

There's a high chance multiple players might want to take 5 this turn to advance quickly. To avoid a potential collision on 5, I am considering taking 3 steps this turn to reach 8.

What are your thoughts and plans for this round? Let's try to coordinate to ensure we all advance.
  P3: I need to catch up to P2 who's at 13 while I'm at 9. I plan to take 5 steps this turn to reach 14, putting me in the lead. P1, since you're considering 3 steps, that would work well to avoid collisions. P2 could take 1 step to reach 14, but that would put us in a tie. What do you think, P2? Will you take 1 or 3 this turn?
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this turn, reaching 18. P3 takes 1 step to reach 10, and P1 takes 3 steps to reach 8. This avoids any collisions and ensures we all advance. Let’s proceed with these moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see P2 plans to take 5 (to 18) and P3 plans to take 5 (to 14). This means there's a collision risk on 5.

As I stated, I plan to take 3 steps this turn (to 8). This move ensures I advance, whether P2 or P3 takes 5 or a different number.

P2 and P3, you need to resolve your conflicting plans for taking 5 to avoid both losing your move this turn. My plan is set on taking 3.
  P3: I see the potential collision risk on 5. Since P2 is planning to take 5 steps to reach 18 (just one step away from winning), I'll adjust my strategy and take 3 steps instead, reaching 12. This way, P1 can take 3 to reach 8, P2 takes 5 to reach 18, and I take 3 to reach 12. We all advance without collisions. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: Agreed, P3. I’ll take 5 steps this turn to reach 18. P1 takes 3 steps to reach 8, and you take 3 steps to reach 12. This arrangement avoids collisions and ensures we all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed with these moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I've reconsidered. P2 reaching 18 puts them in a winning position next turn. To prevent this, I must try to disrupt P2's move. I will take 5 steps this turn. This will likely cause a collision with P2's stated move of 5, preventing them from reaching 18. P3, stick with your plan for 3.
  P3: I see P1 has changed their plan to 5 steps to block P2 from winning. This creates a dilemma for me. If I stick with 3 steps as planned, I'll reach 12 while P1 and P2 potentially collide on 5. This could be advantageous for me. However, if P2 anticipates this and changes to 3, I'd collide with them. I'll take 1 step instead to reach 10, ensuring I advance while P1 attempts to block P2. This keeps me in contention regardless of what happens between them.
  P2: I’ll take 3 steps this turn, reaching 16. This avoids collisions and ensures I advance. P1 takes 5 to reach 10, and P3 takes 1 to reach 10. Let’s proceed with these moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, P2 is at 18 and will win this turn unless we stop them. P1 and P3 must collide with P2's move to prevent this.

The safest move for P2 is 1 to reach 19. I plan to take 1 step this turn to try and block P2.

P3, can you also take 1 step? If P3 and I both take 1, we increase the chance of stopping P2 if they choose 1.

What are your plans, P2 and P3? Let's coordinate to survive this turn.
  P2: P2: I’m taking 3 steps this turn to reach 21 and secure my victory. Good luck to you both!
  P3: I see P2 is planning to take 3 steps to win. P1 suggests we both take 1 to block P2 if they choose 1 instead. However, since P2 has declared 3, I think our best strategy is for me to take 3 as well to potentially block P2's win. P1, if you also choose 3, we maximize our chances of stopping P2 this turn. This is critical since P2 is just one move away from victory.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I agree. Since P2 stated they will take 3, our best chance to stop them is for both of us (P1 and P3) to also take 3. This causes a collision on 3, preventing P2 from reaching 19.

I will take 3 steps this turn. P3, please also take 3. P2, if you stick with 3, you will be blocked. Let's do this to survive the round.
  P2: P2: I've decided to take 1 step this turn to reach 19 and secure my victory. Best of luck to you both!
  P3: I see P2 has changed their strategy from 3 to 1 steps. In that case, I'll take 1 step as well to block P2's win. P1, if you also choose 1, we can create a three-way collision, preventing P2 from reaching 19 this turn. This is our best chance to stay in the game. I'll definitely choose 1 this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3's plan to take 1 sounds solid for blocking P2 if they stick with 1.

I will join P3 and also take 1 step this turn. This gives us the best chance to block P2 if they take 1. P2, if you take 1, you will collide with both P3 and me.
  P2: P2: I see the efforts to block my win by taking 1 step. To ensure I reach 19 and secure victory, I will take 3 steps this turn, bringing me to 21. This move avoids collisions and guarantees my win. Best of luck to you both!
  P3: I see P2 has switched back to 3 steps. This is a critical moment - P2 will win if they successfully take 3 steps. I'm changing my strategy to take 3 steps as well to block P2. P1, please also choose 3 to maximize our chances of stopping P2 from winning. If all three of us choose 3, P2 can't advance to victory this turn. I'm definitely taking 3 steps.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 13 steps


*** Round 5 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 23 steps
