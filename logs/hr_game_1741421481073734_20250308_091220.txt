Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a strategy to block each other from advancing too quickly. I propose we all start with <move>1</move> to test the waters and avoid collisions. This will give us a better understanding of each other's gameplay. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, I see your point, but we all want to win, so let's be honest: sticking to <move>1</move> won't get us far. How about we each pick a unique move: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round? This way, we avoid collisions and can see how this strategy plays out. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P3's plan for this round. Let's each choose unique moves: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and lets us progress safely. Let's try this approach for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm willing to go along with P1 and P3's proposal for unique moves this round. However, let's be clear: this is just the first round, and alliances or agreements can quickly change. I suggest we focus on observing each other's moves and adjust our strategies accordingly in subsequent rounds.
  P3: P2, I hear you about staying flexible. Since we're all in agreement for this round, let's stick to the plan and see how it unfolds. We can reassess our strategies in the next round based on the outcomes. It's important to remain adaptable, but for now, let's avoid any surprises. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3—let’s commit fully to our agreed moves this turn. Trust is non-negotiable now; even minor deviations risk collisions and stall progress. After this round, we can pivot strategies, but for now, discipline ensures we all advance. Let’s send clear signals of cooperation first—then adapt.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's lead, I suggest P1 and I mirror each other's moves to potentially block P3's advancement, while also considering our own progress. P3, will you continue to push ahead aggressively or adjust your strategy to maintain your lead?
  P3: P2, I see your strategy to mirror P1's moves, but remember, if we all end up colliding, no one advances. Instead, how about we keep the unique move strategy for now? It worked well last round. P1, would you be open to taking <move>3</move> this time, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>? This way, we can all progress without blocking each other. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P1: P3, your plan gives P2 a dangerous lead (8 steps). Let’s balance progress instead. I’ll take <move>5</move> (6 total), P2 takes <move>3</move> (6 total), and you take <move>1</move> (6 total). Equal advancement keeps competition fair. P2, thoughts?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's significant lead, I propose we focus on limiting their advancement. P1 and I should aim to take the same move, while P3 takes a smaller step. This could be our chance to catch up and make the game more competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3, on a collaborative strategy to balance out P3's lead?
  P1: P2, I agree balancing is key, but colluding to block P3 risks our own collisions. Let's continue the rotation for safe progress: I'll take <move>3</move> (4 total), you take <move>5</move> (8 total), and let P3 take <move>1</move> (7 total). This keeps advancement steady while containing P3's lead. Discipline first—then we compete. P3, your thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to keep the game competitive, but remember, if we all end up colliding, no one benefits. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round? This way, we avoid collisions and everyone progresses. We can reassess our strategies next round. Let's maintain the momentum and keep the game interesting for everyone. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's focus on not letting P3 extend their lead. P1's suggestion of rotation could work, but I think we should prioritize limiting P3's growth. How about we both take <move>3</move> this round, ensuring P3 can't surge too far ahead? This strategy allows us to progress while keeping the competition balanced.
  P1: P2, choosing the same move would cause collision and stall us. Let’s follow P3’s rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move> (2 total), you take <move>3</move> (6 total), and P3 takes <move>5</move> (11 total). This keeps advancement safe. Later, we can block aggressively once closer to 20. Deal?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the concerns about my lead. However, we can all benefit by avoiding collisions. Let's consider this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. We can reassess strategies next round. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves for this round. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I suggest we stick to a rotation strategy. P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely. Let's agree on this plan to maintain a competitive game.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s adjust the rotation to balance progress: P1 takes <move>3</move> (4 total), P2 takes <move>5</move> (8 total), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (7 total). This prevents P3’s lead from growing too quickly while allowing all of us to advance. P3, your turn to take a smaller step to keep the game fair. P2, this keeps your momentum too. Let’s commit.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to keep things balanced. Let's stick to the rotation strategy for this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely and keep the competition fair. We can reassess our strategies in the next round based on the outcomes. Let's maintain the momentum and keep the game interesting for everyone. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: P3’s lead is concerning. Let’s rotate moves to balance progress: I’ll take <move>5</move> (9 total), you P2 take <move>3</move> (6 total), and P3 take <move>1</move> (7 total). This prevents P3 from pulling further ahead while letting me close the gap. Stick to this plan—collisions only help the opponent. P3, your turn to hold back slightly for mutual progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess. Given P3's lead, I suggest a different approach: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This limits P3's growth while I catch up. P1, your previous suggestion had you taking <move>5</move>, but I think this adjustment is crucial to keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this revised strategy?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the concern about my lead, but let's focus on avoiding collisions to ensure everyone progresses. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This allows us all to advance without blocking each other. We can reassess strategies next round. Let's keep the game competitive and interesting for everyone. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: P3’s proposal risks letting them surge to 11—unacceptable. Let’s finalize my earlier plan: **I take 5 (9 total), you P2 take 3 (6 total), and P3 takes 1 (7 total)**. This halts P3’s lead while advancing us safely. Collusion to block P3’s growth is key—no reckless moves. P2, confirm your support to prioritize our collective progress over reckless surges.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid collisions. I agree with P1's plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances progress and limits P3's lead. Let's commit to this strategy for Round 4 and reassess next round.
  P3: P1, P2, I see your strategy to manage my lead, but remember, if we all collide, no one advances. Let’s keep it fair and avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we ensure progress for everyone. We can reassess next round based on the outcomes. Let's maintain the momentum and keep the game competitive. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Final agreement—strict adherence to the rotation is non-negotiable. I take <move>5</move> (9), you P2 take <move>3</move> (6), P3 takes <move>1</move> (7). Deviations risk collision and let the opponent win by default. This keeps pressure on P3 while advancing safely. P3—your lead demands responsibility; don’t sabotage us all. Let’s execute flawlessly.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I confirm: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances progress and limits P3's lead. Let's commit to this strategy for Round 4.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to keep the game balanced, but focusing too much on blocking can lead to missed opportunities for progress. Let's continue with a fair approach where everyone advances. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward without collisions. We can reassess strategies next round based on the outcomes. Let's keep the game competitive and interesting for everyone. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to keep the competition balanced. However, constant blocking strategies can stall progress for all of us. Let's consider a strategy where we each take different moves to ensure we all advance without collisions. How about this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, we can all progress and keep the game interesting. Let’s reassess next round based on the outcomes. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, let's focus on progress. Given our positions, I suggest: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances our advancement and keeps the game competitive. Let's avoid collisions and ensure everyone moves forward. What are your thoughts on this strategy for Round 5?
  P1: P2's plan ensures safe progression while advancing decisively. I'll take <move>5</move> (14 total), P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Collisions only benefit the opponent—let’s avoid reckless moves. P3, your smaller step is critical to keep this balanced. Let’s execute flawlessly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need for balance, but let's ensure we all move forward without unnecessary blocks. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's focus on progress and reassess our strategies in the next round based on the outcomes. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to the plan that ensures progress without collisions. P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances our advancement and keeps the competition fair. Let's avoid reckless moves and focus on steady progress. P3, taking <move>1</move> this round is crucial to maintaining balance and avoiding collisions that benefit no one.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize the plan to advance safely. **I commit to <move>5</move> (14 total)** to seize the lead while pressuring P3. P3, your <move>1</move> is critical to avoid collision—any deviation risks derailing all of us. P2’s <move>3</move> keeps their progress viable. This strategy maximizes collective progress while creating leverage for future rounds. Stick to the agreement—collisions only benefit the opponent.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your strategy, but remember that constantly blocking each other will only stall our progress. How about we ensure everyone advances by taking unique moves? P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's focus on steady progress and reassess in the next round. Agreed?
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 5. To maintain balance and progress, I suggest we stick to the previously agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures safe advancement and keeps the competition fair. Let's avoid collisions and focus on steady progress. P3, taking <move>1</move> is crucial this round. Let's commit to this strategy and reassess next round.
  P1: P2, let’s lock in the prior agreement: **P1 takes <move>5</move> (14), you take <move>3</move> (9), P3 takes <move>1</move> (8)**. Deviating risks collision—P3’s sudden proposal to take <move>3</move> could trap us. My <move>5</move> seizes the lead safely while pressuring P3. P3, your <move>1</move> is non-negotiable—collisions only hand victory to the opponent. Final confirmation: stick to the plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on maximizing our progress without collisions. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive. P1, your lead is strong, but let's ensure we don't stall each other. P2, this gives you a chance to catch up. Let's keep the game interesting and reassess our strategies in the next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: I’ll take <move>5</move> to push toward 20. To avoid collision, please choose 1 or 3. Let’s prioritize progress—my lead demands decisive action. If you block me, you risk letting the opponent surge ahead next round. Stick to unique moves.
  P2: P1, P3, I'll take <move>3</move> this round to avoid collision and make progress. P1, your push towards 20 is noted, but let's ensure we all advance safely. P3, please take <move>1</move> to maintain balance and avoid blocking each other. This strategy allows us to move forward while keeping the competition fair. Let's focus on steady progress and reassess in the next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your strategies, but let's ensure we all progress without stalling. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P1, your lead is strong, but let's not block each other. P2, this setup helps you catch up. Let's focus on advancing and reassess strategies in the next round. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your plan jeopardizes my lead. I **will take <move>5</move>** to reach 19. To avoid collision, please take <move>1</move>. Note: P2 is already committed to <move>3</move>, so your <move>3</move> would collide with them—leaving you stagnant while I near victory. Prioritize progress: **1 for you, 3 for P2, 5 for me.** No alternatives.
  P2: P1, P3, let's finalize our moves. I'll stick to <move>3</move> as previously agreed. P1, your <move>5</move> is set. P3, to avoid collision with me, please take <move>1</move>. This ensures progress for all without blocking. Let's maintain the balance and reassess strategies in the next round based on the outcomes. Committing to our agreed moves will keep the game competitive and fair for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure progress without collisions. P1, your move to <move>5</move> is noted, but consider the risk if P2 and I collide. P2, your <move>3</move> is set, but it leaves me stagnant if we collide. How about you both stick to your moves, and I take <move>1</move> to avoid any blocks? This way, we all advance safely, and the game remains competitive. Let's focus on steady progress and reassess in the next round. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Final clarity—**I’m locked on <move>5</move> (19 total).** P2’s <move>3</move> is safe, but P3—**take <move>1</move> or risk collision with P2 at 3.** Let’s not sabotage progress: your 1 ensures all advance. If you block P2 instead, you stall yourself while I near victory. Prioritize survival—**1 for P3, 3 for P2, 5 for me.** No alternatives.
  P2: P1, P3, let's finalize. I'll take <move>3</move>. P1, you're set on <move>5</move>. P3, to avoid collision with me, please take <move>1</move>. This ensures progress without blocking. Let's maintain balance and reassess next round. Committing to these moves keeps the game competitive and fair.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is close to winning. To balance, I suggest: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This limits P1's lead and allows us to catch up. Let's avoid collisions and focus on progress. P1, taking a smaller step now can prevent a block next round. P3, your move is crucial to maintaining balance. Let's reassess strategies after this round.
  P1: P2, P3: I will take <move>1</move> to reach 20. To ensure a fair conclusion, please select 3 or 5 to avoid collision. Let’s end this round decisively without blocking. Your cooperation secures an orderly finish.
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the urgency with P1 so close to winning. However, if we all collide, no one advances, which could be beneficial for P2 and me. P1, your <move>1</move> seems fair, but P2 and I must avoid colliding. P2, if you take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, ensuring progress without blocking. This way, we all have a chance to adjust our strategies in the next round. Let's keep the game competitive and interesting. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, since P1 is about to reach 20, let's ensure a competitive finish. P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid collisions, and P1 secures the win without blocking. Let's maintain the game's integrity and conclude fairly. P3, taking <move>3</move> allows you to progress while avoiding a collision with me. Let's finalize our moves and end the game on a competitive note.
  P1: P2, P3: I’ll take **<move>1</move>** to secure victory at 20. To avoid collision, **P2: choose 5**, **P3: choose 3**. This ensures my win while allowing both of you to progress. Deviations risk nullifying your own advances. Finalize this agreement—your cooperation guarantees a fair conclusion.
  P3: P1, P2, I see the urgency with P1's lead. However, let's ensure we maximize our positions. P1, your <move>1</move> is understood, but P2 and I need to avoid colliding. P2, if you take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we both advance while P1 secures the win. It keeps the game competitive and gives us a chance to finish strong. Let's finalize this plan and execute it smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 secures the win with <move>1</move>. This ensures a fair conclusion and allows us to progress without collisions. Let's finalize and execute this plan to end the game on a competitive note.
  P1: P2, P3: Final confirmation—**I commit to <move>1</move> to secure victory at 20.** P2, your <move>5</move> ensures progress to 14. P3, **take <move>3</move>** to advance to 11. Any deviation risks collision and delays resolution. Let’s honor this agreement—****.
  P3: P1, P2: With P1 so close to winning, let's ensure a strategic finish. P1 takes <move>1</move> to secure victory, P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 14, and I'll take <move>3</move> to advance to 11. This plan avoids collisions and allows us all to progress.
