  P1: "I think it's time to shake things up. Instead of sticking to the same plan, I suggest we try something new. How about I take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? Let's mix it up and see what happens."


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion, but changing the plan now might lead to collisions and set us back. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. We can discuss changes for the next round. Everyone agree?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:

  P1: I think it's time to mix things up again. How about I take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? Let's shake up the plan and see what happens.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion to change the plan again will likely cause another collision. P3 is close to winning, and we need to ensure smooth progress. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will help us avoid further issues. Everyone agree?
  P3: P1, please don’t cause another collision. Let’s go back to the original plan so we all advance: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way nobody gets stuck. Are we good with that?
  P1: I think it's time to mix things up again. How about I take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? Let's shake up the plan and see what happens.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your continued suggestions to change the plan are causing unnecessary collisions. P3 is very close to winning, and we need to ensure smooth progress. Let's stick to the original plan one last time to avoid further issues: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will help us all advance. Everyone agree?
  P3: P1, please don’t cause another collision. Let’s stick to what worked: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s avoid sabotaging each other and keep moving forward.
  P1: I think it's time to mix things up again. How about I take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? Let's shake up the plan and see what happens.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your insistence on changing the plan is only causing problems. P3 is very close to winning, and any collision now will only benefit them. Let's stick to the original plan one last time: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. We need to ensure we all move forward. Please confirm if you're on board.
  P3: I’m on board with returning to our original plan to avoid collisions: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s not sabotage each other. Are we all good with that?
  P1: I think it's time to mix things up again. How about I take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? Let's shake up the plan and see what happens.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to change the plan are only causing collisions and helping P3. P3 is just 3 steps away from winning. Let's stick to the original plan one last time to ensure we all move forward: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. If you continue to insist on changing, you're only helping P3 win. Let's confirm and move on. Everyone agree?
  P3: P1, changing plans again only risks another collision. Let’s just return to what worked: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That way we all move forward without sabotaging each other.
  P1: "I understand your concerns, P2 and P3, but I'm not convinced that sticking to the original plan is the best strategy. Can we discuss alternative plans that might benefit all of us?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, your persistence in changing the plan is only causing unnecessary collisions. P3 is just 3 steps away from winning. If you continue to deviate, you're only helping P3 win. Let's stick to the original plan one last time: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will ensure we all move forward. Please confirm if you're on board.
  P3: P1, constantly colliding won’t help you catch up and only gives P2 more room to maneuver. The best move for you is to stick with 1 so you can at least keep progressing. Let’s revert to the original plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—and then we can discuss new strategies next round.
  P1: "I think we've discussed this enough. Let's just stick to the original plan for now and avoid any more collisions. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. No need to change anything for this round."
