Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round to guarantee we move forward. P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 5? What do you think?
  P1: I'm fine with P2's suggestion. To confirm, I'll pick <move>1</move>, you P2 pick <move>3</move>, and P3 can pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward. Let's make a silent agreement to avoid collisions this round. I'm ready to move after this. If you're okay with this plan, P3, please confirm. If not, let's discuss alternatives.
  P3: I like the idea of avoiding collisions and moving forward together. That said, I’m keeping my final move flexible so I can adapt if needed—you all know I’m aiming for the win. Let’s commit to distinct numbers for now to ensure progress, but I’m ready to adjust if the situation calls for it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good P1 and P3. Let's stick with the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 to get us all moving. We can re-evaluate our strategies after this round.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the plan for this round, I'm ready to proceed. However, I'd like to start thinking ahead to the next round. Let's make a mental note that if we're still close together after this round, we might need to start thinking about differentiating our moves to avoid collisions again. P2, P3, are you thinking about your strategy for Round 2, or should we just focus on making progress this round?
  P3: I'm on board with the plan for this round. However, while avoiding collisions now is smart, later rounds might require a bit of unpredictability to secure the win. I'll follow our current strategy for now and adjust if needed as we progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 2 looks interesting. Our last distinct moves strategy worked, but being slightly ahead might invite surprises. I'm leaning toward sticking flexible to adjust if needed. I'm curious: are you both set on distinct moves again, or might one of you consider a twist this round? I'm ready to adapt as the round unfolds.
  P1: To avoid getting too predictable, I'm considering a change in strategy this round. Since we're still relatively close, I'll suggest we mix it up slightly while still trying to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, would you be open to randomizing our moves this round or sticking to a different pattern? For instance, we could shift our numbers by one position or change the order entirely. Let's discuss a slight tweak to keep things interesting and unpredictable.
  P2: Okay, how about this round we switch it up a bit? P1, you pick <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. This way we all still move, but in a different order. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your twist is interesting. I'm open to changing the order, though I'll keep some flexibility given my slight lead. I prefer a plan that minimizes collision risks while still moving us forward. P1, are you comfortable with this adjustment or do you have another tweak in mind? My focus remains on progressing safely and keeping the advantage, so I'll adapt if needed.
  P1: I'm leaning towards P2's suggestion for Round 2: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This maintains the distinct moves strategy while introducing a change. P3, since you're slightly ahead, you might want to consider if picking <move>1</move> is optimal or if you should stick with a higher number to maintain your lead while still avoiding collisions. Let's finalize our moves.
  P2: Okay P3, I think my suggestion of P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and you P3 picking 1 is a good compromise. It keeps us all moving forward and avoids collisions, while also mixing things up a little as P1 suggested.  Are you both on board with this for Round 2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far. Given my current standing, I'm considering a slightly more assertive option this round to help secure my lead. If we’re serious about avoiding collisions, you might want to tweak your moves a bit from the original proposal. I'm still keeping my final move private, but I thought it best to signal that I may not strictly follow the earlier plan.
  P1: Since P3 is slightly ahead and has hinted at being more assertive, I'll suggest a slight adjustment to minimize potential collision risks while still moving forward. How about we stick with the original proposal for this round: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This maintains distinct moves and avoids collisions. If P3 wants to be more assertive, they can still choose differently, but this is my plan unless there's a better alternative.
  P2: Okay, given P3's hint of being assertive, and to ensure at least some progress while minimizing collision risk for myself, I'll stick with my suggestion of picking <move>5</move>. P1 and P3, to avoid a potential collision between you two, perhaps you can decide between <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>? Let's aim for at least two of us moving forward this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I still favor clear, non-colliding choices so progress isn’t stalled, but I might take a bolder step if opportunities arise. I'm keeping my final move flexible—if either of you veers off the clear path, I'll adjust to secure my lead. Shall we agree on distinct moves for this round, or are surprises on the table?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, for this round, how about we try a different set of distinct moves?  P1, could you pick <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>? This keeps us all moving forward but changes the numbers we choose, adding a bit of unpredictability. What do you think?
  P1: P2's suggestion for Round 3 is a good one, maintaining distinct moves while changing the order. However, considering P3's lead and flexible strategy, I'll propose a slight adjustment. How about P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>? This still keeps our moves distinct but gives P3 a moderate step while keeping P1 and P2 safe from collision with each other. P2 and P3, what are your thoughts on this tweak?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm leaning toward a bolder move this round. I'm inclined to choose 5 to build on my lead. To ensure distinct moves and avoid collisions, how about P1 takes 3 and P2 picks 1? This way we all progress safely. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, to keep things moving and avoid collisions, I still think my initial suggestion for this round is solid: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>.  This way we all make progress.  Are we all in agreement on this plan?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain progress, I'm open to adjusting our moves. Given P3's lead and flexibility, I'll consider their suggestion. However, to minimize risks, I propose: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks a number that ensures distinct moves. If P3 chooses <move>5</move>, it risks collision with me. Let's finalize: I'll pick <move>3</move>. P2, please confirm if you'll pick <move>1</move>. P3, what's your move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your focus on avoiding collisions. While I favor our distinct moves approach, given my lead I’m leaning toward a bolder, yet collision‐free option. I’ll lock in my move privately once we’re clear on our plans, so please confirm your choices for a safe round. Let’s ensure our moves remain distinct for progress.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's try P3's suggestion this time to ensure we all move forward without collision: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This seems like a fair plan that keeps us progressing. Are we all in agreement on this?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain progress, I'm sticking with my previous plan: I'll pick <move>3</move>. P2, please confirm if you're picking <move>1</move> as discussed. P3, you're aware of the options; please ensure your move is distinct. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we all move forward. If P3 picks <move>5</move>, it should work with my <move>3</move> and P2's <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with this plan unless there's a better alternative.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain progress, let's analyze our current positions. I'm at 7 steps, P3 is at 11 (5+5+1), and P2 is at 8 (3+5). Given P3's inconsistent moves, I'll be cautious. How about we stick to distinct numbers again? A possible plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This maintains our progress without collisions. P2 and P3, are you open to this or do you have alternative suggestions?
  P3: I like the idea of avoiding collisions. P1’s proposal—P1: 1, P2: 3, and me: 5—works for a safe round. I’m on board for distinct moves, though I’ll remain flexible if any surprises come up. Ultimately, my focus is on steady progress toward a win.
  P2: Sounds good P1 and P3, I'm also on board with distinct moves to ensure we all progress.  Let's go with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 5 for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions, I'm sticking with the proposed plan for Round 4: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves. P2, are you still comfortable with picking <move>3</move>? P3, will you stick with <move>5</move> as previously agreed? If so, we can proceed with this plan. If not, please suggest an alternative to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our choices for this round.
  P3: I'm on board with the distinct moves plan for round 4. I'll lock in move 5 as agreed. However, I'm keeping an adaptive edge—if either of you deviates last minute, I'll adjust my private move to secure my position. Please confirm: P1 with move 1, P2 with move 3, and I with move 5.
  P2: Yes P1 and P3, I confirm I will pick <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's proceed with P1 picking <move>1</move>, P2 picking <move>3</move>, and P3 picking <move>5</move> for this round to ensure we all move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 4, let's stick with the agreed plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. I've confirmed my move. P2 has also confirmed their move. P3, please confirm if you're sticking with <move>5</move> as agreed. If so, we can proceed. If not, let's discuss an alternative to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our choices for this round.
  P3: I'm on board with our distinct move approach this round. I plan to follow our agreed assignment while keeping my options open for any last-minute adjustments. Let's stick to safe, non-colliding moves so we all progress smoothly.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, just confirming again that I'm good with picking <move>3</move> this round, as we've discussed.  Let's lock in these distinct moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) and ensure we all make progress this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, for round 5, how about we continue with distinct moves to ensure progress? Let's try P1 pick <move>5</move>, P2 pick <move>3</move>, and P3 pick <move>1</move>. This way we all move forward and keep the game interesting. What do you think?
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 5, I agree with P2's suggestion of distinct moves. However, considering P3's current lead and flexibility, I'll propose a slight adjustment. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>? This still keeps our moves distinct but gives P3 a chance to extend their lead while keeping P1 and P2 safe. P2 and P3, are you open to this tweak or do you prefer the original plan?
  P3: I support the distinct moves plan. P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1 minimizes collision risk. I'll choose a move that complements this setup while preserving my lead, though I’ll keep my final choice private. This strategy seems safest given our positions. Any objections or further tweaks before we lock it in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I'm open to distinct moves. How about we try this: P1 picks <move>1</move>, I pick <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>? This way we all progress and I can catch up a bit. What do you both think of this arrangement for distinct moves?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 5, I'll suggest a plan. Currently, P3 is ahead, so I'll prioritize avoiding collisions. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>? This maintains distinct moves and allows P3 to continue leading without risking a collision. P2 and P3, please confirm or suggest an alternative. I'm open to adjustments if needed to ensure progress for all. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P3: I'm in favor of ensuring safe progress. I'm locking in move 3 for this round, which complements our distinct strategy—P1 on 1 and P2 on 5 as suggested. This keeps collisions at bay while steadily extending my lead. I'm prepared to adjust if any surprises arise.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it sounds like we are settling on P1 picking 1, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 3 for this round to ensure distinct moves and progress.  I'm confirming I will pick <move>5</move> as part of this plan.
  P1: To finalize our moves for Round 5, I'm confirming I'll pick <move>1</move> as previously discussed. P2, you're picking <move>5</move>, and P3, you're picking <move>3</move>. This plan maintains distinct moves, ensuring we all progress without collisions. Let's proceed with this agreed plan. I'm ready to move to the next phase. If you're both in agreement, let's stop discussing and finalize our moves.
  P3: I'm on board with keeping things collision‐free. I'm focused on maintaining my current lead by sticking with our distinct move strategy while staying flexible if any last adjustments are needed. Let me know if there's any final change; otherwise, I'm ready to lock in my decision.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, for round 6 let's keep the distinct moves going to ensure we all progress. How about this round we try: P1 pick <move>1</move>, P2 pick <move>5</move>, and P3 pick <move>3</move>? This should keep us moving forward without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 6, I'll consider P2's suggestion. However, given P3's lead, I'll propose a slight adjustment. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This keeps our moves distinct and allows P3 to still progress while giving me a moderate step. P2 and P3, are you open to this tweak or do you prefer the original plan? Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P3: I propose we settle this: for Round 6, let’s lock in distinct moves as follows—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll take 5. This avoids any collisions and lets us all progress, while my move ensures I extend my current edge. If you have no strong objections, I’m ready to go with that plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I still think my original suggestion for this round works well: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3. This maximizes my progress while keeping distinct moves. What do you think of sticking with this plan?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain progress in Round 6, let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 9 steps, P2 is at 11, and P3 is at 13. I'll suggest a distinct moves plan. How about P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This keeps our moves distinct, allows P3 to progress cautiously, and gives P1 a chance to catch up. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan or do you have alternative suggestions?
  P3: P3: I note that some proposals would assign me either a 5 or a 1. I favor a collision‐free, assertive play to maintain my lead, yet I remain flexible if we all commit to distinct moves. Let’s agree on a plan where each of us chooses a unique number, ensuring progress without clashes. I’m willing to adapt if small tweaks help us all move safely. What are your final thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's try my initial suggestion for this round again to ensure we all move forward with distinct moves: P1 pick <move>1</move>, P2 pick <move>5</move>, and P3 pick <move>3</move>. This maximizes my step this round while keeping us collision-free. What do you both think?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 6, I'll directly propose a distinct moves plan. Let's consider: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This maintains distinct moves, allows P3 to progress cautiously, and gives me a chance to catch up. P2 and P3, please confirm or suggest an alternative if needed. I'm open to slight adjustments to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P3: I'll stick with distinct moves to ensure safe progress. Given my current lead, I’m leaning toward a bold, high step this round if you both opt for lower numbers so our choices remain separate. Let’s finalize a plan that avoids collisions—please commit to moves that don’t overlap. I’ll adjust in the move phase only if necessary.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 7, let's analyze our positions: P1 is at 10 steps, P2 is at 11, and P3 is at 16 (13+3). Given P3's lead, I'll suggest a distinct moves plan. How about P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This keeps our moves distinct, allows P3 to progress cautiously, and gives me a chance to catch up. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan or do you have alternative suggestions?
  P3: I appreciate the clear proposal, P1. I’m all for distinct moves and keeping collisions at bay. That said, given my current lead, I'm leaning toward a slightly bolder option if we ensure safety. I remain flexible, though my focus is firmly on winning. P2, are you open to a modest tweak to solidify our no-collision approach? Let’s settle on a plan that maximizes progress for everyone.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, to ensure we all move forward and avoid collisions, how about we try this: P1 pick <move>3</move>, P2 pick <move>5</move>, and P3 pick <move>1</move>? This keeps our moves distinct, lets me make the biggest step to catch up, and still allows P3 to progress. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 7, I'll consider the suggestions. P2's latest proposal (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) is a good alternative to mine. It maintains distinct moves and allows P2 to catch up. I'm open to this tweak. P2, if you pick <move>5</move> and P3 picks <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. This keeps our moves distinct. P3, are you comfortable with this adjustment or do you prefer my initial suggestion (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1)? Let's finalize our plan.
  P3: P3: I appreciate both proposals. I'm committed to distinct, collision‐free moves to ensure steady progress. I favor a plan where our numbers are unique, while I keep my final move flexible to best protect my lead. I'm happy with either assignment—as long as we all commit to non‐overlapping choices. Let’s lock in our distinct moves and move forward safely.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I still think my suggestion of P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 1 is a good plan for this round.  It keeps us all moving with distinct moves, and lets me make a good step forward. Are we all in agreement on this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 7, I'm open to P2's suggestion: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This maintains distinct moves and allows P2 to catch up. P3, if you're comfortable with this plan, we can proceed. If not, we can stick with my initial proposal: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all progress without collisions. I'm ready to lock in my decision once we agree.
  P3: I'm fine with locking in distinct, collision‐free moves. I remain flexible with my final choice, though I lean toward a bolder option to protect my lead. Let's finalize our assignments now so we all avoid overlap and progress safely this round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's go with my suggestion for this round: P1 pick <move>3</move>, P2 pick <move>5</move>, and P3 pick <move>1</move>. This ensures distinct moves and lets me take a bigger step to catch up to you both.  Are we agreed on this plan for Round 7?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 8, let's analyze our positions: P1 is at 10 steps, P2 is at 16 (11+5), and P3 is at 18 (13+5). Given the current state, I'll suggest a distinct moves plan to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>? This maintains distinct moves and allows all of us to progress. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan or do you have alternative suggestions? Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: Sounds good P1.  Let's go with your suggestion for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5.  Distinct moves will ensure we all make progress.  I'm on board with this plan for Round 8.
  P3: I'm on board with distinct moves for a safe round. That said, I value flexibility—if any collision risk or unexpected signal appears, I might lean a bit bolder to safeguard my lead. Let’s commit to unique moves and keep the round collision‐free. I'm ready to adapt if needed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 8, I reaffirm my previous suggestion: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This maintains distinct moves and allows all of us to progress. P2 has already agreed, and P3 has shown flexibility. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. If you're both in agreement, let's proceed with this plan. I'm ready to finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: Yes P1, I'm happy to proceed with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 5 for this round as we discussed.  P3, please confirm you are also on board with picking 5 to ensure we all progress safely.
  P3: I'm on board with keeping our moves distinct. I’ll stick with our agreed plan for a safe round and remain flexible if any adjustments become necessary. Let’s lock in our unique choices and push forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 8, let's stick with the agreed plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This maintains distinct moves and allows all of us to progress. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we're all in agreement, let's proceed with this plan. I'm ready to finalize our moves for this round. If you have any last-minute adjustments, please let me know. Otherwise, let's lock in our choices.
  P2: P1 and P3, for this round, since we are getting closer to the target, maybe we should consider slightly different strategy. Instead of always distinct moves, how about we try to ensure at least one player makes a bigger step this round?  P1, would you be open to picking <move>1</move> this round? P3, maybe you can pick <move>3</move>? And I will pick <move>5</move>. This is still mostly distinct but with a slight change in numbers. What do you think?
  P3: I lean toward keeping our original, distinct moves. With P1 on 1 and P2 on 3, I’d prefer to take a bolder step this round to secure my lead. I’m flexible if any adjustments are needed, but my preference is to maximize safe progress.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, for round 9, how about we try this distinct move set: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I will pick <move>5</move>? This keeps us all progressing while allowing me to close the gap with P3 a little. What do you both think?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 9, I'll consider P2's suggestion. However, given P3's lead, I'll propose a slight adjustment. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This maintains distinct moves, allows P3 to progress cautiously, and gives me a moderate step to catch up. P2 and P3, are you open to this tweak or do you prefer the original plan? Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P3: I favor keeping things distinct and collision‐free. In Round 9 I’m leaning toward taking a bold step. I propose we use P1: 1, P2: 3, and I take 5. This setup avoids overlaps and helps extend my lead. I’m flexible if we need minor adjustments, but I’d prefer we stick with this clear plan. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, to slightly adjust from my last suggestion and considering P3's preference for distinct moves, how about this: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>? This is still distinct and lets me make a good step while ensuring we all progress. What do you both think?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 9, I'll analyze the suggestions. P3's proposal (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) is a good option as it maintains distinct moves and allows P3 to extend their lead. I'm open to this plan. P2, are you comfortable with picking <move>3</move>? P3, if you pick <move>5</move>, it should work. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all progress without collisions. If you're both in agreement, let's proceed with this plan.
  P3: I’m in favor of locking in distinct moves. To avoid collisions and keep progress steady, I’d like to lean on the bold option. If we assign P1 the lowest and P2 the middle value, I’ll take the highest move to press my advantage. Does everyone agree?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, considering we are all aiming for distinct moves, how about this round we try: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This would still ensure no collision, but allow me to make a bigger step and close the gap a bit. What do you both think of this arrangement?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 9, I'm open to the distinct moves plan. P3's proposal (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) is a good option. I'll pick <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with picking <move>3</move>. P3, if you pick <move>5</move>, it should work. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all progress without collisions. I'm ready to lock in my decision once we agree. Let's proceed with this plan unless there's a better alternative.
  P3: I appreciate all your input. I remain committed to keeping our moves distinct and collision‐free. I plan to lean bold to extend my lead, but I'll adjust if your selections shift unexpectedly. Let's lock in clear, unique assignments this round to ensure we all progress safely.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I favor a collision‐free round. Since we’re nearing the finish, let’s each pick a unique number to avoid blocking our progress. I’m inclined to a safe yet assertive play, but I’ll adjust if needed. Let’s lock in distinct moves so at least one of us can advance decisively. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, to ensure we all move forward without collisions this round, how about we try this distinct set: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>? This way we each make progress and keep the game going. What do you both think?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 10, I'll consider the current state: P1 is at 12 steps, P2 is at 14, and P3 is at 18. Given P3's lead, I'll suggest a distinct moves plan. How about P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>? This maintains distinct moves, allows P3 to progress cautiously, and gives me a chance to catch up. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan or do you have alternative suggestions?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m leaning toward an assertive play this round—if we all commit to distinct, non‐overlapping moves, I can safely press my advantage. I’d appreciate if we clear up assignments so that one of you takes the lower step while the other picks the middle option. That way, I can keep my flexible, decisive option available. Let’s lock in truly unique moves so we avoid collisions. What do you both say?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, given we are nearing the end, and P3 is in the lead, perhaps for this round we should try to maximize progress for those of us who are behind while still avoiding collisions. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>? This keeps distinct moves but allows me to gain ground on P3. What do you both think?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 10, I'll analyze the suggestions. P2's latest proposal (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3) and my previous suggestion (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3) both maintain distinct moves. Given P3's lead, I'll support a plan that allows me to catch up. Let's go with P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. P2, are you comfortable with picking <move>1</move>? P3, please confirm if you're picking <move>3</move>. This ensures distinct moves and progress for all.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm on board with distinct, collision‐free moves. I still aim to secure my lead while ensuring we all move forward safely. I lean toward an assertive yet adaptable play, so I'll adjust in the move phase if needed. Let’s finalize unique assignments so we can avoid clashes and keep progress steady.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I still think for this round the best distinct move set to ensure progress for me to catch up is: P1 pick <move>1</move>, P3 pick <move>3</move>, and P2 pick <move>5</move>. This allows me to gain ground on P3 while keeping the round collision-free. Let's aim for this plan.
  P1: To progress safely in Round 10, let's finalize our distinct moves. I'm open to either P1 picking <move>5</move> or <move>1</move> as long as our moves remain distinct. P2, are you comfortable with picking <move>1</move> as previously discussed? P3, please confirm if you're picking <move>3</move>. This ensures distinct moves and progress for all. Let's lock in our choices to avoid collisions and make a decisive step this round. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, for round 11, let's aim for distinct moves again to ensure progress. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>? This keeps us all moving forward and avoids collisions as we get closer to the finish line. What do you both think of this plan for a safe round?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 11, I'll consider P2's suggestion. Given P3's lead and our current positions (P1: 12, P2: 14, P3: 18), I'll propose a slight adjustment. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This maintains distinct moves, allows P3 to progress cautiously, and gives me a moderate step to catch up. P2 and P3, are you open to this tweak or do you prefer the original plan? Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P3: I'm sticking with distinct moves. Given my lead, I’m leaning toward a bold move this round to finish strong—provided P1 and P2 commit to lower numbers. I’m flexible, but I need a clear, collision‐free setup so I can press this advantage. Let’s lock our choices with unique moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, to solidify our distinct moves for this round, and considering we are all aiming to progress, let's go with my initial suggestion: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This ensures no collision and allows me to make a good step to catch up. Does this sound good for everyone?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 11, I'll analyze the current suggestions. P2's initial proposal (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3) and my adjustment (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) both maintain distinct moves. Given P3's lead, I'll support P2's plan as it allows them to catch up. Let's go with P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3. P2, please confirm you're picking <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm <move>3</move>. This ensures distinct moves and progress for all.
  P3: I appreciate everyone’s input. I still lean toward an assertive play to protect my lead but agree that avoiding collisions is key. As long as our moves remain distinct, I’ll keep my approach flexible when finalizing privately. If P1 takes a lower step and P2 a higher one, that should allow us all safe progress. Let’s lock in a collision‐free plan so we can push forward.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, for round 11 let's try my suggestion again for distinct moves: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress safely and I can close the gap a bit.  Does this plan work for you both this round?
  P1: To progress safely in Round 11, let's finalize our distinct moves. I'm open to P2's suggestion: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This maintains distinct moves and allows P2 to catch up. P2, please confirm you're picking <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm <move>3</move>. Let's lock in our choices to avoid collisions and make a decisive step this round. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan.
  P3: I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial. If P1 commits to the lower step and P2 to the highest, I’ll take the remaining unique option—while keeping my lead secure. I’m ready to adapt my final move privately to safeguard my advantage. Let’s lock in distinct, collision‐free moves this round.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm set to make a decisive move this round. With my lead at 21, I can win if we avoid collisions. I urge you both to choose lower-step moves so my bold play isn't blocked. I’ll keep my final move private, but if we stick to unique numbers, I can clinch the victory right now.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems P3 is aiming for a win this round. To avoid a collision and ensure at least one of us progresses, P1, would you consider picking a lower move like 1 or 3? I'll adjust my move accordingly to try and keep us moving forward.
  P1: To progress safely in Round 12, I'll consider P3's intention to make a decisive move. Given P3 is at 21 steps, they need only 2 more steps to win. I'll suggest P1 picks <move>1</move> and P2 picks <move>3</move>, allowing P3 to potentially pick <move>5</move> and win. This maintains distinct moves and respects P3's lead. P2, are you open to this plan? Let's avoid collisions and let the game conclude fairly. I'm ready to finalize our moves once we agree.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P1’s plan. If you both commit to lower moves—say P1 with 1 and P2 with 3—I’ll take my decisive step. Let’s keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions so the game can conclude smoothly. I'm ready to adapt if needed, but my focus remains on clinching this round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I agree with the plan for distinct moves to avoid collisions. To ensure at least someone progresses significantly, I will proceed with picking <move>5</move> as discussed. P1, please stick with <move>1</move> and P3, please choose <move>3</move> as we discussed. Let's make these distinct moves to keep the game moving.
  P1: To progress safely in Round 12, I'll stick with the previously discussed plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This maintains distinct moves and allows P3 to potentially win if they choose <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm if you're picking <move>3</move> as discussed. P3, if you pick <move>5</move>, it should conclude the game. Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions and let the game end fairly. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m set on a decisive move—I'm locking in 5. To keep our moves distinct and avoid blocking my win, I ask P1 to pick 1 and P2 to pick 3. This clean strategy lets us finish the game without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I will proceed with picking 5 as I mentioned earlier. To potentially block P3 from winning immediately, perhaps you could pick 1? Let's see what P3 does.
  P1: To avoid collisions and potentially end the game, let's stick with the previously discussed plan for Round 12: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. P2, I noticed you mentioned picking 5 earlier, which could lead to a collision with P3. I urge you to reconsider and pick <move>3</move> instead to allow P3 to potentially win or at least avoid a collision. Let's finalize our distinct moves.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 13, let's analyze our positions: P1 is at 14 steps, P2 is at 19, and P3 is at 21. Given P3's lead and proximity to P3's win condition (needing 2 more steps), I'll suggest a distinct moves plan to avoid collisions and potentially end the game. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>? This maintains distinct moves, allows P3 to potentially win, and keeps the game progressing. Let's finalize our moves.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, as P3 is close to winning, to avoid simply handing them the victory, how about this round P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I will pick <move>5</move>? This still keeps distinct moves but prevents P3 from winning immediately and allows me to get closer. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2: I’m leaning toward a bold, decisive play this round. To ensure our moves don’t collide, I’m advocating for distinct assignments—if P1 can take the low move (1) and P2 opts for 3, it keeps our steps unique. Let’s lock in these distinct choices so I can press my advantage.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 13, I'll stick with my previous suggestion: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This maintains distinct moves and allows P3 to potentially win if they choose <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm if you're picking <move>3</move>. P3, if you pick <move>5</move>, it should conclude the game. Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions and let the game end fairly. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, to be clear, I am not on board with P3 winning this round. My suggestion of P1 picking 1, P3 picking 3, and P2 picking 5 still ensures distinct moves and avoids collision.  This prevents P3 from winning immediately and allows both P1 and me to get closer. Let's go with this plan instead.
  P3: I'm sticking with a collision‐free strategy. I believe if P1 takes the lowest move and P2 the middle, it creates a clear path for progress. I won’t reveal my exact move, but I’m prepared to take an assertive step if our numbers remain unique. Let’s avoid collisions and lock in distinct moves so the game concludes decisively.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 13, I reiterate my previous suggestion: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This maintains distinct moves and allows P3 to potentially win if they choose <move>5</move>. P2, I understand your reluctance to let P3 win, but this plan avoids collisions. Let's finalize our moves to let the game end fairly. I'm ready to proceed with this plan unless there's a better alternative that still avoids collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, I am still suggesting P1 pick <move>1</move>, P3 pick <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>. This plan ensures no collision and stops P3 from winning immediately, while allowing me to close the gap. Let's keep it competitive and go with this plan.
  P3: I’m locking in a decisive play by taking 5 this round. To avoid collisions and let the game conclude fairly, I urge P1 to pick 1 and P2 to pick 3. That’s the only clear, collision‐free path for one of us to win. Let’s finalize these distinct moves so progress isn’t stalled.


Round 13, Move phase:

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 14, let's analyze our positions: P1 is at 15 steps, P2 is at 19, and P3 is at 26 (21+5). Given P3's significant lead and having already won, I'll suggest a distinct moves plan to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>? This maintains distinct moves and allows all to progress. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan or do you have alternative suggestions? Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: I'm on board with a collision‐free round. I'll lock in 5, so please stick with 1 and 3 to keep our moves distinct. This setup lets me capitalize on my lead. Let's finalize our moves and ensure a decisive finish.
  P2: P3, you said you'll lock in 5. To prevent you from winning alone this round, I will also choose 5. P1, please pick 1 or 3 to ensure you still progress. Let's avoid letting P3 win solo.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 14, I'll stick with my previous suggestion: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. P3 has already indicated they'll pick <move>5</move>. P2, please avoid picking <move>5</move> again to prevent a collision. Picking <move>3</move> will allow you to progress while keeping the game collision-free. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a decisive finish. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: I remain committed to a collision‐free, decisive play this round. P1’s commitment to a low move is solid, and I urge P2 to choose a number distinct from my high‐step option so we avoid blocking progress. Let’s agree on truly separate moves so the round concludes without a tie.
  P2: P3, as I said, to stop you from winning alone, I'm also picking <move>5</move>. P1, to ensure you still progress, please pick <move>3</move>. Let's prevent a solo win for P3 this round.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 14, I reiterate: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. P3 has indicated they'll pick <move>5</move>. P2, please avoid <move>5</move> to prevent a collision. Picking <move>3</move> will allow you to progress. Let's finalize our distinct moves. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. If P2 picks <move>3</move>, we can ensure a collision-free round.
  P3: I'm locking in 5 for my decisive move. To avoid a collision that blocks progress, please commit to distinct numbers—P1, lock in 1; P2, please choose 3. This unique set lets me reach 26 and win. Let’s agree now and avoid stalling the finish.
  P2: P1, to ensure P3 doesn't win solo, how about we both pick 5 this round? Let's block P3 together.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 15, let's analyze our positions: P1 is at P1: 16 steps, P2 is at 19 steps, and P3 is at 26 steps. Since P3 has already won, our goal is to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This maintains distinct moves. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>3</move>. Let's finalize our moves to conclude the game fairly.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, to ensure at least one of us progresses towards a win this round, how about we try distinct moves again? P1, could you pick <move>1</move>, and P3, would you consider <move>3</move>? I will then pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress and I have a chance to reach the target. What do you think?
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round to secure the win. For a collision‐free finish, I urge P1 to pick 1 and P2 to pick 3. This distinct set lets me reach 26 and win decisively. Please confirm so we can end the game fairly.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 15, I'll stick with my previous suggestion: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. P3 has indicated they'll likely pick <move>5</move> again. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and allow progress. Let's finalize our distinct moves to conclude the game fairly. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I will stick with my suggestion of picking <move>5</move> this round. P1, please pick <move>1</move> to ensure we have distinct moves for at least two of us. Let's see what P3 decides to do.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P1, please stick with 1, and P2, please choose 3. Colliding on 5 only stalls progress and hurts your chance to catch up later. Let’s finalize distinct moves so I can secure the win—and everyone benefits from a decisive finish.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To progress safely in Round 15, I'll reiterate my suggestion: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. P3 has indicated they'll likely pick <move>5</move> again. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our distinct moves. If P2 picks <move>3</move>, we can ensure a collision-free round. I'm ready to proceed with this plan unless P2 has an alternative that still avoids collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, as I mentioned, I'm still planning to pick <move>5</move> this round to try and get closer to the target. P1, please pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collision with me and ensure you also make progress. Let's see what P3 does.
  P3: P1 and P2, to wrap this round decisively we need distinct moves. P1, your low move works well. P2, please choose a number other than 5 so we avoid a collision that just stalls everyone. I’m committed to a clean, decisive play—and clear, unique moves are our best shot.
