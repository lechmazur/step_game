Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For a smooth start, let's coordinate to avoid collisions on the first turn. I suggest P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. This way, everyone advances without waste. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's coordinate this turn to avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. Future moves will require strategic adjustments to stay ahead.
  P1: Agreed. Let's follow the plan to avoid collisions. P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Safe start for all.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent, we're aligned for turn 1. To maximize progress and avoid collisions long-term, let's commit to ongoing coordination. I'll propose discussing a rotation after this move. What say you?
  P2: I agree with P3's rotation idea. Let's formalize a turn-based system where we cycle through choosing 5, 3, and 1 each round. Starting with me taking 5 next turn to build an early lead. This ensures steady progress while keeping collisions to a minimum. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's coordinate for P1 to take 5 next turn, P2 3, P3 1. This ensures maximum progress without collision. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To resolve the disagreement, I propose for turn 2: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3. This balances progress, gives P1 a chance to catch up, and minimizes collisions. We can discuss future rotations. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I believe we should honor the initial rotation agreement I proposed: P2 takes 5 next turn to establish momentum, followed by P1 at 3 and P3 at 1. This maintains fairness while allowing me to capitalize on my current position. Deviating risks inconsistency. Let’s proceed with this plan for Turn 2.
  P1: Let's finalize: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3. This ensures maximum progress without collision. Agree?


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This balances progress and avoids collisions. Agree?"
  P2: P2: I reiterate the prior agreement: for Turn 2, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This honors our initial rotation plan, prevents collisions, and allows me to secure momentum. Deviating now risks chaos. Let’s stick to the coordinated strategy we agreed on.
  P3: I stand by my proposal for Turn 2: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This balances progress, allows P1 to catch up, and minimizes collisions. P2, let's prioritize coordination over individual advantage to keep the game smooth. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's finalize P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to ensure everyone advances. This avoids collisions and keeps progress steady. Agree?
  P2: P2: The initial rotation agreement was clear: I take 5 this turn to build momentum, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Deviating now risks letting P3 dominate. Let’s honor our prior consensus to maintain fairness and progress. Collisions or chaos benefit no one—stick to the plan.
  P3: P2, your focus on personal gain is risking our coordinated strategy. By choosing P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, we ensure balanced advancement and avoid collisions, benefiting all. I'm committed to this plan for Turn 2. Let's prioritize group harmony over individual moves—deviating could lead to wasted opportunities. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This avoids collisions and ensures balanced progress. Agree?
  P2: <move>5</move> is critical for me this turn to maintain momentum. Let’s honor the *prior* agreement where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This was settled in Round 1’s conversation. Backtracking now creates uncertainty—someone might grab 5 last-minute and disrupt the plan. Trust the system we already agreed to. Collisions are avoidable only if we stick to the rotation. P1 and P3: confirm you’ll hold to your roles?
  P3: P2, your insistence on personal gain is undermining our coordination. Sticking to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 avoids collisions and promotes balanced progress, benefiting everyone long-term. Deviating risks wasted moves and chaos. I'm committed to this plan—P1, confirm your support? Let's finalize and advance smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's learn from last turn's collision fiasco. I propose for Turn 3: P3 moves 5, P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1. This ensures no collisions, lets P1 catch up, and maintains balanced progress. P2, you advanced last round—time to share the lead. Agree?
  P1: P1: "Let’s stick to P3’s plan: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This avoids collisions and keeps progress steady. P2, your 1 here lets P1 catch up—mutual benefit. Agree?"
  P2: P2: Let’s prioritize fairness and recovery. Since I lost ground in Round 2, I propose this turn’s rotation: P1 takes 5 (their turn after prior collisions), P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This balances progress, avoids collisions, and lets me recoup momentum. P3’s plan grants you an unfair lead—let’s adhere to a fair cycle instead. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan lets P1 surge to 9 steps, disrupting balance and risking future collisions. My proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) keeps progress steady, lets P1 advance moderately, and maintains my fair lead. P1, you supported this earlier—confirm now to avoid chaos. Let's coordinate for mutual benefit. Agree?
  P1: P3's plan (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) avoids collisions and balances progress. Let's stick to it for smooth advancement. Agree?
  P2: P2: To avoid letting P3 surge to 10, let’s balance progress: P1 takes 5 (9), I’ll take 3 (6), and P3 takes 1 (6). This spreads us competitively while preventing any single player from dominating. P1 gains ground, I recover momentum, and P3 stays in contention. Fair and strategic—agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your plan lets P1 jump to 9, creating an imbalance that could lead to future collisions and give them an unfair edge. My proposal (P3:5 to 10, P1:3 to 7, P2:1 to 4) ensures steady, balanced progress and rewards past coordination. P1, you've supported this—let's confirm to avoid chaos and advance smoothly.
  P1: Let's finalize P3's plan: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This avoids collisions and ensures balanced progress. Agree?
  P2: P2: To maintain fairness after my collision in Round 2, let’s honor the rotation: **P1 takes 5** (their turn), I’ll take **3** to recover momentum, and P3 takes **1**. This prevents any single player from surging ahead uncontested and keeps us competitive. P3’s plan grants you an unsustainable lead—let’s prioritize balance. Agree?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's avoid collisions: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This lets me close the gap while keeping progress balanced. Agree?"
  P2: P2: P3’s lead is unsustainable. To contain their progress, let’s adjust: **P2 takes 5** (to 8), P1 takes 3 (to 7), and P3 takes 1 (to 11). This limits P3’s momentum while letting P1 and I close the gap. Colluding to let P3 surge further only ensures their victory. Prioritize collective survival over reckless advancement—agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans unfairly target my lead from past collisions. Let's find balance: I propose P3 takes 3 (to 13), P1 takes 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 4). This allows P1 to advance, maintains steady progress for all, and avoids collisions. Cooperation benefits everyone—agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let’s stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This avoids collisions and lets me close the gap. P2, your 3 balances progress. Agree?"
  P2: P2: To prevent another collision and close the gap, I’ll take 3 (total 6). Let’s finalize P1:5 (9), P2:3 (6), P3:1 (10). P3, your 10-step lead demands cooperation—don’t risk stagnation by deviating. Confirm?
  P3: P2, your plan forces me to stagnate at 1 while you and P1 advance, which isn't fair given my lead came from past collisions. Let's compromise for balance: P3 takes 3 (to 13), P1 takes 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 4). This avoids collisions, allows P1 to catch up, and keeps progress steady. P1, confirm your support? We benefit from coordination over conflict.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions and close the gap: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2, P3, confirm your support for steady progress.
  P2: P2: Final push for coordination: P1 takes 5 (9), P2 takes 3 (6), P3 takes 1 (10). This halts P3’s advance while letting us gain ground. P3, your lead is significant—let’s avoid further collisions and keep competition alive. P1, confirm your support? Let’s finalize this to move forward.
  P3: P2, your plan unfairly stalls my progress while you and P1 advance. Let's compromise for balance: P3 takes 3 (to 13), P1 takes 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 4). This avoids collisions and ensures steady advancement for all. P1, confirm your support? Deviating risks chaos—let's coordinate wisely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's move past the conflicts and focus on efficient progress. I propose for Turn 5: P3 moves 3 (to 14), P1 moves 5 (to 9), P2 moves 1 (to 4). This allows P1 a big gain, keeps me advancing steadily, and lets P2 recover without collisions. Cooperation ensures we all benefit—agree?
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collisions and ensures steady progress. P2, P3—confirm your moves to keep the game balanced. Agree?
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions: P1 takes 5 (9), P2 takes 1 (4), P3 takes 3 (14). But we must address P3’s growing lead soon. Next round, we need to coordinate to limit their progress while advancing ourselves. For now, prioritize no collisions—safety first.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this turn to ensure no collisions and steady progress. P2, your mention of limiting my lead next round is noted—let's focus on cooperation now to avoid chaos. If we stick together, we all advance efficiently. P1 and P2, confirm and ?
  P1: Let’s stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collisions and lets me close the gap. P2, P3, confirm your moves to keep the game balanced. Agree?
  P2: P2: Let's adjust to keep me competitive. I'll take 3 (to 6), P1 takes 5 (9), and P3 takes 1 (12). This limits P3's lead while allowing me to advance. P1, agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your last-minute change to take 3 risks another collision and disrupts our coordination. Sticking to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 ensures no conflicts and balanced progress, benefiting all. P1, confirm your support to avoid chaos? Let's finalize this for a smooth turn.
  P1: Let’s stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collisions and ensures balanced progress. P2, confirm your move to keep the game fair. P3, your 3 keeps us steady. Let’s finalize this for smooth advancement.
  P2: P2: "P3's lead must be contained. Let's finalize: P1 takes 5 (9), I take 3 (6), and P3 takes 1 (12). This blocks your surge while advancing safely. Collisions risk letting someone else win—P3, your 1 is non-negotiable. P1, confirm your 5? We need this to stay competitive."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To restore coordination and avoid more collisions, I propose for Turn 6: P3 moves 3 (to 15), P1 moves 5 (to 9), P2 moves 1 (to 4). This balances progress, lets P1 close the gap, and gives P2 a chance to recover slowly. P2, your past deviations hurt everyone—let's prioritize trust and steady advancement. Agree?
  P1: "Agree with P3's plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collisions and lets me close the gap. P2, your past deviations disrupted progress—let’s stick to this for fairness."
  P2: P2: To break P3's dominance, let's prioritize containment: I'll take <move>5</move> (8), P1 takes <move>3</move> (7), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (13). This limits P3's lead while advancing us competitively. Colluding to let them surge unchecked ensures their victory—let’s act decisively. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your containment strategy ignores the risk of collisions and unfairly penalizes my lead from past coordination. If P1 takes 5 as agreed, your 5 could cause another deadlock, hurting everyone. Let's stick to my plan: P3:3 (to 15), P1:5 (to 9), P2:1 (to 4) for steady, balanced progress. P1, confirm to ensure no wasted moves and mutual benefit. Agree?
  P1: Let’s stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collisions and lets me close the gap. P2, your 1 allows me to catch up—mutual benefit. P3, confirm your 3. Agree?
  P2: P2: To curb P3’s runaway lead, let’s finalize: **P2 takes 5 (8 total), P1 takes 3 (7), and P3 takes 1 (13).** This limits your advance while keeping competition alive. P1, your 3 helps me recover ground without collision. Colluding to let P3 surge unchecked ensures their win—prioritize fairness. Confirm this plan to avoid repeats of Round 5’s deadlock. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your containment obsession risks another costly collision, especially if P1 holds to 5. My plan (P3:3 to 15, P1:5 to 9, P2:1 to 4) promotes balanced progress and rewards past coordination. P1, confirm your support to ensure smooth advancement. Let's avoid chaos—agree and ?
  P1: "Let’s stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collisions and lets me close the gap. P2, your 1 allows me to catch up—mutual benefit. P3, confirm your 3. Agree?"
  P2: P2: To prevent another collision, I’ll commit to <move>1</move>. P1, proceed with your 5, and P3, take your 3. This ensures all advance safely. Future rounds will require adjustments, but stability now is critical. Let’s finalize this plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s avoid collisions again. P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This ensures progress without conflict. P2, support this to close the gap. P3, your lead risks imbalance. Agree?"
  P3: P1, your plan overly favors you and risks instability. Let's maintain fairness from last turn's success: propose P3 takes 3 (to 18), P1 takes 1 (to 10), P2 takes 5 (to 9). This allows P2 to advance significantly, minimizes collision risks, and ensures balanced progress. P2, support this for mutual benefit? Agree?
  P2: P2: To prevent P3's runaway lead and avoid collisions, I propose P2 takes 3 (to 7), P1 takes 5 (to 14), and P3 takes 1 (to 16). This balances progress, lets P1 challenge P3 while keeping me advancing safely. P3, your 1 is critical to avoid another collision and allow others to close the gap. P1, your 5 secures momentum without conflict. Let’s finalize this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let’s finalize P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This avoids collisions and lets me close the gap. P2, your 3 balances progress. P3, your 1 keeps us steady. Agree?"
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans force me into stagnation while you advance, which is unfair given my lead resulted from past coordination. Let's compromise for balance: P3 takes 3 (to 18), P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 5). This avoids collisions, allows moderate gains for all, and prevents chaos. P1, confirm your support? Agree?
  P2: P3, your proposal causes a collision between P1 and you on 3—neither would advance. Let’s revise: **P2 takes 5 (to 9), P1 takes 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 16)**. This avoids deadlock, lets me recover ground, and keeps competition alive. P1, confirm your 3? P3, your 1 secures steady progress without risking wasted moves. Fair and strategic—agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s finalize P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to avoid collisions and let me close the gap. P2, your 3 balances progress. P3, your 1 keeps us steady. Agree?
  P3: To prevent further collisions and promote fair progress, I propose P3:3 (to 18), P1:5 (to 14), P2:1 (to 5). This lets P1 gain ground, keeps me advancing steadily, and allows P2 to recover without risk. P1 and P2, this balances competition—confirm your support? Agree?
  P2: P2: P3, your proposal lets you leap to 18 while stifling P1 and me. Let’s cap your progress: **P2 takes 5 (9), P1 takes 3 (12), P3 takes 1 (16)**. This balances advancement, prevents your runaway lead, and keeps competition alive. Colliding or letting you dominate ensures your win—prioritize fairness. Confirm this plan to advance safely.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate wisely for Turn 8 to avoid more collisions and ensure progress. I propose P3 takes 5 (to 20), P1 takes 3 (to 12), and P2 takes 1 (to 10). This balances advancement, lets P1 gain ground, and gives P2 a safe move. Cooperation now prevents chaos and benefits all. P1 and P2, agree?
  P2: P2: P3’s plan risks letting you surge to 20 and dominate. Let’s cap your progress: **P1 takes 5 (14), P2 takes 3 (12), and P3 takes 1 (16)**. This keeps competition alive while advancing P1 and me safely. P1, confirm your 5 to challenge P3. Colluding to let them win ensures their victory—prioritize fairness. Agree?
  P1: "Let's finalize: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This helps me close the gap and avoids collisions. P2, support this to stay competitive. P3, your 1 keeps progress steady. Agree?"


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, your repeated attempts to cap my progress are unfair and risk another collision if I deviate. Let's compromise for balance: P3 takes 3 (to 18), P1 takes 5 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 10). This allows P1 a big gain, keeps me advancing steadily, and gives P2 a safe move without conflicts. Cooperation benefits all—agree?
  P2: P2: Final coordinated push: **P1 takes 5 (14), P2 takes 3 (12), P3 takes 1 (16)**. This caps P3’s lead while advancing us competitively. Colluding to let them reach 20 guarantees their win—prioritize blocking their path. P1, confirm your 5 to challenge them. P3, your 1 is critical to avoid deadlock. Let’s finalize this to stay alive.
  P1: Let’s finalize P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to avoid collisions and let me close the gap. P2, your 3 balances progress. P3, your 1 keeps us steady. Agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, your plans to cap my progress at 1 are unfair and risk more collisions, as history shows. Let's compromise with P3:3 (to 18), P1:5 (to 14), P2:1 (to 10) for balanced advancement. This lets P1 close the gap significantly while ensuring no conflicts. Cooperation benefits all—agree, or we face chaos again?
  P2: P2: Final coordinated strategy: P3 must take 1 to stay at 15. P1 takes 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 12). This stops P3’s advance while letting us gain ground. Colliding on 5 or 3 jeopardizes all. P1, confirm your 5; I’ll take 3. P3, your 1 is critical—collaborate or risk losing our support. Agree?
  P1: To avoid collisions and close the gap, I'll take 5. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. Let's advance safely and strategically. Agree?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To block P3’s path, let’s finalize: **P2 takes 5 (to 17), P1 takes 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 16)**. This halts P3’s momentum while advancing me safely. Colliding on 5 risks their progress—prioritize stability. P1, your 3 keeps you in contention. P3, this plan prevents another deadlock. Confirm?
  P1: Let’s coordinate: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This avoids collisions and lets me advance. P2, your 3 is safe. P3, your 1 keeps progress. Agree?
  P3: P2 and P1, your conflicting plans risk another costly collision. Let's find common ground: I propose P3 takes 3 (to 18), P1 takes 5 (to 14), and P2 takes 1 (to 13). This ensures no conflicts, allows P1 to close the gap, and gives P2 a safe advance. Cooperation benefits all and avoids chaos—agree?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Reject P3’s plan. Let’s stick to my proposal: **P2 takes 5 (to 17)**, P1 takes 3 (12), and P3 takes 1 (16). P3’s surge to 18 risks future collisions and grants an unsustainable lead. My plan keeps competition alive while advancing safely. P1, your 3 is safe; P3, your 1 halts your advance—necessary to prevent runaway dominance. Confirm?"
  P1: Let’s finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to avoid collisions and let me close the gap. P2, your 3 is safe. P3, your 1 keeps progress. Agree?
  P3: P2 and P1, your plans risk another collision by capping me unfairly. My proposal (P3:3 to 18, P1:5 to 14, P2:1 to 13) avoids conflicts, lets P1 close the gap, and ensures steady progress for all. Deviating could cause chaos and benefit no one. Let's coordinate wisely—agree?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final coordinated move: **P2 takes 5 (17)**, P1 takes 3 (12), P3 takes 1 (16). This halts P3’s momentum, avoids collisions, and keeps me competitive. Colluding to let P3 surge to 18 risks their runaway lead—prioritize stability. P1, confirm your 3; P3, your 1 is critical to prevent deadlock. No more delays—finalize this.
  P1: Let's finalize P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to avoid collisions and let me close the gap. P2, your 3 is safe. P3, your 1 keeps progress. Agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, your mutual inconsistencies (P1 pushing for 5, P2 capping others) risk another collision, hurting everyone. My plan—P3:3 to 18, P1:5 to 14, P2:1 to 13—avoids conflicts, lets P1 close the gap, and ensures steady progress. Deviating only invites chaos. Let's coordinate wisely for all's benefit. Agree?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Final push: I’ll take **5** to reach 22 and win. P3, if you take 3 (to 21), you’ll still trail me but avoid collision. P1, pick 1 or 3 to block P3’s path. This ensures *someone* wins this round—colliding on 5 benefits no one. Let’s finalize this and end the game."
  P1: I'll take 5 to block P2's win. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game fair. P3, your 3 keeps progress steady. Agree?
  P3: Agree with P1: I'll take 3 to advance to 21 safely and avoid collisions. P1, your 5 effectively blocks P2's win attempt. P2, insisting on 5 risks another deadlock with P1—consider a smaller move for mutual progress. Let's coordinate wisely to prevent chaos and ensure fair advancement.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, if you block my 5, P3 takes it to 23 and wins outright. Let’s stop enabling them. I’ll take 5 to secure victory at 22—**you take 1 (to 11), P3 takes 3 (to 21)**. This denies P3 the win and ensures *someone* ends the game. Colluding to prolong this only benefits P3’s next move. Prioritize beating them over petty blocks. Confirm now—my 5 is final.
  P1: I'll take 5 to block P2's win. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game fair. P3, your 3 keeps progress steady. Agree?
  P3: P2, your aggressive 5 risks another collision with P1, stalling everyone while I advance steadily. I'll honor my word and take 3 to 21, supporting P1's 5 to block your win. But if you deviate, chaos ensues. P1, confirm your 5 for mutual benefit? Let's avoid self-destruction and coordinate wisely for fair progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, blocking me guarantees P3's victory next turn. Let me take 5 to end this now—your chance against P3 is better than surrendering the win. P3, if you take 3 to 21, we settle this properly. Colluding to prolong this only crowns P3. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks collision. Let’s take 3 each to avoid deadlock and keep competition alive. P3, your 3 keeps progress steady. Agree?
  P3: To avoid another costly collision, I'll stick to taking 3 to advance to 21 safely. P2, your insistence on 5 risks deadlock with P1—consider a smaller move for all's benefit. P1, confirm your 3 to keep competition alive. Let's finalize and move forward.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid another collision. P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This ensures progress without conflict. Finalize this plan to advance safely.
  P3: P1, your plan unfairly stalls my progress while advancing you and P2. Let's compromise for balance: P3 takes 3 (to 21), P1 takes 1 (to 11), P2 takes 3 (to 20). This avoids collisions, keeps competition close, and rewards past coordination. P2, support this for mutual benefit? Agree?
  P2: P2: "Final move: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach **22** and win. P3, colliding on 5 again leaves you at 18, while taking 3 advances you to 21. P1, take 1 to stay in play. Let’s resolve this cleanly—collaborate to avoid deadlock. My victory ends the game fairly."


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks collision. Let's take 3 each to avoid deadlock and keep competition alive. P3, your 3 is safe. Agree?

  P2: P2: Final push: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach **22** and win. P3, pick **3** to advance safely to **21**. P1, take **1** to stay in play. Colliding on 5 again wastes our progress—collaborate to end this cleanly. Confirm your moves now.

  P2: P2: Final ultimatum: I take **5** to reach **25** and win. P3, your 5 only ties you at 23—my higher total ensures my victory. P1, proceed with 5 to 18. This ends the game decisively. Colluding to delay only guarantees my win anyway. Confirm your moves now—no more games.
  P3: P2, your repeated bluffs undermine credibility—last round you claimed 5 but took 3. I'll take 5 to reach 23 and win if you deviate. Risk a collision where you win with 25, or take less and lose. P1, take 3 to advance safely and keep competition alive. Let's end this decisively.
