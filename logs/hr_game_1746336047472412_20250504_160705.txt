Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 this turn. P1 and P2, pick 1 or 3. This way we all advance and maximize progress.
  P2: Okay P3, that's one proposal. P1, what are your thoughts? Are you planning on 1 or 3? Let's try to avoid colliding on the first turn.
  P1: Works for me: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1. Confirm?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed. Let's stick to P1's proposal: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This way we all advance without collision. Trust the plan and commit to it—collaboration now gives us all a path forward.
  P2: Okay, I agree with the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round. Let's all move forward.
  P1: Great—let’s lock in the agreed moves for this round: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. After we see the results we can discuss a fair rotation for next turn so no one feels stuck on the low numbers. Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed. Let’s stick strictly to the plan this turn to build trust. Deviating risks collision and halting progress. Next round, I’ll take 1 to ensure fair rotation. Trust each other now, and we all win eventually.
  P2: Okay, the plan is clear and agreed upon. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: All set on my side—sticking with the agreed 3. Ready for moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Fair rotation time: P3 offered to take 1 this turn, so I’ll take 5 and P2 takes 3. Next round we shift again (P2-5, P1-1, P3-3) so everyone gets the big number in turn. Sound good?
  P3: P3: Agreed to P1’s rotation plan for Round 2: I’ll take 1, P1=5, P2=3. Let’s confirm this round’s moves first, then after seeing results, we can refine future rotations. Trust is key—deviations risk collisions. Let’s prioritize execution now.
  P2: Okay, I agree with the proposed plan for Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This continues the fair rotation. If this works, the plan for Round 3 should be P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. Let's execute this round's plan first.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirming once more for Round 2: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
Round 3 rotation (if all goes smoothly): P2 = 5, P1 = 1, P3 = 3.  
Let’s lock this in so no one collides. I’m ready to move.
  P3: P3: Confirmed—this round’s moves are clear: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s execute strictly to maintain trust. I’ll take 1 as agreed. Any last doubts? Once we confirm, no last-minute changes—deviations risk collision. Proceeding flawlessly now ensures we can adjust rotations safely in future rounds. Final check: All set?
  P2: Confirmed. I am sticking with 3 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All good—sticking with the plan: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Ready to move.
  P3: 
  P2: All set here. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3 this round. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Confirm your moves to avoid last-minute changes. All in?
  P2: Okay, P3, I confirm. As per the rotation plan we discussed last round, I will take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. Let's stick to it. P1, are you also confirming?
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let’s stick to the rotation and keep everyone moving smoothly. Ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I take 3. Deviations risk collision—trust the rotation. Let’s execute flawlessly to progress safely. Proceed as agreed.
  P2: Confirmed. I'm sticking with 5 as planned. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: All set—sticking with the agreed rotation (P2 = 5, P1 = 1, P3 = 3). Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final check: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3? Stick strictly to these moves—collisions erase progress. Our rotation’s integrity depends on flawless execution. No last-second changes. Let’s advance to 9 together and plan next steps post-move.
  P2: All confirmed on my end. Sticking to 5. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: All set—let’s move now exactly as agreed (P2 = 5, P1 = 1, P3 = 3). No last-second changes, please.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with our clean rotation keeps everyone moving safely:  
Round 4 → P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1 (same pattern as Round 1).  
If that goes smoothly, Round 5 → P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1 again.  
Confirm so we avoid any costly collisions?
  P3: P3: Let’s maintain our rotation to stay collision-free: I’ll take 5, P1=3, P2=1 this round. This mirrors Round 1’s pattern—strict adherence ensures progress. Any deviation risks halting us all. Trust the plan: after this round, we cycle back to P1=5 next. Confirm your commitment? No surprises—our coordination is key.
  P2: Okay, the rotation plan continues. I confirm I will take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep the coordination going smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Locked for this round: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1.  
Next round: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
If we hold steady, everyone’s 18 after Round 6—no one lags, no collisions. Ready to move?
  P3: P3: Final commitment: P3 takes 5, P1=3, P2=1 this round. Collisions mean stagnation—our rotation’s integrity is non-negotiable now. Trust the plan, and we progress to 14/12/10. No surprises—let’s execute.
  P2: Confirmed. I am sticking with 1 for this round as agreed. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, following the rotation established over the last few rounds, the plan for this round (Round 5) should be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, as P1 suggested last round. This keeps the cycle going.

If we stick to this, the scores will be P1=17, P2=13, P3=15.
Then for Round 6, the plan would be P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, which would bring everyone to 18 points.

I agree to take 3 this round. Let's confirm, P1 and P3.
  P3: P3: Confirmed. Let’s stick strictly to the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Deviations risk collision and sabotage our progress. After Round 6 (all at 18), we can discuss a final push. Trust the plan—our coordination ensures safe advancement. I’ll take 1 as agreed. Final check: all set?
  P1: Confirmed: this round P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
Next round: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3 so we’re all at 18 and still collision-free. Trust the rotation—no last-second changes. Ready for moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I'm confirmed for 3 this round. Everyone seems aligned on the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's execute this round and then the next one as planned to reach 18 together. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P3: Final verification: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. After Round 6 (all at 18), let’s shift focus to the final push. To secure victory, we must prioritize无人colliding in critical endgame rounds. Trust the plan now—deviations risk letting all of us fall behind. I’ll take 1 as agreed. Proceed with discipline.
  P1: All set—this round I’m taking 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 exactly as agreed. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed one last time. I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P3: Final adherence check: Stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Collisions halt *everyone*—even a small deviation risks derailing our progress. After Round 6 (all at 18), we’ll strategize the final push. Trust the plan now; victory hinges on flawless coordination.
  P1: All good—locking Round 5 exactly as stated: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. After we hit 18/18/18 next round, let’s openly discuss a fair end-game sprint. Zero surprises now—trust keeps everyone moving. Ready for moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the rotation for Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us all at 18 after this turn. From there, in Round 7, we can each take turns with 5 to sprint toward 24. Deviations now risk collisions and derail progress. Trust the plan—our coordination is critical. Final check: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3?
  P1: Confirmed: this round I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. After we’re all on 18, let’s openly map the last few rounds so we finish without collisions—maybe a clear “one 5 each, in order” schedule. For now, sticking to the agreed moves.
  P2: Okay, I confirm as well. I will take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's get everyone to 18 points as planned. Once we are all tied, we can discuss the final rounds. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round to secure our 18/18/18 tie. Deviations now risk collision and derail our final push. Trust the plan—after this, we’ll coordinate a sprint toward 24. Stick strictly to agreed moves. No surprises.
  P1: Confirmed: this round stays P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  
If that lands us at 18/18/18, suggest we keep the rotation:  
• Round 7 → P3 5, P1 3, P2 1 (23/21/19)  
• Round 8 → P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 (26/24/22) — we can reassess then.  
Sticking to simple, collision-free rules is still our safest path. Everyone good?
  P2: Okay, I confirm again for Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's execute this to reach 18/18/18.

P1, your suggested plan for R7 and R8 does follow the rotation pattern we established. However, as you pointed out, that specific continuation leads directly to you winning in Round 8 (26/22/24).

Once we are all tied at 18 after this round, we absolutely need to discuss a *new* plan for the final rounds. Continuing the old rotation isn't fair if it guarantees a win for one player. Let's secure 18/18/18 first, then figure out a fair endgame sprint for Round 7 onwards.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Confirmed—strict adherence to Round 6’s plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No deviations here. After reaching 18/18/18, we *must* negotiate a *new* endgame rotation **equally** beneficial to all. Until then, focus solely on collision-free execution this round. Trust the process—let’s secure the 18 tie first, then fairly strategize Round 7 onward. Final check: All proceed as agreed?
  P1: All in for this turn exactly as agreed: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  

Once we’re all at 18, a fair end-sprint could be: P3 gets the first 5 (since P2’s just taken one), then P1, then P2—each with 3/1 fillers to avoid collisions. We can confirm details after the scores tie, but for now nothing changes. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, everyone has confirmed the plan for Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I am sticking with 5. Let's execute this to get us all to 18 points. Then we can figure out the fairest way to proceed for Round 7 and beyond. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To secure victory, let’s prioritize a new rotation starting with me this round. I’ll take **5** (to reach 23), P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **1**. Next round, P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, I take **1**. This ensures fair turns while positioning me to win at 24 in Round 8 if all cooperate. Deviations risk collision and delay—trust this plan to maximize our chances. Final confirmation?
  P2: P3, your plan just continues the old rotation (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1). We agreed after reaching 18/18/18 that we needed a *new* plan, because continuing the old one leads to P1 winning in R8 (scores 26/22/24). Your own R8 plan confirms this, despite your claim it positions *you* to win.

Let's try a different sequence for fairness. I propose for Round 7: **P2=5, P1=3, P3=1**.
This puts scores at P2=23, P1=21, P3=19.
If we then follow with P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 in Round 8, we all reach exactly 24 (P3=24, P1=24, P2=24). This seems like a potentially fair outcome given our current tie.

What do you think P1, P3?
  P1: I’m good with P2’s fairness proposal:  
• Round 7 → P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1.  
• Round 8 → P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1 (24/24/24).  

That keeps everything collision-free and fully symmetrical. Let’s focus on executing Round 7 exactly as stated—any deviation ruins the tie and the whole plan. Ready to lock it in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Confirmed, let’s execute P2’s plan for Round 7: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. This ensures collision-free progress to 18/18/18. Afterward, in Round 8, we’ll follow the agreed rotation (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) to reach 24 simultaneously. Trust the plan—deviations risk collision. Final check: All proceed as agreed?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, thanks for confirming.

To be crystal clear:
Round 7 plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 (Scores become P2=23, P1=21, P3=19)
Round 8 plan: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 (Scores become P2=24, P1=24, P3=24)

This two-round plan results in a fair 3-way tie at 24. Let's stick to it precisely for both rounds to avoid collisions and ensure this outcome. I am ready for the move phase for Round 7.
  P1: Final confirmation for Round 7: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1. Stick to it so we reach 23/21/19 cleanly, then we execute the agreed Round 8 (P3 5, P1 3, P2 1) for a collision-free 24/24/24 finish. No changes—ready for moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Confirmed, let’s execute P2’s plan flawlessly: **Round 7 → P2=5, P1=3, P3=1**. No deviations—collisions erase progress. After this, Round 8’s agreed rotation (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) ensures a fair 24/24/24 finish. Trust the plan: strict adherence now guarantees our collective advancement. Final check: all proceed as agreed?
  P2: Okay, the plan for Round 7 (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) and Round 8 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) leading to a 24/24/24 tie is fully confirmed on my side. Let's execute Round 7 precisely as agreed. I am ready for the move phase.
  P1: All set—let’s lock in Round 7 exactly as agreed (P2 5, P1 3, P3 1) and move on.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well P1, your move last round broke our agreement and prevented both of us from advancing, directly putting P3 in the lead. Trust is obviously gone now.

P3, you're at 19 and only need 5 to win this round, so it seems very likely you'll choose 5.
P1, after that move, it's hard to predict what you'll do.

Given P1's actions, coordination seems pointless. I'll have to make my move based on anticipating what you both might do individually. Good luck.
  P3: P3: To maximize our collective progress, let’s execute the **agreed Round 8 plan**: I take 5 (to reach 24 and win), P1 takes 3 (21), P2 takes 1 (19). Collisions benefit no one—stick to this to ensure *someone* progresses. Trust the final step of our prior agreement.
  P1: P2, the only sure way to stop P3 from winning right now is to collide with whatever he plays on 5. I’m committing to pick 5 this turn—publicly stated. If you also choose 5, P3 can’t win and we all stay alive to fight next round. Any other split just hands P3 the game. Let’s force the collision now, then renegotiate next round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you broke our agreement last round, making your public commitment to play 5 hard to trust. That said, P3 is obviously aiming for the win with 5, and stopping that benefits both of us. Whether colliding on 5 is the only way, or the best way, is unclear. I'll consider the situation and make my own move to best position myself without handing P3 the victory.
  P3: P3: To uphold our prior agreement and ensure progress, I’ll take **5** (reaching 24 to win). P1 agreed to **3** (21), P2 to **1** (19). Colliding benefits no one—allow someone to advance. Trust this final step to honor our coordinated plan. Any deviation now only delays all. Proceed as agreed.
  P1: Nothing’s changed—still picking 5. P2, we both hit 5 and block P3. Anything else risks handing him the win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your logic to block P3 by playing 5 is sound, given P3 is clearly going for the win with 5. However, after last round, stated intentions mean little. P3, your 'agreed plan' conveniently ignores the fact P1's move broke the *actual* agreement and handed you this advantage.

Trust is gone. Everyone will play for themselves now. I'll choose the move that gives me the best chance, assuming you both act in your own rational self-interest.
  P3: P3: To secure victory, I’ll take **5** (reaching 24). P1 and P2: If either picks **5**, we all lose progress. Choose **1 or 3** to let *someone* advance. Collisions only delay us all—act rationally.
  P1: Re-confirming: I’m 100 % locking 5. One collision on 5 is enough to stop P3—there’s no strategic gain in a triple-5 pile-up.  

P2: pick 1 or 3 and you’ll advance unless P3 dares switch numbers; if he does switch, I jump to 23 and still block him from taking the lead. Either outcome keeps P3 from winning and leaves us both ahead of him for the next round.  

Bottom line: I take 5. Avoid 5 yourself and we guarantee P3 doesn’t win while maximizing our own progress.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Both of you know I’m locking 3 this round—public, irrevocable.

P3: your ONLY winning shot is 5. If you pick 3 or 1 you can’t win and might even hand P2 the game, so you’ll still choose 5.

P2: try 3 and you collide with me (zero progress) while P3 sails to 24 on 5. Try 1 and P3 still wins.  
Your only survival move is 5, colliding with P3 and keeping your lead at 21.

So the rational, self-protecting profile is:
P1 = 3
P2 = 5
P3 = 5

Let’s see who really plays rationally.
  P3: P3: I commit to taking **5** to reach 24. P2: if you choose 3, we tie at 24. If you pick 5, we both stall. P1’s 3 won’t stop us—your move dictates the outcome. Prioritize a tie over letting me win alone.
  P2: P1, your analysis seems correct that P3 will play 5 for the win. P3, your scenario where I play 3 leading to a tie is misleading; if P1 sticks to 3 and you play 5, me playing 3 means you win alone due to our collision.

The main priority is stopping P3 from winning with 5 this turn. Colliding with P3 on 5 seems like the most direct way to achieve that, assuming P3 indeed plays 5. Whether P1 actually plays 3 after last round's betrayal is another question. I'll make my move considering these factors.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, remember: if you pick 5 and P3 also picks 5, they both stall and I alone reach 21—nobody wins, you stay tied for the lead.  

If P3 were crazy enough to switch to 3, your 5 goes through uncontested and you win outright at 26. So 5 is strictly safe and potentially decisive for you.  

Any choice other than 5 risks gifting P3 the victory. I remain on 3. Your rational move is 5.
  P3: P3: I commit to **5** to reach 24. P2: picking **3** ensures a tie at 24—better than letting me win alone. P1’s 3 gains you nothing. Act rationally: stop unilateral victories.
  P2: P3, your claim that me playing 3 leads to a tie is incorrect if P1 actually plays 3 as they claim. In that case, P1 and I would collide on 3, and your 5 would win you the game outright. That sounds like a trap you're trying to set.

P1, your logic about needing to stop P3's likely 5 is sound. The safest way to prevent P3 winning seems to be colliding on 5. However, trusting declared moves is difficult after last round's events.

I have to assume P3 will play 5 for the win. Preventing that is the priority. I'll choose my move accordingly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I remain on 3. If you choose 1 or 3, P3 wins unopposed. Colliding with his 5 keeps him at 19 and you tied for the lead at 21—plus you auto-win next turn if he hesitates. The only rational block is you on 5. Your move.
  P3: P3: I commit to **5** to secure victory at 24. Colliding on 5 only benefits P1, who’ll leap to 21 if we stall. P2: picking **5** sacrifices your lead, while **3** lets me win outright. Let someone advance—collisions only prolong this. My move is final.
  P2: P1, P3, your arguments are noted. P3, your insistence on me playing 3 seems designed to cause a collision with P1 (if P1 is truthful) allowing your 5 to win. P1, your logic to block P3 with 5 is sound, but your past actions make your stated move (3) unreliable. Preventing P3's win is the priority. I will choose the move that best achieves this, considering the high likelihood P3 plays 5 and the uncertainty around P1's actual move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To break this stalemate, I commit to **5** this round. If either of you pick **1 or 3**, I reach 24 and win. If both choose **5**, we all stall—benefiting no one. P2: picking **3** lets me win cleanly. P1: your prior strategy of blocking only prolongs the game. Let someone advance. Act rationally—collisions serve no purpose now.
  P2: P1, P3 is obviously playing 5 to win. If you choose 3, you might win, but it's risky. If I also choose 3, we collide and P3 wins alone. If I choose 1, you end up tying with P3.

The only way to guarantee P3 doesn't win this round is if we both block P3 by playing 5. This way, P3 stays at 19, and we both remain tied at 21. It's the safest move to prevent P3 from winning and gives us another chance next round. Let's both choose 5.
  P1: Agreed, P2—triple-5 is the sure block. I’m locking 5 to prevent any solo win.  
P3, with two of us on 5, staying on 5 stalls you at 19; switching risks gifting someone else the game.  
So the rational play is all of us on 5, nobody advances, then we regroup next round. Locked in: 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, your coordinated 5’s only guarantee stalemate. I stick to my 5. If you both choose 5, we’re back here next round. Break the deadlock—someone must deviate. Let me advance to 24 or risk indefinite gridlock. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, I agree with your assessment. P3 is clearly playing 5 for the win. The only way to guarantee stopping P3 is for us to collide with them on 5. If we both play 5, P3 is blocked, and we remain tied for the lead. Any other move from us risks handing P3 the game. Let's stick to the plan to block 5.
  P1: Still locked on 5. P2, double-blocking on 5 is the only sure way to stop a P3 win; anything else risks the game. I’m done talking—let’s move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: To break this deadlock, I commit to **3** this round, advancing to 22. Letting someone progress is better than perpetual gridlock. If you both block again, I’ll push for 24 next round. Act rationally—collisions only prolong our stagnation.
  P2: P3, your sudden switch to 3 after we agreed to block 5 looks like a transparent attempt to break our coordination and avoid the block. It doesn't change the fact that 5 is your only winning move.

P1, the safest play is still for us both to choose 5. If P3 plays 5, we block them. If P3 actually plays 3, we collide but P3 only gets to 22 and doesn't win. Let's stick to the plan and both play 5 to guarantee P3 doesn't win this round.
  P1: Still locked on 5—no deviations. P2, keep the double-block; anything else gifts P3 the win. Ready to move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
