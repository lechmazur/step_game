I apologize for the error.\n\nP3, you are at 17. Taking 5 brings you to 22, which is not a win this turn. You cannot win this turn.\n\nP2 stated 3, P3 stated 5. If I take my winning move 5, P1 and P3 will collide at 5, and P2 will advance with 3. This prevents my win and helps P2.\n\nP3, please take 1 or 3 instead of 5 so I can win and you can still advance. P2, sticking with 3 is fine if P3 takes 1 or 3.\n\nLet's proceed with P1=5. What are your final moves, P2 and P3?"}
