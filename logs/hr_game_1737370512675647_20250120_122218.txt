Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. Does that work for both of you?
  P1: P3's suggestion seems fair, but I propose we rotate the numbers each turn to ensure fairness and avoid predictability. For example, next turn, P1 could take <move>3</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, and P3 <move>1</move>. This way, no one is consistently disadvantaged. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m fine with starting as suggested: P1 with 1, me with 3, and P3 with 5. Next round, we can rotate as P1 proposed. That should keep things balanced.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last turn was unfortunate, but let’s try the rotation: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1, as suggested before. That should keep us from colliding. Are we all good with that idea?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion for the rotation. However, since we both picked <move>5</move> last round and collided, maybe we should adjust. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move> again? This way, we can avoid another collision. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P3, your adjustment makes sense to avoid another collision. I agree to pick <move>3</move> this turn, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure we all advance. If everyone confirms, we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m willing to go with that plan for this round: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5. Let’s all move forward and avoid collisions.
  P3: Let's confirm our plan one last time before we move: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's proceed to the move phase. Remember, our goal is to avoid collisions and make progress. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I agree with the current plan: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to it to avoid collisions and ensure progress. If everyone confirms, we can proceed to the move phase.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m frustrated by the repeated collisions. Let’s try a fresh plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. That way, nobody overlaps. Let’s trust each other and make real progress this round. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration. Let's make sure we avoid collisions this time. I agree with your fresh plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, you pick <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This should ensure we all move forward. Let’s confirm and stick to this plan to make progress. P1, are you on board with this?
  P1: I agree with P2's fresh plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and make progress. Trust is key here—let’s all commit to this plan and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m eager to finally make real progress. Let’s confirm one last time: P1 picks <move>1</move>, I pick <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. If we all honor this agreement, nobody collides, and we can actually advance. Are we all set?
  P3: Alright, let’s finalize the plan for this round: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. We need to trust each other to avoid collisions and make progress. Let’s confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I agree with the plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. Let’s stick to it to avoid collisions and make progress. Trust is crucial—let’s all commit to this plan and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’ve all agreed on the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. Let’s not overcomplicate things. We need to trust each other and advance. I’m sticking to my word. If we all follow through, we’ll finally break these collisions. Let’s make it happen.
  P3: Alright, let's lock in the plan and move forward. To summarize: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. Trust is essential here. Let's all stick to the plan and avoid any more collisions. Good luck to everyone! Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I agree with the plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. Let’s stick to it to avoid collisions and make progress. Trust is crucial—let’s all commit to this plan and move forward.

  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We finally broke the collision cycle last round. Let’s build on that success. I propose we keep our moves the same for Round 4: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That worked smoothly before, so let’s trust each other and avoid more collisions. Are we all in?
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal to keep the same moves: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Consistency will help us avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let’s stick to this plan and trust each other to follow through. If everyone confirms, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I appreciate the consistency plan, but I'm lagging behind. To catch up, I suggest a slight adjustment: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we still avoid collisions, and I get a chance to close the gap. Trust and fairness are important, so let's consider this adjustment to keep the game balanced. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your desire to catch up, P3, but consistency worked well last round. Let’s avoid introducing risk again. I propose we keep the same moves: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3. That way, nobody collides, and we all keep moving forward. Are we good with that?
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but consistency has worked well so far. Let’s stick to the proven plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. We can reassess next round if needed. Trust is key—let’s not risk unnecessary conflicts now.
  P3: Alright, I see the value in maintaining consistency to avoid collisions. Let's stick with the original plan for this round: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. However, I propose that for the next round, we consider a rotation or adjustment to ensure fairness and give everyone a chance to catch up. For now, let's confirm and move forward with the current plan. Trust and coordination are essential. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I hear your concern, P3, but consistency helped us last round. Let’s stick to the proven plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3. That gives us all safe progress now. Next round, we can explore a fair rotation or adjustment to help you catch up. For this turn, I’m trusting everyone to avoid collisions and move forward.
  P1: I agree with sticking to the current plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Consistency has worked well, and avoiding collisions is our priority. Next round, we can discuss a rotation to ensure fairness and help P3 catch up. Let’s trust each other and proceed.
  P3: Alright, let's finalize and move forward with the agreed plan: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. Trust and coordination are crucial. Let's all stick to the plan to ensure we avoid collisions and make progress. Good luck to everyone! Let’s proceed to the move phase.

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve built some trust with consistent moves. Let’s stick to the same plan again: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That way, we avoid collisions and keep gaining steps. P3, I understand you want a chance to catch up, and we can discuss letting you take 5 on a future turn, but for now, let’s not jinx our progress. If everyone agrees, we can lock in our moves and move forward safely.
  P1: I agree with sticking to the current plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Consistency has worked well, and avoiding collisions is our priority. Next round, we can discuss a rotation to ensure fairness and help P3 catch up. Let’s trust each other and proceed.
  P3: I appreciate the consistency, but I'm still lagging behind. To keep the game fair and give me a chance to catch up, let's consider a slight adjustment for this round: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and I can start closing the gap. Trust and fairness are important. Let's consider this adjustment to keep the game balanced. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand you want to close the gap, but changing moves right now risks another collision. We finally have a stable pattern, so let’s keep P1 at 1, me at 5, and you at 3 for this round. Next round, we can explore letting you pick 5 without colliding. Let’s not jeopardize our progress now. What do you both say?
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but changing the plan now risks collisions and disrupts our progress. Let’s stick to the proven plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Next round, we can discuss a rotation to help you catch up. Trust and consistency are key to avoiding conflicts. Let’s not risk unnecessary setbacks.
  P3: Alright, I see the importance of maintaining our consistent plan to avoid collisions. Let's stick with the original plan for this round: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. However, I strongly suggest that for the next round, we must consider a rotation or adjustment to ensure fairness and give everyone a chance to catch up. For now, let's confirm and move forward with the current plan. Trust and coordination are essential. Good luck everyone! Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your patience is running thin, P3, but let’s push through this round with our proven plan. P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3. Then, next round, we can discuss a fair rotation to help you close the gap. Let’s keep collisions at bay this turn, stay on course, and finalize our moves now.
  P1: I agree with sticking to the current plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Consistency has worked well, and avoiding collisions is our priority. Next round, we can discuss a rotation to ensure fairness and help P3 catch up. Let’s trust each other and proceed.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time before we move: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. Trust and coordination are crucial. Let's all stick to the plan to ensure we avoid collisions and make progress. Good luck to everyone! Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but changing the plan now risks collisions and disrupts our progress. Let’s stick to the proven plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Next round, we can discuss a rotation to help you catch up. Trust and consistency are key to avoiding conflicts. Let’s not risk unnecessary setbacks.
  P3: Alright, let's address the situation directly. P2 is significantly ahead, and if we continue with the same pattern, P2 will win soon. To keep the game interesting and fair, I propose we adjust our strategy this round. How about P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>? This way, P2 slows down a bit, giving P1 and me a chance to catch up. It's crucial to maintain balance and avoid early domination. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand your concern, P3, but I’m not eager to hobble my own progress. We’ve built trust avoiding collisions with our recent pattern, so why risk it now? I’m open to discussing a rotation, but only if it guarantees no collisions and doesn’t single me out to stall. Let’s keep moving safely this round and talk again next time about a fair adjustment.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about P2's lead, but changing the plan now risks collisions and disrupts our progress. Let’s stick to the proven plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Next round, we can discuss a rotation to help you catch up. Trust and consistency are key to avoiding conflicts. Let’s not risk unnecessary setbacks.
  P3: I see the reluctance to change the plan, but let's face it, P2 is almost halfway to winning. To keep the game competitive, we need to mix things up. How about a compromise? P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, P2 doesn't fall behind but also doesn't pull too far ahead. It's a fair middle ground. Let's consider this to keep the game balanced and interesting. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand your concerns, but singling me out isn’t fair either. If we stick with the same moves as before, we avoid collisions and keep the trust we’ve built. Next round, we can discuss letting you pick 5 without derailing anyone else’s progress. For now, let’s not risk another collision by changing everything mid-game. Let’s keep P1 at 1, me at 5, and P3 at 3, then promise a fair rotation next time.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about P2's lead, but changing the plan now risks collisions and disrupts our progress. Let’s stick to the proven plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. Next round, we can discuss a rotation to help you catch up. Trust and consistency are key to avoiding conflicts. Let’s not risk unnecessary setbacks.
  P3: Alright, I see that we're at an impasse. Let's make a deal: if we stick to the original plan this round (P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>), we must agree to rotate next round to give me a chance to pick <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain trust and progress this round while ensuring fairness next round. Let's confirm and move forward with this compromise. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I’m willing to accept your compromise, P3. Let’s all stick with our usual moves this round—P1 takes 1, I take 5, you take 3—and next round, we’ll make sure you get a chance to pick 5. That way, we maintain trust now and keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid collisions. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's honor our agreement from last round. I'll pick <move>5</move> this time to catch up. P1, you can pick <move>3</move>, and P2, you can pick <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I’m willing to honor our deal: I’ll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. That avoids collisions and lets you catch up, P3. But remember, I’m also close to finishing, so next round I intend to push for a big move. As long as we trust each other and avoid collisions, we can keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize the plan for this turn: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. Then we’ll see where we stand for the next round. Let’s proceed.
  P1: I agree with the plan: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to it to avoid collisions and ensure progress. Trust is key—let’s all commit to this plan and move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Thanks for sticking to the plan, everyone. Let's confirm one last time: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This will help me catch up and keep the game interesting. Remember, the goal is to avoid collisions and make progress. Good luck to all! Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I’m on board with the plan we agreed on: I’ll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This should keep collisions away and allow P3 to gain ground. Let’s finalize now and see what happens. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2 is very close to winning. To keep the game competitive, I propose next round we adjust: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This slows P2's progress while allowing P3 and me to catch up. Trust is key, but fairness is equally important. Let’s discuss this now to avoid last-minute changes.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I appreciate P1's concern about P2's lead, but let's focus on the current round first. We have a plan: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions and ensure I catch up. Next round, we can discuss adjustments to keep the game balanced. For now, let's confirm and move forward with our agreed plan. Good luck everyone! Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I’m keeping our agreed plan: I’ll pick <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move> this round. Let’s finalize this and stay collision-free. Next round, we’ll see where we all stand and can discuss any adjustments. For now, I trust we’ll each follow through. Good luck!
  P1: P2 is very close to winning. To keep the game competitive, I propose next round we adjust: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This slows P2's progress while allowing P3 and me to catch up. Trust is key, but fairness is equally important. Let’s discuss this now to avoid last-minute changes.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is just 1 step away from winning. To keep the game competitive, I propose P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move> this round. This slows P2's progress while allowing P3 and me to catch up. Trust is key, but fairness is equally important. Let’s avoid last-minute changes and stick to this plan. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m on board with that plan. Let’s keep it simple and avoid any collisions: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. That way, everyone progresses without tripping each other up. If we trust each other and stick to these moves, we’ll have a fair, collision-free round. Any last concerns? Otherwise, let’s finalize and proceed.
  P3: P2 is very close to winning, and I appreciate P1's proposal to slow P2's progress. However, to ensure fairness and avoid collisions, let's slightly adjust the plan: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, P2 doesn't win immediately, and both P1 and I have a chance to catch up. Trust and coordination are crucial. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your adjustment makes sense to prevent P2 from winning immediately. I agree to P1 picking <move>3</move>, P2 picking <move>1</move>, and P3 picking <move>5</move>. This ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and give everyone a chance to progress. Trust is key—let’s all commit to this and move forward.
  P2: I’m willing to stick with P3’s suggestion: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5. That ensures zero collisions and keeps things fair. Let’s finalize this plan and move forward. After this round, we can revisit how we handle our moves. But for now, I’m set on choosing 1 if you both follow through on 3 and 5 respectively. Let’s trust each other.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's lock in the plan for this round: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This ensures P2 doesn't win immediately and gives both P1 and me a chance to catch up. Trust and coordination are crucial. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Good luck to everyone! Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is just 1 step away from winning, and P3 is close behind. To keep the game competitive, I propose P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. This slows P2's progress while allowing P3 and me to catch up. Trust is key, but fairness is equally important. Let’s avoid last-minute changes and stick to this plan. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1’s suggestion: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. It keeps us collision-free and balances everyone’s progress. Let’s lock it in and trust each other to follow through.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize the plan for this round: P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This ensures P2 doesn't win immediately and gives both P1 and me a chance to catch up. Trust and coordination are crucial. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Good luck to everyone! Let’s proceed to the move phase.
