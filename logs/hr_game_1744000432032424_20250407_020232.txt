Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. We can rotate turns leading with low moves while others go higher. This way, we all advance efficiently without wasting steps. If we work together early, we can focus on racing later. What do you say, P1 and P2? Let’s make a plan and stick to it.
  P1: I'm open to coordination. However, I won't commit to a specific move yet. Let's discuss the proposal. P3 suggests rotating turns with the lowest move. To make it work, we need a clear order. I propose we establish an order now: P1, P2, P3. We can rotate, with one player taking <move>1</move>, and the others taking higher numbers. P2, do you agree to this order, and will you take <move>3</move> this round if I take <move>1</move>?
  P2: I support P3 taking <move>1</move> this round as they offered. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and maximizes our collective progress. We can rotate who leads with 1 in future rounds. P1, this gives you more steps now than your original proposal. P3, does this align with your coordination plan? Let’s lock this for Round 1 and refine the rotation next turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m glad we’re coordinating. P1, your proposal for an order (P1, P2, P3) works, but let’s confirm it explicitly: this round, I’ll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Next round, P2 leads with <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. We rotate like this to ensure no collisions. If everyone agrees, let’s lock this plan in. P1 and P2, does this work for you?
  P1: Let's confirm the plan for Round 1. P3 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and we can refine our rotation strategy next round. P2, please confirm if you're okay with taking <move>5</move> this round. If we're all set, we can stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P3's rotation plan for future rounds works—next round I’ll lead with <move>1</move>, then P3 and P1 follow. Let’s solidify trust by sticking to the agreed moves. If we all honor this, we avoid collisions and maximize progress. Ready to proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems there was a misstep last round since both P1 and I picked <move>1</move>. Let’s clarify: for this round, I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 leads with <move>1</move>. This aligns with our rotation plan. Trust is key—if we stick to the agreed order, we avoid collisions and progress efficiently. P1 and P2, confirm you’re on board so we can proceed smoothly.
  P2: P1, your deviation last round cost us all progress. Let’s rebuild trust: this round, stick to P3’s plan—I take 1, P3 takes 3, you take 5. If you honor this, we avoid collisions and *all* gain steps. If you break ranks again, coordination collapses, and we all lose. P3, confirm you’ll hold to 3. P1, your move?
  P1: To rebuild trust, I'll follow P3's plan for Round 2. P2 will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm: P2, are you committed to taking <move>1</move> this round? P3, will you stick to <move>3</move>? If we all honor this, we can move forward efficiently. I'm willing to proceed with the agreed moves if both of you confirm. Let's lock this in and avoid another collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I’m confirming I’ll stick to <move>3</move> as planned. P1, since you’ve agreed to take <move>5</move>, let’s ensure no further deviations. Trust is fragile—if we all honor the rotation, we progress efficiently. Let’s lock this in and move forward. P2, your commitment to <move>1</move> ensures fairness. If everyone confirms, we can end the conversation and proceed.
  P2: *[Note: P2 ends the conversation here to proceed to moves, trusting the prior confirmations but wary of P1's reliability. The concise stop signals readiness while implicitly holding P1 accountable.]*
  P1: To ensure we proceed, I'll reiterate: P2 is to take <move>1</move>, P3 is to take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. P2 has 5 steps already, so they're ahead. I suggest we maintain this rotation to avoid collisions. If P2 deviates, it risks not just their own progress but also triggers a competitive phase. Let's stick to the plan. P2, please confirm you're still committed to <move>1</move>. If so, we can .


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s maintain the rotation plan: this round, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Sticking to the agreed order ensures no collisions and steady progress for everyone. P1, you’re currently behind—taking <move>1</move> keeps us aligned. P2, confirm you’re committed to <move>3</move>. If we all honor this, we can focus on racing later without disruptions. Trust is critical here. Let’s lock it in and move forward efficiently.
  P1: To maintain the rotation plan for Round 3, I'll reiterate: P2 should take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm you're committed to <move>3</move>. P3, are you still on board with taking <move>5</move>? Let's finalize our moves to avoid any last-minute collisions. If we're aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. I'll take <move>1</move> as per the rotation. Let's lock this in.
  P2: Confirmed. I’ll take <move>3</move> as planned. P1, stick to <move>1</move>; P3, hold <move>5</move>. Trust is key—if we all honor this, we avoid collisions and maintain progress. Let’s solidify the rotation for future rounds. Any deviation now risks mutual stagnation. Proceeding to moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this: I’m taking <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move> (P1), and P2 takes <move>3</move>. No room for error—trust is fragile. If we stick to the plan, we progress efficiently. P1, remember you’re behind; deviating only delays your advancement. P2, confirm your commitment to <move>3</move> so we can lock this in. Let’s avoid collisions and focus on racing forward.
  P1: To avoid repetition and ensure clarity, I'll directly confirm our moves for Round 3 and look ahead. P2 has confirmed taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. P3, please reaffirm you're taking <move>5</move> to finalize our moves. Let's proceed to the move phase if we're aligned. If you're ready, we can stop discussing and move forward.
  P2: Confirmed again: P3 takes 5, me 3, P1 1. No deviations. Let’s execute.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep the rotation intact: this round, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Sticking to the plan ensures no collisions and steady progress. P1, you’re still behind—taking <move>3</move> keeps us aligned. P2, confirm you’re committed to <move>5</move>. Trust is critical here. If we all honor this, we can focus on racing later without disruptions. Let’s lock it in and move forward efficiently.
  P2: Confirmed. I'll take <move>5</move> as per rotation. P1, stick to 3; P3, hold 1. Trust ensures progress. Let's avoid another Round 1 mishap. Proceeding.
  P1: To ensure we maintain the rotation and avoid collisions, I'll reiterate the plan for Round 4: P3 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. P2, you've confirmed <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> to finalize our moves. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase. Let's keep the trust and stick to the plan. I'm ready to move forward if both of you confirm.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this: I’m taking <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move> (P1), and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Trust is fragile—any deviation disrupts progress for everyone. P1, remember you’re behind; sticking to the plan ensures steady advancement. P2, your confirmation of <move>5</move> keeps us aligned. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and focus on racing forward efficiently. If we all commit, we can stop discussing and proceed to moves. Confirm, and let’s lock it in.
  P2: Confirmed again: I take 5. P1 must hold to 3, P3 to 1. Any deviation now sabotages everyone. Trust the rotation—prosper together.
  P1: To maintain trust and progress efficiently, I'll summarize the plan for Round 4: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. P2 has confirmed <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> to finalize our moves. If we're aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward if both of you confirm. Let's keep the trust intact.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s lock this in: I’m taking <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move> (P1), and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Deviating now only delays progress for everyone. P1, you’re behind—stick to the plan to catch up efficiently. P2, your commitment to <move>5</move> ensures fairness. Trust is fragile but critical. If we all confirm, we can stop discussing and proceed to moves. Let’s avoid risks and focus on racing forward. Confirm, and let’s execute.
  P2: Confirmed. Locked in: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. Any deviation now risks mutual stagnation. Trust the rotation—prosper together. Proceeding.
  P1: To maintain the rotation and avoid collisions, I'll reiterate the plan for Round 4: P3 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. P2 has confirmed <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> to finalize our moves. If we're aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward if you both confirm. To end, let's lock this in and stop discussing.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's analyze the current state and plan ahead. P2 is ahead with 14 steps, while I'm at 6 and P3 is at 8. To avoid collisions and maximize progress, we should continue the rotation. For Round 5, P2 should take <move>1</move>, P3 should take <move>3</move>, and I should take <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. P3, are you committed to <move>3</move>? Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the next phase.
  P2: Confirmed. I'll take <move>1</move> as per rotation. P1, honor your commitment to <move>5</move> this round. Any deviation now would sabotage collective progress. Trust is fragile—let’s solidify it. P3, hold to <move>3</move>. Proceeding to moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s lock in the rotation for Round 5: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us aligned and avoids collisions. P2, you’re ahead, so taking <move>1</move> ensures fairness. P1, stick to <move>5</move> to catch up efficiently. Trust is critical—if we all honor this, we progress steadily. Let’s avoid risks and focus on racing forward. Confirm your moves, and let’s execute without further discussion.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To finalize Round 5, I'll confirm: P2 is taking <move>1</move>, P3 is taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. P3, you've confirmed your move. P2, you've also confirmed. I'll stick to <move>5</move> as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward if we're aligned.
  P2: 
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize this: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Trust is fragile—any deviation disrupts progress for everyone. P1, you’re behind; sticking to the plan ensures steady advancement. P2, your confirmation of <move>1</move> keeps us aligned. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and focus on racing forward efficiently. If we all commit, we can stop discussing and proceed to moves. Confirm, and let’s execute.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick to the rotation plan for Round 6: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. P2 is close to winning with 19 steps, so fairness demands we honor this order. P1, you’re behind—taking <move>3</move> keeps you competitive. P2, confirm you’ll take <move>1</move> as planned. Trust is fragile; any deviation disrupts progress for everyone. Let’s lock this in and proceed efficiently. Confirm your moves, and let’s avoid risks.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I need to disrupt P2's lead without causing a collision. P2 is at 19 steps, so taking <move>5</move> could win the game if they take <move>1</move> as planned. I'll propose an alternative: let's have P3 take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. This gives P2 a chance to win but also risks a collision if they don't comply. P3, are you open to adjusting the rotation to gain an advantage?
  P2: P1, your sudden deviation proposal reeks of sabotage. Stick to P3's rotation: you take 3, P3 takes 5, I take 1. Any other move risks collision and mutual stagnation. I'm locked on <move>1</move> per the plan. P3, hold your 5. Trust the rotation—deviators lose.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your attempt to disrupt the rotation is risky and undermines trust. Sticking to the plan—P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>—ensures fairness and progress. P2 is close to winning, but deviating now only delays everyone. Trust is fragile; breaking it benefits no one. P2, confirm your commitment to <move>1</move>. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks, lock in our moves, and proceed efficiently. If we all honor the rotation, we race forward fairly. Confirm, and let’s execute.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll directly respond to P3's plan. P2 is at 19 steps, very close to winning. I'll take <move>5</move> instead of <move>3</move> to potentially win or force a collision that could benefit me if P2 takes <move>1</move>. P3, if you stick to <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll win. P2, taking <move>1</move> now risks a collision with me if I take <move>5</move>. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P1’s desperation is showing. P3, hold to <move>5</move>—if P1 collides with you, they gain nothing. I’m locked on <move>1</move> per rotation. Deviating now only sabotages your own progress. Proceeding as planned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your attempt to disrupt the rotation is transparent and self-destructive. Sticking to the plan—P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>—is the only way to ensure progress for everyone. Deviating now risks collisions that benefit no one. P2, confirm your commitment to <move>1</move>. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks, lock in our moves, and proceed efficiently. Trust the rotation, or we all lose. Confirm, and let’s execute.
  P1: P2 is at 19 steps, just 4 steps away from winning. To disrupt their lead, I'll take a risk. I'm switching from the planned <move>3</move> to <move>5</move>. If P2 sticks to <move>1</move> as planned, I'll either win or force a collision. P3, if you stick to <move>5</move>, we'll collide, and P2 will win. I'm calling P2's bluff. P2, will you still take <move>1</move> and risk a collision with me, or change your move?
  P2: P3, hold to <move>5</move>—if P1 collides with you, they gain nothing. I’m locked on <move>1</move>. Trust the rotation. P1’s desperation sabotages their own progress. Stay disciplined. Proceeding as planned.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s lock in the rotation for Round 7: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. P2 is at 22 steps—just one move from winning. Any deviation now risks collisions that benefit no one. P1, stick to <move>1</move> to avoid chaos. P2, confirm you’ll take <move>5</move> as planned. Trust the rotation; breaking it only delays progress for everyone. Let’s proceed efficiently, avoid risks, and focus on racing forward fairly. Confirm your moves, and let’s execute without further discussion.
  P1: P2 is at 22 steps, just one step away from winning. To potentially win or force a beneficial collision, I'll take a risk. I'll propose deviating from the rotation: I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This could either make me win if P2 takes <move>3</move> or force a collision that might benefit me. P2, if you stick to <move>5</move>, you'll likely win, but if you take <move>3</move>, we collide, and I have a chance.
  P2: **P2:** Locked in: I take <move>5</move> per rotation. P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Final chance to honor the plan. Any deviation sabotages all progress. Trust ensures victory. Confirm and proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your repeated attempts to disrupt the rotation are self-defeating. P2 is at 22 steps—taking <move>5</move> as planned ensures they win fairly. I’ll stick to <move>3</move>. If you deviate again, you risk collisions that benefit no one. Trust the rotation: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. Breaking trust now only delays progress for everyone. Let’s execute the plan, avoid unnecessary risks, and race forward efficiently. Confirm, and let’s end this round cleanly.
  P1: To maximize my chances, I'll directly state my move for Round 7: I'll take <move>5</move>. P2 is at 22 steps and taking <move>5</move> as per the rotation. If P2 sticks to <move>5</move>, they'll win. However, if P3 or P2 deviates to <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, I have a chance to win or force a beneficial collision. P2, taking <move>3</move> instead could lead to a collision, giving me a potential opportunity. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: **P2:** Locked on <move>5</move>. P3 holds 3. P1, take 1 or lose. Trust the rotation. Any deviation now ensures mutual loss. Proceeding.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your repeated disruptions threaten everyone’s progress. P2 is at 22 steps—taking <move>5</move> ensures they win fairly. I’ll stick to <move>3</move>. If you deviate again, you risk collisions that benefit no one. Trust the rotation: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. Breaking trust now only delays progress for everyone. Let’s execute the plan, avoid unnecessary risks, and race forward efficiently. Confirm, and let’s end this round cleanly.
  P1: P2 is at 22 steps, and taking <move>5</move> will win the game. To still have a chance, I need to disrupt their win. I'll take <move>1</move> to potentially collide with P3, who is taking <move>3</move>. If P2 sticks to <move>5</move>, they win, but if either of us deviates, there's a chance for me. P3, consider taking <move>1</move> to collide with me and potentially stop P2 from winning outright. Let's act to change the outcome.
  P2: **P2:** Locked on <move>5</move>. P3 holds 3. P1, take 1 or lose. Trust the rotation. Any deviation now ensures mutual loss. Proceeding.
