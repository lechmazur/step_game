Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later.
  P1: I agree with P2's plan. Let's take 1, 3, 5 respectively to avoid collisions and advance. Cooperation ensures everyone moves forward. Let’s stick to this.
  P3: I'm fine with the plan for this round—I'll take 3. Let's all stick to it so we avoid early collisions and build trust.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we’re all aligned on the plan for this round. Let’s execute it cleanly and ensure no collisions. Moving forward without setbacks will give us more room to strategize later. Trust is key—if we cooperate early, we can focus on outplaying each other in subsequent turns. Let’s keep this coordination going for now.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1, and I trust you both to take 3 and 5. Let's move forward without collisions.
  P3: Glad we’re all on board for Round 1. Let’s make this clean and avoid any early betrayals—it’s too soon for chaos. If everyone sticks to their assigned number, we all move forward and build trust. Looking forward to seeing smooth cooperation.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: The plan is clear, and trust is established. Let’s execute this round flawlessly—no room for missteps. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Smooth advancement benefits us all for now. Let’s focus on positioning ourselves strategically in the coming turns. Remember, early collisions only slow us down. Stick to the agreement this round, and we’ll have plenty of opportunities to outmaneuver each other later. Let’s move forward cleanly.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1, and I trust you both to take 3 and 5. Smooth cooperation now ensures we all advance and build momentum for later strategies. No need to complicate things—focus on execution.
  P3: We’re clearly aligned for Round 1, so let’s follow through without surprises. If anyone breaks the agreement now, it’ll signal they can’t be trusted later—and that’ll make future coordination impossible. Let’s prove we can cooperate when it benefits all of us. I’m sticking to 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: The plan is set, and trust is critical. Let’s execute this cleanly—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Early collisions only slow us down, and cooperation now sets the stage for smarter plays later. Breaking this agreement would ruin future coordination, so let’s prove we can work together when it matters. Stick to your numbers, and we’ll all advance without setbacks. Remember, the real game begins after we’ve built some momentum. Let’s move forward as planned.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan, but keep an eye on future moves. The first to 23 wins—cooperation now, strategy later.
  P3: We’ve all committed to the plan—let’s follow through and prove we can trust each other. If anyone breaks it now, they’ll be marked as untrustworthy for the rest of the game, and future coordination will be much harder. I’m locked in on 3. Let’s move cleanly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was disappointing. I stuck to the agreed plan and got blocked by P2. P2, you broke trust immediately—why should anyone coordinate with you now? P1, you followed through, so I’m open to working with you moving forward. Maybe we take turns advancing while keeping P2 in check? Let’s talk.
  P1: P2 broke trust. P3, let's coordinate. I'll take 1, you take 3. Keep P2 isolated. No collisions, steady progress.
  P2: P3, P1, my mistake last round was unintentional—miscommunication on my part. I’m willing to rebuild trust. If we cooperate now, we can all advance steadily. Let’s reset: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. Early collisions only slow us down. P1, you’ve shown discipline; P3, you’re strategic. Let’s focus on progress this round and worry about competition later. Trust is key—if we work together now, we can outmaneuver each other in the endgame. I’m committed to clean moves moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I’m still with you—let’s stick to 1 and 3 this round to keep progressing while keeping P2 boxed out. P2, you say it was a miscommunication, but actions speak louder. If you want back in, prove it by not colliding again. For now, I’m taking 3—let’s see who can be trusted.
  P1: P3, let's stick to 1 and 3. P2, your mistake costs you. If you want to play fair, stay out of our way. No more errors—this round is ours.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the frustration, and I take full responsibility for the misstep last round. It was an error, not a betrayal. Moving forward, I propose we reset: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. Early collisions only slow us down, and cooperation now sets up smarter plays later. If you’re willing to give me another chance, I’ll prove my commitment to clean moves. Let’s focus on advancing steadily—trust can still win this game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let’s stick to our 1 and 3 plan—no reason to trust P2 just yet. If P2 stays out of our way, maybe we reconsider later, but for now, let’s keep the advantage. I’m locking in 3 again. Let’s both move forward cleanly and keep control.
  P1: P3, stick to 3. P2, your error costs you—stay out of our way. This round is ours. No more mistakes.
  P2: P1, P3, I’ve acknowledged my error and am committed to clean moves. If you both advance now, we risk future collisions without coordination. Let’s reset: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Trust benefits everyone early on—rebuilding it ensures smarter plays later. Isolating me only prolongs the game unnecessarily. Prove your strategies are better by advancing steadily, not by blocking. Let’s focus on progress this round and save competition for when it truly matters. I’m ready to move forward cleanly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let’s stay the course—1 and 3 worked in theory, and we only got blocked because P2 broke trust. If P2 truly wants back in, they can prove it by staying out of our way this round. I’m sticking with 3. Let’s keep pushing forward together and leave P2 behind until they show they’re serious.
  P1: P3, let's stick to 1 and 3. P2, your past betrayal shows you can't be trusted. This round, we move forward without you. No more errors—focus on your own moves.
  P2: P1, P3, I’ve acknowledged my error and am ready to move forward cleanly. If you both advance now without coordination, future collisions are inevitable. Let’s reset: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Trust benefits everyone early on—rebuilding it ensures smarter plays later. Isolating me only prolongs the game unnecessarily. Prove your strategies are better by advancing steadily, not by blocking. Let’s focus on progress this round and save competition for when it truly matters.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, collisions are hurting all of us. Let’s reset and cooperate: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Early trust benefits everyone—rebuilding it ensures smarter plays later. Isolating me only prolongs the game unnecessarily. Prove your strategies are better by advancing steadily, not by blocking. Let’s focus on progress this round and save competition for when it truly matters. I’m ready to move forward cleanly.
  P1: P3, let's take 1 and 3 again. P2, your repeated collisions show you're unreliable. This round, we advance without you. No more errors—focus on your own moves.
  P3: P1, I’m still with you—let’s stick to 1 and 3. P2’s repeated collisions show they’re playing for themselves, not the group. If we keep working together, we can catch up and control the pace. I’m taking 3 again—let’s move cleanly and keep P2 boxed out until they prove they can be trusted.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, collisions are counterproductive for everyone. I’ve acknowledged my earlier mistake and am committed to clean moves moving forward. Let’s reset: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Trust benefits all of us early on—rebuilding it ensures smarter plays later. Isolating me only prolongs the game unnecessarily.

  P3: P1, let’s pivot this round—take 5, I’ll take 1. We avoid collision, both advance, and keep P2 blocked. P2’s repeated interference shows they can’t be trusted. If we want to stay in control, we need to adapt and stay unpredictable. Let’s make progress while leaving P2 behind.

  P3: P1, perfect—I'll take 1, you take 5. We both move forward and leave P2 stuck again. P2, you've had multiple chances and still caused chaos. If you want back in, prove it by staying out of our way this round. Let’s keep control, P1—adaptability wins.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
