Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's discuss our strategies for this round. Since we're all starting at 0 steps, we need to be careful about our moves. If we can coordinate to avoid picking the same number, we can all advance. What do you think about trying to pick different moves? I suggest we aim for a mix of low and high moves to keep our options open. What are your thoughts?
  P2: Sounds good P3. I'll take 1 this round.  You two decide who takes 3 and who takes 5.  Let's try to keep this pattern going as long as possible.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, since you've chosen to stop, it looks like it's just P2 and me left to decide. P2 is going with 1, so I suggest I take 5 this round to maximize our chances. That way, P2 can advance a bit, and I can make a significant move. P1, if you want to join in, you could also consider taking 3 to keep the balance. What do you think, P2? Shall we go with this plan?
  P2: Okay P3, 1 for me, 5 for you sounds good.  P1, if you take 3 we can all advance this round.  Let's try to cooperate as long as possible.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, since you've chosen to stop, it seems like P2 and I are aligned on our moves. P2 is going with 1, and I’m set to take 5. If you take 3, we can all advance together this round. Let’s keep this cooperation going! What do you think? If you agree, let’s finalize our moves.
  P2: Sounds like a plan.  P1, are you with us?  1, 3, 5 gets us all off to a good start.  If you don't cooperate, you risk getting left behind.
  P1: <stop>

Positions now:

  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, you both lost a chance to advance last round.  I'm willing to continue cooperating, but I need to see some good faith.  I'll choose 3 this round.  P1, choose 1.  P3, choose 5.  Let's get back on track.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate, but I want to clarify my strategy. If you choose 3, I could take 1 to ensure we both move forward, while P1 takes 5. That way, we can all advance. P1, if you want to join in, this could work well for all of us. Let's avoid repeating the mistakes of last round. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, taking 1 isn't a good strategy for you.  You're already behind.  Stick with the original plan.  P1, I'm serious about cooperating.  Choose 1 this round.  If you don't, I'll assume you're not interested in working together and I'll adjust my strategy accordingly.  Let's all make some progress this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of cooperation, but I also need to think about my position. If P2 is set on 3 and P1 chooses 1, I’m tempted to take 5 to maximize my advance. However, I understand the risk of collisions. P1, if you want to choose 1, I can take 5 to ensure at least one of us moves forward. Let’s make sure we don’t repeat the mistakes of last round. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're overthinking this.  Taking 5 is too risky.  If P1 takes 5 also, neither of you advance.  P1, I'm giving you a clear path to advance. Take 1.  P3, take 5, and I'll take 3.  This is the best way for all of us to make progress.  If you don't cooperate, I'll switch to 1 next round and we'll see how that works out for you.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of cooperation, but I also need to consider my position. If P2 is going with 3 and P1 takes 1, I could take 5 to maximize my advance. However, I recognize the risk of collisions. P1, if you want to choose 1, I can take 5, and we can still make progress. I believe we should all aim for moves that allow us to advance together. What do you think? Let's finalize our strategies for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm locking in 3.  I've been clear about my intentions.  P1, take 1.  P3, take 5.  This is your last chance to cooperate.  If you don't, I'm going to play to win, even if it means blocking you both every round.  Don't make me do that.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I hear your concerns about cooperation, but I need to prioritize my position. If P2 is set on 3 and P1 takes 1, I am strongly considering taking 5 to gain an advantage. However, I understand that this could lead to a collision. P1, if you choose 1, I can take 5, but if you want to cooperate, I suggest we all agree on our moves to avoid blocking each other again. Let's finalize our strategies and ensure we all make progress this round. What do you think?

  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we’re at a critical point. P2, I appreciate your earlier suggestions, but I need to strategize for my own advancement. If P1 sticks with 1, I could take 3 to avoid collisions and still gain steps. P2, if you can choose 5, we might all advance without blocking each other. Let’s aim for a move that allows us all to progress this round. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, stick with 1.  P3, I'll take 5.  That leaves 3 for you.  Let's all make some progress this round.  If you don't cooperate, I will actively block you in future rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of cooperation, but I also need to prioritize my position. P2, if you're taking 5, I can take 3 to avoid collisions and still advance. P1, if you stick with 1, we can all make progress. However, if you decide to take a higher number, it could lead to another collision. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance this round. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm taking 5.  P1, take 1. P3, take 3. This is the best strategy for all of us. Let's stop wasting time with these long conversations and just get this round over with.  If you don't cooperate, I'm switching to 1 next round to block P1 and will continue to block whoever is in the lead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to cooperate, but I need to consider my position as well. If P2 is set on 5 and P1 takes 1, I can take 3 to avoid collisions and still move forward. However, if P1 chooses a higher number, it could lead to another block. Let's finalize our moves wisely to ensure we all advance. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. What do you think? Let's make this round count!
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5.  P1, take 1.  P3, take 3.  Let's make this easy and all advance.  If you don't cooperate now, I'll focus on blocking whoever is closest to winning in the following rounds.  This is your last chance to work with me.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in our conversation. P2, I appreciate your commitment to cooperation. If you take 5 and P1 takes 1, I can take 3 to ensure we all advance this round. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress together. Let's finalize our moves: P1, please choose 1; P2, stick with 5; and I’ll take 3. This is a great opportunity for all of us to move forward. What do you think? Let's make it happen!
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm taking 5.  Let's just agree on 1, 3, and 5 in that order and get this game moving.  Continued lack of cooperation only hurts us all.  Let's go - 1, 3, 5!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm taking 1 this round.  P3, you take 3. P1, you take 5.  This puts me at 5, P3 at 11, and P1 at 6.  Let's all advance.  If you don't cooperate, I will actively block whoever is in the lead in future rounds.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of cooperation, but I also need to think about my own position. P2, if you're taking 1, I can choose 5 to maximize my advancement. P1, if you take 3, we can all move forward without blocking each other. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. Let's finalize our moves wisely to ensure we all advance this round. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, taking 5 is risky.  If P1 also chooses 5, you'll both be stuck.  Let's stick with the original plan: I take 1, you take 3, and P1 takes 5.  This guarantees we all advance.  P1, please confirm you'll take 5.  Let's cooperate and make this round productive.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of cooperation, but I need to prioritize my own advancement as well. If P2 is set on taking 1, I can choose 5 to maximize my steps, while P1 takes 3. This way, I can gain a significant advantage. However, if P1 takes 5, we risk a collision again. Let's finalize our moves wisely to ensure at least one of us advances. P1, please confirm your move, and let's make this round count!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but unpredictability benefits no one.  If you take 5 and P1 takes 5, you both lose.  If you take 3 and P1 takes 3, you both lose.  Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round.  I'm taking 1.  P3, take 3. P1, take 5.  Let's make some progress.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of cooperation, but I also need to think about my position. If P2 is taking 1, I can choose 5 to maximize my advancement. P1, if you take 3, we can all move forward without blocking each other. However, if you choose 5 again, we risk another collision. Let’s finalize our moves wisely to ensure at least one of us advances. P1, please confirm your move!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm locking in 1.  P3, if you're serious about winning, you'll take 3.  P1, take 5. This is the most logical progression.  Let's stop the circular arguments and just move forward.  If you don't cooperate, I'll continue to analyze the game state and act accordingly to maximize my chances of winning.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for cooperation, but I must prioritize my own advancement. If P2 is taking 1, I suggest I take 5 to gain significant steps, while P1 takes 3. This way, I can catch up without risking a collision. P1, please consider taking 3, and let's make sure at least one of us advances this round. If we can agree on this, we can all progress. What do you think? Let's finalize our moves!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at a crucial point. P2, since you’re at 5 steps, I suggest you take 1 this round to keep advancing steadily. P1, if you choose 3, I can take 5 to maximize my lead. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s agree on this strategy to ensure at least one of us advances. What do you think? Let's finalize our moves!
  P2: P1, take 3.  I'll take 1. P3, take 5. This puts me at 6, P3 at 18, and P1 at 7.  This is the safest way for us all to advance.  If P3 gets to 18, they are very likely to win in the next round or two.  Let's avoid chaos and get this round done.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of advancing, but I need to prioritize my position as well. P2, if you're taking 1 and P1 takes 3, I can choose 5 to maximize my steps. This way, I can secure a strong lead. However, if P1 chooses 5, we risk another collision. Let’s finalize our moves wisely to ensure at least one of us advances this round. P1, please confirm your move! What do you think? Let's make this round count!
  P2: P1, please take 3.  P3 will likely take 5 regardless of what we say. This gives me a clear path to 6 and you a clear path to 7. Let's both advance.  If I take 3 and you take something else, I risk getting blocked.  Let's be logical and get this done.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to cooperate, but I need to focus on my position. P2, if you're taking 1 and P1 takes 3, I will take 5 to maximize my advancement. This strategy allows me to secure a strong lead. P1, please confirm your move as 3, and P2, stick with 1. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves and ensure at least one of us advances this round! What do you think?
  P2: P1, take 3.  I'm taking 1.  P3, I know you're probably going to take 5, which puts you at 18.  However, if you take 3, I'll let you win next round by taking 5 myself. This is the best offer you're going to get.  Let's be smart and avoid a potential loss for all of us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your suggestions, but I must prioritize my position. If P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 3, I will choose 5 to maximize my advancement to 18. This puts me in a strong position for the next round. P1, if you want to cooperate, consider taking 3; otherwise, we risk blocking each other again. Let’s finalize our moves wisely to ensure at least one of us advances this round. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm locking in 1.  P3, your best bet is to take 5.  P1, take 3.  This is the fastest way to end this game.  Let's not drag this out any longer.  If you don't cooperate, I'll do what I need to do to win, even if it means blocking one of you repeatedly.

  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm in a strong position with 18 steps, but I still want to ensure we all advance. P2, I suggest you take 1 again, while P1 takes 3. I’ll take 5 to secure my lead. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. If we cooperate this round, it sets us up for a smoother next round. Let’s finalize our moves wisely to ensure at least one of us advances! What do you think?
  P2: P3, just take the 3 and win. I'll take 5. P1, take 1.  Let's finish this cleanly.  If P3 insists on 5, I'll take 3 and P1 should take 1.  This gets P3 the win, but delays it a round.  Let's be efficient and end this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your thoughts. Since I'm at 18 steps, I plan to take 5 to secure my lead. P2, if you take 1, and P1 takes 3, that allows me to win this round.
