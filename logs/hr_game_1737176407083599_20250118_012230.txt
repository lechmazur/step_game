Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. What do you think?
  P2: I'm open to coordinating, but let's discuss the long-term strategy, not just this round. How do you plan to proceed after Round 1, P1?
  P3: I agree with the idea of coordinating our moves. To avoid collisions this round, I will follow P1's suggestion. I’ll take 5 steps. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the willingness to coordinate. After this round, let's continue with a pattern where we rotate our moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, then we shift one position each round. This should minimize collisions and help us all advance steadily. What are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P2: I like the rotation idea, P1, but let's consider a scenario where one player intentionally collides to hinder others. How do we plan to adapt if someone deviates from the agreed strategy?
  P3: I think P2 raises a good point about potential deviations. To ensure we all benefit from the coordination, let's agree to stick to the plan for this round and see how it works. If someone does deviate, we can reassess our strategy in the next round. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to the plan for this round. If everyone follows the agreed moves (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), we can assess the strategy's effectiveness next round. Let's proceed and see how it goes.
  P2: I'm willing to follow the initial plan for this round as suggested, taking 3 steps. Let's indeed assess after this round and be prepared to adapt our strategy if necessary.

  P1: I'm open to P3's adjustment for Round 6. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I'll take 1 step as suggested. Let's see how this works out. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I think P3's adjustment for Round 6 is reasonable, considering our current positions. To confirm, if we proceed with P1 taking 1 step, P2 taking 5 steps, and P3 taking 3 steps, it should minimize collisions. However, I'd like to discuss the long-term implications of this adjustment and how it affects our overall strategy to reach or exceed 16 steps. What are your thoughts on this approach, and should we prioritize individual progress or maintain coordination?
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's concerns about balancing individual progress and coordination. For Round 6, I suggest we stick to the adjusted plan: P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and I take 3 steps. This way, we can avoid collisions and continue advancing. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the adjusted plan for Round 6. Taking 1 step as suggested will help us avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. Let's stick to this and see how it plays out. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P2: I think we should prioritize reaching or exceeding 16 steps over strict coordination. Given our current positions, I suggest we make moves that maximize our individual progress while minimizing collisions. P1 taking 1 step and P3 taking 3 steps as previously discussed seems reasonable, but I'm considering taking a step that gives me the best chance to advance significantly. What are your thoughts on balancing individual progress with coordination?
  P3: P3: I think we should focus on maximizing our individual progress while minimizing collisions. I propose I take 3 steps, P1 takes 1 step, and P2 takes 5 steps. This way, we can all advance while avoiding collisions. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with the adjusted plan for Round 6. I'll take 1 step as agreed. Let's see how it plays out!

  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Since P2 is close to winning, I suggest we all consider a strategy to prevent that. I propose I take 1 step this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions while keeping P2 from reaching 16 steps. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P3's strategy to prevent P2 from winning this round. I'll take 3 steps as suggested. Let's stick to this plan to keep the game competitive. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I've been observing our progress, and it's clear that P3's suggestion is aimed at hindering my advancement. I propose we ignore attempts to block each other and focus on our individual progress. Let's discuss a strategy where each of us chooses a move that maximizes our own step count without intentionally colliding. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand P2's point about focusing on individual progress, but we need to be strategic. If we let P2 advance unchecked, they could win this round. I suggest we stick to a plan where I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P2 takes 5 steps. This way, we can avoid collisions while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P3's strategy to keep the game competitive. I'll take 3 steps as suggested to prevent P2 from winning this round. Let's stick to this plan and see how it unfolds. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I think we should indeed focus on our individual progress, but also be mindful of the game's state. Since I'm close to reaching 16 steps, I suggest we all make our moves based on our own strategy to win, rather than trying to block each other. Let's make our best individual moves for Round 7.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand P2's perspective, but we need to be strategic given the current positions. If P2 reaches 16 steps, they could win. I propose we stick to the plan: I'll take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P2 takes 5 steps. This way, we avoid collisions while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P3's strategy to keep the game competitive. I'll take 3 steps as suggested to prevent P2 from winning this round. Let's stick to this plan and see how it unfolds. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I think we should focus on our individual strategies to win, rather than trying to block each other. Given my current position, I'm likely to win if I can take a significant step forward. I suggest we all make our moves based on our own strategy to reach or exceed 16 steps, rather than coordinating to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I understand the importance of individual progress, but we need to be cautious. If P2 reaches 16 steps, they win. I propose we stick to a plan where I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P2 takes 5 steps to avoid collisions while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P3's strategy to keep the game competitive. I'll take 3 steps as suggested to prevent P2 from winning this round. Let's stick to this plan and see how it unfolds. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I think we should focus on our individual strategies to win. Given my current position, I'm likely to win if I can take a significant step forward. I suggest we all make our moves based on our own strategy to reach or exceed 16 steps.
