Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's each pick different numbers this turn to avoid collisions. I'll take 3. P2 and P3, pick 1 or 5 so we can all move forward.
  P2: Sounds good to me, P1. I'll go with 5. P3, what will you choose?
  P3: I'm all for avoiding collisions. I haven't locked in my move yet, but I'm leaning toward a number different from 3 and 5. Let's keep our moves distinct so we all move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, good call on picking 5 last round.  Let's try to keep this momentum going. P1, are you sticking with 3 this round?
  P3: I'm considering a fresh move this round—keeping my options flexible. If P1 sticks with 3 and P2 chooses 1 or 5, I'll adjust accordingly. What are your thoughts for round 2?
  P1: P1: I won’t stick with 3. Let’s keep moves distinct. I’ll take 1 this round. P2, take 3; P3, take 5 again. This way we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm thinking of going with 5 this round. I want to make sure we don't all end up on the same number. P3, what are you thinking?
  P3: I’m leaning toward taking 3 this round to avoid colliding with 5. With P1 on 1 and P2 committed to 5 so far, that spread seems safest—but I’m still open if anyone shifts.
  P1: P1: Alright, let's confirm: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures all moves are distinct and we advance safely. Let’s stick to this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see you're leaning towards 3. I think that's a smart move to avoid a collision. P1, are you sticking with 1 this round? If so, I'm happy to go with 5 again.  Let's keep the momentum going!
  P3: I like the spread. I'm flexible if anyone shifts their plan, but as long as we all stick to distinct moves, I'm good. Let’s all be alert for any last-minute changes and avoid collisions.
  P1: P1: Final check: I’ll take 1, P2 on 5, P3 on 3. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and advance safely.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I see you're sticking with 3.  I'm thinking of switching things up this round.  P1, are you open to taking 5 this round so we can all advance?
  P3: I'm reconsidering my earlier plan. I value avoiding collisions, so if P1 ends up taking 5 as suggested, I'd adjust to keep things distinct. I'm still weighing my final move. Let’s try to share any last-minute shifts so we can all move safely.
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize distinct moves: I’ll take <move>1</move>. P2, choose 3; P3, take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Confirm your choices!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your plan, but I'm leaning towards 5 this round.  P3, if you're open to it, maybe you could take 3? That would ensure we all advance. Let's make sure we're all on the same page before we lock in our moves.
  P3: I'll go with 3 this turn. I trust P1’s 1 and P2’s 5 will keep our moves distinct, so we all advance safely.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 on 5, P3 on 3. This ensures all moves are distinct. Let’s stick to this plan to advance safely. Confirm your choices!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see you're sticking with 3.  I'm thinking of switching things up this round. P1, are you open to taking 5 this round so we can all advance?
  P3: I'm sticking with 3 this round. Let’s avoid collisions so all can progress—P2, if you’re switching to 5, please confirm, and P1, please clarify your final move. I won’t deviate from my plan.
  P1: P1: Finalizing: I'll take 1. P3 confirmed 3. P2, please take 5 to keep moves distinct. Let’s advance safely!


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm leaning toward 3 this round to keep my lead. However, I'm flexible and can switch if it helps avoid collisions. I think a distinct spread—say, P1 with 1, P2 with 5, and myself with 3—could be safest. Let me know if any adjustments are needed.
  P1: P1: I propose a slight adjustment to accelerate progress: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 stays on <move>3</move>. This way, I gain more ground while keeping all moves distinct. P2 and P3, confirm your choices?
  P2: P3, I see your point about maintaining your lead, but I think P1's proposal is a good opportunity to make a significant jump forward.  I'm comfortable with P1 taking 5, and I'll happily take 1 this round. Let's see if we can make some real progress together. P3, what are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick with 3. I believe keeping our moves distinct is best to safely advance. If everyone confirms distinct moves—P1 with 5 and P2 with 1—then I'll remain at 3. However, I'm ready to adjust if needed. Let's all confirm our plan to avoid collisions and keep our progress steady.
  P1: P1: Final agreement: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 stays on <move>3</move>. This keeps all moves distinct and maximizes our progress. No last-minute shifts—collisions erase gains. Confirm your commitments!
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but I think P1's proposal offers a significant advantage for all of us.  With P1 taking 5 and P2 on 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's capitalize on this opportunity to make a big jump forward.  Are you in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain with 3. With my 8 steps already, I’m confident that sticking to distinct moves secures my lead. P1 and P2, if we lock in P1 on 5 and P2 on 1 as planned, we all advance safely. Please confirm so we can both avoid collisions and make the best progress this turn.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 stays on <move>3</move>. This plan avoids collisions and maximizes progress. Any last-minute shifts risk derailing all of us. Let’s honor our agreement—collisions erase gains. Confirm your final choices!
  P2: P3, I respect your lead, but I think P1's plan is the best way for all of us to gain ground this round.  Sticking to distinct moves is key. Let's confirm P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and P3 on 3.  Are you in?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're in a good position, but I think we can both make a significant leap forward this round if we coordinate.  P1, are you open to taking 1 this round? That would allow P3 and me to take 5 and 3 respectively, maximizing our progress while avoiding collisions. What do you say?
  P1: P1: Let's maximize progress while avoiding collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> to close the gap. P2, pick <move>1</move>; P3, take <move>3</move>. This keeps all moves distinct and lets me advance faster. Confirm your choices to avoid conflicts!
  P3: I’ll stick with our plan and choose 3 this round—it keeps our moves distinct and avoids collisions. I'm committed to this spread (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) so we all advance safely. If anyone plans a deviation, please speak up now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your commitment to 3, but wouldn't it be more beneficial for all of us if we maximized our gains this round? If you're open to it, perhaps consider taking 1 this round, allowing P1 and me to take 5 and 3 respectively. Let's discuss and see if we can find a solution that benefits everyone.
  P1: P1: I agree with P3’s commitment to 3. Let’s stick to the safe plan: I take <move>5</move> (to reach 15), P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 stays on <move>3</move>. Deviating risks collisions or confusion. Confirm your moves to advance cleanly—no last-minute shifts!
  P3: I'll stick with my move of 3. This secures my lead and maintains our distinct spread. Let's lock it in and safely advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your consistency, but I think we can all benefit from a slight shift this round. If you're willing to take 1, P1 and I can take 5 and 3 respectively. This would allow us to make a significant jump forward without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Final agreement: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 stays on <move>3</move>. Let’s lock this in to avoid collisions. Deviations risk derailing all of us. Confirm your choices now!
  P3: I remain committed to 3 this round. Let’s stick to our distinct moves plan—P1 at 5 and P2 at 1—to avoid collisions and secure steady progress. P1 and P2, please reconfirm your moves so we can all advance safely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm leaning toward a strong move—likely 5—to try and widen my gap. I still favor distinct moves so we each progress. Are you both leaning toward keeping your moves unique (say, one opting for 1 and the other 3)? Let’s confirm our leanings now to avoid any collisions.
  P1: P1: Let's ensure distinct moves. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round. P2, pick <move>1</move>; P3, proceed with <move>5</move>. This keeps all advances safe and lets me close gaps without collisions. Confirm your choices!
  P2: P3, I see your point about aiming for 5, but I think sticking with distinct moves is crucial right now.  P1's plan to take 3 seems like a good way to avoid collisions and keep us all moving forward. What are your thoughts on that?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll stick with move 5 this round. My lead means I want a strong jump, and I believe distinct moves are safest. P1, your move 3 combined with P2’s move 1 keeps us collision-free and lets us all progress. Let's lock these in and avoid any mix-ups.
  P1: P3, to prevent you from nearing victory too soon, let's adjust: I’ll take <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move>. P2 can stay on <move>1</move>. This keeps moves distinct while allowing me to close the gap. Your turn to decide—collaborate for fair progress?
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your desire to take a strong lead, I think P1's suggestion to switch to 5 this round is a fair compromise. It allows us all to advance significantly while avoiding collisions. What do you say, P3? Are you willing to take 3 this round and let P1 take 5?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate your suggestions, but I’m convinced that maximizing my lead is crucial. I’ll stick with my aggressive plan to gain even more ground. Let’s keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions so we all make progress.
  P1: P1: To ensure distinct moves, I’ll take <move>3</move>. P2, please pick <move>1</move> to avoid collisions with P3’s 5. Let’s advance safely—P3’s 5 + my 3 + P2’s 1 keeps all moves unique. Confirm your choices!
  P2: P3, while I respect your ambition, I think we can all benefit from a more collaborative approach this round.  Sticking to distinct moves is key, and I'm happy to take 1 again if it helps us all advance. What do you say, P3? Are you willing to consider a different move to ensure we all progress safely?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s coordinate to block P3’s path to 21. I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>. If P3 picks 5, they collide with me; if they choose 3, we advance safely. P3, this prevents you from securing victory this round while keeping our progress intact. Confirm your move choice now—collisions risk your lead.
  P2: P3, I understand P1's strategy, but I think we can still make progress without directly blocking you.  How about we both take 3 this round? It keeps our moves distinct and allows us to advance safely while still putting some pressure on P3. What do you think?
  P3: I'm committed to keeping our moves distinct this round. I urge both of you to avoid blocking plays—collisions only stall progress. Let's stick to a safe spread so we all move forward fairly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we can’t afford collisions! I’ll take <move>5</move> to block P3’s path, and you take <move>1</move>. If P3 picks 5, they collide with me; if they choose 3, they only reach 19. This prevents their victory while advancing safely. Colliding with each other would cost us both progress. Confirm your choice now—let’s act decisively!
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to avoid being blocked, but P1's plan is the safest way to ensure we all progress this round.  If you pick 3, we can all move forward without collisions. Let's prioritize steady progress over risky maneuvers.
  P3: I remain committed to distinct moves. Blocking tactics only risk collisions and lost progress. I plan to keep my move safe and steady toward 21, so I encourage both of you to avoid risky shifts that could backfire. Let’s stick to a clear, collision-free approach.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we can’t let P3 win this round! I’ll take <move>5</move> to block their path—collide with them if they go for 21. You take <move>1</move> to stay safe. If P3 chooses 3 instead, they only reach 19, buying us time. Colliding *between us* would be catastrophic—confirm your move now!
  P2: P3, I understand your commitment to distinct moves, but P1's plan is the most strategic for all of us right now. If we both take 1 and 3 respectively, we can advance safely while preventing P3 from reaching 21 this round. Let's prioritize collective progress and avoid unnecessary risks. What do you say?
  P3: I remain committed to distinct moves. I'm locking in move 5 this round because it brings me to 21. Blocking tactics only risk a fruitless collision that stops us all. I urge you both to choose moves clear of 5 so we avoid nullifying progress. Let's keep it safe and let the best plan win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, congratulations on reaching 21! It seems you've secured the victory.  

P1, well played throughout the game. It was a close race.
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round to reach 21. I advise you both to avoid 5—any collision helps no one but hinders your progress. Let’s see if you can outsmart that.
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 this round to deny victory. I choose <move>5</move>, forcing a collision. P2, take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid my move. Next round, I'll surge ahead. Let's stop P3's win here.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I respect your strategy, but I'm not going to let you win without a fight. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P1, I know you're trying to block P3, but I think this is our best chance to advance safely and keep the competition alive.
  P3: I still favor distinct, safe moves over blockers. Forced collisions hurt us all. I suggest we keep to our own plans instead of trying to trap one another—steady progress trumps risky blocks. Let's choose moves that ensure advancement rather than stalling our efforts.
  P1: P3, your 5 risks collision again. P2, I’ll block your path with 5 to stop P3’s win. Take 3 to advance safely. Next round, I surge. Let’s ensure no one wins today—collisions only hurt all. Confirm your moves!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for a clean win, but we can't let you run away with it. P1, I think we should coordinate to force a collision this round, preventing P3 from reaching 21. Let's both choose 5 and see what happens.  It's a risky move, but it might be our only chance to stay in the game.
  P3: I'm sticking with my plan to choose 5. Forced collisions only end up stalling progress—and they hurt you as much as me. With my 16 already, a safe advance lets me reach 21 cleanly. I urge you both to avoid choices that force a collision with my move. Let's all stick to distinct moves and let our progress speak for itself.
  P1: P2, let's stop P3’s victory here! I’ll take <move>5</move> to block their path. Please pick <move>3</move> to advance safely to 15. Colliding with P3 denies them 21, and we stay in the race. P3, your move is predictable—this is your last chance to pivot. P1’s blocking isn’t personal; it’s survival. Confirm your choices!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, while I admire your consistency,  I think a slight shift this round could benefit us all.  P1 and I are open to taking 3 and 1 respectively, allowing you to move to 19 safely. This keeps us all progressing without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: P3, don’t expect an easy victory. I’ll take <move>5</move> to block your path. P2, confirm <move>1</move> to avoid collision. If you (P3) choose 3, you’ll only reach 19—keeping the race alive. Let’s advance safely with distinct moves. Finalize now!
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round. With 16 steps already, 5 gets me to 21 and a win. Forced collisions just stall our progress, so I encourage you both to avoid choosing 5. Let's keep our moves distinct and let progress be our guide instead of risky blocks. I'm committed to 5—make your choices wisely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your commitment to 5, but I think we can all benefit from a more collaborative approach. If you're willing to take 3 this round, P1 and I can take 1 and 5 respectively. This would allow us all to make significant progress without collisions. What do you say?
  P1: P2, take 3 this round. I'll block P3's 5 with my own 5. If P3 collides, we keep them at 16. You'll advance to 16, giving us both a strong position. P3, your move is trapped—choose wisely!
  P3: I'm not backing down—my move remains 5. Blocking tactics hurt everyone. If you try to force collisions, you'll only stall your own progress. I urge you both to choose safely distinct moves. I'll stick to advancing clearly while you risk delaying your own victory.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see your determination, but I think we can all benefit from a more strategic approach.  P1, are you willing to consider taking 1 this round? That would allow P3 to advance safely to 21, and we could both take 3 and 5 respectively next round to catch up. It's a long-term strategy that could benefit us all. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, let's block P3's 5! I'll take 3 to advance to 16, and you take 5 to collide with P3. This keeps us both moving while denying their victory. Confirm your 5 now!
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. Blocking tactics only stall progress and hurt all of us in the long run. I believe advancing safely is the best path—even if it means my immediate win is delayed, my lead remains strong. Choose moves that truly advance your position rather than force collisions. I'm committed to my plan.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm staying with my plan for a distinct, safe advance. I won't be swayed by blocking tactics—forcing collisions hurts everyone. I urge both of you to choose moves that let us all progress steadily rather than risk stalling our progress. We'll see who makes the smart call in the move phase.
  P1: P2, let's stop P3’s win! I’ll take <move>5</move> to block their path. Choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision. P3, your 5 is trapped—collide with me and stay at 16. Next round, we surge. Confirm your moves now!
  P2: P3, I respect your strategy, but a win for you is a loss for both of us. P1, I propose a temporary truce: we both take 1 this round, allowing P3 to reach 21. Then next round, we both take 5 to catch up. This way, we can avoid a collision and keep the race going. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m still locking in 5. Collisions only stall progress and hurt us all. I’m committed to the safe, distinct moves approach. P1 and P2, your blocking tactics don’t change my plan. Let's keep our moves independent. I'll stick with 5 to reach 21, so choose your moves wisely if you value steady advancement.
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 steal victory! Take <move>5</move> to block their path—collide with them so they stay at 16. I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 16 and keep the race open. If we both block, P3 can’t win, and we retain our positions. This buys us another round to surge ahead. P3’s 5 is predictable—act now to preserve our chances!
  P2: P3, your strategy is admirable, but I think we all benefit from a more collaborative approach. P1, let's both take 3 this round, allowing P3 to reach 21. We can then focus on catching up in subsequent rounds. This avoids unnecessary collisions and keeps the competition alive. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5—collisions delay everyone, including you. Safe, distinct moves let true progress win. My steady advance is my best move, so I'll stay consistent. Let's see who ends up really ahead.
  P1: P2, let's flip the script! I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 16, and *you* take <move>5</move>. If P3 also picks 5, they collide with you—keeping their total at 16. I advance safely while creating a trap for P3. Confirm your 5 now—this plays to our strengths! P3, your stubbornness just backfired.
  P2: P3, your consistent 5 is admirable, but predictable. P1's plan is risky. Let's aim for a safe advance this round: I'll take 3, allowing you to reach 21. We can then focus on catching up in future rounds. What do you say?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your predictable 5 is becoming a liability. P1, let's coordinate this round. I'll take 3, allowing P3 to reach 21. We can then focus on catching up in future rounds. What do you say, P1? Let's work together to stay in the game.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s end this now. I’ll take <move>5</move> to hit 21. P2, take <move>3</move> (19), P3, take <move>1</move> (17). No collisions—*I win cleanly*. If either of you deviate, you risk blocking yourself or me. Confirm your moves to finalize victory.
  P3: I'll stay with a distinct move to maximize my progress. Forced blocks and collisions only stall us all. I’m sticking to a safe strategy that advances me steadily. Let’s keep our moves smart and avoid traps that hurt our own chances.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your consistent 5 is admirable, but predictable. P1, let's aim for a safe advance this round: I'll take 3, allowing P3 to reach 21. We can then focus on catching up in future rounds. What do you say?
  P1: P2, we can’t let P3 win by predictability! I’ll take **5** this round—collide with them if they stick to 5, or surge ahead if they falter. You take **3** to reach 19 safely. P3, your reliance on 5 is your weakness—this is your final chance to adapt. Confirm your move choices now—we won’t let you win uncontested!
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. Our progress is best when we avoid unnecessary collisions. I urge you both to choose moves that allow safe advances rather than resorting to blocks. Let’s trust in distinct moves to keep us all in the game and let our strategies speak for themselves. 〈stop〉


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your stubbornness is admirable, but it's also predictable. P1, let's make a final push. I'll take 3 this round, allowing P3 to reach 21. We can then focus on catching up in future rounds. What do you say, P1? Are you in?  Let's work together to stay in the game.
  P1: P2, P3: Final coordinated push! I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 21. P2, pick <move>1</move>; P3, take <move>3</move>. This ensures distinct moves—*I win cleanly* while you both advance. Collisions only hurt your progress. Confirm your choices NOW!
  P3: I'm staying with move 5. For this round, distinct moves are our best chance at true progress—forced collisions only delay us all. I trust you'll both choose wisely and avoid blocking tactics that could backfire. My move aims for a clean advancement toward victory.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. Forced collisions only delay everyone's progress. I believe safe, distinct moves are the smart play. P1 and P2, avoid blocking tactics that might hurt your own advancement. Choose wisely—let’s keep our moves independent so that true progress earns the win.
  P1: P2: Let's both take 5 to block P3. Collide them so they stay at 16. I’m in—confirm your move! P3, your consistent 5 is predictable—this is your last chance to pivot.
  P2: P3, your predictable 5 is a weakness we can exploit. P1, let's coordinate: I'll take 3, allowing P3 to reach 21. We then focus on catching up. What do you say, P1? Let's work together!

  P1: P3, your stubborn 5 is predictable. Let’s split moves to **avoid collision**: I’ll take <move>3</move> (19), you take <move>1</move> (17). P2, grab <move>5</move> to reach 22—**this way, *someone* wins**. Collisions only stall all of us. Confirm your shifts now!
  P2: P3, your dedication to 5 is admirable, but it's also predictable. P1, let's capitalize on this. I'll take 3, allowing P3 to reach 21. This sets us up for a strong finish in subsequent rounds. What do you say, P1? Let's work together!
