Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. We can rotate strategies in future rounds to ensure we all progress efficiently. If we work together early, we can maximize our chances of winning later. What do you say?
  P2: I'm in. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's see if P3 is on board with this plan.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you don't respond, I'll assume you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the plan: no collisions this round. We can adjust strategies later based on progress. If we cooperate now, everyone moves forward efficiently. Waiting for your confirmation or counter-proposal.
  P2: P3, are you with us? A little teamwork goes a long way in this game. Let's make sure we all make progress this round.
  P3: <stop>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you're aiming to win, sticking with the plan is our best bet.  P1 and I are committed to avoiding collisions.  Let's make this a quick win for one of us. What's your move?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, it seems you're determined to collide with me. If you continue picking <move>1</move>, neither of us will progress. Let’s try this: I’ll take <move>3</move> this round if you commit to <move>5</move>. P2 is already ahead, so we’re losing ground by fighting over the same moves. A coordinated approach benefits both of us. What do you say? If no response, I’ll assume you’re unwilling to cooperate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1's offer is reasonable.  We can all benefit from avoiding collisions. If you take <move>5</move>, we can both advance this round and start closing the gap with P2. Think strategically - let's not let P2 run away with this.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, if you continue to ignore coordination, we’ll both lose. P2 is already ahead, and collisions only help them. Let’s break this cycle: I’ll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. If you refuse, I’ll assume you’re intentionally sabotaging progress. Cooperate now, or we risk falling too far behind to recover.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to bully you into taking a move that benefits them.  We both know they'll just change tactics next round. Let's not be predictable. I'm sticking with my plan.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, continuing to collide only helps P2 pull ahead. If you refuse coordination, I’ll adjust my strategy to ensure *someone* progresses. Let’s avoid wasting another round—take <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. Otherwise, I’ll assume you’re intentionally blocking progress, and we’ll both lose ground. P2 is already at 5 steps; we can’t afford to fall further behind. Cooperate now, or face the consequences.

  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to intimidate you, but their strategy is predictable.  They'll keep trying to force you into a corner. Let's not fall for it. I'm going to take <move>5</move> again this round. You choose what's best for you.
  P1: P3, continuing to pick <move>1</move> only helps P2 pull further ahead. If you refuse coordination, I’ll adjust my strategy to ensure progress. Let’s avoid wasting another round—take <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. Otherwise, I’ll assume you’re intentionally blocking progress, and we’ll both lose ground. Cooperate now, or face the consequences.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to bully you again. Don't fall for it. We both know they'll just change tactics next round. I'm sticking with my plan. You decide what's best for you.
  P1: P3, your persistence with <move>1</move> is counterproductive. P2 is already dominating, and collisions only help them. Let’s break this pattern: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round if you commit to <move>3</move>. This ensures both of us advance while P2 moves alone. If you refuse, I’ll assume you’re sabotaging progress, and I’ll adjust accordingly. Cooperate now—this is our chance to catch up and challenge P2’s lead.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1 keeps trying to manipulate you. They want you to take <move>3</move> so they can take <move>5</move> and get ahead. Don't fall for it. We can both advance if we work together. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. You pick <move>5</move> and let's leave P1 behind.
  P1: P3, your repeated choice of <move>1</move> is only helping P2 dominate. If you refuse to coordinate, I’ll adjust my strategy to ensure *someone* progresses. Let’s avoid wasting another round—take <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. Otherwise, I’ll assume you’re intentionally blocking progress, and we’ll both lose ground.

  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to wear you down. They see you as an obstacle, not a teammate.  Let's prove them wrong. I'm going to take <move>3</move> this round. You choose <move>5</move> and let's leave P1 in the dust.
  P1: P3, your refusal to coordinate is only helping P2 dominate. If you continue with <move>1</move>, I’ll adjust and take <move>5</move> to ensure progress. Let’s break this cycle: commit to <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Otherwise, I’ll assume sabotage, and we’ll both lose.

  P1: P3, your repeated choice of <move>1</move> is only helping P2 dominate. If you continue this pattern, I’ll adjust and take <move>3</move> to ensure progress.

  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your choice of <move>5</move> last round finally showed progress, but it also helped P2 get closer to winning. If you keep colliding with me or P2, none of us will catch up.
