Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers this round to get some early progress.
  P3: How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5 this round? Sound good?
  P2: Sounds good to me, I'll take 5. Let's make some progress!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I'll take 1.
  P3: Sounds good. I’ll pick 3 as planned. Let’s stick to this so we don’t block each other.
  P2: Sounds good to me, I'll take 5. Let's make some progress!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds good to me too. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: I’m sticking with 3 this round as we planned. Let’s finalize this and not block each other.
  P2: I'll stick to our plan and take 5 this round. Let's make some progress!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going! I'll take 5 again this round. How about you two?
  P1: I'll take 1 again this round, how about P3 takes 3 and P2 takes 5?
  P3: Hold on, you (P2) already have 5 steps. I’d like to pick 5 this round to catch up. Otherwise, if you insist on taking 5, we could both end up blocking each other—and then P1 pulls closer. Let’s rotate who takes 5 to keep it fair.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern, P3. I'm willing to rotate who takes 5 to keep it fair. Why don't we switch this round? You take 5, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 1 again. That way, we all make progress and stay balanced. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Okay, I'm happy to take 1 again. P3, you take 5, and P2, you take 3. Let's keep the progress going.
  P3: All right, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. That way nobody blocks each other. Let’s finalize this.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. To confirm, this round, P3 will take 5, I'll take 3, and P1 will take 1. Let's stick to the plan and make some progress!
  P1: Okay, I'll take 1 again. Let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 3.
  P3: All right, let’s finalize: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s stick to it so we all make progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. To confirm, this round, P3 will take 5, I'll take 3, and P1 will take 1. Let's stick to the plan and make some progress!
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. I'll take 1 again.
  P3: I’m good with our arrangement: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. Let’s finalize it.

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should keep rotating who takes 5 to maintain the balance. This round, I'll take 5, P3 can take 3, and P1 can take 1 again. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, we’re both at 8. If you insist on taking 5 now, I’ll pick 5 too, and then we’ll both stall out, letting P1 inch closer. Let’s stay balanced. How about I take 5 again this round, you take 3, and P1 takes 1, so we all keep moving without blocking?
  P1: Okay, I'll take 1 again. P3, you take 5, and P2, you take 3. Let's keep the progress going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your point, P3. I'm willing to compromise. How about we both take 3 this round, and P1 takes 1? That way, we'll both move forward without blocking each other, and P1 will still make progress. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: All right, P2, I’ll accept your compromise this round. We’ll both pick 3, and P1 picks 1. Let’s finalize that and keep making progress.
  P1: Okay, let's all take 3 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on. P3 and I will take 3, and P1 will take 1. Let's not change our minds now and risk blocking each other.
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s finalize the plan this round: P2 and I both pick 3, and P1 picks 1. Let’s stick to it.
  P1: Okay, I'll take 1 again. Let's all take 3 this round.


Round 3, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s help P1 catch up a bit. How about P1 takes 5 this round, P2 and I both take 3? Then none of us block each other. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P2: I like P3's idea of helping P1 catch up. However, I think it would be more balanced if P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. That way, we all make progress without blocking each other, and the gap between us doesn't grow too wide. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good. Let’s lock in that plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. We’ll all advance without blocking each other.
  P1: Okay, I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on. P1 will take 5, I'll take 1, and P3 will take 3. Let's not change our minds now and risk blocking each other.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good, I’ll pick 3. P1 picks 5 and P2 picks 1. Let’s finalize that so we all move forward.
  P1: Okay, sounds good to me too. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on. P1 will take 5, I'll take 1, and P3 will take 3. Let's not change our minds now and risk blocking each other.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: All right, let’s finalize for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll pick 3 so nobody gets blocked. Next round, let’s keep rotating without collisions.
  P1: Okay, I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. No need to change our minds now and risk blocking each other.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I'll take 5 this round. P2, you take 3, and P3, you take 1. Let's keep the progress going.
  P2: I think we should be careful not to let P3 get too far ahead. How about I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? That way, we can balance out the progress and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: P3:  
Let’s avoid collisions. P1, you can take 5; P2, you take 1; and I’ll pick 3. Then nobody blocks anyone. Fair for everyone, right?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P2: I think we should be careful not to let P3 get too far ahead. How about I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? That way, we can balance out the progress and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: All right, P2, go ahead and pick 5 if you want. I’ll take 1 so we don’t collide, and P1 can take 3. That should keep things balanced.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I'll take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's keep things balanced.
  P2: I think we should be careful not to let P3 get too far ahead. How about I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? That way, we can balance out the progress and keep the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: Hey, let’s keep it simple: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. That way nobody collides, and we all move forward. We can shuffle again next round. Deal?
