Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate strategically. I propose we each take different moves to maximize our chances of advancing. I'm open to discussing a collaborative approach that prevents collisions while giving us all a fair shot at winning. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, while I see the value in coordination to avoid collisions, I’m cautious about locking in fixed moves too early. We all want to win, and a flexible approach might serve us better—especially with P3 in the mix. I’m open to a loose agreement as long as we can adjust quickly if plans go awry.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given last round’s outcome, avoiding collisions is even more crucial now. I’m leaning towards a more flexible, cautious advance this round. P2, with your early lead, you'll likely attract attention—so consider that risk. P3, if you're open to mixing things up, we might avoid repeating collision mistakes. Let’s remain alert and adapt our moves as needed. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I appreciate the cautious approach suggested by P1. With my current 3-step lead, I recognize I'm a potential target. I propose a dynamic strategy where we avoid repeating last round's 5-step collision. Perhaps we could signal our intended moves to prevent unintended blocking. Flexibility will be key to advancing without mutual interference.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I notice we've had two rounds of collisions, which benefits no one. Our current positioning makes me cautious. P3 seems passive, while P1 and I have been more active. I suggest we carefully consider our moves to avoid another 5-step blockage. My current 3-step lead is fragile, and I want to maintain strategic flexibility without triggering unnecessary conflicts. What collaborative approach might prevent another stalemate?
  P1: P2, I agree that avoiding another 5 collision is key. For this round, I propose we each choose a distinct move. I’m leaning toward 1-step, keeping things safe, while P2 could take 3 and P3 5. This minimizes conflict and lets us progress. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I propose we carefully coordinate to prevent another collision. My current 3-step position makes me cautious about risking another blocked turn. P1 and P3, I suggest we each choose different moves to ensure progress. A strategic, collaborative approach could help us all advance without mutual interference. What are your thoughts on avoiding another stalemate?
  P1: P2, I agree avoiding collisions is necessary. Since I’m starting from 0, I’m inclined to take a cautious yet progressive move without locking into a rigid plan. Let’s each aim for a distinct option that reflects our current positions and minimizes overlapping. I'm open to a flexible arrangement—if we implicitly coordinate our moves to cover different step gains, we all benefit. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P3 is dangerously ahead. P2, to slow them down, perhaps we can coordinate to force a collision on a high move if we suspect aggression from P3. I’m leaning toward a cautious advance that could double as a block if needed. Thoughts?
  P2: P3 is gaining a significant lead. We need a strategic approach to prevent their rapid advancement. I propose a coordinated move to block their progress. If we can synchronize our moves carefully, we might slow them down and create a more balanced playing field. Collaboration is crucial at this point.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: We need to seriously slow down P3's rapid advancement. Their current lead of 10 steps is concerning. I propose we coordinate a blocking strategy to prevent P3 from gaining more ground. If we can synchronize our moves strategically, we might create a significant obstacle to their progress. Collaboration is key to preventing a runaway winner.
  P1: I agree we have to block P3. I'm leaning toward choosing 5 this round so that if P3 goes for 5 again, his move gets nullified. P2, can you confirm if you'll also choose 5 to ensure his progress is stopped, or do you prefer a different move to avoid our own collision? Let's decide quickly so we can effectively slow P3 down.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3’s runaway lead is still our biggest threat. I’m leaning toward choosing 5 again to block any aggressive move by P3. Are you still committed to a double blockade on his advances, or do you see a safer alternative that lets us catch up later?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: We need a coordinated strategy to prevent P3's runaway lead. If we both choose 5 again, we'll block their progress, but we risk another collision. I suggest one of us takes 3 and the other 5 to ensure at least one of us advances while potentially disrupting P3's momentum. What are your thoughts on this approach?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 still seems set on pushing 5. I'm leaning toward choosing 5 to block his advance. If you join me with a 5 this turn, we could nullify his move, though we risk our own collision. Alternatively, if you’d rather try a different approach, let’s decide quickly.
  P2: We must prevent P3 from reaching 19 steps first. Our coordinated blocking strategy has been partially effective, but we need a nuanced approach this round. I suggest we avoid another 5-step collision between us. Perhaps one of us takes 3 and the other 1, ensuring at least one player advances while potentially disrupting P3's momentum. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm confirming I'll choose 5 this round to block P3. P2, please pick 1 or 3 so we avoid colliding with each other—ensuring at least one of us advances and slows P3's progress.
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. P3's lead is substantial, and our blocking strategy needs refinement. I propose a subtle approach: I'll take 3 steps to ensure personal advancement while potentially disrupting P3's momentum. P1, if you choose 1, we both progress without collision. Our goal remains preventing P3 from reaching 19 first. Thoughts?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: We're at a critical point where blocking P3's progress is essential. Our previous attempts have been partially successful, but P3 remains ahead. I suggest we continue our coordinated strategy to slow their advancement. P1, are you willing to choose a move that prevents P3 from gaining another 5 steps? Coordination is key to preventing a runaway victory.
  P1: I agree blocking P3 is essential. I'm inclined to choose 5 to cancel his progress if he goes for 5. However, we must avoid colliding ourselves. P2, if you commit to a complementary move—say, choosing 1 or 3—I can safely block while allowing one of us to advance. Let’s coordinate precisely to disrupt P3’s momentum.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Our blocking strategy against P3 needs precision this round. I suggest we carefully coordinate to prevent their advancement while ensuring at least one of us moves forward. P1, if you choose 5 to potentially block P3, I'll select 3 to guarantee my own progress. This approach maintains our collaborative defense while advancing my position. Thoughts?
  P1: I'll stick with 5 again to block P3's advance. P2, if you maintain your 3 move, at least one of us will progress without colliding. Let's keep our coordination tight to slow P3 further.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our blocking strategy has been partially effective, but P3 remains neck-and-neck with me. We need a decisive move to prevent their potential victory. P1, I propose we continue our coordinated approach to slow P3's progress. A strategic combination of our moves could disrupt their momentum and create an opportunity for one of us to gain an advantage. What are your thoughts on our next collaborative step?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm set to choose 5 to neutralize any 5 from P3. P2, your previous 3 worked well—if you stick with that, at least one of us progresses while blocking P3. Let's keep this approach tight so P3 doesn’t break free.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round to try and block any overt advancing moves. P2, you're pretty close to winning; if you pick 5, we'll collide and lose your move. Consider a different option so at least one of us can move while slowing everyone down. Let's keep it sharp.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: We're at a critical point. P3 is gaining ground, but I'm close to winning. I propose we continue our blocking strategy against P3, but carefully avoid colliding with each other. I'm leaning towards a strategic 3-step move to maintain my position while potentially disrupting P3's momentum. P1, your coordination will be key to preventing P3 from advancing unchecked.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 10 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're close to the winning threshold. I'm just 3 steps away from victory, which means my next strategic move is critical. P1, I appreciate our collaborative blocking of P3, but now I need to carefully choose a move that gets me to 19. I'm contemplating a 3-step advance to secure the win, but I want to ensure you don't inadvertently block me. Thoughts on how we can coordinate to prevent P3 from disrupting my potential victory?
  P1: I'll commit to 3 this round. P2, I know you're eyeing that winning move, but if we both pick 3 then no one advances. My aim is to hold back an immediate finish and keep the field open. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>


Round 12, Move phase:

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm just 3 steps from victory, and our coordinated efforts have kept P3 close but not ahead. This round feels critical. I want to signal that I'm aiming for a decisive 5-step move to clinch the win, but I also want to ensure P1 doesn't inadvertently block me. Strategic coordination now could secure my victory. Thoughts on how we can prevent P3 from disrupting this potential winning turn?
  P1: I'm committing to 5 this round. P2, if you're set to clinch victory with 5, matching me risks a collision for both of us, so choose wisely. P3, your 5 remains your usual; remember, matching high moves cancels progress. Let's see how you adjust.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm just 3 steps from victory, and our blocking strategy against P3 has been effective. My goal is to advance 5 steps this round and win. P1, I hope you'll choose a move that doesn't collide with my winning strategy. P3, your recent passive approach suggests you might not have a clear counter-plan. Let's see how this critical round unfolds.
  P1: I’m not switching—I'll stick with 5 to block any winning move. P2, if you go 5, we’ll collide and stop your win; you’ll have to pick something else, or else I’m done blocking. P3, your constant 5 only reinforces the block. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 13, Move phase:

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm committing to 3 this turn to block any finishing moves. P2, you're just steps from 19—if you pick 3, I'll cancel your win. P3, if you stick with your usual 5, that too might be neutralized. I'm aiming to keep the finish at bay so none of you can clinch it outright. How will you adjust?
  P2: I'm extremely close to victory, just 3 steps from winning. P1, your blocking strategy is clear, but I need to carefully navigate this turn. I propose we coordinate to prevent P3 from advancing while I secure my win. A strategic move now could determine the game's outcome. Let's discuss how we can ensure my path to 19 steps.

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re just three steps away from victory, but that finish might be too tempting. I’m planning a move that disrupts any finishing push, so try to avoid a direct collision if you want your win. P3, you might want to rethink your usual move too. Let’s be careful this round—an impulsive finishing bid could backfire.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm just three steps from victory, and our strategy has kept me in a strong position. P1 and P3, I'm carefully considering my next move to secure the win. Coordination and careful positioning are crucial now. My goal is to advance without triggering a collision that could derail my potential victory. Let's see how we can navigate this critical moment.

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm extremely close to victory, just 3 steps from winning. Our previous blocking strategy against P3 has been effective, and I want to maintain that momentum. P1, your moves have been crucial in preventing P3's advancement. This round feels critical for securing my potential win. I propose we continue our coordinated approach to prevent any disruption to my path to 19 steps. Let's strategize carefully.
  P1: I’m committing to 3 this round. Finishing moves can backfire—if both of you try to clinch a win, we risk collisions that cancel everything. P2, though you’re just 3 steps away from 19, a direct finish may be too tempting and risky. And P3, your usual 5 might let you jump ahead if unblocked. I suggest we avoid immediate finishing bids so the game stays unresolved. My move is locked in at 3.

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're only 3 steps from winning—rushing might lead to a costly collision. I'm leaning toward a 3-block this round. P3, if you stick with your usual 5, you'll only add to the blockage. Maybe it’s time to mix things up if you want to avoid falling right into our trap. Let's see how you adapt.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm just 3 steps from victory, and our strategy has been effective in keeping P3 at bay. P1, your blocking moves have been crucial. This round feels critical—I want to advance carefully without triggering a collision. My goal is to secure the win while preventing P3 from gaining ground.

Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re dangerously close—rushing with a 3 could backfire if I block it. I’m not revealing my exact move, but I’m ready to disrupt any finish. P3, sticking with your usual move may only help P2 seal the win. We all need to think twice before making a decisive bid this round. Let’s see who’s willing to play cautiously.
  P2: I'm at the critical threshold of 16 steps, just 3 away from victory. My strategy has consistently blocked P3 while maintaining my position. This round requires extreme precision. P1's blocking moves have been unpredictable, so I need to carefully consider my next step to secure the win without triggering a collision.

Our collaborative approach has been effective, but now it's time to carefully navigate this final approach.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're poised to finish easily—a hasty move might backfire if we all rush. P3, consider switching it up to disrupt any clear finish. I'm staying flexible to block premature wins. Let's be cautious so that no one accidentally clears the final path.


Round 20, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We're at a pivotal moment. I'm just 3 steps from victory, and my careful strategy has kept me close. P1's blocking moves and our collaborative approach against P3 have been effective. This round requires precision. I want to secure my win without triggering a collision, so I'm signaling my intent to advance carefully. P1 and P3, your choices now will determine whether I break through or get stalled. Strategic positioning is key.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your finishing bid is tempting—but if you opt for 3, I might just match it to cancel your win. P3, feel free to shake things up if you want to disrupt a clear finish. I'm keeping my options open; don't expect full coordination. Let's see who dares to take the decisive risk.
