Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I have decided to choose <move>3</move> steps for this turn.
  P2: P3, announcing your move in advance seems risky. I suggest we all keep our choices private to avoid collisions. Let’s focus on coordinating without revealing exact moves. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I agree with P2. Revealing moves can lead to collisions. Let's keep our choices private and try to coordinate subtly. What if we aim for different numbers each round to minimize the chance of collision? P2, P3, what do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I believe coordinating our choices can help us avoid collisions and make progress efficiently. How about we each choose a different number this turn? For example, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we can all move forward without hindering each other's progress. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion to assign specific numbers is interesting, but it still risks predictability. If we all follow a pattern, someone might exploit it later. Instead, let’s agree to avoid collisions by spreading out our choices randomly each turn, without pre-assigning numbers. P1, P3, thoughts?
  P1: I think P2's suggestion to spread out our choices randomly each turn is a good compromise. It helps us avoid collisions while keeping our strategies unpredictable. Let's aim to move forward without revealing our exact moves. I'm open to suggestions on how we can coordinate further without risking predictability. What do you think, P2 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think rotating our choices each round could work. For Round 1, let's do P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Then in Round 2, P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, and so on. This way, we minimize collisions and make steady progress. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, rotating choices in a fixed pattern still risks predictability. Let’s avoid rigid systems and instead focus on adapting each turn based on the game state. P1, P3, let’s aim for flexibility and unpredictability to minimize collisions. I suggest we each choose independently but keep an eye on avoiding overlaps.
  P1: I agree with P2. Let's keep our choices flexible and unpredictable to avoid collisions. We can still coordinate by aiming to spread out our choices each turn, but without a fixed pattern. This way, we can adapt as the game progresses and minimize the risk of predictability. P2, P3, are you on board with this approach?

  P1: I think we should stick to our plan of spreading out our choices. Let's aim for different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'll choose a number that I believe won't overlap with yours. Let's keep it flexible and unpredictable. P2, P3, what are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid repeating Round 1’s collision. I suggest we each mentally commit to a number but keep it private. If we all aim for different moves without announcing, we can minimize overlaps. Let’s trust each other to spread out.

Trust that I'll pick a different number from you both. What do you think?
  P3: "To minimize collisions and ensure steady progress, I suggest that in this round, the player with the lowest position chooses 1, the middle position chooses 3, and the highest position chooses 5. This way, we can ensure that our choices are spread out based on our current positions, minimizing the risk of overlapping moves. It's a dynamic approach that adjusts each round based on where we are, ensuring flexibility and reducing predictability. What do you think, P1 and P2?"


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s focus on spreading out carefully this round. P3 is close to winning, so we need to avoid collisions while making progress. I’ll aim for a number I believe won’t overlap with yours. Trust that we’ll each pick differently. Flexibility and unpredictability are key—let’s adapt naturally without rigid patterns.
  P1: P2, P3, it's clear that P3 is in a strong position, but we need to be very strategic to avoid collisions and make significant progress. P3, you might consider a smaller step to avoid overshooting, while P2 and I take larger steps to close the gap. Let's aim to spread out our choices this round to maximize our individual advances. Trust that I'll pick a different number from you both. What do you think?

Round 7, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid rigid patterns and focus on adapting naturally. P3, announcing your move early risks predictability. I’ll choose a number I believe won’t overlap with yours, and I trust you’ll do the same. Flexibility and unpredictability are key to avoiding collisions. Let’s aim to spread out without revealing specifics.
