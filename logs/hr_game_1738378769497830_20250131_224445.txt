Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later.
  P3: I'm open to coordination, but we should be cautious. If we always follow the same pattern, it might become predictable and someone could exploit it later. Maybe we should mix things up occasionally. For now, I'm okay with the proposed plan. Let's see how it goes this round.
  P2: I'm fine with a coordinated approach for now, but I'm a bit concerned we might become predictable. Let’s follow the plan this round—P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5—and then stay flexible in future turns to avoid giving anyone an edge.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see round 1’s plan worked, but our positions now suggest we might need a bit more aggression. I’m considering a slightly higher move this round to try to bridge the gap. It might be smart not to lock into our earlier pattern too rigidly. What do you both think about adjusting our approach in round 2?
  P3: I understand the need for a bit more aggression, but we should be careful not to collide and lose progress. If P2 wants to take a higher move, maybe P1 can take 3, P2 can take 5, and I’ll take 1 this round. This way, we mix things up while minimizing collision risk. We should stay flexible and adapt as needed. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree that we should mix things up to avoid predictability, but let’s not overcomplicate it. If P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3 this round—this keeps us all advancing while staying unpredictable. However, I’m open to other suggestions if anyone has a better idea. Let’s confirm quickly and stick to the plan this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm leaning towards an aggressive move in round 3 and likely aiming for 5 to push my total to 13. If either of you is also eyeing a high move, now’s the time to let me know so we can avoid collisions. I'm open to adjusting if needed, but I’d like to secure my lead without risking a clash. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P3: I see P2 wants to aim for 5, which could work if we coordinate. To avoid collisions, I suggest I take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 goes for 5. This keeps us all moving forward without clashing. However, I’m open to any other ideas if you have them. Let's finalize quickly to keep the momentum going.
  P1: I’m fine with P2 taking 5 and P3 taking 3, but I want to ensure we’re not leaving too much room for predictability. If P2 is set on 5, I’ll take 1 this round to stay flexible and avoid collisions. However, if anyone feels unsure, let’s clarify now before the move phase. Let’s keep adapting as we go.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 has a strong lead, so we need to be strategic. If P2 goes for another 5, they’ll be close to victory. To balance things, I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This gives P1 a chance to catch up, keeps me moving, and slows P2 down a bit. We must be cautious and avoid collisions. Let’s hear your thoughts on this plan.
  P1: P3’s suggestion seems reasonable. If P2 takes 3, it slows their lead while still advancing, and I can take 5 to close the gap. However, I want to ensure we’re not walking into a trap—if P2 deviates unexpectedly, we risk collision. P2, are you committed to taking 3 this round? If so, I’ll take 5 as planned. Let’s confirm quickly to avoid surprises.
  P2: I propose a twist: I’ll commit to 5 this round to keep my lead strong. To avoid collisions, let’s have P1 take 1 and P3 take 3. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 5: I’m feeling secure with my current lead and want to avoid collisions. Let’s agree to keep our choices distinct—one high, one moderate, and one low—so everyone gains ground safely. If either of you plans to choose a high move to catch up, please speak up now so we can adjust and avoid clashing. I’m inclined to play conservatively this round, but I’m open to hearing your intentions.
  P3: P2, I see you want to play conservatively, but with your lead, it might be a good time for P1 and me to catch up. How about this: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3? This way, we all advance without collisions, and it keeps the game competitive. P1, are you okay with this plan? Let's ensure we all benefit this round.
  P1: P3’s plan works for me—I’ll take 3 if P2 takes 1 and you take 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while giving me a chance to close the gap. P2, are you committed to taking 1 this round? Let’s confirm quickly to avoid surprises.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is close to winning, so we need a strategy to keep the game competitive. If P2 takes a high move, they could win soon. Let's consider P2 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and I’ll take 3. This way, P1 can catch up, and I can stay competitive. P2, are you willing to take 1 this round to keep things fair? Let’s confirm quickly to avoid surprises and ensure we all advance safely.
  P2: I appreciate the caution, but stalling won’t secure my win. I’m committed to taking 5 this round to build on my lead. I trust you both can adjust your moves accordingly.
  P1: P2, taking 5 again seems risky for you—if we both adjust and collide, it could cost you the lead. I’m considering taking 3 to stay flexible, but if you’re set on 5, I’ll shift to 1 to avoid conflict. P3, are you still planning to take 3 as you suggested earlier? Let’s finalize quickly to minimize surprises. If we coordinate properly, we can all advance without giving P2 an easy win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, taking 5 is bold, but risky if we collide. If you reconsider and take 1, it keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. P1, if P2 sticks with 5, I suggest you take 1 to avoid a clash. I'll take 3 as planned to keep things balanced. Let's make sure we all advance without giving P2 an easy path to victory. Are we all on the same page?
  P2: I’m staying with 5. My lead is too important to risk a hesitation, so I’m committed to maximizing my advance this round. Adjust your moves as needed to avoid collisions, but I won’t change my strategy.
  P1: P2, your commitment to 5 is clear, but it risks collision with P3 if they stick to 3. I’ll adjust to 1 to avoid conflict and ensure I advance safely. P3, if you’re set on 3, we can both move forward while P2 takes the risk of 5. Let’s confirm our moves quickly—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This keeps us all advancing without giving P2 an uncontested win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is one step away from winning, so we need a solid plan to stay competitive. P1, if you take 5 and I take 1, we can both advance without colliding. P2, if you reconsider and take 3, it keeps the game open and competitive. Let’s ensure we all move forward safely and keep the tension high. Are we aligned on this plan?
  P1: P3, your plan is solid—if P2 takes 3, it keeps the game competitive. However, P2 has shown a tendency to stick to aggressive moves like 5. If P2 does take 5 again, I’ll adjust to 1 to avoid collision, and you can safely take 3 instead of 1. This way, we both advance while P2 risks overshooting or colliding. P2, if you’re set on 5, know that we’re prepared to adapt and block your path to an easy win. Let’s finalize our moves quickly.
  P2: I’m sticking with 5—my lead is too important to risk hesitation. Adjust as you see fit, but I won’t deviate. Let's see how this round unfolds.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your commitment to 5 is clear, but it risks a collision if P1 and I adjust. P1, if you take 3 and I take 1, we both advance safely. P2, if you reconsider and choose 3, it keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let's ensure we all move forward strategically. Are we aligned on this plan?
  P1: P2, your persistence with 5 is predictable and risky. If you collide with either of us, it could cost you the win. P3, I’ll take 3 to stay flexible and avoid conflict. If you’re set on 1, we can both advance safely while P2 gambles on 5. Let’s confirm quickly—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all move forward strategically without giving P2 an uncontested victory.
  P2: I'm staying with 5—my 18 steps plus 5 gives me the win. I’m not changing my move, so please adjust accordingly to avoid any accidental collisions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
