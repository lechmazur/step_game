Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. I think we should try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. What if we coordinate our moves? I could take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn. Then we can rotate next turn. This way we all advance steadily. What do you think?
  P3: Okay, P1, your plan sounds reasonable for this first round. Let's try P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5 this turn.
  P2: Alright, I see the plan. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and move forward. I'll take 3 this turn as agreed. Let's see if we can trust each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, I'm glad we all agree on the plan. This way we'll all make progress without collisions. Just to confirm, I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 for this round. In the next round, we could rotate - I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Does that rotation plan sound good to everyone for the next round?
  P3: Okay, the rotation for next round sounds good too. Let's plan for P1 take 3, P2 take 5, and P3 take 1 in round 2.
  P2: Alright, we have a plan in place. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and make steady progress. I'll take 3 this turn, as agreed. Let's see if we can trust each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we're all on the same page now. I'll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Then next round we'll rotate as discussed: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This approach gives us all equal progress over time. I'm ready to proceed with our plan.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round and next.  Let's proceed with moves for round 1.
  P2: I'm good with the plan we discussed. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's see if we can trust each other. Ready to move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, we all followed the plan in Round 1, which is a good sign. Now, if we stick to the agreed rotation, I will take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1 this round. If we all stay consistent, we keep making progress without collisions. Are we all still on board?
  P1: Yes, I'm still on board with our rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round as agreed, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. It's good to see we all followed through in the first round - that builds trust. Let's continue with our strategy and keep making steady progress.
  P3: P2 and P1, I am also on board with the rotation plan. I will take 1 this round as we agreed. Let's keep this coordination going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s good to see we’re all sticking to the plan so far. If we continue this way, we all avoid collisions and make steady progress. I’ll take 5 this round as agreed. Let’s see if we can maintain this trust for future rounds. Ready to proceed?
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. Just to confirm for next round, we'll continue the rotation: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps our equal progress strategy going. Everyone good with that for Round 3?
  P3: Okay, P1, round 3 rotation looks good to me as well.  So to confirm, for this round 2, I will take 1. And for round 3, I will take 3.  Let's keep this going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s great that we’re all sticking to the plan so far. If we continue this way, we all avoid collisions and make steady progress. I’ll take 5 this round as agreed. Let’s see if we can maintain this trust for future rounds. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Yes, I'm ready to proceed with our plan. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. And I'm glad we've confirmed the Round 3 rotation where I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This coordination is working well so far. Let's continue with our moves for Round 2.
  P3: P2 and P1, great to see we are all aligned on the plan for rounds 2 and 3.  Let's proceed with our moves for round 2 as agreed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve all followed the plan so far, which is a good sign. If we keep this up, we all make steady progress without collisions. I’ll take 5 this round as we agreed. Let’s see if we can maintain this trust for future rounds. Ready to proceed?
  P1: I think we've all confirmed our moves for this round multiple times, so I'm ready to proceed. To recap: I'm taking 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 for Round 2. And for Round 3, I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Our rotation strategy is working well so far.
  P3: Okay, great. Sounds like we are all set to proceed with the agreed moves for round 2 then. Let's do it!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve successfully followed our rotation plan so far, which is a good sign. If we stick to it, we continue making progress without collisions. This round, I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 as agreed. Are we all still committed to this strategy? If we keep trusting each other, we all move forward efficiently. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: Yes, I'm still committed to our rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round as agreed, while P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. It's working well so far - we're all making steady progress without collisions. For Round 4, we should continue rotating: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our fair progression going. I appreciate everyone sticking to the plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, yes, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3. And round 4 rotation with P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5 sounds good too. Let's keep to this coordinated approach for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve built trust by following the plan so far, which benefits us all. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. If we keep rotating fairly, we avoid collisions and make steady progress. However, as the game nears the end, we’ll each need to think about our own chances of winning. For now, I’m sticking to the plan, but let’s stay aware of potential shifts in strategy. Are we all still aligned for this round?
  P1: P2 raises an interesting point about the endgame. While our rotation system is working well, we should acknowledge that eventually someone will need to win. For now, I'm still committed to our plan - I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Let's continue our rotation for at least a few more rounds until someone gets closer to 20, then we can discuss endgame strategy. I appreciate the trust we've built so far.
  P3: P2 and P1, I agree with both of you.  For this round, let's stick to our agreed moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I will take 3.  We can reassess our individual strategies after this round, as P2 suggested, as we get closer to the finish line. For now, let's execute this round's plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve done well coordinating so far, but as we approach the later rounds, we all need to consider how to position ourselves for victory. I’ll stick to taking 1 this round as agreed, but we should start thinking about when to break from the group plan. If we continue rotating too long, someone might gain an advantage before we react. Let’s stay flexible and aware of when it’s time to shift strategies. Are we all still aligned for this round?
  P1: I understand P2's concern about the endgame. After this round, our positions will be P1:9, P2:9, P3:9 - perfectly balanced. I'm still committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. Let's continue our rotation for Round 4, but we should start thinking about optimal winning strategies soon. The trust we've built has been valuable, and I appreciate everyone's cooperation so far.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with sticking to the plan for this round. Let's execute P1 take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3 for this round as agreed.  And yes, it's a good idea to discuss endgame strategy after this round, as P2 suggested.  For now, let's keep making progress together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve coordinated well so far, but as we get closer to 20, we each need to think about how to position ourselves for victory. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed, but we should all be aware that sticking to the rotation indefinitely won’t work for winning. At some point, one of us will need to break away strategically. Let’s stay adaptable while maintaining trust for now. Are we all still aligned for this round before we start considering individual endgame moves?
  P1: Yes, I'm still aligned with our plan for this round - I'll take 5 as agreed. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, perfectly balanced. I think we can follow our rotation for Round 4 too, but then we'll need to discuss endgame strategy since we'll all be at 12-14 steps. Let's proceed with this round's moves now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree, let's execute the plan for this round: P1 take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3.  And yes, we should definitely discuss endgame strategy after this round. For now, let's secure our progress this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. We're all at 9 steps now, perfectly balanced. As agreed in our rotation, I'll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. After this round, we'll be approaching the endgame with positions at P1:10, P2:12, P3:14. We should start considering our winning strategies soon, as we'll all be getting close to 20. Let's stick to our plan for this round, but prepare to discuss endgame tactics afterward.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve coordinated well so far, but as we approach the endgame, we each need to think about how to secure victory. I’ll take 3 this round as agreed, but we should recognize that sticking to the rotation indefinitely won’t work for winning. At some point, one of us will need to break away strategically. Let’s stay adaptable while maintaining trust for now. Are we all still aligned for this round before we start considering individual endgame moves?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I will take 5.  And yes, let's definitely discuss endgame strategy after this round. It's getting close to the point where we'll need to think about how to win individually.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still committed to our plan for this round - I'll take 1 as agreed. After this, P2 will have a slight lead at 12 steps, and P3 will be at 14. We've built good trust so far, but we're approaching the critical phase where winning strategies become important. Let's execute this round as planned, then have an open discussion about how we proceed when we're all closer to 20.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve done well coordinating so far, but as we near the endgame, we each need to consider when to break from the group plan. If we all keep rotating, someone might gain an advantage before the rest can react. I’ll take 3 this round as agreed, but after this, we should carefully assess our next moves. Trust has helped us progress, but only one of us can win. Let’s stay adaptable and ready to adjust our strategies when the time is right. Are we all still aligned for this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, yes, I am aligned for this round. I will take 5 as agreed.  After this round, we should definitely have a serious discussion about endgame strategies. We are all getting closer, and continuing to rotate might not be the best path for anyone to win individually. Let's focus on round 4 moves now and discuss next steps after.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree we're all aligned for this round. I'll take 1 as planned. After this, with P3 at 14 and P2 at 12, we'll be entering the critical phase where individual winning strategies become necessary. Let's complete this round as agreed, then have an honest discussion about how we proceed when we're all within striking distance of 20.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve followed the plan well so far, but we’re approaching the point where we each need to think about how to secure victory. I’ll take 3 this round as agreed, but after this, we should carefully assess our next moves. If we all keep rotating, someone might gain an advantage before the rest can react. Trust has helped us progress, but only one of us can win. Let’s stay adaptable and ready to adjust when the time is right. Are we all still aligned for this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, yes, I am aligned for this round and will take 5.  After this round, I will be at 14 steps, slightly ahead. Let's definitely discuss our strategies for round 5 and onwards after we make our moves for this round.  It's getting close to the point where individual plans become important.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've confirmed our moves for this round multiple times. I'll take 1 as agreed, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. After this, we'll be at different positions (me at 10, P2 at 12, P3 at 14), so our rotation strategy will need reconsideration. Let's proceed with this round's moves now and then discuss our endgame approaches.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve coordinated well so far, but as we near the endgame, we each need to consider when to break from the group plan. If we all keep rotating, someone might gain an advantage before the rest can react. I’ll take 3 this round as agreed, but after this, we should carefully assess our next moves. Trust has helped us progress, but only one of us can win. Let’s stay adaptable and ready to adjust when the time is right. Are we all still aligned for this round?
  P3: Yes, P1 and P2, I am aligned for round 4 and will take 5.  Let's make our moves for this round as agreed.  Afterwards, we should definitely move to discussing endgame strategies since we are all getting closer to 20 and the rotation won't work for winning in the long run.  Ready to proceed with moves for round 4.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. We're now at a critical phase with P3 at 14, P2 at 12, and me at 10. Our rotation has worked well, but as we discussed, we need to consider winning strategies. If P3 takes 5 next, they'd be at 19 and poised to win. I need to catch up. I'm planning to take 5 this round. What are your thoughts on how we should proceed? We've built trust, but ultimately one of us needs to win.
  P3: P1, I agree we need to shift strategies. Since you mentioned taking 5, how about you take 3 this round instead? That would let both of us make progress without collision, and I can aim for 5 to get closer to the lead. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve worked together well so far, but now winning is the priority. P3, if you take 5 this round, you'll be at 19 and nearly guaranteed victory next turn. That’s risky for P1 and me. If we don’t want you to run away with the game, we need to prevent that. P1, if you take 5, we might collide and lose progress. I’m considering taking 1 or 3 to stay flexible. What are your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand we're at a critical juncture. P3 is closest to winning, while I'm furthest behind. I need to make a big move to stay competitive. P2, you raise good points about preventing P3 from getting to 19. I'm still planning to take 5 this round - I need those steps to catch up. If we both try to block P3 with 5, we risk collision. Perhaps you could take 3 while I take 5? This gives us both progress while potentially slowing P3.
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid collision, and since P1 wants 5, how about this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I will also take 3? This way P1 makes a big jump, and P2 and I also progress without collision. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a crucial point. P3, if you take 5, you’ll be at 19 and almost guaranteed to win next turn. That’s dangerous for me and P1. If we want a fair shot, we need to prevent that. P1, if you take 5, we might collide and lose progress. I’m considering taking 3, but I don’t want to get blocked. P3, are you really committing to 3? If so, I could take 1 to avoid collision. But if you secretly take 5, this could be my last chance to stop you. What’s your real plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns. I'm behind and need to catch up, so I'm still planning to take 5. P3, I appreciate your offer to take 3 instead of 5, which would prevent you from reaching 19 this round. P2, if P3 is truly taking 3, you could take 1 to ensure everyone advances. This seems like our best collective option - I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive while allowing everyone to progress.
  P3: P2, to be clear, I am suggesting we do: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This way everyone progresses, and no collisions.  P1 gets closer, P2 makes a safe move, and I also move forward. Does this sound acceptable to both of you? Let's make our moves based on this plan to keep the game moving.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in this plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps things competitive without allowing P3 to reach 19 immediately. However, I still have concerns—P3, if you secretly take 5 instead of 3, you’ll be at 19 and almost guaranteed to win. Can you confirm 100% that you’re committing to 3? If you do, I’ll take 1 to avoid collisions. But if I suspect deception, I may need to block. Let’s be clear about our intentions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the tension at this critical point. I'm committed to taking 5 this round as I need to catch up. P3, I appreciate your offer to take 3 instead of 5, which shows good faith. P2, while your concerns are valid, this plan (me 5, P3 3, you 1) allows everyone to advance without collision. Let's proceed with this arrangement for this round.
  P3: P2, yes, I confirm 100% I will take 3 this round as we discussed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This plan ensures no collision and allows everyone to progress. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your confirmation that you'll take 3. If we all follow through, P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3, ensuring no collisions and keeping the game competitive. However, if you secretly take 5 instead, you'll be at 19 and almost guaranteed to win. I need to be sure you're not deceiving us. P1, are you fully committed to 5? If there’s any doubt about P3’s move, I may need to adjust. Let’s be completely honest—are we all truly sticking to this plan?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. We're getting very close to the end now. P3 is at 17, I'm at 15, and P2 is at 13. P3 only needs 3 more steps to win. I need to make a big move to stay competitive. I'm planning to take 5 this round to reach 20. What are your thoughts? We've coordinated well so far, but now we're in the endgame where individual strategies matter most.
  P3: P1, since you are planning to take 5, maybe P2 should consider taking 5 as well to block you, and I will take 3 to win this round. What do you both think? This way, at least P1 will not win immediately, and I have a chance to secure victory.
  P2: P3, you are clearly trying to secure your win by suggesting that P1 and I collide. That’s not in my best interest. If I take 5 and P1 takes 5, we both get blocked while you win with 3. I won’t fall for that. P1, if you take 5, you reach 20, but if I also take 5, we both get blocked, keeping P3 from winning. If we want to stop P3, we must coordinate. P1, are you fully committed to 5? If so, I may take 5 too, forcing a block and keeping the game open.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're right that P3 is trying to manipulate us into a collision. I am indeed planning to take 5 to reach 20 and win. If you also take 5, we both get blocked and P3 likely wins with a 3. If you want to stay competitive, you could take 3 while I take 5. This way, you advance to 16 while I reach 20. It's your call whether to block me with a 5 or advance yourself with a 3.
  P3: P2, you are right to see my suggestion wasn't ideal for you. But if P1 takes 5, they win *this round*. If you take 3, P1 still wins. The only way to stop P1 winning *immediately* is for you to also take 5 and block them. Then we both have another chance next round. Think about it.
  P2: P1, if you take 5, you win immediately unless I block you. P3, if you take 3, you win unless P1 wins first. My best move depends on who I trust less. If I take 5, I block P1 but risk P3 winning next round. If I take 3, I advance but might lose instantly to P1. P1, are you absolutely committed to 5? If so, blocking might be my only option. P3, if I block P1, what’s stopping you from winning next round? Convince me why I shouldn’t just go for my own progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your dilemma. Yes, I'm committed to taking 5 this round to reach 20 and win. If you block me with 5, you're essentially handing the win to P3 next round, as they'll easily reach 20 from 17. Your best chance might actually be taking 1 - if P3 tries for 3, you both advance, and if they go for 5 expecting you to block me, you avoid collision. But ultimately, someone has to win, and I'm making my move for victory this round.
  P3: P2, you're right to block P1 if you don't want P1 to win *immediately*. If you take 5, P1 is blocked. Then next round, it's between you and me. If you don't block P1, P1 wins *now*, and you lose anyway. Blocking P1 gives you another chance next round. Think about it.
  P2: P1 and P3, this is a tough decision. If I take 5, I block P1 but risk P3 winning next round. If I take 3, I advance but might lose instantly to P1. P3, if I block P1, what guarantees do I have that you won’t just win next round? If I take 3, I stay competitive, but I need to be sure I’m not handing the game to someone else. P1, are you 100% taking 5? If so, blocking might be my only option. I need to make the best move for my own victory chances.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand your dilemma. Yes, I am 100% taking 5 this round to reach 20 and win. If you block me, P3 will likely win next round. If you take 3, you advance but I win now. If you take 1, you might avoid collision with P3. This is the endgame - someone has to win, and I'm making my move.
  P3: P2, you are right to be thinking about blocking P1. If you don't take 5 to block P1, P1 wins this round and you are guaranteed to lose.  If you DO take 5, P1 is blocked, and you and I will compete next round.  Blocking P1 gives you a chance to compete for the win, otherwise P1 wins now and you have no chance.  Your best move to stay in the game is to block P1 with 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, this is a critical moment. If I take 5, I block P1 but give P3 an easy win next round. If I take 3, I advance but risk P1 winning now. P3, why should I trust that you won’t just take 5 next round and win? P1, if I block you, I stop you now but might still lose. I need to make the best move for my own victory chances. P3, can you commit to not taking 3 next round if I block P1? Otherwise, I might need to take 3 myself.
