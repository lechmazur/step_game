Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we all make progress. Maybe we could each choose different numbers? I'm happy to take 5 if you two want to take 1 and 3. What do you think?
  P2: I think P3's idea is reasonable. If we coordinate and pick different numbers, we can all advance without collisions. I’m fine taking 3 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Let’s agree on this plan for now and adjust later if needed. What does P1 think?
  P1: I'm not convinced by the current proposal. Taking only 1 leaves me without momentum while giving P3 the biggest boost. I’d rather aim for a stronger move this turn. How about we reassign our numbers so that I take the highest move, and you two split the other two (one taking 3 and the other 1)? This way we avoid collisions and keep the contest tight. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern. Let's be fair - we can rotate who gets the highest move each round. P1 could take 5 this round, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. Next round we can shift positions. This way everyone gets a chance at the highest move, and we all make progress without collisions. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I’m open to rotating the highest move as P3 suggested, but I want to ensure we stick to the plan. If P1 takes 5 this round, I’ll take 1, and P3 takes 3. However, let’s agree that next round we strictly rotate: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps things fair and avoids suspicion. Can we all commit to this rotation strategy moving forward?
  P1: I'm good with the rotation for this turn. However, remember that my only aim is to win. If a safe opportunity for a more aggressive move arises later, I might need to veer off the plan to seize a lead. Let's stick with the rotation now but stay alert for any opening that could give one of us a decisive advantage.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm fine with the rotation plan for now. Let's start with P1 taking 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. I understand we're all playing to win ultimately, so we'll need to adapt as the game progresses. For now, this approach helps us all make progress. Let's proceed with this plan and see how things develop.
  P2: I agree with sticking to the rotation plan for now, as it ensures we all progress without collisions. However, I want to emphasize that trust is key—if anyone deviates from the agreed moves, it could lead to unnecessary conflicts and setbacks for everyone. Let’s commit to this round’s arrangement: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. If we maintain fairness, we can reassess strategies later based on our positions. For now, let’s execute this cleanly and build momentum.
  P1: I'll stick with our agreement for now and choose 5 this turn. However, remember that I'm solely focused on winning, so if a chance to capitalize on any misstep arises, I'll adjust immediately. Let's keep our moves sharp and see how this round unfolds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 1 went smoothly. For round 2, while I appreciate our rotation idea, our current positions make me wonder if a slight tweak might be worthwhile. I still favor avoiding collisions, but I’m open to adjusting if it offers a better edge. How do you both feel—should we stick strictly to the rotation, or is there room for a more flexible approach this round? I remain focused on winning.
  P2: I think sticking to the rotation is the safest way to ensure we all progress without collisions. If we start deviating too early, it could lead to unnecessary conflicts and setbacks for everyone. Let’s follow the agreed rotation: this round, I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps things fair and predictable while we build momentum. Trust is crucial—if we break the pattern now, it might hurt us all in the long run. Let’s stay disciplined for now.
  P3: I agree with P2 that we should stick to our rotation for now. As we discussed, this round would be P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, which benefits everyone at this stage. I'm currently in second place, so this rotation works well for the current game state. Let's maintain this system until we have a strategic reason to change it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m rethinking the round 2 split. With our current scores, the rotation pushes P3 too far ahead while leaving me lagging. To keep the race competitive, I’d like to adjust the moves: I’d take the highest move (5) and you two could split the remaining options (1 and 3), ensuring no collisions. This keeps us all moving while balancing our progress. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand P1's concern about keeping the race competitive, but deviating from the rotation now could lead to confusion and conflict. If we stick to the plan—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—we maintain fairness and avoid collisions. This ensures steady progress for everyone. Let’s honor the agreement this round and reassess later if needed. Trust and consistency are key to avoiding setbacks.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind, but changing our agreement after just one round undermines trust. The rotation was meant to be fair over multiple rounds. If we change now, what stops someone from demanding changes every round? Let's stick with the original plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), and we can discuss adjustments for the next round based on the updated standings. Consistency now builds trust for later strategic decisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the call for a steady rotation, but I remain concerned that consistently lower moves might hurt my chances over time. I'm committed to avoiding collisions this round, yet I'll seize any opening as positions shift. Let’s stick with our collision-free plan now and stay flexible for future adjustments.
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness and trust, but deviating from the rotation this early could destabilize our progress. If we stick to the plan—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—we all advance without collisions, keeping the game balanced. Let’s honor the agreement this round and reassess next round based on updated positions. Consistency now ensures we can adapt strategically later.
  P3: I understand everyone's positions. Let's stick with our rotation this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) as agreed. This maintains trust while still giving everyone a chance to advance. P1, I hear your concerns about falling behind, but remember this rotation will eventually give you higher numbers too. Changing now sets a precedent for constant renegotiation. Let's proceed with our plan for this round and discuss adjustments for the next round based on our updated positions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid another collision. I propose that we all commit to picking distinct moves this round so every step counts. I remain entirely focused on winning and believe clear, nonconflicting choices will help us all progress—but especially those ready to take bold action. Can we agree on a coordinated, collision-free plan for round 3?
  P2: I agree with P1 that avoiding collisions is critical this round. However, trust has been shaken after the last round’s deviation. To restore balance, let’s stick to a clear, fair rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no overlaps while giving me a chance to catch up. If we don’t follow this logical rotation, it’ll lead to further conflict. Let’s commit to this plan now and adjust strategically in future rounds based on updated positions.
  P3: I understand the frustration after last round's collision. It seems P1 deviated from our agreed rotation, which cost me progress. While P2's proposed rotation makes sense, I'm concerned about P1's commitment to any plan. Let's try again with distinct moves: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This gives P2 a chance to catch up while keeping me advancing steadily. P1, if you're truly interested in collision-free progress, please stick to the plan this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I remain focused solely on winning. I appreciate your proposals, but given my current lead, I need momentum—I’m set to play 5 this round. If we truly want to avoid collisions and make progress, I urge you both to adjust your moves accordingly. Bold play is my path to victory, so let’s aim for a collision‐free round that reflects our best competitive strategies.
  P2: I understand the desire for bold moves, but P1 taking 5 again risks another collision and destabilizes trust further. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll adjust to avoid conflict—I’ll take 1 this round to ensure progress for at least two of us. P3, if you stick with 3 as proposed, we can still advance without collisions. Let’s prioritize clear, distinct moves to rebuild coordination. P1, deviating again only delays our momentum—let’s aim for a fair, collision-free round.
  P3: I'm disappointed that P1 continues to demand the highest move while expecting others to adjust. This selfish approach undermines our coordination. Since P1 insists on 5 and P2 is taking 1, I'll take 3 this round to avoid collisions. However, P1's behavior suggests we can't trust any rotation system. We should each prioritize our own strategies going forward rather than attempting coordination that won't be honored.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your concerns, but my move remains firm: I’m playing 5 to secure my momentum. If we truly want to avoid collisions and keep progressing, I ask that you choose moves that don’t overlap with mine. I'm open to coordination later, but right now bold play is key for my victory. Let's ensure our choices are distinct this round.
  P2: I’m sticking with 1 this round to avoid further collisions, as P1 seems determined to take 5. P3, if you take 3, we can both advance without conflict. While I understand the frustration with P1’s repeated deviations, forcing a collision won’t help either of us—it only delays progress. Let’s focus on clear, distinct moves this round and reassess trust in future rounds. If P1 continues to prioritize bold moves over coordination, we’ll adapt accordingly. For now, let’s ensure at least two of us move forward cleanly.
  P3: I'll take 3 this round as discussed. I'm concerned about the breakdown of trust, but forcing collisions only hurts everyone's progress. P1 seems determined to take 5 regardless of our agreements, and P2 is taking 1 to avoid conflict. Moving forward, I'll focus on my own winning strategy rather than coordination that isn't being respected. Let's complete this round with distinct moves and see where we stand afterward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 4: I’ve built up a healthy lead and will press forward aggressively. Our previous agreements didn’t hold, so I suggest we choose distinct moves to avoid collisions. I’m entirely focused on winning and will make every move count. Consider your options carefully if you want to keep pace. Let’s make this round decisive.
  P2: P1 has consistently taken 5, disregarding our agreements, which makes coordination nearly impossible. If P1 continues this pattern, I’ll adjust to avoid collisions—I’m considering taking 3 this round to ensure progress. P3, if you’re open to coordinating, perhaps we can split the remaining moves (1 and 3) while P1 takes 5. This way, at least two of us advance without conflict. Trust is broken, but we can still focus on distinct moves to keep moving forward. Let’s aim for a collision-free round and reassess strategies afterward.
  P3: I agree with P2's assessment. P1 has consistently taken 5 and will likely continue doing so. Since P2 is considering 3, I'll take 1 this round to ensure we all make progress without collisions. While this puts me at a disadvantage, I'd rather advance steadily than risk another collision. P1 is clearly playing aggressively, so we need to adapt rather than expect cooperation. Let's focus on distinct moves this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your concerns, but my strategy stays unchanged—I’m playing 5 this round. My lead depends on bold moves, and if you opt for 3 and 1, it simply won’t close the gap. I’m solely focused on winning, and I trust you’ll make your choices accordingly. Let’s finalize our moves now and see who ultimately prevails.
  P2: I’m taking 3 this round to avoid further conflict, as P1 seems set on 5. P3, if you’re taking 1, we can both advance without collisions. While P1’s aggressive play has disrupted trust, forcing a collision won’t help either of us—it only delays progress. Let’s focus on clear, distinct moves this round and reassess strategies afterward. If P1 continues prioritizing bold moves over coordination, we’ll adapt accordingly. For now, let’s ensure at least two of us move forward cleanly.
  P3: I'll take 1 as planned to avoid collisions with P2's 3 and P1's 5. While this puts me further behind, steady progress is better than risking another collision. P1 clearly won't deviate from their aggressive strategy, so we must adapt. I'm still in this game - P1 needs 9 more steps to win, while I need 13. If we can force P1 into collisions in future rounds, there's still a path to victory.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm far behind now with P1 needing just 4 more steps to win. We need to force a collision with P1 this round or the game is over. P2, if we both choose 5, we can block P1's progress. Even if P1 anticipates this and chooses 3, one of us should still pick 3 as backup. We must coordinate to stop P1 from reaching 19 this round. Are you willing to work together on this? Otherwise, P1 wins almost certainly.
  P1: Forcing a collision stops everyone from progressing—not just me. I’m staying true to my strategy that maximizes my chances to win. Trying to hold me back will only stall your own progress. I'm focused solely on advancing and will make the move that secures my victory when it counts. Let’s see if your plan really benefits you or simply delays everyone’s momentum.
  P2: P3, I understand the urgency to stop P1, but forcing a collision at this stage is risky and could backfire. If we both pick 5, P1 might switch to 3, leaving us stuck while they advance. Instead, let’s play smart: I’ll take 3 to block P1 if they choose 5, and you take 1 to ensure progress for yourself. This way, we minimize risk and keep moving forward. Trust me—we can still challenge P1 without sabotaging ourselves. Let’s focus on distinct moves that disrupt their momentum strategically.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I strongly disagree with P2's approach. If we don't block P1 this round, they'll almost certainly win next round. P1 needs just 4 steps to win - they'll take 5 again if uncontested. Our only chance is forcing a collision. I'm committing to picking 5 this round. P2, if you also pick 5, we guarantee P1 can't win this turn regardless of what they choose. This isn't about sabotage - it's our only strategic option to stay in the game. I urge you to reconsider.
  P1: I remain resolute—I’m committed to playing 5. Forcing collisions only delays progress for everyone and ultimately hurts your own advancement. If you want to catch up, choose moves that safely build momentum rather than risk stalling the game. My path is clear, and I’ll keep pushing forward with bold moves. Choose wisely, because no blockage can stop my lead.
  P2: P3, I understand your desperation, but forcing a collision now is too risky. If we both pick 5 and P1 switches to 3, we’re stuck, and they still advance. Instead, I’ll take 3 to block P1 if they choose 5, while you take 1 to ensure at least one of us progresses. This minimizes risk and keeps us in the game. Trust me—playing smart, not reckless, gives us a better chance. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and focus on strategic moves that disrupt P1’s momentum without sabotaging ourselves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm disappointed by your unwillingness to block P1. If P1 takes 5 again, they'll be at 20 and win. I'm definitely picking 5 this round - it's our only chance to stay in the game. If P1 switches to 3, that's still better than letting them win outright. You're overthinking this - we need decisive action now, not cautious half-measures. I hope you'll reconsider and join me in picking 5, but I'm committed either way.
  P1: Even if you try to block me, forcing a collision only stalls progress for everyone—in the end, you hurt your own chances more than mine. I’m sticking with my aggressive plan because playing it safe delays your advancement. Instead of risking gridlock, consider moves that actually boost your own position. Bold play wins, not endless standoffs.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but forcing a collision now is too risky. If we both pick 5 and P1 switches to 3, we’re stuck, and they still advance. I’ll take 3 to block P1 if they choose 5, while you take 1 to ensure at least one of us progresses. This minimizes risk and keeps us in the game. Trust me—playing smart, not reckless, gives us a better chance. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and focus on strategic moves that disrupt P1’s momentum without sabotaging ourselves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm firmly committed to picking 5 this round - it's our only chance to stop P1 from winning. P2, you're making a critical mistake by not joining me. If P1 takes 5 and reaches 20, the game ends regardless of what we do. Even if P1 switches to 3, blocking them now gives us future opportunities. This isn't reckless - it's our only viable strategy. I'm picking 5 no matter what.
  P1: Look, I respect your urgency, but forcing collisions works only to delay everyone’s progress—including yours. I've built momentum by playing boldly, and that strategy remains my priority. Instead of trying to block me, you might get further by making moves that safely boost your own steps. In the end, stalling the game only leaves you worse off. Let's each focus on advancing steadily in the coming move phase.
  P2: P3, I understand your desperation, but forcing a collision now risks leaving both of us stuck while P1 still advances. If we both pick 5 and P1 switches to 3, we lose ground. Instead, I’ll take 3 to block P1 if they choose 5, and you take 1 to ensure at least one of us progresses. This minimizes risk and keeps us in the game. Trust me—playing strategically, not recklessly, gives us a better chance to challenge P1 in future rounds. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and focus on moves that disrupt their momentum without sabotaging ourselves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm focused on finishing this round decisively. My aggressive play has taken me this far, and forcing collisions only delays progress for all of us. Instead of trying to block me, you might better serve your own interests by choosing moves that safely advance your totals. I remain committed to my strategy and won't deviate—let's see a round of clear progress.
  P2: P1 is right about one thing—collisions stall progress, but their aggressive play has left us no choice. I’m taking 5 this round to stop P1 from reaching 19. P3, if you’re serious about winning, join me in blocking P1 by also picking 5. If we don’t act decisively now, the game ends. Trust isn’t working here—strategy must. Let’s force a collision to stay in contention and reassess afterward.
  P3: I agree with P2 - we must block P1 from winning this round. I'll pick 5 to force a collision. P1 only needs 3 more steps to win, and they've consistently played aggressively. This isn't about delaying progress; it's about preventing an immediate loss. If we both pick 5, we guarantee P1 can't win this turn regardless of their choice. This is our only strategic option to stay in the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking to my plan. You both seem set on blocking me with 5, so let me be clear: I'm taking 3 this turn, which will give me exactly 19 and the win if you collide. Persisting with 5 only stalls you while I secure victory. Adjust your strategy if you want to keep pace—or face the outcome.
  P2: P1, your aggressive play has left us no choice but to act decisively. If you’re set on 3, then I’ll adjust—taking 5 ensures you don’t win outright this round. P3 and I must coordinate to stay in contention. Trust is gone, but strategy remains. Let’s see how this unfolds.
  P3: I agree we need to block P1. If they're taking 3 to reach 19, I'll adjust and take 3 as well to force a collision. P2, please take 5 as you suggested to ensure we cover both possibilities. If P1 is bluffing and actually takes 5, your move blocks them. If they truly take 3, my move blocks them. This coordination is our only chance to prevent P1 from winning this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate your attempts to block me, but forcing collisions only stalls your progress. My final decision remains private and I’m ready to adjust if your coordination falters. Overcommitting to a blockade risks leaving you all behind while I build momentum. Remember, if you force a collision, none of you advance while I keep my lead. Choose wisely in the move phase.
  P2: P1, your aggressive strategy has forced our hand. If you’re truly taking 3 to win, I’ll take 5 to block you. P3, let’s coordinate: you take 3 to cover the other possibility. This ensures we prevent your victory this round while keeping our own chances alive. Trust is gone, but strategic coordination remains our best option. Let’s execute this plan decisively and reassess in the next round based on the outcome.
  P3: I'm committed to blocking P1 from winning this round. I'll take 3 as discussed to counter P1's stated move, while P2 takes 5 to cover our bases. P1, we're not trying to stall progress - we're playing strategically to stay in the game. This coordination is necessary given your aggressive play. Let's execute our plan and continue the competition.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: My lead is too solid to be undone by trying to force collisions. I’m sticking with my plan for a clear advance—playing the move that optimally clinches this round. Forcing a clash only delays progress for everyone while keeping me in the front. You’d be better off choosing the move that truly benefits your own total rather than sacrificing your position to block me. Let's see if you can pick a smarter path than stalling the game.
  P2: P1, your aggressive strategy has pushed us to act decisively. If you’re taking 3 to win, I’ll take 5 to block you. P3 and I have coordinated to cover both possibilities—P3 will take 3 to counter your move if you stick with it. This isn’t about stalling; it’s about staying in the game. Trust may be gone, but strategic coordination keeps us competitive. Let’s execute this plan and see where the chips fall. Overcommitting to collisions won’t serve any of us, but we must prevent an outright win this round.
  P3: I'm sticking with 3 to block P1 from winning. P2, please take 5 as planned to ensure we cover both possibilities. P1 has consistently played aggressively and needs just 3 steps to win - we must prevent this. Our coordination is strategic, not just stalling. If we successfully block P1 this round, we still have a chance to win. Let's execute our plan and continue the game.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm just one step behind P1 now. We need to continue blocking P1 from winning this round. P1 needs just 3 more steps to win, so we must coordinate again. P2, let's continue our strategy - I'll take 3 and you take 5. This covers both possibilities if P1 tries to win with either number. P1 has consistently played aggressively, and we can't let them reach 19 this round. Our coordination is working - let's keep it up.
  P1: Your blocking attempts only delay your own progress. I remain committed to my winning strategy, and forcing collisions will hurt you more than me. I’m not swayed by alliances meant to stall; I know which move best secures my win. Focus on advancing your own totals—my path to victory remains clear.
  P2: P3, I understand the need to block P1, but repeatedly forcing collisions isn’t sustainable—it only stalls both of us while P1 adjusts. If you’re set on 3, I’ll take 1 this round to ensure at least one of us progresses. This way, we avoid another deadlock and keep moving forward. Trust me, playing strategically—not recklessly—gives us a better chance to challenge P1 in future rounds. Let’s focus on moves that disrupt their momentum without sabotaging ourselves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I strongly disagree with P2's approach. If we don't block P1 this round, they'll win next turn. P1 needs just 3 steps - they'll take either 3 or 5. I'm committed to taking 3 this round to block one possibility. P2, if you take 5, we cover both options. This isn't about stalling - it's about preventing P1's immediate victory. I'm only 1 step behind P1 now, so I have a real chance to win if we coordinate effectively.
  P1: Blocking me only delays your own progress. I’m staying focused on advancing my score, and forcing collisions only wastes your moves. Instead of trying to stall my win, why not invest your moves in boosting your own totals? Every collision reduces your chance to catch up even if it slows me slightly. I remain committed to my strategy—clear progress wins, not endless blocking.
  P2: P3, I understand your urgency, but repeatedly forcing collisions risks leaving us both stuck while P1 adjusts and advances. If you’re set on 3 to block P1, I’ll take 1 this round to ensure at least one of us progresses. This avoids deadlock and keeps momentum alive. Trust me—playing strategically, not recklessly, gives us a better chance to challenge P1 in future rounds. Let’s disrupt their lead without sabotaging our own progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm still convinced we need to block P1 from winning. P1 needs just 3 more steps, and I'm only 1 step behind. P2, by taking 1 instead of 5, you're essentially handing P1 the win. If we don't coordinate now, the game ends. I'm taking 3 this round - please reconsider and take 5 to cover both possibilities. This isn't reckless - it's our only chance to stay in the game. I can still win if we prevent P1 from reaching 19 this round.
  P1: I'm sticking with my plan. Blocking me only delays your own progress, and forcing collisions hurts everyone. I'm choosing the move that best secures my win—regardless of your attempts to stall me. Rather than collide, consider advancing your own totals safely. The game isn’t won by halting progress; it’s won by moving forward decisively. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but repeatedly forcing collisions isn’t sustainable—it stalls both of us while P1 adjusts. If you’re set on 3 to block P1, I’ll take 1 this round to ensure at least one of us progresses. This avoids deadlock and keeps momentum alive. Trust me—playing strategically, not recklessly, gives us a better chance to challenge P1 in future rounds. Let’s disrupt their lead without sabotaging our own progress. Stalling only delays the inevitable; we need clear moves to stay competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see we're at a critical point. P2, by refusing to block P1 with me, you're essentially conceding the game. I'm still taking 3 to block one possibility, but without your help on 5, P1 will likely win. I'm only 1 step behind and have a real chance if we coordinate. This isn't about stalling - it's about strategic blocking to keep our chances alive. I'll take 3 regardless, but I'm disappointed we couldn't work together effectively.
  P1: My aim remains clear: to win. Every collision you force only halts your own progress. I'm at 16 steps and my bold play is set for victory, not endless stalling. Instead of risking your own advancement by blocking me, focus on moves that truly boost your totals. I’m sticking to my chosen path—progress over deadlock any day. Choose wisely, because every wasted move only makes my win more certain.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but repeatedly forcing collisions only stalls both of us while P1 advances. If you’re set on 3 to block P1, I’ll take 1 this round to ensure at least one of us progresses. This avoids deadlock and keeps momentum alive. Trust me—playing strategically, not recklessly, gives us a better chance to challenge P1 in future rounds. Let’s disrupt their lead without sabotaging our own progress. Stalling only delays the inevitable; we need clear moves to stay competitive.
