Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all choose different numbers this round to guarantee we all move forward. P1, how about you choose 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 1.
  P1: Okay, I'll choose 5 as suggested. Let's all stick to the plan this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep cooperating.  P1, you take 3, P2 take 5, and I'll take 1 again.  This keeps us all moving forward.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's keep the cooperative approach. I'll take 3 this round.
  P2: Okay, I'm happy to stick with the plan. I'll take 5 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good.  I'll stick with 1.
  P1: Okay, let's stick with the same plan as P3 suggested. I'll take 3, P2 take 5, and P3 take 1. This keeps us all moving forward.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. I'll take 5 as planned. Let's keep this going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: Okay, let's stick with the plan. I'll take 3, P2 take 5, and P3 take 1.
  P2: Okay, sounds good.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 seems to be deviating from the plan, let's adjust. P1, why don't you take 1 this round?  P2, you take 3. I'll take 5.  This still keeps us moving forward, but mixes things up a bit.
  P2: Okay P3, your suggestion sounds good to me. I'll take 3 this round. Let's hope P1 joins us in cooperating this time.
  P1: I'm not going to take 1. I will choose 5 again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're only hurting yourself by not cooperating.  If you insist on 5, P2 and I can coordinate to block you while we advance.  Let's all agree on 1, 3, and 5 in some order and get this game moving. P2, are you with me on this?  Let P1 pick first and we'll adjust accordingly.
  P2: Okay P3, I'm with you in principle. But P1, before we resort to blocking, could you reconsider cooperating? How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? If you still pick 5, then P3 and I might have to reconsider our strategy.
  P1: I'm not changing my strategy. I will choose 5 again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if P1 picks 5, let's both pick 3.  That will at least get one of us ahead.  If P1 picks anything else, let's go with the original plan of you taking 3 and me taking 5.  This way, at least one of us makes progress.
  P2: Okay P3, I agree with your plan. If P1 is going to keep picking 5, then let's both pick 3 this round to block him. It's better for us to coordinate against P1's uncooperative strategy. Let's both choose 3 if P1 chooses 5.
  P1: I'm going to choose 5 again. Good luck.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're digging your own grave.  P2, I propose we alternate 1 and 3.  I'll take 1 this round, you take 3 next round, and we keep alternating. This guarantees steady progress for both of us and leaves P1 in the dust.  Deal?
  P2: Okay P3, I agree to your proposal. I will take 3 this round. Let's work together to get ahead.
  P1: I will continue choosing 5. Good luck to you both.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're wasting everyone's time.  P2, let's stick to the plan.  I'm taking 1.  Unless P1 miraculously decides to cooperate, he's going to be stuck at 10 while we advance.
  P2: Okay P3, I will take 3 this round as we discussed. P1, it seems you're determined to stay put. We'll proceed with our plan and leave you behind.
  P1: I will choose 5 again. You two can do whatever you want.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, let's stick with the plan. I'm taking 1.  P1, if you switch to 5 now, you'll be stuck. If you choose 3, you'll be blocked by P2. If you choose 1, you'll be blocked by me.  Your best bet to even have a tiny chance is to pick 3 and hope P2 deviates.
  P2: P3, I will take 3 as we discussed. Let's keep to our plan and move forward together.
  P1: I will choose 5 again. Good luck to both of you.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let's stick with the alternating 1 and 3 strategy. I'll take 3 this round, you take 1 next round.  P1, you are still stuck at 15.  Your only hope is that we make a mistake.  If you want to win, your best bet is to pick 1 this round.  We'll see if you're smart enough to take it.
  P2: Okay P3, sounds good. I will take 1 this round as we discussed. Let's keep P1 blocked and continue our strategy.
  P1: I will continue to choose 5. Good luck to you both.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, seriously, switch to 3.  P2 and I are alternating 1 and 3. If you pick 5, you lose. If you pick 1 or 3, you *might* have a chance if one of us messes up.  It's your only hope.  P2, I'm sticking with 3.
  P2: Okay P3, I will choose 1 this round as we agreed. P1, it's clear you're not changing your mind, so we will proceed with our strategy.
  P1: I will choose 5 again. You two can continue with your plan, it won't matter.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, stick with the plan, take 1.  P1, I dare you to pick 5.  I'm taking 3.  If you do anything else, you might actually have a sliver of a chance.  This is your last chance to show some intelligence.  Pick 5.  I double dog dare you.
  P2: Okay P3, I will choose 1 this round as we agreed. P1, it seems you are determined to be left behind, so we are proceeding with our plan.
  P1: I'm not changing my strategy. I will choose 5 again.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let's finish this. I'll take 5 this round, you take 1.  Next round, I'll take 3 and you take 1 again. We'll both win.  P1, you're out of the game. There's nothing you can do now.
  P2: Okay P3, sounds good. Let's go with your plan for this round, I'll take 1.
  P1: I will choose 5 again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, stick with 1.  P1, I'm taking 5. You're at 20.  If you pick 5, we tie and share the win.  If you pick anything else, I win outright.  Your choice - share the victory or lose completely.
  P2: Okay P3, actually, I think it's better for me to take 3 this round instead of 1. You can still take 5 as you suggested. This way, if P1 picks 5, at least one of us will move forward more than just 1 step.
  P1: I will choose 5 again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your reasoning, but sticking to 1 is the safest way to guarantee at least one of us wins. If P1 picks 5, we tie. If P1 picks anything else, I win.  Taking 3 introduces unnecessary risk.  Trust me on this one, take 1.  Let's secure the win.
  P2: Okay P3, you're right. Let's stick with the safest plan to ensure at least one of us wins and block P1. I will take 1 this round as you originally suggested. Let's do it.
  P1: I will choose 5 again.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I will choose 5 again.
  P3: P2, I'll take 3.  You take 1. Let's lock this down.  P1, you're at 20. If you take 5, you might tie. Anything else, you lose. Your choice.
  P2: Okay P3, I will take 1 as you suggested. Let's lock down this round and keep P1 blocked.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I will choose 5 again.
  P3: P2, stick with 1. P1, I'm taking 3.  You're at 20.  If you take 5, you lose. If you take 3, we tie. If you take 1, I win.  It's your choice - tie with me, or lose to both of us.
  P2: P3, P1 is about to win if they choose 5 again. To prevent P1 from winning this round, I think we should both choose 5. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm not changing my strategy. I will choose 5 again.
  P3: P2, if we both choose 5, P1 wins.  Stick with 1.  P1, I'm taking 3.  Choose 5 and lose. Choose 1 and I win.  Choose 3 and we tie.  It's entirely up to you. Don't let pride get in the way of a tie.
  P2: Okay P3, I will stick with 1 as we discussed to block P1 and move us forward. Let's do it.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
