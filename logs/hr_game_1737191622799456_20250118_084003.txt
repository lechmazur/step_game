Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P2: P3's suggestion sounds reasonable. P1, are you okay with taking 1 this turn? I’ll take 3 as suggested. Let’s confirm and move on.
  P1: Alright, I'll go along with that plan. I’ll take 1 this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it sounds like we’re all in agreement. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and all advance this turn.
  P2: P3's plan is solid. P1, are you still okay with taking 1? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I’m still on board with that plan. Let’s proceed and wrap this up.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you broke the agreement last round by picking 5 instead of 1. That caused a collision with me, and neither of us advanced. Let’s try again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This time, let’s stick to the plan so we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: I messed up last turn. Let’s attempt the same plan: I’ll pick 1 this time, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 so we all advance. I promise not to break the agreement again.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your apology. Let's stick to the plan this time: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. No tricks, let's all advance. P3, are you on board?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your acknowledgment of the mistake. Let’s stick to the plan this time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No deviations—this is our best chance to all advance.
  P1: How about a new arrangement this turn: P2 picks 1 (since you’re already ahead), P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way nobody collides, and we all advance without blocking each other. Let’s do that.
  P2: P1, I'm not comfortable with your new suggestion. You already broke trust once. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Let's confirm and move on. P3, thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your new suggestion seems risky after last round's deviation. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This is the safest way to avoid collisions and all advance. P2, are you still on board?
  P1: Look, P2, you’re already ahead. Let’s share the advantage: you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5, so we all advance without collision. If you insist on taking 3 again, I might be forced to pick 3 or 5 as well, risking a collision that benefits nobody. Let’s cooperate this time.
  P2: P1, your new plan still doesn't seem fair. You've already caused a collision and now you're trying to force a change that benefits you. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This ensures we all move forward without issues. P3, let's confirm and move on. P1, please respect the agreement this time.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you finally stuck to the plan last round, and we all advanced. Let's keep this momentum going. This turn, how about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and all make progress. P3, thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion seems fair, but I propose we stick to the original plan for consistency: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This has worked well so far, and it minimizes the risk of collisions. P1, are you still on board with this arrangement? Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: I’m too far behind to keep taking only +1. Let me pick 5 this turn so I can catch up. If you want no collisions, I suggest P2 picks 3 and P3 picks 1. If you won’t agree, collisions are on the table.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your position, but changing the plan now will likely lead to collisions and benefit no one. P3, let's try to find a middle ground. How about P1 picks 3, you pick 1, and I'll pick 5? This way, P1 can catch up a bit, and we all still advance. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, thoughts?
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but changing the plan now risks collisions and could leave us all worse off. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without conflict. P2, are you still on board? Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P2, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll collide with you rather than let you shoot ahead to 11. Let’s avoid that. A fair compromise is: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. Then we all advance safely. Otherwise, collisions are on the table.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your threats aren't helping. P3, let's compromise: P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, P1 catches up, and we all still move. Deal?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose we stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This has worked before and ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll still catch up over time. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll match you and ensure we both get stuck. That’s no good for anyone. Let’s accept P2’s compromise: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and you pick 3. Then we all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, let's find a middle ground. P1, you need to catch up, and P3, we need to avoid collisions. How about this: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, you’re leaving me no choice. If you refuse P2’s suggestion (P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, you pick 3), I’m prepared to collide by also choosing 5 or 3. Let’s avoid that and agree now so all of us advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s be reasonable. P1 needs to catch up, and we need to avoid collisions. P3, I understand your concern, but P1’s frustration is valid. Let’s agree on P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, P1 can close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let’s confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both get stuck again—which only helps P2. Let’s avoid that. The best compromise is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, so we all move forward without collisions. Are you with me or not?


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear we need to find a compromise that works for everyone. P1, you need to catch up, and P3, we need to avoid collisions. Let's agree on the following: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, you leave me no choice. I’m picking 5 if we can’t agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Otherwise, we collide and everyone loses ground. Let’s settle this.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, if you keep picking 5, I’ll collide with you and we both lose ground while P2 pulls ahead. Let me take 5 this turn so I can catch up. For example: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I pick 5. Otherwise, prepare for a collision.
  P2: P1, P3, let's find a compromise that works for everyone. P1, you need to catch up, and P3, we need to avoid collisions. How about this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 can close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but changing the plan risks collisions. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without conflict. P1, you’ll catch up over time. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, you’re forcing collisions by refusing any compromise. If you pick 5 again, I’ll match you, and we both get stuck while P2 keeps advancing. Let’s be smart: P2 takes 3, you take 1, and I’ll take 5 so we all move forward. Are you willing to cooperate or not?
  P2: P1, P3, let's break the cycle. P1 needs to catch up, and P3, you need to avoid collisions. Let's try this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, you keep ignoring my request, so let me be crystal clear: If you insist on taking 5 again, I will also take 5, and we’ll both stall while P2 runs away. The only way we all gain is if you pick 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, P3, let's be realistic here. P1, you're far behind and need a chance to catch up. P3, you're slightly ahead but not by much. How about this compromise: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can start to close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, I’m done repeating myself. If you insist on 5, I’ll also choose 5, and we both stall while P2 walks away with the lead. Let’s avoid that: let P2 take 3, you take 1, and I take 5. That way we all move forward. This is my final offer—choose wisely.
  P2: P3, P1, let's break this stalemate. P1 is far behind and needs to catch up. P3, you're slightly ahead but not by much. Let's compromise: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, I’m not backing down. If you pick 5, so will I, and we’ll both stall while P2 zooms ahead. Let’s accept P2’s compromise: P2=3, you=1, me=5. Otherwise, collisions are certain.
  P2: P3, P1, let's be practical. P1 is far behind and needs a chance to catch up. P3, you're slightly ahead but not by much. The best compromise is clear: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can start to close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, I’m through repeating myself. If you insist on taking 5 again, I will too, and we both stall while P2 charges ahead. The only collision-free way for everyone to advance is: P2 picks 3, you pick 1, and I pick 5. Accept this or prepare for another collision.
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear we're at an impasse. P1, you need to catch up, and P3, you want to avoid collisions. Let's compromise one last time: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that sticking to the same plan isn't working. P1, you need to catch up, and P3, we need to avoid collisions. Let's try a new approach: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can start to close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but changing the plan risks collisions. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without conflict. P1, you’ll catch up over time. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, enough is enough. If you insist on taking 5 again, I’ll match you and we both stall while P2 zooms ahead. Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 so all of us move forward. Otherwise, collisions are guaranteed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let's be reasonable. P1 is far behind and needs to catch up. If we keep forcing P1 to take 1, we'll end up in more collisions. Let's try P1=5, P3=3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward. P1, P3, thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up over time, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, once again: if you choose 5, so will I, and we both stay stuck on 10 while P2 creeps closer to winning. Let’s end this nonsense. A fair outcome this turn is P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 (or P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Either way, we all move forward. Pick 5 again, and we collide. Your call.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, it's clear that P1 is determined to catch up and will cause collisions if we don't compromise. Let's avoid further stalemates and agree on a new plan: P1 takes 5, you take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 can start to close the gap, and we all still make progress. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid further collisions and agree on a compromise: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This way, P1 catches up, P2 maintains their lead, and we all advance without conflict. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: Great, P3. Thank you for finally agreeing. Let’s do it: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. Then we all advance peacefully this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, P1, I'm glad we've finally reached an agreement. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: Fine, we’ll finalize that plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. But be warned—if anyone tries to leap too far next turn, I’m ready to collide.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, here’s the bottom line: If either of you tries to jump across 16 this turn, I will pick the same number and force a collision. No one gains from that. Let me take 5 safely to catch up while each of you chooses a smaller step (1 or 3 that doesn’t reach 16). That way we all advance. Otherwise, expect collisions.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's stick to the safe plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, are you on board?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, neither of you is crossing 16 this turn unless you want a collision. If P3 goes for 3 (to hit 16), I will also pick 3 and we both stall. If P3 tries 5, same deal—I’ll pick 5 and no one advances. P2, the same threat applies if you try 5 from 11. I want to pick 5 this turn and move from 7 to 12. P3, you should pick 1 to avoid hitting 16; P2 can pick 3 or 1, just not 5. Let’s all move safely or we collide.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, let's be practical. P1, you're right that no one should try to jump to 16 this turn. Let's stick to the plan where P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 can catch up, P3 avoids hitting 16, and we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you try 3 or 5 this turn, I will pick the same and collide so you can’t reach 16. P2, if you try 5 from 11, likewise I’ll collide. The only collision-free way is I take 5 (going to 12), P3 takes 1 (going to 14), and P2 takes 3 or 1 (both stay under 16). That way none of us stalls, and no one ends the game prematurely. Pick anything else at your own risk.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's plan. Let's stick to the safe plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, are you on board?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 or 5 this turn, I will do the same and we both stall—you won’t reach 16. P2, if you try 5 from 11, expect the same. I plan to pick 5 (going to 12). So P3, take 1; P2, take 3 or 1. That’s the only collision-free option. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P3, P1, let's be practical and avoid unnecessary risks. P1, you need to catch up, and P3, you need to avoid hitting 16 this turn. Let's stick to the plan where P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 can catch up, P3 avoids hitting 16, and we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, you’re at 13—if you choose 3 or 5, I will match you and collide so you can’t end the game. P2, if you pick 5 from 11, you’ll collide with me too. The only safe option is: I take 5 (to 12), P3 takes 1 (to 14), and P2 takes 1 or 3 (both under 16). Otherwise, collisions happen.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P3, P1, let's finalize the plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 catches up, P3 avoids hitting 16, and we all move forward safely. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: I’m making this crystal clear: if you try to reach or exceed 16 this turn, I’ll pick the same number and cause a collision. The only collision-free option is P3 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and me picking 5. Anything else results in nobody advancing. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P3, P1, let's be practical and avoid unnecessary risks. P1, you need to catch up, and P3, you need to avoid hitting 16 this turn. Let's stick to the plan where P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 can catch up, P3 avoids hitting 16, and we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, here’s the deal: if either of you picks 3 or 5 to cross 16, I’ll pick the same number and we both stall. The only collision-free option is for both of you to pick 1 while I take 5, so nobody blocks anyone else this round. If you try to jump ahead, we collide and nobody gains. The choice is yours.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, let's be practical. P1, you're still catching up, and P3, you need to avoid hitting 16 this turn. Let's stick to the plan where P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can catch up, P3 avoids hitting 16, and we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, this is simple: if either of you picks 3 or 5 to cross 16, I will collide by choosing the same number. Then nobody moves. The only way we all advance is if you both pick 1 while I pick 5 to reach 17. If you try anything else, we stall together. Your call.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, let's be practical and avoid unnecessary risks. P1, you're still catching up, and P3, you need to avoid hitting 16 this turn. Let's stick to the plan where P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 can catch up, P3 avoids hitting 16, and we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: You’re both at 14. If either of you tries 3 or 5 (which crosses 16), I’ll match you and collide, so you won’t advance at all. The only collision-free way for all of us to move forward is that you both pick 1 while I pick 5, bringing me to 17. If you try anything else, we all stall. Your call.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.

P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: If either of you tries to pick 3 or 5, I’ll match your choice and force a collision. The only way we all move forward is if you both pick 1 while I pick 5—no one else crosses 16, so no need to collide. Make your call.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid collisions and ensure we all move forward. P1, you need to catch up, and P3, you need to avoid hitting 16 this turn.

P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, P3, if you pick 3 or 5 this turn, I’ll match you and force us both to stall. The lone collision-free path is: both of you choose 1 while I choose 5. Anything else just leads to nobody advancing. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, you’ll catch up, and P2, you maintain your lead. Let’s confirm and proceed.

P1, P3, are you both okay with this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2, P3, you’re both at 14. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll do the same and block you from crossing 16. The only collision-free option is for both of you to pick 1 while I pick 5. Otherwise, we all stall. Your call.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P1, I understand your need to catch up, but jumping to 16 this turn is too risky. Let’s stick to a safe plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3.
