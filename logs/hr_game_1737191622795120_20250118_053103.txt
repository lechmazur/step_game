Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone, let's try to pick different numbers this turn to move forward effectively.
  P1: I agree we should avoid collisions. I'll take 1 if you two want to take higher numbers.
  P2: Okay, I'll take 3 then, P3 take 5?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good, I'll go with 5.
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: 
  P2: Sounds good, let's move on to the move phase.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's try to keep the same pattern this round. I'll take 3 again.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 5 again.
  P1: I'll stick with 1 again since our coordination worked well last time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good, let's all stick to our numbers again this round.
  P3: 
  P1:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's keep the same pattern again. I'll take 3.
  P1: I think we should change things up. P3 is getting too far ahead at 10 steps while I'm only at 2. I suggest I take 5 this time.
  P3: P1, if you take 5, I’ll take 3 to avoid a collision. Let’s have P2 continue with 3 as well.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I'll stick with 3. P1, are you sure about 5? P3, are you okay with 3?
  P1: I'll definitely take 5 this turn. P3, if you take 3 you'll collide with P2 and neither of you will advance, which helps me catch up.
  P3: P1, I understand your strategy, but I'll stick with taking 5 to move closer to 16. Let’s proceed accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'll stick with 3 again. P1, you are going for 5, and P3 you're going for 5 as well?
  P1: I'm definitely going for 5 this turn. P3, if you also choose 5, neither of us will advance and you'll waste your turn. It's in your interest to pick a different number.
  P3: P1, I need to take 5 to move closer to 16. Please choose 3 instead to avoid a collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems like we are in a bit of a standoff. I'll stick with 3 again.
  P1: I understand you want to win P3, but I'm committed to taking 5 this turn. You can either take 3 and collide with P2, or take 5 and collide with me - either way you won't advance this turn.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with taking 5 to move closer to 16. Let's proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3 again. It seems like you two have a standoff.
  P1: Since we've all made our positions clear and further discussion won't change anything, I'll end the conversation here.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since our collision last turn was unproductive, I propose we return to our original coordination. I'll take 1 if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance.
  P2: Okay, I'll take 3 again. P3, please take 5. P1, you can take 1.
  P3: P3: Alright, I'll take 5 as agreed. Let's proceed.
