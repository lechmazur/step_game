Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2, let's try to coordinate to all move forward this round. How about P1 picks move 1, P2 picks move 3, and I will pick move 5?  This way we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: That’s a fair proposal, P3. I’m okay with taking move 1 this round if everyone sticks to the plan. Let’s build some trust early. P2, are you in?
  P2: P3's plan ensures we all progress without conflict. I agree to take move 3 this round. Let’s confirm: P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. This avoids collisions and builds trust. Next round, we can adjust based on progress. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay great, P1 and P2, sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1 move 1, P2 move 3, and I move 5. Let's do it.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. Let’s all stick to the plan this round—no surprises. If everyone keeps their word, we’ll all advance and set a solid foundation for future coordination. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I completely align with this plan. Let’s execute it precisely—no last-minute changes. Trust is key here. I’ll hold to move 3. Once we confirm this round’s moves, we can focus on strategy adjustments later. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s maintain consistency to avoid risks. I’ll stick to move 3 again. P1, if you take 1 and P3 takes 5, we all advance safely. This builds momentum without unnecessary conflict. Later rounds can focus on aggressive moves once we’re closer to 20. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay P2, that sounds reasonable to me. Let's keep the same moves for this round: P1 take 1, you take 3, and I'll take 5 again. This consistent approach seems to be working well so far.
  P1: I’m good with repeating the same moves this round—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. It’s low risk and keeps us all progressing. If we maintain this trust, we can reassess in a few rounds once we’re closer to 20. Let’s keep it clean and cooperative for now. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, let's keep the same strategy this round to maintain progress. Trust remains vital—sticking to the plan ensures safe advancement for all. Next round, we can discuss adjustments. Confirmed: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s execute this decisively.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I agree let's stick with the same moves for this round as well.  It's working smoothly and building a good foundation.  We can re-evaluate our strategy again after this round to see if adjustments are needed. I will take move 5 again.
  P1: We’re off to a solid start. If we all stick to the plan again this round, we’ll each gain more ground without risk. Once we hit 10+ steps, we can reassess strategies. For now, let’s keep the trust going—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, while consistency is good, continuing this pattern risks letting P3 surge too far ahead. Let’s adjust this round: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This balances progress—P3 stays closer, I gain ground, and P1 advances more. We can reassess next round. Deal?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about balance. But switching to P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 slows us all down. Let's keep the momentum. How about P1-1, P2-3, and I take 5 again this round? We are still early, and consistent progress is key. We can adjust more significantly in the next round if needed.
  P1: P2, I get your point about balance, but switching now might cause confusion or mistrust. Let’s stick to the original plan one more time—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5—then reassess next round with more data. Sudden shifts could backfire. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision cost P3’s progress. Let’s strictly adhere to the original plan this round to avoid repeats: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. No deviations—trust is fragile. We’ll discuss adjustments post this round once we’ve regained momentum. Deal?
  P3: Yes, P2, I agree, let's get back on track with P1-1, P2-3, and P3-5 this round to ensure we all progress smoothly.  It's crucial we rebuild trust after last round's mishap.  Let's all commit to these moves and then reassess. P1, are you with us on this?
  P1: I’m with you both—let’s restore trust and stick to the original plan this round: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That way we all move forward without risk. After this round, we can reassess based on new positions. Let’s keep it clean and cooperative for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, we need to avoid another collision. Let’s refine the plan: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This distributes progress fairly while ensuring no overlaps. My higher move helps close the lead gap, but keeps all advancing. We can reassess next round. Deal?
  P3: Okay P2, I understand your concern about fairness, but changing the plan again might create more confusion after last round's collision.  Let's prioritize rebuilding trust and consistent progress first.  How about we stick to the original plan for this round: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5, just to ensure we all move forward? We can reassess and adjust again next round. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, I see your point about balance, but constant switching risks mistrust. Let’s stick to the original plan this round—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5—so we all move forward. We’ll reassess next round with more clarity. One more round of stability builds trust. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Continuing the original plan lets P3 overtake me this round. Let’s adjust for fairness: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5 (to stay ahead), and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions while preventing any single player from gaining an unfair lead. Trust requires balance—agreed?
  P3: P2, P1, let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  We need to avoid another collision and ensure we all progress. Rebuilding trust is key right now. Let's revisit adjustments next round after we've all moved. Agreed?
  P1: P2, I understand your fairness concern, but constant changes risk missteps and mistrust. Let’s stick to the original plan—P1-1, P2-3, P3-5—just this round to restore consistency. If we all move cleanly, we can renegotiate next round with more trust and better positioning. Stability now benefits us all.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s stabilize progress. This round, I’ll take **5** to extend my lead cautiously, while P1 takes **1** (to 5) and P3 takes **3** (to 8). This prevents collisions and balances advancement. My move 5 avoids overlapping with your proposed steps. Trust this adjustment ensures no repeat of past collisions while allowing me to build a sustainable edge. Agreed?
  P3: P2, your proposal benefits you most by extending your lead. Let's stick to the original plan for one more round to ensure consistent progress and rebuild trust: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way we all move forward and can reassess next round without anyone gaining a disproportionate advantage right now. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, your plan clearly favors you and risks further mistrust. P3’s suggestion—returning to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5—is the most balanced and predictable path forward. We all move safely, and no one gains an unfair edge. Let’s prioritize clean progress and rebuild trust after recent collisions. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1: Continuing the original plan lets you overtake me, destabilizing trust. Let’s **rotate moves** fairly this round: **P1 takes 3 (to 7), I take 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 1 (to 6)**. This prevents collisions, balances progress, and avoids any single player surging too far. Stability requires mutual sacrifice—agreed?
  P3: P1 and I both prefer the original plan for consistent progress and trust-building. Rotation feels early and might cause confusion. Let’s do P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 again this round for stability. What do you say, P2?
  P1: P2, your constant push for rotation always puts you on move 5—maximizing your gain while asking others to sacrifice. That’s not balanced, it’s opportunistic. P3 and I have consistently supported the original plan for mutual progress. Let’s stick to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this round—no collisions, fair gains, and restored trust. We reassess next round. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s finalize **P1 takes 3 (to 7), I take 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 1 (to 6)**. This avoids collisions, lets me close the gap responsibly, and ensures all advance. P3, your 1 move keeps you moving safely. P1, 3 balances progress. Trust this adjustment—it prevents future clashes while allowing me to build a sustainable lead. Final call: commit now?
  P3: P2, both P1 and I prefer the original plan for this round: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. It's the most balanced way to ensure we all progress and rebuild trust. Let's stick with it for this round and reassess next turn. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your repeated push for move 5 while rotating others below you is self-serving. P3 and I have consistently supported a fair, stable plan. Let’s lock in: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5—no collisions, fair gains, and trust restored. Constant changes only sow doubt. Stick to the original plan this round, then we all reassess. Final agreement?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the collisions are costing us all progress. P2, your deviations from our agreed plan have caused the recent collisions. Let's get back to the original plan this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. We need to move forward and rebuild some trust.  Agreed?
  P2: P3, P1: Agreed—let’s revert to the original plan this round to avoid another stalemate. P1 takes 1 (to 5), I’ll take 3 (to 9), and P3 takes 5 (to 10). Stability now ensures progress. After this round, I’m open to adjustments to balance advancement—fairness matters. Let’s execute cleanly.
  P1: Agreed—let’s return to the original plan this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. We all advance safely and rebuild trust after last round’s full collision. Let’s keep it simple and clean—no surprises. If this works, we can reassess next round with better footing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round as agreed.
  P2: P1, P3: I acknowledge my past deviations caused collisions. Let’s **strictly** follow the original plan this round: P1-1 (5 total), P2-3 (9), P3-5 (10). Stability now is critical. Once we advance, I propose a fair rotation next round to balance progress. Trust starts with honoring agreements. Let’s execute flawlessly this time.
  P1: Let’s stay disciplined and follow through: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. We all move, no collisions, and rebuild trust. If this works cleanly, I’m open to discussing a fair rotation next round. But for now, let’s prove we can cooperate. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, great, it sounds like we are all aligned on P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round to ensure we all progress. Let's execute these moves now and get ourselves back on track.
  P2: P1, P3: I fully commit to the original plan this round—**P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5**—to honor our agreement and avoid repeats of past collisions. My prior deviations were mistakes; stability is critical now. Let’s prove we can execute flawlessly. After this, I propose a **rotation system** for future rounds to balance progress equitably. Trust starts with consistency. Final confirmation: I will take 3.
  P1: Let’s lock it in—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. We’ve all confirmed, so let’s follow through without surprises. If this round goes smoothly, I’m fully open to discussing a fair rotation next turn. Let’s prove we can cooperate and rebuild trust. Ready to execute?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to ensure no collisions this round. Let's stick to the original plan again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. P2, please stick to 3 this time to rebuild trust and ensure we all progress.  Let's make this round count.
  P1: P2, P3: After repeated collisions, trust is fragile. I’m willing to return to the original plan—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—if we all truly commit. No deviations this time. If this round goes cleanly, I’m open to discussing a fair rotation next turn. But we need stability now. Can we all agree—no surprises?
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m fully committed to the original plan this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s execute flawlessly to rebuild trust. No deviations—stability now ensures progress. I’ll stick to 3 to guarantee we all advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, we are all agreeing to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round to avoid collisions and rebuild trust.  Let's all lock in these moves now.
  P1: Let’s lock in the agreed plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. We’ve all confirmed—no surprises. If we execute cleanly, I’m open to discussing a fair rotation next round. But for now, let’s prove we can cooperate and rebuild trust. Ready to move forward?
  P2: P1, P3: Trust is our only path forward. This round, **strict adherence** to the plan is non-negotiable. P1 takes 1 (to 5), I take 3 (to 12), P3 takes 5 (to 10). No deviations—collisions erase progress. After this, I propose a **rotation system** to balance leads equitably. But first, we **must** execute flawlessly. P3, confirm you’ll hold to 5? P1, same with 1? Let’s prove we can follow through *this time*.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, yes, I confirm move 5. Let's all stick to our agreed moves this round: P1-1, P2-3, and P3-5.  Trust is key, let's execute these moves now.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Let’s follow through without deviation—no last-minute changes. If this round goes cleanly, I’m open to discussing a fair rotation next turn. But stability must come first. Let’s prove we can cooperate. Ready to execute?
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s **finalize this round’s moves now**. I confirm I’ll take **3** (to 12). P1, please hold to **1** (5 total). P3, **5** (10 total). *No deviations this time—trust is non-negotiable.* Collisions erase progress. Let’s prove we’ve learned from past mistakes. Execute flawlessly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Six rounds of promises, six rounds of chaos. I’m done playing nice while others break agreements. From here on, I’ll choose moves based on what maximizes my position—not empty coordination. If either of you want to propose a *real* plan that doesn’t just benefit yourselves, I’m listening. Otherwise, expect me to play to win.
  P3: P1, I agree with you. P2 is unreliable. Let's both pick 5 this round to pressure P2. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3—let’s seize this chance to turn things around. I’ll take **1** this round (to 13), letting you both advance freely. P1, take **3** (to 7), and P3, take **5** (to 10). No overlaps, guaranteed. I swear to honor this plan *without fail*. Fair progress rebuilds trust, and it keeps me ahead while giving you both momentum. Collisions only hurt everyone—let’s prove cooperation still works. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your offer benefits all of us on paper—but after six rounds of broken promises, words mean little. If you truly take 1 this round, it’ll be the first real sign of goodwill. P3, if we both take 5 and P2 sticks to 1, we all gain without collision. I’m willing to test this—once. But if it fails, I’m done coordinating. Let’s see if P2 finally delivers.
  P3: Okay P1, I am willing to test P2's plan for this round as you suggested. Let's take P2 at their word this time: P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and I will take 5. If P2 deviates again, we know for sure. Let's proceed with this plan for this round only and see what happens.
  P2: P1, P3: I understand your skepticism, but this is my last chance to prove reliability. **I swear on 1 this round—no exceptions**. Let me earn your trust. If we all advance cleanly (P1:3, P3:5), I’ll honor a fair rotation next round. This is critical—collisions only delay all of us. Give me this one chance to rebuild trust. Let’s make progress *finally*.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, this is your final test—if you truly pick 1 and let us advance, we’ll consider future coordination. P3, I’m leaning toward taking 5 instead of 3 to close the gap faster—if P2 sticks to 1, we both gain big. But if P2 lies again, we punish hard next round. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I think testing P2's plan is reasonable, but instead of you taking 5, please stick with 3 as P2 proposed.  This way, if P2 is lying again, at least one of us is likely to advance. If P2 is truthful and takes 1, we all progress as planned. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3: I **solemnly commit** to **move 1** this round—no hidden agenda. Let’s seize this chance to reset. If I truly take 1, P1’s safest path is **3** (avoids collision risk if I lied), while P3 takes 5 as proposed. This way, *even if I’m dishonest*, at least one of you advances. But if I’m truthful, *both* of you leap forward. Trust this critical test—my 1 is non-negotiable. Let’s prove progress is possible.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: I'm at 13 and need decisive progress. This round, I’ll take **5** to reach 18. To avoid collision, please coordinate: P1 take **1**, P3 take **3**. This lets us all advance safely. I won’t block your moves if you grant me this critical step forward. Let’s cooperate for mutual survival.
  P1: P2, after seven rounds of deception, your sudden plea for cooperation—while grabbing 5 again—is laughable. You’re at 13, P3 at 5, and I’m at 4. Your plan puts you within striking distance of 20 while asking us to crawl. Not happening. P3, I propose we both take 5 this round. If P2 collides with us, they stall. If not, we catch up. Either way, we don’t let P2 run away with this. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I agree. P2 is clearly untrustworthy and is running away with the game. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P2 and catch up. If P2 also picks 5, they will be stalled, which is good for us. Let's do it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3: Colliding on 5 is self-destructive. Let’s split moves: I’ll take 5 to 18 **only if** you take 1 and 3. Otherwise, I’ll choose 3 and watch you both stall. Cooperation benefits all—don’t shoot yourselves in the foot.
  P1: P2, your “conditional cooperation” is a bluff—if you truly feared stalling, you'd commit to 3 now. But you won’t, because you’re trying to sneak to 18 while we crawl. P3, let’s stay united: we both take 5. If P2 joins us, they stall. If not, we close the gap. No more favors for someone at 13. Let’s force balance.
  P3: P1, you're right, P2's proposal is self-serving. Let's definitely both take 5 this round.  If P2 joins us, they are blocked. If P2 takes 3 or 1, we both gain ground and close the gap to P2.  Let's do it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: I commit to **move 3** this round. If you both take **5**, I advance to 16 while you’re blocked—fair play. If you split (e.g., P1-1, P3-5), I’ll stay at 3 and let you progress. Choose: Mutual collision or controlled advancement? My move is locked at 3. Let’s decide.
  P1: P2, your “locked” move at 3 is just another manipulation attempt. You’re still trying to gain while pretending to be generous. P3 and I both taking 5 forces balance—either we stall together or close the gap while you crawl. I’m not falling for your bait. P3, let’s stay the course and both take 5. We either block P2 or gain ground. No mercy for someone already at 13.
  P3: P1, agreed, let's both take 5. P2, we are sticking with our plan and not falling for your manipulations.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 16. Let me finish this by picking 5 to reach 21. If you both pick 1 or 3, I win cleanly. Blocking me only delays the inevitable—I’ll pick 3 next round to hit 19, then 1 to secure victory. Let’s end this now. Choose 1 or 3.
  P1: P2, you're not winning this round. You’ve lied too many times, and now you’re begging for a clean exit. P3 and I both taking 5 stalls you at 16 again. If you try 3 or 1, we gain ground. P3, let’s stay unified—double 5 again. We either block P2 or catch up. No mercy for manipulators.
  P3: P1, you're right, no mercy for manipulators. Let's stick to our plan: both of us pick 5 again this round to block P2.  We can't let P2 win after all their deceit. Let's do it.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: Your mutual 5 choice blocks **you both** this round. Choose 1 or 3 so at least one advances while I take 5 to 21. You gain progress, I win cleanly. Stalemate only delays your own advancement. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, stay the course—double 5 again. If P2 takes 5, they stall. If they try 1 or 3, we both gain and close the gap. We’ve sacrificed progress to block P2’s runaway lead—now’s not the time to blink. P2, you’ve lied too many times to deserve a clean win. Let’s make you earn every step.
  P3: P3, yes, let's definitely stick with double 5s. P2, you had your chance to play fairly. Now we are blocking you. Both P1 and I will choose 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Continuing to both pick 5 only stalls us all. Let’s split: one takes 1, the other 3. I’ll take 5 to 21 now—fair game. You both advance, I win cleanly. Mutual progress is better than gridlock. Agree?
  P1: P3, we’re in perfect sync—let’s lock in 5 again. If P2 takes 5, they stall. If they try 1 or 3, we both gain. Either way, we win ground or block them. P2’s “clean win” pitch is just another trick. We’ve come this far holding the line—don’t blink now. Let’s crush this.
  P3: P1, agreed, let's lock in 5s. P2, we're not changing our minds. We are both picking 5 to block you this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll take 1 to reach 20. Let one of you pick 3 and the other 5 so we all advance. Colliding on 1 only delays my inevitable win—why risk it? Choose differently.
  P3: P1, let's both call P2's bluff and pick 1. If P2 is serious about 1, we block them. If P2 picks something else, we haven't lost much.
  P1: P3, let’s both pick 1. If P2 actually takes 1, we block them at 20. If they try 3 or 5, we gain ground while they stall. It’s win-win for us. P2’s “clean win” pitch is bait—don’t fall for it. This is our shot to stop them.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3—colliding on 1 only ensures *none* of us advance. If you both pick 1, I’ll take **3** to reach 22 and win decisively. Split your moves: let me finish cleanly at 20 (1), while one of you takes 3 or 5. Mutual advancement is better than stalemate. Trust me *this time*.
  P3: P1, let's confirm our plan: both of us pick 1 this round.  P2 is trying to trick us into splitting moves so they can win. If we both pick 1, we have a chance to block P2 if they try to reach exactly 20 with a move of 1. Even if P2 picks 3 or 5, they will win anyway, but picking 1 gives us the best chance to stop them. Let's do it.
  P1: P3, we’re aligned—double 1 is our best shot. If P2 truly takes 1, we block them at 20. If they take 3 or 5, we both gain. Either way, we deny them a clean win. Let’s hold the line—both pick 1. P2, you’ve burned every bridge. Now you earn every step.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: If you both pick 1, I’ll take **3** to reach 22 and win decisively. But let’s split: I’ll take **1** (20), P1 take **3**, P3 take **5**. This lets me win cleanly while you both advance. Colliding on 1 only blocks us all—choose mutual progress over gridlock.
  P3: P1, confirm you are still picking 1. P2, as we said, we are both picking 1 to block you from winning this round.
  P1: P3, confirmed—I'm locking in 1. If P2 truly takes 1, we block them at 20. If they lie and take 3 or 5, we both gain ground. Either way, we deny them the win this round. P2, you’ve tried every trick—this ends now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 5 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 5 steps
