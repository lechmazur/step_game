Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue rotating our moves. P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1 this round. Agreed?
  P2: "Actually, how about I take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1?"
  P1: I'll take 1.  Let's stick with the original rotation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, let's stick to the original rotation plan. It's been working well so far. I'll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, P1 prefers the original rotation. How about I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round?
  P1: P2, if you deviate from the plan now, it only hurts all of us.  Let's stick to the rotations.  I'm taking 1. P3 takes 5, you take 3.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's get back on track with the rotation. I'll take 5 this round.
  P1: P2, you've deviated from the plan twice now.  If you're not going to cooperate, I'm not going to either.  This round, I'm taking 5.  P3 should take 3.
  P3: P2, let's stick to the rotation plan to avoid more collisions. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. P1, please take 1 to keep us on track.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're right. My apologies for the deviations. Let's get back on track. I'll take 5.
  P1: P3, take 1.  I'm taking 5. P2, if you take 5, neither of us will advance.  If you take 3, you'll be at 9 and I'll be at 14, one step away from winning.  If you take 1, you'll be at 7 and I'll win.  Your choice.
  P3: P2, let's get back to the rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round as originally agreed. Please take 3 to keep us on track. P1, stick with 5 to avoid collisions and let's all advance smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I agree with your original suggestion this round: I take 3, you take 1, P1 takes 5.
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I win next round. If you take 1, I win this round.  If you take 5, neither of us advance.  P3, I'm taking 5.  Take 1 and get ahead of P2.
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1 as agreed, you take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we all advance and keep the game fair.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you take 5, I will also take 5. P3, how about you take 3?
  P1: P2, if you take 5, we BOTH lose.  If you take 3, *I* win. If you take 1, *I* win.  P3, take 1. It's your best move.
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan for fairness. I'll take 1 as agreed. Please take 3, and P1, take 5. This way, we all advance and keep the game balanced.

  P1: I'm taking 1.  If either of you take 1, neither of us advances, and I win next turn.  If you both take something else, I win this turn.
  P2: P3, I'll take 1 this round to block P1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, taking 1 won't stop P1 from winning. If P1 takes 1, we both lose this round. Let's stick to the plan: you take 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game fair and gives us all a chance to advance.
  P1: I'm taking 1.  P2, if you take 1, neither of us advances, and I still win next round. P3, you might as well take 3 or 5 - it won't change the outcome.
  P2: P3, I understand the rotation, but P1 is about to win. I'm taking 1 to block P1 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: I'm taking 1.  P3, whether you take 3 or 5 is irrelevant. P2, if you take 1, neither of us advances, and I *still* win next round.
  P2: "P3, I am taking 1 to block P1. You should take 3 or 5."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm taking 5. P3, if you take 1, P2 *must* take 3 to have any chance.  If he does, I win next round.  If he takes anything else, I win this round.  P2, if P3 takes anything other than 1, I win this round.
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1 as agreed. You take 3, and we can both advance. P1, if you take 5, we'll block you next round. Let's keep this fair.
