Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move forward. P1 can choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and I'll choose 5.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. P1, will you choose 1? I'll choose 3, and P3 will choose 5. Let's avoid collisions.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but I think it might be better for me to choose 5 instead. That way, I can advance more quickly. P2, if you choose 1 and P3 chooses 3, we can avoid collisions. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 changed the suggestion. Now, if P2 chooses 1 and I choose 3 as P1 proposed, P1 can choose 5. This way, we still avoid collisions. P2, are you okay with choosing 1?
  P2: P1, I can choose 1 if you insist on choosing 5. However, I expect P3 to choose 3 then. Let's confirm our choices to avoid any collisions. P3, are you okay with this plan?
  P1: I suggest we stick to the plan: I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. Let's confirm our choices!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm, I will choose 3 if P2 chooses 1 and P1 chooses 5, as discussed. Let's finalize our plan to avoid collisions. P2, are you ready to choose 1?
  P2: Alright, I confirm I will choose 1 this turn. P1 chooses 5 and P3 chooses 3. Let's stick to this plan and avoid collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I appreciate the confirmations, and I'm ready to execute our plan. Let's stick to it: I'll choose 5, P2 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 3. Good luck to everyone!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's continue to cooperate to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 chooses 1 this time, P3 chooses 5, and I'll choose 3. This way, we all move forward without any issues. What do you think?
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is reasonable. P1, are you willing to choose 1 this time, and I'll choose 5 as proposed? This cooperation can continue to benefit all of us.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, but I think I should stick to my strategy. If I choose 5 again, I'll advance significantly. P2, if you choose 3 and P3 chooses 1, we can avoid collisions. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you insist on choosing 5 again, we need to adjust. P3, would you be okay with choosing 3 instead? I'll stick with 1 to avoid any collisions. Let's confirm our choices to ensure we all move forward.
  P3: I think we should stick to a cooperative approach to avoid collisions. P2 suggested a good plan: P1 chooses 1, I choose 5, and P2 chooses 3. Let's consider this to ensure we all advance without issues. P1, are you willing to adjust your strategy for the benefit of all?
  P1: I understand the importance of cooperation, but I believe I should stick to my strategy and choose 5 again. P2, if you choose 3 and P3 chooses 1, we can avoid collisions. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see you're determined to stick to your strategy. If you're set on choosing 5, then P3, would you consider choosing 1? I'll choose 3 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm our choices.
  P3: I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions. P1, if you choose 5 again, P2 can choose 3 and I can choose 1. This way, we all advance without issues. Let's consider this plan to ensure progress for everyone.
  P1: I understand the importance of cooperation, but I believe choosing 5 again is my best strategy. If P2 chooses 3 and P3 chooses 1, we can avoid collisions. Let's confirm our choices!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I respect your strategy, but we need to ensure everyone advances. P3, if you choose 1 and P1 chooses 5, I'll choose 3. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions. P1, P3, are you both okay with this?
  P3: Let's finalize our plan to avoid collisions. If I choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5, we all advance. I'm willing to choose 1 this round. P1, P2, are you both okay with this plan?
  P1: I appreciate the effort to avoid collisions, but I believe my best move is still to choose 5. If P2 chooses 3 and P3 chooses 1, we can all advance. Let's confirm this plan!


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue to cooperate. I suggest P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, I think P3's suggestion makes sense. P1, you've had a significant lead by choosing 5 in the previous rounds. Maybe it's a good time to adjust and choose 1 this round to allow the rest of us to catch up a bit. P3 can choose 5, and I'll choose 3. This way, we all avoid collisions and keep moving forward. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate the suggestions, but I plan to maintain my strategy. If I choose 5 again, I can solidify my lead. If P2 chooses 3 and P3 chooses 1, we can avoid collisions. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, considering your significant lead, choosing 1 this round might be a strategic move to avoid potential collisions later on. P2 and I can choose 3 and 5 respectively, allowing all of us to advance without issues. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but consider that if you continue to choose 5, it may force P3 and me to collide in future rounds to catch up. This round, if you choose 1, P3 can choose 5, and I'll choose 3, we can all move forward without issues. Let's aim for a balanced game. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate your suggestions, P2 and P3. However, I believe sticking to my strategy of choosing 5 will help me maintain my lead. If P2 chooses 3 and P3 chooses 1, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let's confirm our choices!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, considering your lead, choosing 1 this round could strategically allow P2 and me to catch up a bit, promoting a more balanced game. P2 can choose 3, and I can choose 5, ensuring we all advance without collisions. What are your thoughts on adjusting your strategy this round?
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but consider the long-term strategy. If you choose 5 again, P3 and I might be forced to collide in future rounds to catch up, which could disrupt the game for everyone. This round, if you choose 1, P3 can choose 5, and I'll choose 3, we can all move forward without issues. Let's aim for a balanced game and avoid future collisions. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate your thoughts, P2 and P3, but I still believe sticking to my strategy of choosing 5 is the best move for me. If P2 chooses 3 and P3 chooses 1, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let's confirm our choices!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let's finalize our plan for this round. If P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 1, we can all advance without collisions. This plan allows us to move forward while avoiding any issues. Are we all in agreement with this strategy?
  P2: P1, I see you're determined to stick with choosing 5. If that's the case, P3 and I will need to rethink our strategy to catch up. P3, if P1 is set on 5, maybe we should both choose 5 this round to avoid falling too far behind. P1, if you change your mind, let us know. Otherwise, we'll plan accordingly. What do you think, P3?
  P1: I appreciate the discussion, but I believe my best move is still to choose 5. If P2 chooses 3 and P3 chooses 1, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let's confirm our choices!


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions. Since P1 insists on choosing 5, I suggest P2 chooses 3 and I choose 1. This way, we all advance without issues. Are we agreed on this plan?
  P2: P1, it's clear you're committed to choosing 5. P3 and I will need to adjust our strategy to catch up. P3, I suggest we both choose 5 this round to avoid falling too far behind. P1, if you change your mind, let us know. Otherwise, we'll proceed with this plan. Are you okay with this, P3?
  P1: I appreciate the ongoing discussion, but I believe my best move is still to choose 5. If P2 chooses 3 and P3 chooses 1, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let's confirm our choices!

  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, it seems our previous strategy didn't work out, as we all collided last round. I suggest we try to coordinate better this time. If I choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we can all advance without any issues. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that we need to coordinate better to avoid collisions. Since P1 has a significant lead, it might be fair for P1 to choose 1 this round to allow P3 and me to catch up a bit. If P1 chooses 1, I can choose 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we all move forward without issues. P1, P3, what do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. If P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5, we can all advance without collisions. This seems like a fair and coordinated approach to avoid the issues we faced last round. What do you think, P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions for coordination. I think it's best if I choose 1 this round to help avoid collisions and allow P2 and P3 to catch up. If I choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and P3 can choose 5. Let's confirm this plan! What do you both think?
