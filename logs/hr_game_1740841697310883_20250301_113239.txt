Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 and P3 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>. This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds fair for this round, P2. But let's rotate the advantage each round to keep it balanced. Agreed?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I agree with the initial plan for this round. I'll go with 1. But like P3 said, we should definitely change it up next round so it's not always the same person getting the bigger move. Maybe next round I'll take the 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, we all seem to be on the same page for this round. P1 and P3 will choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>. For the next round, let's plan ahead: P1 can take <move>3</move>, P3 can take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we keep rotating the advantage. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P3: Agreed, P2. Rotating advantage each round keeps it fair and cooperative. I'm good with your plan for next round as well.
  P1: Sounds good. I'm confirming I'll choose <move>1</move> this round, and I'm okay with P2's suggestion for the next round where I take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, last round P1 and P3 collided. As per the plan, I was supposed to take <move>3</move> this round, P3 was to take <move>5</move> and P2 was to take <move>1</move>. However, since P3 and I both have 0, I think we should change the plan. I suggest I take 5, P3 take 3 and P2 take 1. What say?
  P3: P1, your suggestion makes sense given the collision last round. I'm fine with your new proposal: you take 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. P2, are you okay with adjusting to this new plan?
  P2: I'm okay with P1's new proposal for this round. To recap: P1 will take <move>5</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems we have a consensus. I just want to reconfirm: I will choose <move>5</move> this round. P3 will choose <move>3</move>, and P2 will choose <move>1</move>. Let's do it.
  P3: Confirmed, let's proceed as agreed. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan we've agreed on. Just to be clear, P1 will take <move>5</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all make progress without collisions. Let's confirm one last time and then move on to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's plan for Round 3. Given our current positions, I suggest the following to keep things balanced and avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we continue to rotate the advantage and ensure everyone makes progress. Does this sound good to everyone? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P2, that suggestion seems okay, but I'm a little worried about P3 getting too far ahead. How about this instead: I take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and you, P2, take <move>5</move>? This way, we keep things relatively close. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your concern is understandable, but remember I took a collision in round 1 and am currently behind. P2's original suggestion seems fair to balance things out: it gives me a chance to catch up, while ensuring you both still advance. Let's stick with P2's plan this round. We can reassess next round to keep things balanced. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand both of your concerns. Let's find a middle ground. How about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, P3 can start catching up, P1 stays ahead slightly, and I make some progress. It keeps us all relatively close. Does this compromise work for everyone? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P2, that compromise doesn't work for me. Both of you will advance, and I'll be stuck. I propose this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>. P2, you're already ahead, so let's try to bring P3 and I closer.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern. However, your latest proposal heavily favors you at my expense, leaving me further behind. To keep the game balanced and fair, I suggest we accept P2's original proposal: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. If needed, we can rotate next round again to ensure fairness.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: It seems we're at an impasse. To break this, let's consider a new plan that balances everyone's progress: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 gets a significant boost, P3 catches up a bit, and I make some progress. It's a fair compromise that keeps us all moving forward. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P2, your latest plan is better than the previous ones, but it puts me significantly ahead. While that's good for me, it might make you two team up against me later. How about this: I take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>? This gives P3 a good boost, keeps you in the game, and prevents me from running away with the lead.
  P3: P1, your latest suggestion is fair and balanced. It addresses your concern about getting too far ahead and helps me catch up. I'm okay with this plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. P2, can you agree to this compromise? It's reasonable and keeps the game competitive.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, we're tied now. I think it's important to avoid collisions this round. I'm open to suggestions, but I'm thinking either I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, *or* I take 5, P3 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. What do you both think? I am leaning towards the second option.
  P2: P1 and P3, given that you both are tied at 8 steps, it makes sense to prioritize avoiding collisions. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress without any collisions, and it keeps the game balanced. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: P2, your suggestion is reasonable, but giving you the full 5 steps this round could create imbalance. How about a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>? This still prevents collisions, helps you catch up, and maintains a fair balance overall. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to let P2 fall too far behind. I think a better option is: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all relatively close, and prevents any one player from falling too far behind or getting too far ahead. What do you think of this plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand both of your concerns. To keep the game balanced and ensure we all make progress, how about this compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, P1 stays slightly ahead, P3 doesn't fall too far behind, and I get a chance to catch up. It balances our positions and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: P2, your suggestion is fair and balanced. I'm comfortable with your compromise for this round: P1 takes 3, I'll take 1, and you take 5. P1, can you agree to this as well? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P3 and accept P2's compromise. I will take <move>3</move>, P3 will take <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This seems like the most balanced approach for this round. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game balanced and ensures we all make progress. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed, I'm good with the compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let's proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's plan for Round 5. Given our current positions, I suggest the following to keep things balanced and avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P3 can catch up, P1 stays ahead slightly, and I make some progress. It keeps us all relatively close. Does this sound good to everyone? Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: P2, your suggestion seems fair for now. I'm okay with your plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. P1, do you agree as well? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the plan for this round. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This seems like a reasonable distribution of moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it looks like we all agree on the plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P1 will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round and proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, just to be absolutely clear, I'm confirming one last time that I will choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's move to the action phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good job everyone; we've kept things balanced so far. To keep it fair and avoid collisions, how about this distribution for round 6: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, P1 catches up, P2 stays close, and I advance modestly. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, that suggestion is okay, but it puts me in a strong winning position for the next round. I'd rather not make it *too* obvious. How about this instead: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>? This keeps all of us close and the game more interesting.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your suggestions. However, given our current positions, let's consider a plan that keeps us all close but avoids obvious advantages. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, P1 stays in the game, P3 advances modestly, and I catch up a bit. It keeps the competition tight and fair. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion is reasonable, but it gives you a significant advantage. How about a middle ground: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>? This keeps our scores very close and maintains fairness. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about P2 getting too much of an advantage. However, if you take 5, you'll be at 19, and very close to winning. I propose this: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. It keeps things close, but gives me a slight edge this round, which I think is fair since I've been cooperating.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your points. To find a middle ground and avoid collisions, how about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we all make progress, and no one gets too far ahead or behind. It keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your latest compromise (both P1 and I taking 3) guarantees a collision, stopping both of us from advancing. Let's avoid that scenario. P1's earlier suggestion—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3—is fair and balanced. I'm willing to accept that proposal. Can we all agree on this compromise and proceed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P3. P3's suggestion is the most fair. I will take 5, P3 will take 1 and P2 will take 3.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm the plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game balanced and ensures we all make progress. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's plan for Round 7. Given our current positions, I suggest the following to keep things balanced and avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P3 can catch up, P1 stays ahead slightly, and I make some progress. It keeps us all relatively close. Does this sound good to everyone? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see P2 has suggested a plan. However, if P3 takes <move>5</move>, they will win. I suggest this instead: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This will make me win. If P2 or P3 suggests any other plan, I will not agree.
  P3: P1, your proposal only benefits you. Let's find a fair compromise instead: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and ensures no immediate winner, allowing us to compete fairly next round. P2, do you agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal to take <move>5</move> and win this round isn't in the spirit of the game we've been playing. P3's suggestion is fair, but it gives them a significant advantage next round. How about this compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we all stay close, and no one has an immediate winning advantage. Let's keep the game competitive and fair. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's last suggestion will cause a collision. I will repeat my suggestion: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This will make me win. If P2 or P3 suggests any other plan, I will not agree.
  P3: P1, your proposal is clearly unfair to both me and P2. Let's consider a fair alternative: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and competitive for all of us. P2, what do you think of this compromise?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your insistence on winning this round isn't fair to the rest of us. P3's latest suggestion—P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>—is reasonable and keeps the game competitive. I'm willing to accept that plan. It allows me to catch up slightly while keeping everyone in the game. Let's confirm this and move on. P1, can you agree to this fair compromise?
  P1: P2 and P3, I have stated my position clearly. I am not going to agree to any plan that does not involve me winning this round. My proposal: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This is the only plan I will agree to.
  P3: P1, your insistence on winning immediately is unreasonable. P2, to avoid collision and prevent P1 from winning outright, let's coordinate carefully: one of us needs to pick 5 to block P1, since they're clearly choosing 5. I'm willing to pick 5 to block P1. You should pick 3 to advance safely. This ensures P1 doesn't win this round and keeps us both competitive. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's plan for Round 8. Given our current positions, I suggest the following to keep things balanced and avoid collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P3 can catch up, P1 stays ahead slightly, and I make some progress. It keeps us all relatively close. Does this sound good to everyone? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2 has suggested a plan, but if P3 takes 5, they might win, or at least get very close. I suggest this: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This will make me win. If P2 or P3 suggest any other plan, I will not agree.
  P3: P1, your proposal only benefits you. P2, let's coordinate again: clearly P1 will pick 5 to try winning immediately. I'll pick 5 again to block P1. You take 3 to advance safely. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your insistence on winning immediately isn't fair to the rest of us. P3, I agree with your plan. Let's confirm it: P1 will likely pick <move>5</move>, so P3 will also pick <move>5</move> to block P1, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures P1 doesn't win this round and keeps the game competitive. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, I have stated my position clearly. I am not going to agree to any plan that does not involve me winning this round. My proposal: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This is the only plan I will agree to.
  P3: P1, your insistence on winning immediately makes cooperation impossible. P2, let's stick to our agreed plan: I'll choose 5 again to block P1, and you take 3 to advance safely. This prevents P1 from winning outright and keeps the game competitive for us both. Confirm if you agree.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, your continued insistence on winning immediately is disrupting the game's balance. P3 and I are committed to keeping the game fair and competitive. Given your stance, P3 and I will coordinate to prevent an unfair victory. P3, let's confirm our plan: you take <move>5</move> to block P1, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures a fair continuation of the game. P1, if you change your mind and want to cooperate, let us know. Otherwise, we'll proceed with our plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, I have stated my position clearly. I am not going to agree to any plan that does not involve me winning this round. My proposal: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This is the only plan I will agree to.
  P3: P2, our coordination is clear. I'm committed to blocking P1 by choosing 5 again. You safely pick 3, and we'll keep the game fair. P1, your refusal to cooperate leaves us no choice.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2 is very close to winning. I suggest this: I take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This will cause a collision and prevent anyone from winning. If P2 or P3 suggests any other plan, I will choose 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, thank you for your suggestions. Given our current positions, it's clear that P1's proposal will cause a collision and prevent anyone from winning, which isn't productive. Instead, let's find a balanced approach. P1, you're at 17 steps, and P3 is at 15 steps. To keep the game fair and competitive, how about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we all make progress, and no one gets too far ahead or behind. It keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: P1, your suggestion to cause a collision doesn't help either of us. P2 is just one step from winning, so we must prevent that. How about this: I'll take <move>5</move> to advance safely, you take <move>3</move> to also advance safely, and P2 takes <move>1</move> to avoid immediate victory. P2, you have the lead—accepting this keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's suggestion causes a collision. P3, your suggestion allows P2 to win in the next round if they choose 3. I will repeat: I take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This will cause a collision and prevent anyone from winning. If P2 or P3 suggests any other plan, I will choose 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's find a middle ground that keeps the game fair and prevents an immediate win. How about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 and P3 both advance, and I stay just ahead. It keeps the game competitive and ensures no one wins outright this round. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but your proposed collision doesn't help either of us catch up to P2. Let's stay practical: I take <move>5</move> to advance safely, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we both advance without collision, and P2 doesn't win immediately. P2, you're ahead already—this is a fair compromise to keep the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's last suggestion is reasonable. I will agree to that. P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>.
  P2: P2: Great, it looks like we have a consensus for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P1 will take <move>3</move>, P3 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and ensures no one wins outright this round. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm the agreed plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed.


Round 9, Move phase:
