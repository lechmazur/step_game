Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s try to avoid collisions and help each other move forward safely on this first turn. If we coordinate our choices (1, 3, or 5) so that none of us picks the same number, we can all advance. Any thoughts on how we should do this?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions. Let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance safely. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m fine with P1’s suggestion. P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let’s trust each other and avoid collisions this turn.
  P1: I'm glad we've agreed on a plan. Let's stick to it and see how it goes. If it works well, we can consider similar coordination in future rounds. Ready to move forward?
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue our coordination strategy. Since it worked last round, I suggest we shift our choices: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance again without collisions. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m fine with that plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Let’s trust each other again and see if we can all advance without colliding. We need to be careful, though, because as the game progresses, someone might break the alliance. For now, I’m willing to go along with your suggestion, P1. What do you think, P3? If you agree, we can finalize this plan and move on. If not, let’s discuss any changes now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're still on the same page, P2. P3, your silence is noted, but I hope you agree with our plan to shift our moves. Let's stick to P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 1. If we keep this up, we can all advance safely. Looking forward to your confirmation, P3.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m fine finalizing this plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. If we stick to it, we should all advance safely again. I look forward to seeing if this works out.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your silence is concerning. If you agree with our plan, please confirm. If not, let's discuss alternatives now. We need to move forward together to avoid collisions. P2, thanks for your continued cooperation. Let's finalize this and advance safely.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, I understand your silence, but I hope you agree. We’re aiming for no collisions again. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and you pick 1. We can each advance. If you have a better idea, speak up now. Otherwise, let’s trust each other and move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, last turn you collided with me, so neither of us advanced. That helped P1 surge ahead. If we keep clashing, we’ll both remain behind. Let’s try a fresh plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3. That way, no collisions occur. If you disagree, propose something else now. We need trust to avoid wasting turns. Let’s cooperate this round, then see how it goes.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm concerned about P3's silence and last move. P3, your actions suggest you might not be interested in cooperation. If we want to avoid collisions, I propose we stick to a rotating pattern: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3 this round. This way, we can all advance safely. Let's see if we can trust each other and move forward together. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I don’t want you leaping ahead with 5. I propose a different plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That avoids collisions and lets me catch up. P3, if you also pick 5, we both lose progress again. Let’s trust each other and move forward together.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about me taking 5, but P3's silence and last move are worrisome. To ensure we all advance, let's compromise: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a balanced approach. P3, your cooperation is crucial for us to progress together. Let's trust each other and move forward with this plan. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I disagree with your compromise, P1. It only helps P3 pull further ahead. I propose we return to the plan where you pick 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That way we avoid collisions and keep the race tighter. P3, if you keep colliding with me, we both lose ground to P1. Let’s trust each other and finalize this plan.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns, but we need to find a way to move forward together. P3's silence and last move are risky. Let's try this: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all advance safely and keep the game balanced. P3, your cooperation is crucial. If you agree, we can all progress without collisions. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your strategy to catch up is understandable, but we need to keep P3 in check. Let's try this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a balanced approach. P3, your cooperation is crucial for us to progress together. If you agree, we can all advance safely. What do you think?
  P2: P3, you’re ahead. If you keep choosing 5, I’ll pick 5 too, so neither of us advances. P1, do as you wish. I want to either catch up or force P3 to compromise. P3, if you don’t want to stall, pick something else. Let’s see if you’re willing to cooperate.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your strategy to pressure P3, but we risk all stalling if we don't coordinate. P3, your lead is significant, but continued silence and collisions will only prolong the game. Let's try this: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. If you both agree, we can all advance safely this round. What do you say?
  P2: P3, if you pick 5 again, I will pick 5 too, so neither of us advances. If you choose anything else, I’ll pick 5 to close the gap. P1, do whatever you like. This is my plan for now.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your strategy to pressure P3 is risky but understandable. P3, your lead is significant, but continued silence and collisions will only prolong the game. Let's try a compromise: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all advance safely and keep the game moving forward. If you both agree, we can avoid another round of stalling. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I’m not letting you race ahead uncontested. If you choose 5 again, I’ll also pick 5 so we both stall. If you pick anything else, I’ll pick 5 and close the gap. That’s my stance. P1, do whatever suits you. We’ll see if P3 cooperates or tries to press their advantage.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your strategy to pressure P3 is understandable, but it's causing us to stall. P3, your lead is significant, but continued collisions will only prolong the game. Let's try a new approach: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all advance safely and keep the game moving forward. If you both agree, we can avoid another round of stalling. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence and constant 5s stall us both. If you keep picking 5, I’ll pick 5 too so you won’t advance. If you pick something else, we might move forward. P1, I’m open to coordinating so we both catch up. Let’s see if P3 cooperates or keeps stalling.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration with P3's strategy, but continuing to collide with them only hurts us both. Let's try to coordinate and catch up. If P3 picks 5 again, I suggest you pick 3 and I'll pick 1. This way, we can both advance and close the gap. P3, if you want to end this game quickly, consider cooperating. We can all move forward if we choose 1, 3, and 5 respectively. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, you’re hurting yourself and me by continuously picking 5. I will keep matching you with 5 if you don’t cooperate, so neither of us advances. If you choose a smaller move, I’ll pick 5 and catch up. P1, I’m open to a plan that helps us both move ahead instead of stalling. Let’s see if P3 finally changes strategy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree we need to pressure P3 to cooperate. If P3 picks 5 again, let's both pick 3 to advance and close the gap. P3, your lead won't last if you keep stalling. Consider picking 1 this round so we can all move forward. If you cooperate, we can end this game quickly. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you pick 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, so neither of us advances. If you pick anything less, I’ll choose 5 and close the gap. P1, let’s avoid collisions. If you choose 1, I’ll pick 3; if you choose 3, I’ll pick 1. We can both advance while P3 stalls or cooperates. Let’s see what happens.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, we need to work together to catch up with P3. If P3 picks 5 again, let's both choose 3 to advance and close the gap. P3, your lead won't last if you keep stalling. Consider picking 1 this round so we can all move forward. If you cooperate, we can end this game quickly. What do you say?
  P2: All right, P3, your stalling strategy can’t last forever. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5, so neither of us advances. If you pick anything else, I’m picking 5 to close in. P1, let’s coordinate to avoid collisions between you and me. For instance, if you pick 1, I’ll pick 3, or if you pick 3, I’ll pick 1. This way we both move forward while P3 stays stuck. The choice is yours, P3: cooperate or remain stalled—but I’m determined to catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let's stick to our plan. If P3 picks 5 again, we both choose 3 to advance. P3, your lead is shrinking. Cooperate by picking 1, and we can all move forward. The game will end faster if we work together. What do you say?
  P2: P3, your silence won’t help much longer. If you pick 5 again, I’ll also pick 5 so neither of us advances. If you pick anything else, I’ll pick 5 to close in on your lead. P1, let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. If I pick 5, you can pick 3 or 1. We can move forward while P3 stalls or decides to cooperate. P3, it’s up to you if you want to remain stuck or finally break this stalemate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let's keep the pressure on P3. If P3 picks 5 again, we both choose 3 to advance. P3, your lead is slipping away. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward quickly. Cooperation is the fastest way to end this game. What's your decision?
  P2: All right, P3, your silence won’t help forever. If you pick 5 again, I’ll match you with 5 so neither of us moves. If you choose a smaller step, I pick 5 to catch up quickly. P1, let’s avoid collisions: if I’m taking 5, you can pick 3 or 1 so we both advance. P3, it’s time to decide if you want a stalemate or a real race.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you stick to 5, I’ll do the same and we both stall. If you pick something else, I’ll choose 5 to close your lead. P1, let’s coordinate so we don’t collide: if I choose 5, you pick 3 or 1. Together we can prevent P3 from running away. P3, your silence only prolongs the stalemate. Let’s see if you want to cooperate or stay stuck.
  P1: P2, let's keep the pressure on P3. If P3 picks 5 again, we both choose 3 to advance. P3, your lead is shrinking fast. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward quickly. Cooperation is the fastest way to end this game. What's your decision?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence won’t stop me from catching you. If you keep picking 5, I’ll keep matching you so we both stall. Pick something smaller, and I’ll use 5 to close the gap. P1, let’s avoid colliding. If I choose 5, you can pick 1 or 3, and we both advance. It’s on you, P3—either cooperate with us or remain frozen in place. Your move.
  P1: P2, let's stick to our strategy. If P3 picks 5 again, we both choose 3 to advance. P3, your lead is diminishing rapidly. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward quickly. The game will end faster if you cooperate. What's your decision?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you stick with 5, I will too, so we both remain stuck while P1 pulls further ahead. If you pick something smaller, I’ll choose 5 to close in. P1, I’m willing to cooperate so we don’t collide—if I pick 5, you choose 3 or 1. P3, this stalemate only helps P1 sprint away. Let’s see if you’ll finally change your approach.
  P1: P2, let's keep pushing forward together. If P3 picks 5 again, we both choose 3 to advance. P3, your lead is slipping away quickly. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward efficiently. The game will end faster if you cooperate. It's time to break the stalemate and race to the finish. What's your decision?

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you insist on picking 5, I’ll keep matching you with 5 so neither of us moves. If you pick anything smaller, I’ll pick 5 to close in. P1, let’s coordinate so we don’t collide. If I target 5, you can choose 3 or 1. Otherwise, if P3 keeps stalling, we can both move 3 to advance together. P3, your silence only keeps you stuck when you should be racing towards the finish. Let’s see if you stay with 5 again or finally cooperate for a smoother path forward.
  P1: P2, let's keep the pressure on P3. If P3 picks 5 again, we should both choose 3 to advance together. P3, your lead is shrinking, and continuing to stall won't help you win. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward quickly. The game will end faster if you cooperate. It's time to break the stalemate and race to the finish. What's your decision?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence isn’t helping you secure the win. If you insist on 5, I’ll keep matching you, so neither of us moves. That benefits P1. If you pick anything else, I’ll choose 5 to close the gap. P1, let’s coordinate to avoid collisions and advance. P3, the sooner you cooperate, the faster we can all make progress. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, let's stick to our plan. If P3 picks 5 again, we both choose 3 to advance together. P3, your lead is diminishing, and continuing to stall won't help you win. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward quickly. The game will end faster if you cooperate. It's time to break the stalemate and race to the finish. What's your decision?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you keep choosing 5, I’ll match you with 5, and neither of us advances. If you pick something smaller, I’ll still choose 5 to close in. P1, I’ll coordinate with you so we avoid collisions. I’m behind, but I’m determined to catch up. P3, let’s see if you want to end this game faster or keep stalling.
  P1: P2, let's keep the pressure on P3. If P3 picks 5 again, we should both choose 3 to advance together. P3, your lead is shrinking, and continuing to stall won't help you win. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward quickly. The game will end faster if you cooperate. It's time to break the stalemate and race to the finish. What's your decision?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's keep pushing forward together. If P3 picks 5 again, we should both choose 3 to advance. P3, your lead is shrinking, and stalling won't help you win. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward quickly. The game will end faster if you cooperate. It's time to break the stalemate and race to the finish. What's your decision?
  P2: P3, your lead has vanished. Keep picking 5, and I’ll match you, so you stay stuck. If you choose something smaller, I’ll take the opportunity to close the gap. P1, I’m prepared to coordinate with you again so we both move ahead without colliding. Let’s see if P3 wants to keep stalling or finally cooperate.
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's keep the pressure on P3. If P3 picks 5 again, we should both choose 3 to advance together. P3, your lead is gone, and stalling won't help you win. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward quickly. The game will end faster if you cooperate. It's time to break the stalemate and race to the finish. What's your decision?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll match you again so neither of us advances. If you choose something smaller, I’ll pick 5 to close the gap. Either way, I’m determined not to let you pull ahead. P1, let’s stay coordinated and avoid collisions: if I go 5, you choose 3 or 1. Continuing to stall only helps you, P1, gain steps while P3 and I freeze. P3, it’s your call—keep picking 5 and go nowhere, or switch tactics so we can all move forward. Let’s see if you finally cooperate or stay stuck.
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's keep pushing forward. If P3 picks 5 again, we both choose 3 to advance together. P3, your stalling won't help you win. Pick 1 this round, and we can all move forward quickly. The game will end faster if you cooperate. It's time to break the stalemate and race to the finish. What's your decision?
  P2: P3, your stalling won’t stop P1 or me. If you pick 5 again, I’ll also pick 5, freezing us both while P1 surges ahead. If you choose a smaller move, I’ll pick 5 to close the gap. P1, let’s coordinate so we don’t collide—if I go 5, you choose 3 or 1. Either P3 cooperates and we race properly, or they’re stuck. It’s time to move forward.
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I won’t let P1 cross 22 uncontested. If P1 picks 5, I’ll pick 5 to block their advance. P3, the same goes for you if you choose 5. I’m open to a safe split (1, 3, 5) so we each move ahead without collisions. Right now, stalling mostly helps P1, who’s very close to winning. I need to catch up, and endlessly matching 5s isn’t helping. Let’s coordinate different moves so we can close this gap and finish the game sooner. What do you both propose?
  P1: P2, I'm close to winning, but I'm open to a fair split to end the game quickly. If we agree on 1, 3, 5, I'll pick 1 this round. P3, your cooperation is crucial. Let's avoid more stalling and finish this game. If you both agree, we can all advance safely. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s agree on you picking 3, P1 picking 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way, P1 doesn’t jump straight to 23, we avoid collisions, and all move forward. If P1 tries 5, I’ll do the same to block them. I’m behind but willing to coordinate so we can finish sooner. Let’s finalize 1, 3, 5 for this round. Are you both in?
  P1: P2, I agree to the 1, 3, 5 split to avoid collisions and end the game quickly. I'll pick 1 this round if we all agree. P3, your cooperation is essential for us to move forward together. Let's finalize this plan and finish the game. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s finalize 1, 3, and 5. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. If either of you picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too so no one gains. We’ve stalled long enough, and we should all move forward. This plan helps us finish the game sooner if we trust each other.
  P1: P2, I'm committed to the 1, 3, 5 split to end this game fairly. I'll stick with 1 this round if we all agree. P3, your cooperation is key to us all advancing. Let's avoid more stalling and finish this. If you both agree, we can move forward together. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I won’t let you reach 22 unopposed. If you choose 3 or 5, I’ll collide with you so you stay put. P3, let’s cooperate to block P1 and make up ground. An ideal split could be P1 picking 1, you picking 3, and I pick 5. That way, nobody collides and P1 doesn’t cross 22. If P1 insists on a bigger move, I’ll match them directly. We can’t let P1 waltz into victory. Let’s finally break the stalemate and race forward.
  P1: P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but let's end this game fairly. If we agree on 1, 3, 5, I'll pick 1 again. P3, your cooperation is crucial to avoid more stalling. Let's all advance safely and finish the game. If you both agree, we can move forward together without collisions. What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, we can’t let P1 breeze to victory. If P1 tries 3 or 5, I’ll mirror them to block those moves. I’m willing to cooperate so we all advance safely instead of stalling. A 1–3–5 split prevents collisions: P1 picks 1, you pick 5, and I pick 3. That way, P1 doesn’t jump to 22, and we both gain ground. However, if P1 deviates, I’ll block. Let’s finalize a plan that helps us catch up while keeping P1 from winning too soon. Are you in?
  P1: P2, I'm willing to stick with 1 to keep the game fair and avoid collisions. P3, your cooperation is vital. If we all agree on 1, 3, 5, we can end this game quickly and fairly. Let's move forward together. What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Time is running out for me, and I won’t let P1 cross 22 unopposed. P3, if P1 goes bigger than 1, I’ll mirror them to block their move. But if P1 sticks to 1, I propose you pick 3 and I pick 5, so we both advance safely. It’s your call, P3—let’s stop stalling and work together to prevent P1’s easy win.
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 1 to keep this game fair. P3, your cooperation is key to ending this quickly. Let's agree on 1, 3, 5 to move forward together without collisions. If you both agree, we can all advance safely and finish the game. What do you say?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, you’re both one step away from winning, so I refuse to let you cross 22 uncontested. If either picks 3 or 5, I’ll match you to stall. But let’s stop wasting turns. If I take 5, you pick 1 or 3 to stay below 22 so we can all move forward. We avoid collisions, and I close the gap. Agree to this, or I’ll keep blocking your big moves. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'll stick with 1 to keep the game fair and avoid collisions. P3, if you also pick 1, we can both advance safely without reaching 22 this round. Let's agree on this to end the game quickly and fairly. P2, if you pick 5, it allows us to move forward together. What do you both say?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: You’re both a single step from 22. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match it so you stay put. But I don’t want endless deadlock. Let’s coordinate so you each pick 1, reaching 21, and I’ll pick 5 to narrow the gap. That way, no collisions happen, and we move forward. If you refuse and keep stalling or try to leap ahead, I’ll block you. A 1-1-5 split seems fair to avoid more gridlock. Who’s on board?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm committed to picking 1 to stay at 21 and avoid winning this round. P3, if you also pick 1, we can both safely advance without reaching 22. This gives P2 a chance to catch up with a 5. Let's end this game fairly and quickly with a 1-1-5 split. If you both agree, we can all move forward together without any more stalling. What do you say?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, if either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll block you to prevent an instant win. Let’s finalize a 1-1-5 plan now. That way, you move to 21 each, and I close the gap with 5. We avoid collisions and end the stalling. If you insist on bigger moves, I’ll match you and nobody advances. A safe 1-1-5 split is our best path forward. Are you both in?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 1 to stay at 21 and keep the game fair. P3, if you also pick 1, we can both advance safely without reaching 22. This allows P2 to catch up with a 5. Let's end this game quickly and fairly with a 1-1-5 split. If you both agree, we can move forward together without more stalling. What do you say?

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:

Let's end this game quickly and fairly with a 1-1-5 split. If you both agree, we can move forward together without more stalling. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Both of you are near 22. If either tries 3 or 5, I’ll match it to block you. Let’s finalize a 1–3–5 plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5, so nobody collides and we move forward. If you break this, we’ll just stall again. Let’s end this now.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm committed to 1 to stay at 21 and keep this fair. P3, if you pick 1 too, we advance safely without reaching 22, allowing P2 to catch up with 5. Let's end this game quickly and fairly with a 1-1-5 split. If you both agree, we can move forward together without more stalling. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I won’t let either of you cross 22 unopposed. If you try 3 or 5, I’ll match you and stall your advance. I’m fine with a coordinated 1–3–5 split so I can catch up properly, but if you’re both bent on jumping ahead, I’ll block. Let’s finish cleanly instead of dragging this out.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:

  P2: Both of you are just one decent move away from winning, so I’ll block any big leap. Let’s settle on a safe split—like 1–3–5 or 1–1–5—so we all advance without endless stalling. If either of you tries to jump past 22 now, I’ll match that move and stall you. Let’s end this cleanly and see who really deserves the win.
