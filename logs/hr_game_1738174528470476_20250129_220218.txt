Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions - it only hurts us all. I suggest we each pick different numbers this round. I'm willing to take 3 if others want to coordinate.
  P1: Sounds good P2. I'll take 1 then. P3, what number would you like?
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to avoid collisions. Let's keep coordinating like this to make sure we all progress. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the coordination. Since P1 chose 1 and P3 chose 5, I'll stick with my suggestion of taking 3. This way we all advance efficiently.
  P1: Sounds good everyone. Let's move with these choices.
  P3: Let's keep the coordination going. If we continue to choose different numbers, we can all progress steadily. For the next round, I suggest we rotate our choices. P1, would you be okay with taking 5 next? P2, you could take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we minimize the risk of collisions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that didn't go as planned - P3 said they'd pick 5 but chose 3 instead, causing a collision. This shows we can't fully trust each other's words. I suggest we each just pick our own numbers independently from now on, since coordination attempts seem futile.
  P1: I agree P2, after what happened last round, independent choices seem best. Let's just focus on our own moves.
  P3: I understand the frustration from the last round. However, independent choices might lead to more collisions. How about we try a partial coordination? I'll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we still have a plan but can adjust if needed. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given P3's previous deception, I don't trust their new suggestion. I'll make my own choice independently. Let's move forward without trying to coordinate - it's every player for themselves now.
  P1: Okay P2, I agree. Let's all play independently and make our own choices. I'll proceed with my move now.
  P3: I see the mistrust, but let's not give up on strategy altogether. To build back some trust, I'll stick to my previous statement and take <move>1</move> this round. If we all end up picking different numbers, great. If not, at least we're communicating openly. Let's try this and reevaluate next round. Thoughts?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Playing independently. I'll aim for 5 to maximize progress. Good luck.
  P2: I'm in the lead now, and I intend to stay there. Since P1 just announced they'll take 5, I'll avoid that number. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: I understand P1 and P2's strategy to play independently. However, I'm significantly behind, so I need to make a bold move. I'll aim for <move>5</move> this round to catch up. P1, you might want to reconsider your choice to avoid a collision. P2, you're in the lead, so playing defensively might be wise. Let's see how this round plays out. Good luck to both of you.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since P3 is also aiming for 5, and you said you'd avoid 5, maybe consider taking 1? I'm thinking of taking 3 to avoid collision with both of you. What do you think?
  P2: I don't trust any declarations about moves anymore - they've proven unreliable. Since I'm in the lead, I'll play to maintain my advantage. Make your choices wisely.
  P3: Given the current situation, I'm far behind and need to make significant progress. I'll stick to my plan and take <move>5</move>. P1 and P2, you both have a lead, so it might be strategic for you to choose lower numbers to avoid collisions and maintain your positions. Let's see how this round unfolds. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, to ensure at least some progress, I will take 3. If you take 1, we can both move. Otherwise, I risk collision with P3 if we both try to avoid 5.
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but I'll make my own strategic choice to maintain my lead. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P3: I understand the mistrust, but let's consider the math. P1 and P2, you both have a significant lead. If you continue to choose lower numbers, you'll still progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. I'm far behind and need to take bigger steps. Sticking to my plan of taking <move>5</move> makes sense for me. If you both choose 1 or 3, we can all advance without collision. Think about it. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's reassess. I'm still behind, so I need to make strategic moves to catch up. I suggest we try a partial coordination again. P1, you could take <move>3</move>, and P2, you could take <move>1</move>. I'll take <move>5</move> to close the gap. This way, we can all progress without collisions. If we continue to play independently, we risk more collisions, which helps no one. Thoughts?
  P2: Given my lead, I need to play strategically. P3's suggestions have been unreliable before, and they're clearly trying to catch up now. I'll make my own choice based on game theory and my position. Let's proceed without coordination attempts.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, even though coordination has been shaky, to ensure at least some progress for myself, I'm considering taking <move>1</move>. P2, if you are truly avoiding 5 as you mentioned, perhaps consider <move>3</move>? P3, if you are set on 5, then this leaves <move>3</move> open for P2 and <move>1</move> for me to avoid collision. Let's aim for at least partial progress this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're right to be strategic, but consider this: if you take <move>5</move>, you risk collision with me, and if you take <move>1</move>, you collide with P1. Taking <move>3</move> seems safe and maintains your lead. P1, sticking to <move>1</move> makes sense for you. I'll take my chances with <move>5</move> to catch up. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P2: Since my lead is crucial, I need to play smart. P1 and P3 are both telegraphing their moves, but I've learned not to fully trust these declarations. I'll make my choice based on maintaining my advantage. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: Okay P2, to be clear, I am still considering taking <move>1</move> to try and ensure I make some progress. If you are truly avoiding 5 as you mentioned, taking <move>3</move> would let us both move forward regardless of what P3 does. Just a thought to maximize our chances of advancing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, let's wrap this up. P1, you're set on <move>1</move>, and P2, you're likely to avoid <move>5</move> given your lead. I'll stick to my plan and take <move>5</move> to catch up. P2, if you're strategic, taking <move>3</move> ensures you progress without collision. Let's move forward with these choices. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: I understand both of your positions, but I need to maintain my lead. Since you're both being very open about your moves, I'll consider that information carefully in my decision. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: P2, for clarity, I am indeed taking 1 to ensure I move forward.  If you take 3, we both progress regardless of P3's move. This seems like the most reliable way for both of us to make progress this round given the uncertainty.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, to avoid potential collision with P3 who seems set on 5, maybe consider taking 1 this round? I will take 3. This way, if P3 indeed takes 5, we can both progress. What do you think?
  P3: P2, you're still in the lead, and P1 has a good point about avoiding collisions. If you take <move>1</move> and I stick to <move>5</move>, we can all move forward. P1, your choice of <move>3</move> seems solid. Let's minimize collisions and keep the game moving. Good luck!
  P2: Since I have a solid lead at 11 steps, I need to play defensively to maintain my advantage. P1 and P3's suggestions are noted, but given past experiences, I'll make my own strategic choice. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, just confirming again, I'm planning to choose 3. If you choose 1, we both make progress for sure, no matter what P3 does. This seems like the safest way for us to both advance given the current situation.
  P3: P2, you're far ahead, and P1 is planning to take 3. If you take 1, you both progress. I'll stick to 5 to catch up. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Good luck!
  P2: I understand both of your suggestions, but as the leader I need to be cautious. P1 has been consistent about taking 3 this round, while P3 claims they'll take 5. I'll factor this information into my decision, but won't commit to any specific number. Let's move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, as I said, I'm taking 3.  For both of us to make progress, 1 is the clear best choice for you this round given P3's stated move of 5.  It guarantees you move forward and maintain your lead. Let's both secure some steps.
  P3: P2, you're far ahead and need to play defensively. P1 is committed to 3, so if you take 1, you both progress. I'll stick to 5 to catch up. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input, but as the leader I need to make my own strategic choice to protect my advantage. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given my lead at 12 steps, I'm close to winning. P3 has caught up to 11 steps, while P1 is at 8. I need to play carefully to maintain my advantage and secure victory. Let's see how everyone approaches this crucial round.
  P3: P2, you're very close to winning, and I'm right behind you. P1 is a bit further back. To ensure you maintain your lead, P2, you might want to consider taking <move>1</move> again. P1, you could take <move>3</move> to catch up a bit. I'll go for <move>5</move> to close the gap with P2. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's play strategically and keep the game moving. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you are leading. P3 is likely going for 5 to catch up. To maintain your lead, maybe avoid 5? I will take 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since I'm just one step ahead of P3 and they're likely to go for 5, I need to be very careful with my choice. P1's suggestion to avoid 5 makes sense. I'll consider that in my final decision, but won't commit to any specific number. Let's proceed.
  P3: P2, you're right to be cautious. Given your lead and P3's close position, taking <move>1</move> seems like the safest bet to maintain your advantage. P1, sticking to <move>3</move> is a good call to ensure progress. I'll continue with <move>5</move> to try and close the gap. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, since you are concerned about maintaining your lead, and P3 is likely going for 5, taking 1 or 3 seems safest for you.  I'm still planning to take 3. If you take 1, we both make progress and you maintain your lead over P3. Let's both ensure we move forward this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand everyone's positions clearly. Since I'm so close to winning, I need to make a careful choice to maintain my lead, especially with P3 right behind me. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P3: P2, you're right at the finish line, and I'm just one step behind. P1 is further back but still in the game. To secure your win, P2, consider taking <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. P1, you could take <move>3</move> to ensure progress. I'll go for <move>5</move> to close the gap. This way, we all move, and you, P2, maintain your lead. Let's play smart and keep the game moving. Good luck!
  P1: P2, as I said, I'm taking 3. To maintain your lead over P3 and ensure we both progress, choosing 1 seems like your best option this round. Let's both move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is very close to winning, so I expect P3 to choose 5 to try and finish the game. To prevent P3 from winning immediately, I will also choose 5 this round to force a collision. P2, you are also close to winning, so to ensure you make progress while I block P3, I suggest you choose either 1 or 3. This way, at least one of us can move forward and prevent P3 from running away with the game this turn.
  P2: Since I'm at 13 steps and P3 is at 16, I need 6 more steps to win while P3 only needs 3. P1's strategy to block P3 with 5 makes sense. I'll consider taking 3 this round to get closer while avoiding the collision at 5. Let's proceed carefully.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the strategy to block me, but remember, collisions help no one in the long run. I'm close to winning, so I'll be aggressive. I'm considering <move>5</move> again to end this. P1, if you also pick 5, we collide, and P2 gains an advantage. P2, if you take <move>3</move>, you're one step from winning. P1, reconsider and take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to ensure some progress. Let's all play smart. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you are right, collisions hurt everyone, but letting you win hurts me most! P2 is also closer to winning than I am.  To stop you from winning this round, I will choose <move>5</move>. P2, if you want to win, taking <move>3</move> is a good option to move forward while I block P3. Let's prevent P3 from winning immediately.
  P2: P1's strategy to block P3 with 5 aligns with my interests. Since I need 6 more steps to win and P3 only needs 3, preventing their immediate victory is crucial. I'll take advantage of this situation and make my own strategic move. Let's proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your strategy to block me, but remember, I only need 3 more steps to win. If you both try to block me with <move>5</move>, you risk a collision, and neither of you will progress. P2, you're close to winning too, but P1, you're further behind. If you both pick different numbers, you can both progress and maybe catch up. Think carefully, as blocking me might not be the best long-term strategy for either of you. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I am indeed picking 5 to block you from winning this round. P2, as I said, taking 3 is a good option for you to move forward while I block P3. Let's prevent P3 from winning this turn.
  P2: I understand everyone's positions clearly. P1 is committed to blocking P3 with 5, while P3 still aims for victory. Since I'm in a strong position but need to catch up, I'll make my own strategic choice to maximize my chances of winning. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's be realistic. I'm very close to winning, and blocking me this round only delays the inevitable. P1, you're far behind, and P2, you're close but not there yet. If you both pick different numbers, you can at least make some progress. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> to end this. Think about your long-term strategy. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, both at 16 and close to winning. To avoid a tie and to ensure at least some progress, I suggest we pick different numbers. P2, take 3, I'll take 1, and P3 take 5. This way, everyone moves forward this round.
  P3: P1's suggestion makes sense for a fair and strategic round. P2, if you take <move>3</move>, you'll be at 19 and win. I'll stick to <move>5</move> to secure my win as well. P1, taking <move>1</move> ensures you progress. This way, we all move forward, and the two closest to winning make decisive moves. Let's play smart and wrap this up. Good luck!
  P2: Since both P3 and I are at 16 steps, this is likely the final round. While P3 suggests I take 3 to win, I can't trust their commitment to any move given past deceptions. I need to make my own strategic choice to secure victory. Let's proceed carefully.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, given your caution, and P3 suggesting you take 3 to win, consider that P3 might aim for 5 to win themselves. To be safe and control the outcome, perhaps take 1. I will take 3. This way, if P3 does go for 5, you are safe from collision and still progress towards a win next round.
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but consider this: if you take <move>1</move>, you'll be at 17 steps, and I'll likely take <move>5</move> to win. P1 is suggesting they'll take <move>3</move>, which won't affect your move. However, if you take <move>3</move>, you win outright. I'm committed to <move>5</move> to secure my victory. Let's end this game decisively. Good luck!
  P2: I need to win this round since P3 is likely to take 5. P1 suggests I take 1 while P3 wants me to take 3. Given my position tied with P3, I need to make the optimal choice to secure victory. I'll factor in both suggestions but make my own strategic decision. Let's proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both at 16 and can win this round. If you both choose 5 to try and win, you will collide and neither of you will progress. To avoid this, perhaps consider choosing different numbers this round to ensure at least one of you progresses towards a win.  I will choose my move based on what you both decide.
  P3: P2, you're tied with me at 16 steps, and we both need to make decisive moves to win. I'm committed to taking <move>5</move> to secure my victory. If you take <move>3</move>, you win outright. P1 is suggesting they'll take <move>3</move>, which won't affect your move. However, if you take <move>1</move>, you'll be at 17 steps, and I'll likely win with <move>5</move>. Consider your options carefully. Let's end this game decisively. Good luck!
  P2: Given that P3 keeps insisting they'll take 5 to win, I need to make a decisive move. Both P1 and P3 have been clear about their intentions, though P3's past actions haven't always matched their words. Since this is likely the final round, I'll make my choice based on game theory and my position tied with P3. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 19 steps
