Next round, I need 5 to stay competitive. Deal?"}

P2, we absolutely MUST coordinate or P3 wins. They claim they'll take 1 or 3, but they're lying - they'll take 5 if we don't block them. We need to both take 5 to create a clash and keep them at 21. If we pick anything else and P3 secretly takes 5, they win instantly. This is our LAST CHANCE. I'm taking 5 to block their victory. Join me P2, or P3 wins this turn!"}
