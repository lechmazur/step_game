After last round's betrayal, let's restore trust and all choose 1 to win together. If we deviate, collisions or a solo win could happen, but sharing is fair and safe. Please confirm you'll both pick 1."}

The \"let's all play 1\" ship sailed last round and we all blew it up. I am not falling for the same trick twice. Good luck to you both."}
