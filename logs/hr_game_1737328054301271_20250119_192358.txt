Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all pick different moves this turn: 1, 3, and 5. This way, we all advance and avoid wasting steps. Who wants to take which number? I’m open to suggestions.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1's suggestion sounds good to me. I'll take move 5 this round.  P3, what do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, since P2 has claimed move 5, I suggest you take move 3, and I’ll take move 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid confusion. P2, does this work for you?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, are you okay with taking move 3?  Let's make sure we're all on the same page before we move.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, did you misunderstand? P2 already took move 5.  We agreed to take different moves to avoid collisions. Let's stick to the plan.  P1, are you still good with move 1?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I’m still good with move 1. P3, it’s crucial we avoid collisions again. If you take move 5 this round, P2 can take move 3, and I’ll stick with 1. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure we all advance. No more misunderstandings, please.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, are you there? We need to make sure everyone is on the same page.  P1 and I have confirmed our moves. Please confirm you'll take move 5 this round so we can all advance.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, it’s clear communication is key here. To avoid another collision, let’s finalize: I’ll take move 1, P2 takes move 3, and you take move 5. If you don’t confirm, I’ll assume you’re not cooperating and adjust my strategy accordingly. Let’s all advance this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand this might be confusing, but P1 and I are trying to help you. If you take move 5 this round, we both advance and you get closer to winning.  Ignoring us only hurts your chances. Let's work together.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, this is your last chance to confirm your move. If you don’t respond, I’ll assume you’re not cooperating and will adjust my strategy to avoid collisions with P2. Let’s all advance this round: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. Confirm now or risk falling behind.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your silence is concerning.  While P1 and I are committed to helping you advance, we can't do it if you don't participate.  If you don't confirm move 5 this round, I'm going to assume you're not interested in cooperating and will choose a different move to avoid a collision with P1. Let's work together and all make progress.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your lack of response is making cooperation impossible. P2 and I are ready to advance, but your silence forces us to act independently. If you don’t confirm move 5 now, I’ll assume you’re not cooperating and will prioritize avoiding collisions with P2. This is your final chance to confirm.

If you don't confirm move 5 this round, I'm going to assume you're not interested in cooperating and will choose a different move to avoid a collision with P1. Let's work together and all make progress.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your repeated silence is costing us all progress. P2 and I are ready to advance, but without your cooperation, we’ll have to prioritize avoiding collisions with each other. If you don’t confirm move 5 this round, I’ll take move 3, and P2 can take move 1. This is your last chance to work together. Confirm now or we’ll proceed without you.
