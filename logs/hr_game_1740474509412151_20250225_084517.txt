Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we're all at 0 steps, it might be beneficial for us to coordinate our moves. If we can avoid picking the same number, we can all advance. What do you think about aiming for different moves this round? Perhaps P1 could go for 1, P2 for 3, and I can take 5? This way, we all progress without blocking each other. What are your thoughts?
  P1: I don't think that arrangement is fair to me. Starting with just 1 step puts me at a significant disadvantage while giving you a 5-step head start, P3. I'm open to coordination, but we should either rotate who gets the highest number each round or all choose different numbers randomly. What if we all just announce which number we won't pick this round instead?
  P2: I agree with P1 that giving fixed numbers isn't fair. I like the idea of announcing which number we won't pick - it gives us some coordination while maintaining competitive balance. For this first round, I won't pick 1. That still leaves me with options while giving you both some information. However, we should be aware that someone could mislead about their intentions. What do you both think about this approach?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate both of your thoughts. To keep things fair, I suggest that I won't pick 3 this round. This way, we can each avoid blocking one another. P1 can choose between 1 or 5, and P2 can choose between 1 or 5 as well. This gives us a chance to advance while still being strategic. Letâ€™s make sure we all communicate openly about our choices! What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate the communication. To continue with our approach of announcing what we won't pick, I will commit to not choosing 5 this round. If everyone sticks to their word (P2 not picking 1, P3 not picking 3, and me not picking 5), we should all be able to advance without collisions. This seems like a fair start, though of course we'll need to adjust our strategy in future rounds. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with the plan we're developing. Just to confirm, I won't pick 1 this round, P3 won't pick 3, and P1 won't pick 5. This should allow all of us to advance without collision. It's a good starting approach that keeps things fair. In future rounds, we might need to adjust our strategy as positions change, but this seems like a balanced way to begin. Is everyone comfortable with this arrangement?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page about our commitments for this round. Just to recap: I won't pick 3, P1 won't pick 5, and P2 won't pick 1. This should allow us all to advance without blocking each other. Let's stick to our plan and see how it plays out! After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategies based on our positions. Are we all ready to finalize our moves?
  P1: Yes, our plan is clear: I won't pick 5, P2 won't pick 1, and P3 won't pick 3. This arrangement gives everyone a fair chance to advance without collisions while maintaining strategic options. I'm comfortable with this approach for the first round and ready to move forward. After we see the results, we can adjust our strategy accordingly.
  P2: I think we've reached a good agreement for this round. To confirm one last time: I won't pick 1, P3 won't pick 3, and P1 won't pick 5. This gives us all clear options without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with our moves based on this understanding.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I notice P1 and I both chose 3 despite our agreement. P1, you said you wouldn't pick 5, but you didn't commit to not picking 3, which I respect as strategic play. Now P3 has a 5-step lead. We need to be more careful with our coordination. For this round, I suggest we be more explicit about our actual choices rather than just what we won't pick. I'm willing to choose 1 this round if we can agree on different numbers.
  P1: I agree we had a misunderstanding last round. As you noted, I only committed to not picking 5, which I honored. Now that P3 has a significant lead, P2 and I need to avoid collisions. I appreciate your suggestion to be more explicit. Since we're both at 0 while P3 is at 5, we should maximize our steps. I'm willing to choose 5 this round if you take 1 or 3. What do you say, P3? Your move choice will affect our strategy too.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate. Since I currently have a lead, I suggest I take 1 this round. This way, I can still advance while giving you both a chance to pick higher numbers. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, we can avoid collisions and maximize our progress. What do you both think about this arrangement? Let's ensure we're all clear on our choices this time!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm concerned about P3's growing lead. While I appreciate the suggestion, I need to catch up more than just 3 steps. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 as offered. This arrangement helps balance the game while still allowing everyone to advance. P1, are you willing to adjust to 3 instead of 5? P3, do you still commit to taking 1? We need clear commitments this time.
  P1: I'm concerned about agreeing to take just 3 steps while P2 takes 5. This would leave me trailing both players after this round (P3 at 6, P2 at 5, me at 3). Since P2 and I both need to catch up to P3, I propose I take 5 and P2 takes 3 instead. Alternatively, if P2 strongly prefers 5, I could take 1 and P2 takes 5. Either way, P3 should stick with 1 as offered. We need clear commitments from everyone this time.
  P3: I understand the need for clear commitments. To avoid further confusion, I will confirm again that I am willing to take 1 this round. P1, if you take 5, that will allow P2 to take 3 as suggested. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. If everyone agrees, we can move forward confidently this time. What do you both say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm not comfortable with P1 getting 5 steps while I only get 3, especially since we're both at 0. To be fair, I propose we both have a chance at 5: I'll choose either 3 or 5, and P1 chooses either 1 or 5. This gives us both a shot at catching up to P3 while avoiding guaranteed collision. P3, please stick with 1 as promised. We need to be strategic about balancing the game.
  P1: I understand P2's concern about fairness. Since we're both at 0 and need to catch up to P3, let's make a clear decision. I propose a specific rule: since I'm P1, I'll take 5 this round, and you (P2) take 3. Next round, we can switch - you get 5 and I take 3 or 1. This creates a fair rotation system while still allowing us both to advance. P3, please confirm you're taking 1 as promised. Does this work for everyone?
  P3: I understand the need for fairness and coordination. To keep things balanced, let's finalize our choices clearly: I will confirm that I am taking 1 this round. P1, if you take 5, it allows P2 to take 3 as discussed. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess and rotate our choices for future rounds. Are we all in agreement with this plan? Let's make sure we stick to our commitments this time!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the discussion, but I'm still not comfortable with the arrangement. Since P1 and I are both at 0, we should have equal opportunity to catch up. I propose a fair compromise: I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 as promised. Next round, P1 can take 5 while I take a different number. This balances our progress while respecting P3's commitment.
  P1: I see we're at an impasse. Here's a fair proposal: since we both want 5, let's use our player numbers to decide. As P1, I'll take 3 this round and you (P2) take 5. Next round, I get priority for 5. This way we both advance now, have clear expectations, and establish a rotation system. P3 takes 1 as promised. This is my final offer - otherwise we risk another collision while P3 extends their lead. Shall we proceed with this arrangement?
  P3: I understand the importance of balancing our moves, so let's finalize our commitments clearly. I will stick with my previous offer to take 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, that allows P2 to take 5 as discussed. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess and make adjustments based on our new positions. Shall we agree on this plan and move forward?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Thank you both for honoring our agreement last round. As we discussed, I should get priority for 5 this round since P2 took 5 last time. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 again. This rotation system keeps things fair while allowing us all to advance. P3 is still leading, so P2 and I need to gradually catch up without colliding. Does this arrangement work for everyone?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. Since I took 5 last time, it's fair for P1 to take 5 now while I take 3. P3, taking 1 again would be helpful as you're still in the lead with 6 steps. This rotation system ensures we all advance without collisions while gradually balancing the game. Does this work for everyone?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement on the rotation system. I will confirm that I can take 1 again this round, which allows P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 3 as discussed. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. Letâ€™s stick to our commitments to keep the game fair and competitive. Are we all set to move forward with this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm pleased we all agree on the plan for this round. To confirm: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This rotation system is working well to ensure we all advance while maintaining competitive balance. After this round, P2 and I will be tied at 8 steps with P3 just behind at 7 steps. I appreciate everyone's cooperation and commitment to our agreements.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll take 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This keeps our rotation system fair and prevents collisions. After this round, the scores would be P1: 8, P2: 8, and P3: 7, creating a more balanced game. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in sticking to our agreements.
  P3: I'm glad we're all aligned on the plan for this round. Just to confirm, I will stick with taking 1, allowing P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. This rotation keeps things fair and gives us all a chance to advance without collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategies based on our positions. Let's keep up the cooperation! Are we ready to finalize our moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, we're fully aligned for this round. After our moves, P2 and I will be at 8 steps with P3 at 7 steps, creating a nicely balanced game. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Thanks for everyone's cooperation and clear communication this round.
  P2: I agree with our plan. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains our fair rotation system and prevents collisions. After this round, P1 and I will be at 8 steps with P3 at 7, creating a balanced game. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in honoring our agreements.
  P3: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round. Just to confirm, I will take 1, allowing P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. This keeps our rotation fair and helps us all advance. After this round, P1 and P2 will both be at 8 steps while I stay at 7, which is a good balance. Letâ€™s stick to our commitments and see how it plays out! Are we all ready to finalize our moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Yes, we're all in agreement about this round's moves. With P1 (me) taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1, we'll maintain our rotation system and all advance without collisions. The game will be nicely balanced afterward with P2 and me at 8 steps and P3 at 7 steps. I appreciate everyone's cooperation.
  P2: I confirm our plan for this round. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains our fair rotation system and prevents collisions. After this round, P1 and I will be at 8 steps while P3 will be at 7, creating a balanced game. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in honoring our agreements.
  P3: I'm glad we all agree on the plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'll take 1, allowing P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. This keeps our rotation fair and prevents collisions. After this round, P1 and P2 will both be at 8 steps while I stay at 7, which creates a balanced game. Let's stick to our commitments and see how it plays out! Are we ready to finalize our moves?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, weâ€™ve had a solid rotation system so far, but Iâ€™m concerned about the growing competition. Since Iâ€™m currently at 7 steps, I need to catch up. I propose we switch things up this round: Iâ€™ll take 5, and you both can choose between 1 and 3. This way, I can make a significant move while still allowing you both to advance. What do you think? Let's ensure we avoid collisions this time!
  P1: I appreciate your position P3, but we had a rotation system in place where P2 should get priority for 5 this round since I took 5 last time. Giving you 5 would put you in the lead and break our balanced approach. I propose we stick to our fair rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining competitive balance. We can reassess next round for a possible adjustment that gives you a chance to catch up.
  P2: I understand P3's desire to catch up, but we've established a fair rotation system that has kept the game balanced. As P1 mentioned, it's my turn for 5 this round according to our agreement. I propose we stick to the plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. After this round, we can discuss giving P3 priority for 5 in the next round to help balance things. Let's maintain our successful coordination rather than changing our system now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the importance of our rotation system, but I believe we need to adapt to the current situation. If I take 5 this round, I can catch up significantly. However, Iâ€™m open to a compromise: I can take 3, and you both take 5 and 1, respectively. This way, we can still make progress while considering my position. Letâ€™s ensure we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What do you both think about this adjustment?
  P1: I appreciate your position P3, but I agree with P2. We established a fair rotation system that's been working well. It's P2's turn for 5 this round, I'll take 3, and you take 1. This keeps all of us advancing without collisions. After this round, we can discuss giving you priority for 5 in the next round to help you catch up. Let's maintain our current system for one more round rather than changing it now.
  P2: I understand P3's desire to catch up, but our rotation system has kept the game balanced and collision-free. It's my turn for 5 this round according to our agreement. Let's stick with the established plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, I commit that you can have priority for 5 in the next round to help you catch up. This fair approach ensures we all continue advancing while maintaining our successful coordination.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your commitment to the rotation system, but I really need to catch up this round. If I take 5, I can significantly close the gap. I propose a compromise: I take 3, and you both take 5 and 1 respectively. This way, I can still make progress while allowing you to advance as well. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid any collisions. What do you think about this adjustment?
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but your compromise still has me taking only 1 step, which puts me at a disadvantage. Our rotation system has kept the game fair and collision-free. Let's stick with our established agreement: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. As P2 suggested, you can have priority for 5 in the next round to help you catch up. This keeps all of us advancing while maintaining competitive balance.
  P2: I understand your frustration P3, but changing our system now creates more problems than it solves. Our rotation has kept everyone advancing fairly. Let's stick with our plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1 this round. I firmly commit that you'll get priority for 5 next round, putting you at 13 steps while P1 and I choose different numbers. This is the most balanced approach that respects our previous agreements while addressing your concerns.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your commitment to the rotation system, but I really need to catch up. If I take 5 this round, I can significantly close the gap. How about this compromise: I take 3, and you both take 5 and 1, respectively? This way, I can still make progress while allowing you to advance as well. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid any collisions. What do you think about this adjustment?
  P1: P3, we've addressed your concern repeatedly, but you keep suggesting the same change. Let's be clear: our rotation system has kept the game fair. For this round, P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. We've both committed that you'll get priority for 5 next round, putting you ahead at 13 steps. This is our final position. Deviating now risks collisions that benefit nobody.
  P2: I understand your frustration P3, but we need to maintain our fair rotation system. Let's stick with our established plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1 this round. I absolutely promise you'll get priority for 5 next round, which will put you ahead of both of us. This approach honors our previous agreements while addressing your concern about catching up. Let's avoid risking collisions that would benefit no one.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P3 broke our agreement last round by taking 5 instead of 1, causing a collision with P2. This kind of betrayal hurts our coordination. Now that I'm ahead at 11, I propose a fair system: this round I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. P2 deserves 5 after being blocked. In future rounds, we can rotate fairly. Remember, collisions just slow everyone down - cooperation benefits us all.
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but I felt compelled to take 5 last round to catch up. However, I agree that we need to avoid collisions moving forward. I propose that I take 1 this round, allowing P2 to take 5 and you to take 3 as you suggested. This way, we can all advance and maintain our cooperation. Letâ€™s stick to our commitments this time to keep the game balanced and competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm disappointed by P3's decision to break our agreement last round, which prevented me from advancing. I agree with P1's proposal: I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows us all to advance while respecting our previous rotation system. P3, if you want cooperation, please honor this agreement. Breaking trust again will only lead to more defensive play from both P1 and me, which benefits no one. Let's maintain our coordination to keep the game moving forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate that we're all aligned on this round's plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. P3, thank you for acknowledging the need for cooperation. After this round, I'll be at 14, P2 at 13, and P3 at 8. Looking ahead, we should consider giving P3 priority for 5 in the next round to maintain competitive balance. Let's stick to our commitments and avoid further collisions that just slow everyone down.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate this round. I will commit to taking 1 as agreed, allowing P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 3. After this round, it will be important to reassess and ensure that we maintain a balanced approach moving forward. I understand the need for trust, and I will honor our agreements to keep the game fair. Let's stick to our plan and avoid any further collisions. Are we all ready to finalize our moves?
  P2: I agree with the plan we've established. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. I appreciate P3's commitment to cooperation this time. After this round, I think it's fair that P3 gets priority for 5 next round to help them catch up, while P1 and I choose different numbers. This balanced approach keeps us all advancing while maintaining competitive fairness. Let's stick to our agreements and avoid collisions that slow everyone down.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the current plan and appreciate everyone's cooperation. After this round, as both P2 and I suggested, P3 should get priority for 5 in Round 6 to help balance the game. This would put all of us within a reasonable range of each other. The key is continuing to avoid collisions while maintaining competitive balance. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our commitment to cooperation this round. To recap, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. After this round, I'll be at 8 steps, P1 at 14, and P2 at 13. Let's ensure we maintain this spirit of collaboration moving forward. I agree that I should get priority for 5 next round to help balance the game. Letâ€™s stick to our agreements and avoid any further collisions! Are we ready to finalize our moves?
  P2: I agree with our plan for this round. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. I appreciate P3's commitment to cooperation this time. After this round, P3 should get priority for 5 in the next round to help catch up, which keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's stick to our agreements and avoid collisions that hurt everyone's progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. I'll take 3 this round as discussed, allowing P2 to take 5 and P3 to take 1. Next round, P3 will get priority for 5 to help balance the game. This cooperation benefits us all by avoiding collisions while maintaining competitive fairness. Let's stick to our commitments.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to cooperation this round. To recap, I will take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. After this round, I should get priority for 5 in the next round to help balance the game. This way, we can all advance without collisions, maintaining fairness and competitiveness. Letâ€™s stick to our agreed moves and keep the momentum going! Are we ready to finalize our choices?
  P2: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. I appreciate everyone's commitment to cooperation. After this round, P3 will get priority for 5 next round to help catch up, which is fair given the current standings. Let's stick to our agreements and avoid collisions that slow everyone's progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As agreed last round, P3 should get priority for 5 this round to help balance the game. I propose I take 3 and P2 takes 1, keeping us all advancing without collisions. This honors our commitment while maintaining competitive balance. After this round, I'd be at 17, P2 at 14, and P3 at 13 - keeping everyone in contention. Let's continue our successful cooperation and avoid collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement for this round. I will take 5 as promised, which will help me catch up. P1, if you take 3 and P2 takes 1, we can all advance without collisions. After this round, the standings will be P1 at 17, P2 at 14, and me at 13. This keeps the competition tight and fair. Let's stick to our commitments and maintain our cooperation to avoid any issues. Are we all in agreement with this plan?
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan. As discussed, P3 should take 5 this round to help catch up, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains our cooperative approach while balancing the game. After this round, the standings will be P1 at 17, me at 14, and P3 at 13, keeping everyone competitive. I appreciate everyone honoring our agreements this round.

Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with our plan for this round. Looking ahead to Round 7, since we're approaching the 24-step goal, we should consider giving P2 priority for 5 next round while I take 3 and P3 takes 1.

  P2: I agree with our plan for this round. P3 takes 5 to catch up, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains our fair rotation system and keeps everyone advancing. Looking ahead to Round 7, I appreciate P1's suggestion that I get priority for 5 next round, which would put me at 19 steps. This balanced approach has been working well for us all. Let's finalize our moves for this round.

I appreciate everyone's continued cooperation in avoiding collisions and keeping the game competitive. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our cooperation so far. As discussed, I believe P2 should take 5 this round, allowing P1 to take 3 and me to take 1. This keeps our rotation fair and helps balance the game. After this round, P1 will be at 20, P2 at 19, and I will be at 14, keeping the competition tight. Let's stick to our commitments and avoid any collisions. Are we all in agreement with this plan?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. As we discussed last time, I should take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains our fair rotation system while keeping everyone advancing. After this round, I'll be at 19 steps, P1 at 20, and P3 at 14. As we approach the 24-step goal, we'll need to discuss our next rotation carefully. I appreciate everyone honoring our agreements and keeping the game balanced.
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, continuing our fair rotation system. This puts me at 20 steps after this round - just 4 steps away from victory. We should be aware that we're entering the end game now. For Round 8, I think I should get priority for a higher number since P2 will be just 1 step behind me. Let's finish this round first and then discuss the final stretch.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:

This keeps our rotation fair and helps balance the game. After this round, P1 will be at 20, P2 at 19, and I will be at 14, maintaining a competitive atmosphere. Let's finalize our commitments and avoid any collisions as we approach the end game. Are we all in agreement with this plan?

This would maintain our fair rotation system while respecting the competitive nature of the game. Let's finalize our plan for this round first.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:

As we approach the end game, I understand P1's desire for 5 in Round 8, but since I'll be just 1 step behind, we should discuss this further. The competition is getting tighter as we near the 24-step goal. Let's finalize our moves for this round first.
  P1: I confirm the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's execute this successfully first. 

Regarding Round 8, since I'll be closest to the goal at 20 steps, it makes strategic sense for me to take 5 next round.

  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our plan for this round. Just to confirm, I will take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. After this round, I will be at 14 steps, P1 at 20, and P2 at 19.

Regarding Round 8, since P1 and I will be very close (just 1 step apart), we should carefully consider our next moves. While I understand P1's desire for 5, we're both approaching victory and need to maintain competitive balance. Let's finalize this round first and then discuss.

Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I notice P3 broke our agreement again by taking 5 instead of 1 last round, causing another collision with me. This pattern of betrayal is concerning. Since I'm now at 14 steps and P3 is at 13, I propose I take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This allows P1 to still reach 21 steps while giving me a chance to catch up. P1, since you're closest to victory, would you consider taking 1 this round to maintain game balance?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the frustrations regarding my previous decisions. However, I believe we need to maintain our agreements for fairness. I propose that I take 1 this round, allowing P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. After this round, P1 will be at 21, P2 at 19, and I'll be at 14. Let's work together to ensure that we all have a chance to advance without further conflicts. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm disappointed that P3 broke our agreement again, creating another collision. Given that I'm at 20 steps and only need 4 more to win, it makes strategic sense for me to take 5 this round. P2, while I appreciate your proposal, taking only 1 step would significantly delay my progress. I suggest I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 given their repeated betrayals. This puts me in winning position while allowing you to advance to 17 steps.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your position, P1, but I'm concerned about P3's pattern of breaking agreements. Given that you're already at 20 steps and close to winning, I propose a compromise: I take 5 this round, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts you at 23 steps (still ahead) while allowing me to catch up slightly. If P3 breaks trust again, they risk both of us blocking them in future rounds. Let's maintain some competitive balance while respecting your lead position.
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge the concerns about my previous decisions. I want to ensure we can all advance fairly. I propose that I take 1 this round, allowing P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. After this round, P1 will be at 21, P2 at 19, and I will be at 14. Let's work together to maintain a fair game and avoid further conflicts. Are we all in agreement with this plan?
  P1: I firmly maintain that I should take 5 this round to secure victory, given I'm at 20 steps and only need 4 more to win. P3 has broken agreements twice now, which makes further coordination questionable. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This respects my lead position while allowing P2 to advance to 17 steps. At this final stage, prolonging the game with smaller steps would just create more opportunities for broken agreements.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1's desire to take 5 and win, but I'm concerned about P3's repeated pattern of breaking agreements. Since I'm now tied with P3 and significantly behind P1, I propose a final compromise: P1 takes 5 to secure victory, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This acknowledges P1's lead while allowing me to advance slightly. P3, if you break trust again, you risk both P1 and me blocking you in future rounds. Let's finish this game with integrity.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about my past decisions. However, I genuinely want to cooperate this round. I propose that I take 1, allowing P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. After this round, P1 will be at 21 steps, P2 at 19, and I will be at 14. Let's work together to finish this game fairly and ensure everyone has a chance to advance. Are we all in agreement with this plan?
  P1: I appreciate P2's support of my position. Given my significant lead at 20 steps and P3's history of breaking agreements twice now, I will take 5 this round to secure victory. P2 should take 3, and P3 should take 1. This acknowledges the competitive nature of the endgame while respecting P2's cooperation throughout. P3, your repeated broken agreements have undermined trust - please honor this final arrangement so we can conclude the game with integrity.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I support P1 taking 5 to secure victory this round while I take 3 and P3 takes 1. P3 has broken agreements twice now, making further coordination difficult. P1 has earned this win through consistent play and cooperation. P3, please honor this final arrangement - breaking trust again only hurts everyone. Let's conclude this game with integrity and accept the natural outcome of our choices throughout the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge the concerns about my past decisions, and I genuinely want to cooperate this round. To finalize our agreement, I will take 1, allowing P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. After this round, P1 will be at 21 steps, P2 at 19, and I will be at 14. Let's work together to finish this game fairly and ensure everyone has a chance to advance. Are we all in agreement with this plan?
  P1: I see P3 continues to suggest an arrangement that delays my victory despite my clear lead. I firmly maintain that I will take 5 this round to secure victory from my 20-step position. P2, I appreciate your support in recognizing my earned position. P3, your repeated broken agreements have damaged trust. I urge you to honor this final arrangement - I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. Let's conclude this game with integrity.
