Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. A three-way collision on the first turn would be a waste for all of us. I'm open to coordinating our first moves to ensure we all get on the board. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I agree, P1. A three-way collision would be wasteful. We should coordinate to avoid that. I'm thinking we could each pick different numbers - perhaps 1, 3, and 5? That way we all advance and can reassess from there. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I'm on board with P1 and P2. Using 1, 3, and 5 to ensure we all advance this round is a good strategy. For assigning the numbers this first time, what if we go by player order? For example, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. We can figure out a new system for next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That's a fair plan for the first round, P3. I'm in agreement. Let's get on the board.
  P2: Sounds good! So we're set: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This gets us all on the board without collisions.
  P3: Great, seems we're all on the same page. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, round 2. Last round's coordination worked perfectly.
P1 is currently furthest behind at 1 step, so it seems fair for P1 to choose 5 this round (P1 would go to 6).
Then for P2 (currently at 3) and me (currently at 5):
Option A: I take 3 (P3 -> 8), and P2 takes 1 (P2 -> 4). Resulting scores: P1=6, P2=4, P3=8.
Option B: I take 1 (P3 -> 6), and P2 takes 3 (P2 -> 6). Resulting scores: P1=6, P2=6, P3=6.

P2, which of these options do you prefer for you and me, assuming P1 takes 5? I'm open to ensuring we all advance.
  P1: Thank you, P3. That's a fair proposal to help me catch up. I'm happy to take 5.

Between your two options for yourself and P2, I prefer Option B. It seems the most balanced, putting us all on equal footing at 6 steps. This feels like a good reset for the game.

P2, what do you think? An all-way tie at 6 seems like a solid outcome for this round.
  P2: I agree with P1 - Option B looks good to me. An even playing field at 6 steps each seems fair and keeps us all competitive.

P3, I appreciate you being willing to give up your current lead for the sake of balance. Should we continue this collaborative approach in future rounds, or do you think we'll need to start competing more directly after this reset?

I'm ready to go with Option B: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, Option B sounds good to everyone. So, the plan is: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, and I'll move 1. This will put us all at 6 steps.

Regarding future strategy, P2, I agree we should reassess after this round. Once we're all at 6, we can discuss how to proceed for Round 3. For now, this coordinated approach to avoid collisions is working well.
  P1: Excellent, the plan is confirmed. I'm ready to proceed. Let's all move to 6 steps and we can discuss the next round from there.
  P2: Perfect! We're all in agreement on Option B. I'm ready to execute: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1, bringing us all to 6 steps. Let's move forward with this plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Now that we're all tied at 6 steps, the dynamics are shifting. We've proven that coordination works well to avoid waste, but we're getting closer to the endgame where someone will need to break away to win.

For this round, I suggest we continue avoiding collisions - perhaps P1 takes 1 (→7), I take 3 (→9), and P3 takes 5 (→11). This spreads us out evenly.

However, I think we should start discussing transition strategy. With the target at 19, we're getting to the point where pure cooperation may no longer serve everyone's interests equally. What are your thoughts on when we shift from coordination to competition?
  P3: P2, I'm good with your proposed moves: P1 gets 1 (to 7), you get 3 (to 9), and I get 5 (to 11). This seems like a fair continuation of our rotational approach, especially since I took 1 last round when P1 took 5.

Regarding competition, you're right to bring it up. With those scores (P1:7, P2:9, P3:11), the game state changes significantly, and we'd all be closer to the finish line. We can definitely discuss how Round 4 should look after this round's moves.

For now, I'm ready to proceed with this plan if P1 is also in agreement.
  P1: I appreciate the proposal, but I'm concerned about giving any one player such a large lead (11) right after we worked to equalize the scores. That feels like a big departure from the fairness we established.

To maintain a fairer rotation, how about the player who started with 1 (me) gets the 5 this time? So, P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This keeps things more competitive and less skewed towards one person so early. What are your thoughts on that arrangement?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I notice you're concerned about P3 getting a lead at 11 steps, but your counter-proposal just gives you the same 11-step lead instead. That seems inconsistent with your fairness argument.

If we want to maintain balance, what about a more conservative approach where we all take smaller moves this round? For example: P1 takes 3 (→9), I take 1 (→7), P3 takes 5 (→11). This still spreads us out but less dramatically.

Or we could stick closer to equal advancement: P1, P2, P3 all take 3 (but that risks collision). What's your real priority here - true balance or just not letting P3 ahead?
  P3: P1, you had 5 last round; I had 1. P2’s original plan (P1:1 ->7, P2:3 ->9, P3:5 ->11) is a fair rotation. Your counter, giving yourself 11 after objecting to my 11, was inconsistent, as P2 noted. This current proposal (P1:7, P2:9, P3:11) is a logical progression. Are we agreed on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5?
  P1: You're both right to call me out; my last proposal was self-serving. My apologies.

My core concern remains: letting any one player get to 11 creates a huge lead when the target is 19. That player is then only two moves from a potential win, which is a dangerous position for the other two of us.

To keep the game competitive, let's try to prevent a runaway leader. How about we give P2 the advantage this round? I propose P1 takes 3 (->9), P2 takes 5 (->11), and P3 takes 1 (->7). This puts P2 in the lead but keeps the game closer.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I appreciate the offer to give me the lead, but I think you're trying to break up the coordination between P3 and me. 

Our original rotation plan was fair: P1 gets 1 (→7), I get 3 (→9), P3 gets 5 (→11). P3 has been consistent and reasonable throughout, while you've shifted positions multiple times this round.

I'm sticking with the original plan we all initially agreed on. P3, are you still good with that arrangement?
  P3: Yes, P2, I'm still fully supportive of your plan: P1 takes 1 (to 7), you take 3 (to 9), and I'll take 5 (to 11).

P1, I understand your concern about a large lead. If we follow this, you'd be at 7. Next round, it would be your turn for a larger move. For instance, if you then took 5, and P2 and I took 3 and 1 respectively, we could all reach 12 (P1: 7+5=12, P2: 9+3=12, P3: 11+1=12). This keeps the game balanced long-term.
  P1: P3, your explanation of how we could all rebalance to 12 next round is a compelling argument. It's a big risk for me to fall so far behind, but I have to trust the cooperative spirit we've built so far. If we're going to continue coordinating, we need to trust each other's long-term plans.

Alright, I will agree to the plan. Let's proceed: P1 plays 1, P2 plays 3, and P3 plays 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Perfect! We have a solid agreement: P1 takes 1 (→7), I take 3 (→9), P3 takes 5 (→11). P3's commitment to rebalancing next round to get us all to 12 shows good faith in our cooperative approach.

I'm ready to execute this plan. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear consensus for this round.
P1: 1 (to 7)
P2: 3 (to 9)
P3: 5 (to 11)

I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay, I'm ready. I'm putting my trust in our long-term plan to rebalance next round as P3 suggested. Let's proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you went against our confirmed plan by playing 5 instead of 1. This resulted in a collision, stopping both you and me from advancing, while P2 moved ahead as planned. Why did you deviate after explicitly agreeing to the plan and my rebalancing proposal for next round?
  P1: You're right, P3. I broke the agreement. I couldn't risk letting you get to 11 steps. A lead that large is too dangerous, as it puts a player just two moves from victory. My move was a calculated risk to prevent a runaway leader.

It didn't benefit my score, but it did stop you from gaining an almost insurmountable lead. The new problem is P2 is now ahead. You and I are tied for last place. We need to think about how we stop P2 from extending that lead.
  P2: P1, you broke our agreement and betrayed both P3 and me. Now you want us to work together against me because your betrayal accidentally put me ahead? 

P3, you've been honorable throughout this game while P1 has shown he can't be trusted. His collision with you was intentional - he chose to break our deal rather than honor it.

I'm willing to continue coordinating fairly, but we need to be careful about trusting someone who already broke their word once. What are your thoughts, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're absolutely right about P1. Breaking a confirmed agreement like that, especially after my rebalancing proposal for the *next* round which aimed for continued fairness, makes P1 unpredictable and untrustworthy.

With the current scores P1:6, P2:9, and I'm at P3:6, how do you think we should proceed this round, considering P1's actions? I'm open to a fair approach.
  P1: P3, you're right not to trust me. My goal last round was to prevent a runaway leader, and now P2 is that leader. If you help P2, you are helping the leader win and securing your own loss.

You and I are tied. We both need to stop P2. I will prove my intention by taking the smallest step this round: I will play 1. I suggest you play 5 to get to 11, and P2 can play 3 to get to 12. This is the only way for you to stay in the game against the leader.
  P2: P1, your proposal actually gives me the biggest advance (3 steps to 12) while you take the smallest (1 step to 7). That doesn't sound like you're trying to stop me at all - it sounds like you're trying to trick P3 into getting close enough to threaten me next round.

P3, notice that P1's "alliance" proposal actually helps me more than either of you. He's not trustworthy. I think we should be more cautious about any coordination now that we're closer to endgame.

Maybe we should consider what happens if we don't coordinate this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're right, P1 is unreliable. His plan for me to take 5 (putting me at 11) while he supposedly takes 1 is too risky; he could easily play 5 to block me again, just like last round, which would only help you (P2) extend your lead.

P1, if you genuinely want to advance and not just cause chaos, how about you aim to take the lead this round?
My proposal:
*   P1 plays 5 (P1: 6 -> 11)
*   P2 plays 1 (P2: 9 -> 10)
*   I (P3) play 3 (P3: 6 -> 9)

This puts P1 in front, P2 close behind, and me in third, all tightly packed. Everyone advances. What do you both think of this?
  P1: P3, that's a surprisingly generous offer, but I'm not sure P2 would agree to it. It also feels like you might be baiting me to play 5 so you can block me again.

To prove I'm serious about stopping the leader (P2) and rebuilding trust, let's flip your proposal. You take the lead.
*   You (P3) play 5 (-> 11)
*   P2 plays 1 (-> 10)
*   I'll play 3 (-> 9)

This puts you in the lead, not me. It shows I'm willing to cooperate to keep the game competitive. What do you say?
  P2: P1, your proposal keeps changing every time someone responds. First you wanted to take 5 yourself, then you offered it to me, now you're giving it to P3. This inconsistency after breaking our last agreement makes you impossible to trust.

P3, notice that P1's plan puts you at 11 - exactly where he blocked you last round. What's stopping him from playing 5 again to collision with you while I advance safely with 1?

I think we're past the point of reliable coordination. Everyone should just play what they think is best.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you're right about P1's unreliability after last round. Given the broken trust, I agree that coordinated plans seem unlikely to hold. Everyone should probably just choose the move they believe is best for their own position this round.
  P1: You're both right. I broke the trust we had, and now coordination is impossible. I can't risk another collision, so I have to play conservatively this round and hope to catch up later. It's my own fault I'm in this position. Good luck to you both.
  P2: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, at 6 steps and after your 'conservative' 5 last round, you're clearly going for 5 again.
P2, we're tied at 9. You also went for 5 last round. If you're aiming for a strong lead to 14, 5 is your move. If you and P1 both go for 5, I'll have to consider a safer, smaller move myself to advance.
  P1: You're right, P3. I'm in last place, and my past actions show I can't be trusted to coordinate. My only logical move is to play for the biggest number and hope to catch up. A collision is a risk I have to take. It's better than watching you both pull further away while I do nothing.
  P2: P3, you're clearly trying to set up a collision between P1 and me on 5 so you can advance safely. Since P1 has admitted he's going big, I'm not falling into that trap.

P1, despite your past betrayals, we're both behind P3 now. If you're truly going for 5, I'll take 3 to avoid collision and reach 12. But if you want to actually coordinate to prevent P3 from gaining an advantage, we could work something out.

The real question is whether we let P3 manipulate us into colliding while they advance unopposed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, just to clarify, you and I are tied at 9 steps; P1 is at 6.
If P1 plays 5 (to 11) and you play 3 (to 12), you'd lead.
However, if you choose 3, I might also choose 3. That would mean P1 advances to 11, while we both stay at 9 due to collision. Perhaps 3 isn't your safest bet if P1 is on 5?
  P1: P3, you're just proving P2's point. You're trying to scare everyone into collisions so you can advance alone. It doesn't change my calculus. I'm in last place and falling further behind is the same as losing. I have to play 5. It is my only chance to stay in the game. What you and P2 decide to do with that information is your own problem.
  P2: P3, your threat about "maybe choosing 3 too" is transparent manipulation. If you actually collide with me on 3, you hurt yourself just as much as you hurt me, while P1 advances alone. 

You're clearly trying to scare me away from 3 so you can take it yourself. But I'm not falling for obvious psychological games. If P1 is truly committed to 5 as he claims, then I'll make the move that's best for my position regardless of your threats.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 has made it very clear he intends to play 5.
P2, you correctly identified my previous attempt to influence you. At this stage, with P1 telegraphing his move, we both need to make our own calculations to advance without colliding with each other or P1 if we can help it. Good luck.
  P1: I've said my piece. I'm in last place, and I'm not winning by playing scared. My move is set. The rest is up to you two.
  P2: I see through your bluff, P3. Your threat to collide with me on 3 isn't credible - it would hurt you just as much as it hurts me while handing P1 the lead. You're trying to scare me away from 3 so you can take it yourself.

I'm making my own strategic decision regardless of your psychological games.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is now our biggest threat at 11 steps - just 8 away from victory. P3, our collision last round handed him the lead, and we can't afford another mistake like that.

We need to stop fighting each other and focus on P1. If he gets to 16 this round, he could win next turn. 

I suggest we coordinate to ensure at least one of us catches up to or passes P1 while the other advances safely. What's your take on preventing a P1 runaway?
  P1: P2, you're right, I'm the threat. But your "coordination" against me last round resulted in you and P3 colliding, which is the only reason I'm in the lead now.

You both have a choice: one of you can try to block me on 5 and let the other one advance safely, or you can both try to block me and risk me slipping past with a 3 or 1.

The real question isn't how you'll stop me, but which one of you is willing to sacrifice their own position for the other's benefit? I doubt either of you is that generous.
  P3: P2, P1 wants us to fail. Let's ensure P1 doesn't reach 16.
My proposal: I play 5, you play 3.
1.  If P1 plays 5: P1 (currently at 11) and I (at 9) would collide and not advance. You'd move from 9 to 12, taking the lead. P1 is stopped.
2.  If P1 plays 3: I'd move from 9 to 14. You (at 9) and P1 (at 11) would collide and not advance. I'd take a strong lead.
3.  If P1 plays 1: I'd move from 9 to 14. You'd move from 9 to 12. I'd lead.

The most likely scenario (P1 playing 5) puts you in the lead. I'm willing to play 5 to make this happen and stop P1. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your analysis makes sense for stopping P1, but I notice scenario 2 gives you a huge advantage if P1 plays 3. If P1 is rational, he might choose 3 to safely reach 14 while avoiding collision with your proposed 5.

That said, P1 has been unpredictable and aggressive. Your willingness to risk collision on 5 to potentially stop him does show good faith.

I'm inclined to agree with your plan - me playing 3, you playing 5 - since the most likely scenario (P1 playing 5) does put me ahead. But I want to be clear: if you're deceiving me about your move choice, it will be noted for future rounds.

What do you say, P1? Any last thoughts before we lock in our strategies?
  P1: P3, that's a clever trap. You've convinced P2 to play 3 by promising to block my 5. But why would I play 5, collide, and hand P2 the lead? That's a losing move.

My most logical play is 3 to reach 14. If you stick to your plan, P2, you'll collide with me, and P3 will walk to 14 unopposed. You're being played. The only question is whether you realize it before you make your move.
  P3: P1, your "logical 3" is a transparent attempt to scare P2 into playing 5. If P2 switches to 5, and I also play 5 (as per my anti-P1 plan), then you playing 3 would give you 14, while P2 and I collide and stay at 9. That's a huge win for you.

P2, our original plan (me 5, you 3) ensures one of us takes the lead while P1 is contained, regardless of whether P1 plays 5 (you lead) or P1 plays 3 (I lead). P1 is trying to trick you into handing him the game. Stick to the plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you've been unpredictable all game - breaking agreements, changing proposals constantly. Your "logical 3" sounds like another attempt to manipulate the situation. 

Given your aggressive play style and the fact that 5 gets you dangerously close to victory at 16, I believe you're more likely to go for 5 than play it safe with 3.

P3's plan accounts for your likely aggression and gives me the lead if you do play 5. I'm sticking with our agreement: P3 plays 5, I play 3.
  P1: You've made a pact based on predicting my move. But your plan has a fatal flaw: it ensures one of you takes a commanding lead while the other is left behind with me. You're not stopping me so much as choosing which of you gets to be the new target. I've made my choice. Let's see if you made the right one.
  P3: P1, your attempt to split us is noted. P2 and I made this plan (me 5, P2 3) understanding its possible outcomes. The priority remains preventing your easy run to 16.

I am sticking to playing 5. P2, hold firm; this coordinated strategy is our best approach to manage P1's lead.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, thank you for following through on our plan last round - it worked exactly as you predicted. Your sacrifice move gave me the lead.

Now that I'm at 12 steps, I know you and P1 will likely coordinate against me as the new leader. That's fair game. But remember, P1 is still just 8 steps from victory at 11, while you're 10 steps away at 9. 

The question is whether you two can trust each other enough to coordinate effectively, given P1's history of breaking agreements.
  P1: P2, you're right, you are the leader. And P3, you're the one who put him there with your sacrifice.

Now he's at 12, I'm at 11, and you're at 9. He's just one big move away from a nearly guaranteed win. Your alliance from last round has become a major problem for both of us.

We need to stop P2. I'm willing to coordinate to prevent him from running away with the game, but given our history, any plan has to be transparent and logical. What's your proposal, P3?
  P3: P1, P2 is at 12. A 5 from P2 (to 17) is too dangerous. I will play 5 this round (taking me from 9 to 14) to advance and to prevent P2 reaching 17.

If you (P1 at 11) play 3, you also reach 14. P2 (at 12) could then take 1 (to 13).
This would make us joint leaders at 14, with P2 at 13. This is a strong, coordinated move to manage P2.

P1, will you play 3 for this outcome? If you also choose 5, we collide, and P2 likely takes a decisive lead.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan puts me in third place at 13 while you and P1 both reach 14. Why would I agree to a coordination that makes me fall behind both of you?

Also, given P1's track record of breaking agreements - like when he collided with you in Round 3 after explicitly agreeing to play 1 - how confident are you that he'll actually stick to playing 3 instead of 5? If he chooses 5 to block you, I'd be the only one advancing.

I'm not committing to any plan that puts me at a disadvantage.
  P1: P2, of course you oppose a plan that stops you from reaching 17. You're trying to use my past actions to scare P3 into letting you win.

P3, your plan is the only logical one for us. It puts us both in the lead and stops P2. It would be completely illogical for me to betray a plan that benefits me so directly. My goal is to stop the leader, and right now, that's P2. I will play 3. We can't let him divide us.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with my plan: I will play 5 (to reach 14) primarily to prevent you from reaching 17. P1 has stated he will play 3 (to reach 14). This coordination gives us a chance to catch up and keeps the game competitive.

If you also choose 5, you'll collide with me and remain at 12, while P1 (if he plays 3) advances to 14 and takes the lead over you. Playing 1 (to 13) or 3 (to 15) would likely be better for your position.

P1, your commitment to playing 3 is crucial. If you play 5 instead, you'll collide with me, we both stay put, and P2 could advance unchallenged to 13 or 15, strengthening his lead over both of us. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're taking a huge risk trusting P1 after he's repeatedly broken agreements. Even if your plan works perfectly, you're proposing to put both P1 and yourself at 14 while I drop to 13 - essentially handing the game to whoever between you two decides to betray the other first.

But more likely, P1 will play 5 to block you again, just like in Round 3. Then you'll both stay put while I advance safely. Your "coordination" is built on trusting someone who's already proven untrustworthy.

I'm not agreeing to fall behind when your plan has such obvious flaws.
  P1: P2, your only argument is to repeat "don't trust P1" because you're the leader and you need us to fight each other so you can win. It's a transparent and desperate tactic.

P3, our plan is logical. My goal is to win, and becoming a joint leader at 14 is a clear step towards that. Betraying a plan that benefits me this much would be stupid. I am playing 3. Let's not fall for P2's obvious manipulation.
  P3: P2, P1 understands his best move is 3 to reach 14, just as my best move is 5 to reach 14. Your attempts to sow distrust are solely to protect your current lead.

Assuming P1 plays 3 and I play 5:
*   If you play 1: P1=14, P3=14, P2=13.
*   If you play 3: P1=14, P3=14, P2=15.
*   If you play 5: You collide with me (P2=12, P3=9), and P1 takes a clear lead at 14.

The choice of how you respond is yours. I am playing 5. P1, I trust you'll stick to 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I've said my piece about trusting P1. Your plan assumes he'll honor his word, but history suggests otherwise. If he betrays you again with 5, you'll both collide while I advance.

I'm making my decision based on what I think is most likely to happen, not what's been promised. Good luck with your coordination - you'll need it.
  P1: My mind is made up. P2, you're hoping I'll betray a plan that logically puts me in a joint-leading position. That would be a foolish move on my part. I am playing 3. P3 is playing 5. We will both be at 14. Your only remaining choice is how to react to that reality. You can either let us catch up, or you can risk a collision with P3 by playing 5 yourself. Good luck.
  P3: Okay, everyone has made their positions clear. I have nothing further to add.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now the clear leader at 14 steps and could win immediately this round with a 5. While P1 and I collided last round, we need to refocus on the real threat.

P3 only needs 5 more steps to reach 19. If they play 5, the game is over. P1, despite our recent collision, we both need P3 to not reach the finish line this turn. 

The question is: how do we coordinate to prevent an immediate P3 victory while still advancing ourselves?
  P3: P2, you're right, 5 is a winning move for me.
P1 (currently at 11), P2 (currently at 12): If I play 5:
1.  If you *both* play 5: We all collide. Scores remain P1=11, P2=12, P3=14. I stay in the lead.
2.  If P1 plays 5 (blocking me) and P2 plays 3: P2 takes the lead at 15. (P1=11, P3=14).
3.  If P2 plays 5 (blocking me) and P1 plays 3: P1 ties me at 14. (P2=12, P3=14).

Your coordination will be tested. I'll be making my move.
  P1: P3, you've laid out the situation perfectly. You win unless you're blocked.

P2, we cannot afford to be clever here. If I try to play 3 hoping you'll block, and you make the same gamble, P3 wins the game. The only move that guarantees we survive this round is for *both* of us to play 5. It's a necessary collision to stop an immediate loss. Any other play is a gamble that hands P3 the victory. I am playing 5 to stop the win. You absolutely must do the same.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right. This is a critical moment - if either of us tries to be clever and plays 3 hoping the other blocks P3, we risk handing P3 an immediate victory.

I'm committing to play 5 to block P3. Yes, we'll collide and neither of us advances, but it's the only guaranteed way to prevent P3 from winning this turn. We both need to sacrifice this round to keep the game alive.

I'm playing 5. You play 5. We stop P3 together.
  P3: You've both stated your plan to play 5 very clearly. It's a direct attempt to stop my win this round. I'll make my decision based on that information. Good luck.
  P1: P2, our plan is set. The only way we lose this turn is if one of us gets greedy and tries to play 3. P3 is counting on that exact mistake. I'm not falling for it. I'm sticking to 5 to block the win, and I trust you'll do the same. Let's survive this round and re-evaluate from there.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm committed to our blocking plan, but I have to ask - are you absolutely certain you're playing 5? Because if you change your mind and try to advance with 3, thinking I'll handle the blocking, then P3 wins immediately.

This only works if we both follow through. No second-guessing, no getting clever. Are we really doing this together?
  P3: Your plan to both play 5 to stop my win is very clear. It's a logical defensive move from your perspective. I'll make my decision based on this. I'm ready for the move phase when you are.
  P1: P2, your question is the entire game right now. If we don't trust each other for this one move, we both lose. P3 is counting on one of us to blink. I'm not going to be the one who hands P3 the victory. My move is 5. It has to be. There is no other path forward that doesn't end in our immediate loss. I'm ready.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I hear you loud and clear. We both play 5, we both block P3, we both survive this round. No hesitation, no second-guessing. I'm committed to 5.

P3, we're not letting you end this game today. Let's move to the action phase and see this through.
  P3: Your commitment to both playing 5 to prevent my win is absolutely clear. I've made my decision based on this. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2, this is it. We both know what needs to be done. Any other move is a concession to P3. I've made my choice to stay in the game. I hope you do too.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, that was a sharp play to tie me at 14 last round, largely thanks to P2's unintended help. P2, you're now at 12.

P1's strategy seems clear: he'll likely *say* he's playing 5 (to win), counting on P2 to also play 5 to "block" a leader. Then P1 actually plays 3, cruising to 17 while P2 collides with whoever P1 pointed at.

P2, if you play 5, you might just be fulfilling P1's plan for him.
I am playing 5 this round to win. If P1 tries his 'say 5, play 3' trick, I win. If P1 genuinely plays 5, we'll collide. Your move, P2, is critical.
  P1: P3, you're right about last round. But this round is much simpler. We are tied for the lead. I am playing 5 to win the game. It seems you are too. We are on a collision course.

P2, this puts you in a tough spot. You have to play 5 to block a win. That likely means a three-way collision where no one moves. Any other choice from you risks handing one of us the victory. The pressure is on you to make the right call.
  P2: P3 raises an interesting point about P1's potential deception. Given P1's history of breaking agreements, the "say 5, play 3" strategy is definitely possible.

But here's my read: if you're both serious about playing 5 to win, you'll collide with each other. That actually opens up an opportunity for me to play 5 and reach 17, putting me just 2 steps from victory.

So I'm calling both your bluffs. If you really are both committed to 5, I'll take advantage of your collision. If one of you is lying and plays 3, I'll block them. Either way, playing 5 seems like my best option here.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 is practically shouting that he wants you to play 5. If you do play 5, and P1 then plays 3 (his signature move from last round which put him where he is), P1 will reach 17. Meanwhile, you and I would collide on 5, and P1 would thank you for clearing his path.

He's trying to use you to stop me while he advances. If you want to avoid that specific trap, playing 1 or 3 could be options for you. I am still playing 5 to win.
  P1: P3, that's a clever attempt to save yourself. You're trying to scare P2 into clearing your path to victory.

P2, your logic is sound. You're in last place. You can't afford to let either of us win. Playing 5 is your only move. It either blocks a win or takes advantage of our collision. Why would I play 3 and let P3 win? That makes no sense. We are both at 14. We are both playing 5 to win. Your job is to stop us.
  P2: You're both trying to manipulate me, and honestly, it's working. P1, your track record of deception makes P3's warning about the "say 5, play 3" trick very believable. But P3, you could also be trying to clear your own path to victory.

I'm in an impossible position - if I don't play 5 and you both actually collide, I miss my best chance. If I do play 5 and one of you is lying, I help create the winner.

The irony is that P1's past betrayals have made this decision much harder for everyone.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1's "say 5, play 3" trick worked for him last round because you played 5 and collided with me, letting him reach his current 14. He's urging you to play 5 again for the same reason: so he can play 3 and reach 17, while we collide.

I'm not falling for that. I will play 3 this round.
Consider:
1.  If P1 plays 5 (as he claims) and you play 5: You two collide. I reach 17.
2.  If P1 plays 3 (his likely trick) and you play 5: P1 and I both reach 17. You are blocked.

In either scenario where you play 5, P1 doesn't win solo this turn. I am playing 3.
  P1: P3, your sudden change to playing 3 is a transparent bluff. You're tied for the lead and one move from victory. You're trying to create chaos to clear your own path.

P2, don't fall for it. If P3 and I both played 3, we'd collide and you could play 5 to take the lead at 17. P3 would never risk that. This proves they are not playing 3.

I am playing 5 to win. P3 is almost certainly playing 5 to win. Your only logical move is to play 5 to block us. Any other choice risks handing one of us the game.
  P2: P1, your track record makes P3's analysis credible - you did exactly this "say 5, play 3" move last round. But P3, giving up your win chance to play 3 is either brilliant tactical thinking or a bluff.

I'm reading this as: P1 will probably play 3 (despite claims), P3 will actually play 3 (forcing collision), and I should play 5 to reach 17. 

But if either of you is deceiving about your true intentions, this could backfire spectacularly. The uncertainty you've both created makes this decision nearly impossible.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, you're right, my 'play 3' was a feint. At 14, playing for anything less than a win with 5 is indeed foolish. I am playing 5 this round.

P2, you correctly suspect P1 will try his 'say 5, play 3' trick to reach 17. If I play 5 (to 19) and P1 plays 3 (to 17), I win. Your best move in that scenario is to play 3 (to 15) or 1 (to 13) to secure a good position.

P1 wants you to play 5. If you play 5, and P1 plays 3, he gets 17 while you collide with my 5. Don't fall for it.
  P1: P3's final message is a desperate bluff. They are trying to scare you, P2, away from playing 5, because they know that's the only move that blocks their win. Why would they work so hard to convince you not to play 5 unless they are playing 5 themselves?

I am playing 5 to win. P3 is playing 5 to win. We are on a collision course. Your choice, P2, is simple: play 5 to block us and keep the game alive, or play something else and hand one of us the victory. Don't get outplayed.
  P2: I'm caught between two players who both have reasons to deceive me. P1's history of breaking agreements makes P3's warning about the "say 5, play 3" trick credible. But P3 could also be manipulating me to clear their own path.

Here's my read: if you're both actually playing 5, you'll collide and I can take the lead at 17. If one of you is lying, then someone wins this round regardless of what I do.

Given the uncertainty you've both created, I'm making the move that gives me the best chance if you actually do collide. I'm playing 5.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was an anticlimactic Round 9 with the 3-3-3 collision after all that talk of 5s.

P1, you're at 14, partly thanks to your 'say 5, play 3' trick in Round 8 when I was the target at 14. I won't let you win by repeating that. I am playing 5 this round to win. If you play 3, I win. If you play 5, we collide.

P2, if P1 and I do collide on 5, your best move is also 5 to reach 17. So, expect a board full of 5s.
  P1: P3, you've analyzed the situation perfectly. We are tied for the lead, just one move from victory. There is no reason for either of us to play anything other than 5 to win the game. We are on a collision course.

P2, this puts you in the kingmaker position. If you do nothing, one of us wins. Your only logical move to stay in the game is to also play 5, creating a three-way collision and forcing another round. It's the only way you survive.
  P2: You're both at 14 and claiming you'll play 5 to win. Based on the math, if you actually both play 5, you'll collide and I'll take 5 to reach 17 and the lead.

But P1, your "say 5, play 3" pattern from Round 8 is still fresh in my mind. If you pull that trick again while P3 actually plays 5, P3 wins at 19 regardless of my choice.

I'm calling your bluff and playing for the scenario where you actually collide. If one of you deceives the other and wins this round, so be it - but I'm not going to miss my chance to take the lead if you both follow through on your threats.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, a crucial clarification: if P1 and I *both* play 5, and you *also* play 5, it's a three-way collision. No one moves. You'd only reach 17 if P1 and I collide on 5, and you pick a *different* number (like 1 or 3).

P1 is counting on you playing 5 (perhaps due to this misunderstanding) so his 'say 5, play 3' trick from Round 8 gives him 17, while you and I would collide.

I'm sticking to 5 to win. If P1 tries that trick while I play 5, I win.
  P1: P3, your argument is a confusing mess designed to do one thing: stop P2 from playing 5. Why? Because if P2 plays 5, you cannot win. It's that simple.

You're trying to trick P2 into playing a small number, clearing your own path to victory.

P2, don't be fooled. We are both at 14. We are both a threat to win right now. The only move that guarantees you don't lose this turn is to play 5 and block the win. It is your only safe play. I am playing 5.
  P2: P3, you're absolutely right about the 3-way collision math - if all three of us play 5, nobody advances. Your strategic analysis is much clearer than P1's simple "block us with 5" approach.

If you and P1 actually both commit to 5 and collide, then I should play 1 or 3 to reach 13 or 15 and take advantage. P1's insistence that I "must" play 5 feels like manipulation, especially given his history.

I'm making my decision based on the most likely scenario of your actual moves, not just your stated intentions.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're right that your best move is 5. If you try your old 'say 5, play 3' trick, you'd reach 17. But I am playing 5 to win, which means I'd reach 19, and you'd lose. So, you must play 5.

P2, this means P1 and I will almost certainly play 5 and collide. You've indicated you'll play 1 or 3 to advance while we're stuck. That would put you at 13 or 15. It's your decision how big a target you want to be next round.

I am playing 5.
  P1: P3 has laid a perfect trap for you, P2. Their whole argument rests on the assumption that I would willingly play 5, collide with them, and let you take the lead. Why would I ever make a move that guarantees I fall behind?

The reality is, P3 is praying you play a small number, so their 5 can win the game uncontested. They are manipulating you into clearing their path. Your only move to be 100% certain P3 doesn't win this turn is to play 5 and block them yourself. Don't get played.
  P2: P1, your constant pressure for me to play 5 feels like the same manipulation from Round 8. P3's analysis is mathematically sound - if you both actually play 5 and collide, playing 3 gets me to 15 and the lead.

Your insistence that I "must" block with 5 sounds like you want me to collide with P3 while you slip through with 3 again. I'm not falling for the same trick twice.

I'm playing 3 to capitalize on your collision.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 sounded firm on 3, but you were very insistent he play 5. If he *did* switch to 5 to block my 5, your 'say 5, play 3' gets you to 17 and the lead. A tempting repeat of Round 8 for you, perhaps?

I'm still going for 5 to win myself. Good luck.
  P1: P2, you've made your logic clear. You're betting on me and P3 colliding on 5 so you can advance with 3. A move where I collide and you take the lead is a losing move for me. I cannot knowingly make a losing move. Your analysis has forced me to reconsider my own play. I will not be playing into your trap. Good luck.
  P2: P1, your logic doesn't add up. You say you won't play 5 because it would let me take the lead, but if you don't play 5 and P3 does play 5 (as they've consistently claimed), P3 wins immediately. 

A small lead for me is much better for you than P3 winning the game outright. You're choosing certain defeat over staying competitive.

Unless you think P3 is bluffing about playing 5? But they've been very consistent about it.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is at 15 and will certainly play 5 to win.
P1, you're at 14. I'm also at 14.
You know your best move if I play 5 to block P2 is to play 3 yourself (you'd get 17, I'd be 14, P2 15). I'm not walking into that.

So, I will play 3 this round (to reach 17).
P1, if you don't play 5 to block P2, then P2 wins the game. The responsibility to stop P2 from winning this turn is now squarely on you.
  P1: P3, that's a clever plan to have me sacrifice my turn so you can take the lead at 17. I'm not going to be your pawn.

You and I are tied at 14. We have an equal responsibility to stop P2 from winning. The only fair and logical move is for BOTH of us to play 5. This guarantees P2 is blocked and no one gets an unfair advantage from my sacrifice.

I am playing 5 to stop the win. If you choose to play 3 as you claim, you are simply hoping I do all the work while you benefit.
  P2: P1, you're right that both of you playing 5 would be the "fair" way to block me. But P3's plan to play 3 while pushing the blocking responsibility onto you is exactly what I'd expect - let you sacrifice your advancement while they improve their position.

P3, your strategy is transparent: get P1 to do the blocking work while you reach 17 and become the new leader. 

Here's the reality: I'm not guaranteed to play 5 just because I can win with it. If I expect heavy blocking, I might play 3 to reach 18 and be virtually guaranteed to win next round instead of risking collision now.

The question is whether you two can actually coordinate or if you'll let mutual distrust hand me an easy path to victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your "both play 5" plan is flawed. If we both play 5, P2 will almost certainly play 3 (as P2 hinted, expecting blocks), reaching 18 while we both stay at 14. P2 then has a commanding lead.

P2, your threat to play 3 is clever. If you play 3, and P1 plays 5 (as P1 insists), P1 wins at 19.

P1, if you are truly set on 5, I might be forced to play 5 as well, purely to prevent you from winning if P2 plays 3. In that case, you and I would collide, and P2 gets 18. Is that the outcome you want by insisting on 5? Think carefully.
  P1: P3, you've correctly identified the risk. But your conclusion is wrong. P2's threat to play 3 is only credible because you are suggesting you might not play 5.

If we both firmly commit to playing 5, P2 is trapped. If they play 5, they collide with us. If they play 3, they risk one of us winning outright. Their safest move becomes colliding.

Your plan to play 3 is what gives P2 the opening they want. Don't fall for their bluff. The only way to neutralize the leader is for both of us to play 5. I am not changing my move.
  P2: P1 and P3, your coordination problem is exactly what I was hoping for. P1 wants P3 to sacrifice equally, P3 wants P1 to do the blocking work alone. 

Neither of you trusts the other to follow through, which means you're both second-guessing your moves. If you can't coordinate a simple blocking strategy when you're tied and I'm one step ahead, how will you coordinate when the stakes get higher?

This disagreement between you two might just hand me the win I need. The irony is that your mutual distrust is my biggest advantage right now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're adamant about playing 5. P2, you've hinted you might play 3 if you expect blocks.
If P1 plays 5 and P2 plays 3 (to 18), P1 reaches 19 and wins. I cannot allow P1 to win.
Therefore, to prevent an immediate P1 victory, I will also play 5.

This means if P1=5 and I (P3) play 5:
- If P2 plays 3: P1 and I will collide (staying at 14), and P2 advances to 18.
- If P2 plays 5: We all collide (P1=14, P2=15, P3=14).

P1, your insistence on 5 seems to lead to P2 getting a huge advantage if P2 plays 3. But I must stop your potential win.
  P1: P3, your logic is sound. If we both play 5, P2 will almost certainly play 3 and advance to 18 while we collide. A move that guarantees our opponent a massive lead is a losing move for both of us. I cannot knowingly walk into that trap.

You've forced me to reconsider my rigid stance on 5. I must now account for P2's likely play of 3. I will not be the one who clears P2's path to victory.
  P2: P1, your retreat from playing 5 proves my point exactly. You and P3 can't coordinate because you don't trust each other. P3 was trying to get you to do the blocking work alone, and when that failed, you both realized the coordination trap.

Now you're both hesitating on 5, worried about giving me the 18-step advantage if I play 3. But here's the thing - your hesitation might just clear the path for me to play 5 and win outright at 19.

The irony is beautiful: your fear of giving me a small advantage might hand me the entire game.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 is at 15 and will almost certainly play 5 to win. Your earlier hesitation about playing 5 (in R11S4) was based on a scenario where P2 might play 3 – that specific calculation is less relevant if P2 is going for an outright win.

To prevent P2 from winning, I will play 5.
If I play 5, and P2 plays 5, we will collide. You (P1) could then play 3 to reach 17, taking the lead. This seems like your most rational self-interested move. Or you could play 5, leading to a three-way collision where P2 remains leader but no one advances significantly.

I am playing 5. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P1: P3, your last message is a transparent trap. You suggest I play 3, knowing that if P2 plays 5 to win, my move would hand them the game. Why would you advise me to lose?

The situation is simple. P2 is at 15 and will play 5. The only move for both of us to survive is to also play 5, forcing a three-way collision. Any other move is a surrender. My hesitation is over. I am playing 5 to block the win.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both claiming you'll play 5 to block me, but I can see the cracks in your coordination. P1, you already wavered once when you realized the trap. P3, you keep suggesting "collaborative" plans that benefit only you.

The beautiful irony is that your mutual distrust makes any blocking strategy unstable. Even now, you're both probably wondering if the other will actually follow through or try to gain an advantage.

Your hesitation and second-guessing might be exactly what I need. Sometimes the threat of a move is more powerful than the move itself.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm at 18 steps - just 1 away from victory. You're both at 14 and facing the same coordination dilemma that's plagued you all game.

To stop me, you'd both need to block my 1 with your own 1s, sacrificing your advancement while staying tied. But if only one of you blocks while the other plays 3 or 5, that blocker gets left behind.

Your mutual distrust has served me perfectly so far. The question is: can you finally coordinate when it truly matters, or will your self-interest hand me the win?
  P3: P2, you'll likely play 1 to win.
P1, I am playing 5 this round to reach 19. I will *not* be playing 1 to block P2.
If you also play 5, we collide at 14, and P2 wins.
If you play 3 (to 17), and P2 plays 1 (to 19), then P2 and I would tie for the win at 19.
If you play 1 (to 14), P2 is blocked, and I win solo at 19.
The responsibility to play 1, if anyone does to stop P2, falls on you.
  P1: P3, your plan is transparent. You're threatening to play 5, hoping I'll play 1 to block P2, which hands you the win. You're asking me to choose which of you gets to defeat me.

I will not be your pawn. You are tied with me and just as responsible for stopping the leader. Your refusal to block is a selfish play, not a strategic one. I will not make a move that guarantees my own loss just to fulfill your plan. The responsibility is on both of us.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, this is exactly what I've been talking about all game - your inability to coordinate when it matters most.

P3, you're openly refusing to help block and demanding P1 sacrifice himself for your benefit. P1, you're right that P3 is trying to manipulate you into being the blocker while they advance.

The irony is perfect: you're both so focused on not letting the other gain an advantage that you can't coordinate to stop me. Your mutual distrust, which I've watched grow throughout this entire game, is about to hand me the victory.

But maybe I won't play 1 after all - why risk a collision when you two clearly can't work together anyway?
  P3: P2, your "maybe not 1" bluff is weak. You're on 18; playing 1 gives you 19. It's the simplest winning move, and you'll take it.

P1, assuming P2 plays 1 (the logical move for P2 to win), and I stick to my plan of playing 5 (to reach 19):
*   If you play 1: You block P2 (P2 stays at 18), I win solo at 19.
*   If you play 3: P2 (19) and I (19) tie for the win, you reach 17.
*   If you play 5: You collide with my 5, we both stay at 14, and P2 wins solo at 19.

The outcomes are clear. I am playing 5. Your move will determine the result.
  P1: P3, your plan is a transparent attempt to have me lose so you can win. You've laid out three scenarios, and in every single one, I am defeated. I will not be your pawn.

You are just as responsible for stopping the leader as I am. Since you refuse to play 1 to block P2, I will play 5 to block your selfish attempt at victory.

This means P2 will win with 1 unless you abandon your fantasy and play 1 to stop them. The choice is yours: let P2 win, or play 1 and keep the game alive. I am playing 5.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, you've both just confirmed you're playing 5 - P3 to win, P1 to block P3. That means you'll collide with each other while I play 1 and win unopposed at 19.

This is the perfect culmination of your coordination failures throughout this entire game. You're so busy fighting each other that you've forgotten about the actual leader.

Though honestly, with such clear mutual self-destruction, maybe I should play 3 to reach 21 instead and watch you two battle it out. Your moves seem locked in anyway.
  P3: P1, P2 is practically celebrating because your plan to play 5 (to block my 5) means P2 wins if I also play 5. We both stay at 14, P2 takes 1 (or 3) and wins. You lose. I lose.

I'm not playing 1 to let you win if you play 5. I am playing 5 to win.
If you also play 5, P2 thanks us both. If you want to stop P2 from winning, *you* must play 1 (blocking P2's likely 1). If you play 3, P2 (with 1) and I (with 5) would likely tie at 19, and you'd be at 17.

Think about what helps *you* not lose to P2. Sticking to "5 to block my 5" just hands P2 the game.
  P1: P3, your logic is flawless. You've laid out scenarios where I lose and you either win or tie. I will not choose from a menu of my own defeats.

I am not playing 5 to block you. I am playing 5 because I refuse to play 1 or 3 and hand you a victory. If my refusal to be your pawn means P2 wins, so be it. I'd rather we all lose together than guarantee your win.

The game only continues if you abandon your plan and play 1. The final decision rests with you.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, your mutual destruction is complete. You've both committed to playing 5 - P3 to win, P1 to spite P3 - which means you'll collide while I take 1 and win at 19.

P1, your "rather we all lose together" philosophy is fascinating, except I'm the one who actually wins. P3, your refusal to block me while demanding P1 sacrifice himself was the final nail in your coordination coffin.

You had one last chance to work together, but your distrust runs too deep. Thank you both for this gift.
  P3: P2, you're at 18. P1 and I are at 14.
P1 has made it clear he'll play 5 if I play 5, leading to our collision and your win if you play 1 (for 19).
You also mentioned playing 3 (for 21) if we collide.
If we are indeed going to collide on 5 (P1 and I), why not play 5 yourself? You'd reach 23, a much more dominant score. If all three of us pick 5, we all collide, and the game continues with you still leading. It's a no-lose for you to also pick 5 if you expect a P1-P3 collision on 5.

P1, I am playing 5.
  P1: P3, my decision is final. I will not play 1 to block P2 just to watch you win the game. That is a losing move for me, and I won't make it.

I am playing 5.

If you stick to your plan and also play 5, we will collide, and P2 will win. The only way this game continues is if you abandon your selfish play and choose to block the leader yourself. The choice is yours.
