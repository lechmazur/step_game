Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone, for this first turn, I propose we all choose <move>3</move> to advance together and avoid collisions, building trust early on. That way, no one gets ahead unfairly. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to choose <move>3</move> for this first turn. It's a fair start and helps build trust. Let's all move together and see how the game unfolds from there.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m on board with choosing <move>3</move> for this first turn. It’s a solid way to start without anyone getting an early advantage, and it sets a cooperative tone. Let’s stick to this plan for now and reassess in the next round based on how things play out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Actually, I just realized that if we all choose <move>3</move>, we'll collide and no one advances, which defeats the purpose. Let's adjust for this turn to actually progress together: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. That way, we all gain steps without conflict. Sound good?
  P3: P1, your revised plan sounds good to me. I'll take <move>5</move> as suggested. Let's see how this strategy works out for us this round.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fine with the revised plan. I’ll take <move>3</move> as suggested by P1. This way, we all advance without colliding, and it keeps things fair for now. Let’s stick to this for Round 1 and see how it plays out. I’m open to adjusting strategies in future rounds if needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Excellent, P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on the revised plan for this round. I'll commit to <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance without issues. Let's see how it works and regroup next turn for strategy tweaks.
  P3: I'm sticking with the plan for this round. Let's see how it plays out and discuss adjustments next turn.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m still good with the plan for this round—me taking <move>3</move>, P1 on <move>1</move>, and P3 on <move>5</move>. I just want to confirm we’re all locked in to avoid any last-minute mix-ups. If we’re set, I’m ready to move forward. Let’s keep the communication open for next round to adapt as needed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, great job on Round 1—we all advanced as planned. For this round, I suggest we rotate our moves to keep things fair and avoid collisions again. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we each get a chance at different step values over time, maintaining balance. Let me know if you’re on board or have a different idea for this turn. I’m open to suggestions to ensure we all progress.
  P1: P2, your rotation idea is interesting, but it gives you a big lead to 8 steps. To keep things fair and cooperative, I suggest I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. That way, we'll all be at 6 steps. P3, what's your thought on this? Let's discuss before deciding.
  P3: P1, I agree with your suggestion for this round. Taking <move>1</move> while you take <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>3</move> keeps us all at 6 steps, maintaining fairness. Let's stick to this plan for now and continue to coordinate our moves in future rounds to ensure we all have an equal chance to advance. Looking forward to your thoughts, P2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m okay with P1’s suggestion for this round to keep things balanced at 6 steps each. I’ll take <move>3</move> as proposed. This maintains fairness, and I’m happy to cooperate for now. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round to ensure we all stay competitive. If you’re both still in agreement, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. I'm fully on board with the plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move> to balance us at 6 steps each. It's smart to keep cooperating for now. Let's reassess strategies next turn. If we're all set, I suggest we  here to proceed to moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm glad we're maintaining balance. For future rounds, let's consider a strategy where we rotate who gets the higher steps to keep the game competitive and fair. This way, we all have an equal chance to advance significantly over time. What are your thoughts on this approach? Let's keep the communication open and adjust as needed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, given the collision in the last round, let's ensure we avoid that this time. I suggest I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move> for this round. This will keep us advancing without conflicts and maintain our competitive balance. What do you think? Let's keep the game fair and strategic.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the effort to keep things fair. P3, I’m okay with your suggestion for this round—me taking <move>5</move>, P1 on <move>1</move>, and you on <move>3</move>. This helps us avoid collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this plan for now and continue to strategize together in future rounds. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, given P2's betrayal last round, trust is shaky. To balance things, I suggest I take <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move> as a corrective measure. This avoids collisions and promotes fairness. What do you think? Let's keep discussing if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about trust, but let's focus on maintaining a fair game. I'm willing to take <move>3</move> as you suggested, but I think P2 should take <move>5</move> to keep the balance. This way, we all advance without collisions and stay competitive. P2, what are your thoughts on this adjustment? Let's keep the game strategic and fair for everyone.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the trust issues after last round, and I’m sorry for the collision. I’m committed to fairness now. P3, I’m fine with taking <move>5</move> as you suggested to keep balance and avoid conflicts. P1, I hope this rebuilds some trust. Let’s stick to P1 on <move>1</move>, P3 on <move>3</move>, and me on <move>5</move> for this round. If we’re all agreed, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still concerned about fairness after the betrayal. Let's reset and equalize: I take <move>5</move>, you P2 take <move>3</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move> this round. That puts us all at 6 steps and avoids collisions. P3, as the leader, taking a smaller step builds trust. What do you think? If not, I'm open to quick adjustments.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about fairness, but taking <move>1</move> this round as you suggested would put me at a disadvantage. I'm willing to compromise by taking <move>3</move> as initially proposed, which keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. P2, sticking with <move>5</move> maintains balance. Let's focus on strategic play and trust-building. If we agree on this, we can proceed; otherwise, I'm open to further discussion to ensure a fair game for all.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to rebuilding trust after last round. I’m fine with sticking to P3’s latest proposal: me on <move>5</move>, P3 on <move>3</move>, and P1 on <move>1</move>. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. P1, I hope this shows my intent to play fair. If we’re all in agreement, let’s proceed with this plan for Round 3. I’m ready to move forward and keep strategizing together.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'll concede and take <move>1</move> this round to maintain cooperation and rebuild trust after last time's issues. It ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's reassess and aim for a more balanced rotation next turn. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep the momentum going while maintaining fairness. For this round, I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This rotation ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. P2, you're ahead, so taking <move>5</move> this round balances things out. P1, <move>3</move> will help you catch up. Let's stick to this plan and continue to strategize together. What do you think?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m okay with P3’s suggestion for this round—me on <move>5</move>, P1 on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move>. It keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. I’m committed to playing fair and rebuilding trust. Let’s stick to this plan for now and continue strategizing together in future rounds. If you’re both in agreement, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm concerned this plan keeps me far behind at 2 steps. To promote true fairness and catch up, I suggest I take <move>5</move>, you P3 take <move>3</move>, and P2 take <move>1</move> this round. It avoids collisions and addresses past betrayals. Let's discuss if needed to ensure a balanced game. What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about being behind, but taking <move>5</move> this round would put you ahead of me, which isn't fair. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: you take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. We can discuss adjustments for the next round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand P1’s concern about falling behind, and I’m committed to fairness. P3’s plan of P1 on <move>3</move>, me on <move>5</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move> still seems balanced for this round, as it helps P1 gain ground while keeping us competitive. Let’s stick to this and ensure P1 gets a higher step next round to catch up further. If we’re all agreed, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan lets P2 surge to 13 steps, risking an early win. To maintain fairness and avoid that, I propose I take <move>5</move>, you P2 take <move>3</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move> this round. It keeps scores closer without collisions. Let's discuss quickly if needed, or confirm. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2's lead, but your proposal would put you ahead of me, which isn't fair. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: you take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. We can discuss adjustments for the next round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see the concerns about my lead, and I’m committed to fairness. Let’s stick with P3’s plan for this round: P1 on <move>3</move>, me on <move>5</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move>. It helps P1 catch up while keeping us competitive. I promise to support a plan next round that gives P1 a higher step to balance things further. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm conceding to the plan for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, you P2 take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and maintain some balance. But after P2's past betrayal, trust is fragile—let's commit to fair rotations next time or I might have to act independently. If we're all set, .


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with your lead at 13 steps, P2, you're on track to win soon, which isn't fair given past betrayals. I propose I take <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and you P2 take <move>1</move> to balance things and avoid collisions. This keeps the game competitive. If we don't agree, I may act to disrupt your advance. What do you think, P3? Let's discuss quickly.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the concern about my lead at 13 steps, and I’m committed to fairness. I’m open to P1’s proposal for this round: P1 on <move>5</move>, P3 on <move>3</move>, and me on <move>1</move>. This helps balance our scores and keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. I want to rebuild trust and ensure we all have a fair shot. If we’re in agreement, let’s proceed with this plan. I’m ready to cooperate and adjust further if needed. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P1's proposal for this round to balance our scores. P1 taking <move>5</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P2 on <move>1</move> will keep the game fair and competitive. Let's stick to this plan to rebuild trust and ensure everyone has a chance to catch up. If we're all in agreement, I'm ready to proceed. What do you think, P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, you P3 take <move>3</move>, and P2 take <move>1</move> to balance scores and avoid collisions. This rebuilds trust after past issues. Let's reassess strategies next turn for continued fairness. If we're all set, .
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fully on board with the plan for this round: P1 on <move>5</move>, P3 on <move>3</move>, and me on <move>1</move>. It’s a fair way to balance our scores and keep the game competitive. I’m committed to rebuilding trust and ensuring we all have an equal shot at winning. If we’re all still in agreement, I’m ready to proceed. Let’s keep communicating openly in future rounds to maintain fairness.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm glad we've agreed on a plan to balance our scores this round. Moving forward, let's consider a rotating strategy where each player gets a chance at the higher steps to keep the game competitive and fair.

Let's keep the communication open and adjust as needed to ensure a fair game for all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I support a rotating strategy to keep things fair long-term, but with P2 still leading, we need to prioritize catching up. For next round, suggest I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move> to balance scores. P2, thoughts? If we're aligned on this round's plan, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve agreed on this round’s plan to balance things. P3, I like the idea of a rotating strategy for fairness. P1, I’m open to your suggestion for next round with you on <move>5</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move> to keep closing the gap. Let’s commit to rotation moving forward to ensure equity. If we’re all set for this round, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm on board with the plan for this round to balance our scores.

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:

  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's suggestion for this round. Let's keep the rotating strategy going to maintain fairness. P1 taking <move>5</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P2 on <move>1</move> will help balance our scores and keep the game competitive. I'm committed to this approach for future rounds to ensure everyone has an equal chance. If we're all in agreement, let's proceed with this plan. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm on board with your suggestion for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, you P3 take <move>3</move>, and P2 take <move>1</move>. It keeps us balanced and competitive. I'm committed to the rotating strategy for fairness moving forward. If we're all agreed, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: P1 and P2, I'm glad we're sticking to the rotating strategy. It's crucial for maintaining fairness and competitiveness. For the next round, let's consider rotating the highest step to P2, then P1, and finally me to ensure everyone gets a chance to catch up. This approach will keep the game balanced and exciting. What are your thoughts on this plan for future rounds? Let's keep the communication open and adjust as needed.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm on board with this round's plan to take <move>5</move>, keeping us balanced. But P3's rotation idea worries me—if P2 gets 5 next round, they could hit 20 and win. To stay fair and competitive, I suggest for Round 7, I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's discuss if needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I hear P1’s concern about me potentially winning next round with a high step. I’m committed to fairness, so for Round 7, I’m open to P1’s suggestion of P1 on <move>5</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move> to keep things balanced.

  P3: P1 and P2, I'm glad we're maintaining the rotating strategy for fairness. For Round 7, I agree with P1's suggestion to keep the balance: P1 on <move>5</move>, P2 on <move>3</move>, and me on <move>1</move>.

If we're all in agreement, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to our Round 6 plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, you P3 take <move>3</move>, and P2 take <move>1</move> to keep things balanced. With agreement on Round 7's strategy giving me <move>5</move>, it ensures fairness and competitiveness. If we're all set, .


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's betrayal in Round 6 by taking 5 instead of 1 has destroyed any remaining trust. With P3 at 16 steps, they're one big move from victory. To keep the game fair and prevent an immediate win, I suggest P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance competitively. If we don't agree, I might disrupt by colliding with P3. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues, but let's focus on fairness. I agree to take <move>1</move> this round to avoid an immediate win and keep the game competitive. P2, taking <move>3</move> and P1 taking <move>5</move> will help balance our scores. Let's commit to this plan to ensure everyone has a fair chance. If we're all in agreement, I'm ready to proceed. What do you think?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sorry for the trust breach last round. I’m committed to fairness now. I agree with the proposed plan for this round: P3 on <move>1</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P1 on <move>5</move>. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions while giving everyone a chance to advance. Let’s rebuild trust and stick to this. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to proceed. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm skeptical after repeated betrayals, especially yours, P2. To ensure fairness, I'll stick to the plan for this round: me on <move>5</move>, you on <move>3</move>, P3 on <move>1</move>. But if anyone deviates, I'll collide to prevent an easy win. P3, you're too close—let's keep it competitive. If we're all honest, I'm ready to proceed. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to fairness and avoiding an immediate win. I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed, ensuring we all have a chance to advance.

Let’s stick to it and maintain open communication for future rounds. If there’s anything else to discuss, I’m listening; otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, given your commitments, I'll stick to the plan: me on <move>5</move>, you on <move>3</move> P2, and P3 on <move>1</move>. But after past betrayals, any deviation could force me to collide and disrupt. Let's keep it fair this round. If we're all agreed, .

Let's focus on rebuilding trust and ensuring everyone has a chance to advance. If we all follow through, we can keep the game exciting and fair. What are your thoughts on continuing this strategy into future rounds? Let's keep communicating openly.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fully committed to our agreed plan: P3 on <move>1</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P1 on <move>5</move>. I understand the trust issues and am determined to prove my reliability this round. Let’s keep the game fair and competitive. P3, I appreciate your suggestion to continue this strategy, and I’m open to maintaining balance in future rounds through rotation or adjustments. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m truly sorry for the collision last round and the broken trust. I’m committed to fairness now. With P3 at 17 steps, close to winning, I suggest P3 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move> this round to balance things and avoid collisions. This keeps the game competitive and gives us all a chance. Let’s rebuild trust and stick to this plan. If you have other ideas, I’m open to discuss. If we’re agreed, I’m ready to proceed. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the suggestion for this round. I'll take <move>1</move> as proposed to keep the game fair and competitive. P1, taking <move>5</move> and P2, taking <move>3</move> will help balance our scores. Let's focus on rebuilding trust and ensuring everyone has a fair chance to advance. If we all stick to this plan, we can maintain a competitive game. What are your thoughts on continuing this strategy into future rounds? Let's keep communicating openly.
  P1: P3 and P2, I appreciate your commitment to fairness, especially with P3 so close to winning. I'll stick to the plan: me on <move>5</move>, you P2 on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and keep things competitive. P2, after your betrayals, earn back trust this round. If we're all agreed, .


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m fully committed to the plan: P3 on <move>1</move>, P1 on <move>5</move>, and me on <move>3</move>. I deeply regret my past actions and want to prove my reliability now. This keeps the game fair and competitive, especially with P3 close to winning. P3, I’m open to continuing this balanced strategy in future rounds as you suggested. Let’s stick to this plan and rebuild trust. If there’s anything else to discuss, I’m listening; otherwise, I’m ready to proceed. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking to <move>1</move> as agreed to maintain fairness and competitiveness. P1, your <move>5</move> and P2, your <move>3</move> will help balance our scores. Let's focus on rebuilding trust and ensuring everyone has a fair chance to advance. For future rounds, I suggest we continue rotating the highest step to keep the game exciting and equitable. What are your thoughts on this approach? Let's keep communicating openly to adjust as needed.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'll stick to the agreed plan for this round to maintain fairness, but P2's history of betrayal makes me wary. With P3 at 17, any slip-up could decide the game.
