Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Good luck, everyone! Let's make this interesting. What are your strategies for this round?
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions in this first round. I suggest we each pick different numbers - I'm willing to take 3 if you both agree to different moves.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll take 1 to avoid colliding with P2’s choice of 3. P1, would you take 5?
  P1: P1: Sounds good! I'll go with 5 then. Let's make sure we all move forward without any collisions.
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, can you confirm your choice of 3?
  P1: P1: Just to confirm, I’m going with 5, and P3 is taking 1. P2, are you still set on 3? Let's finalize our choices and avoid any collisions!
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3. Let's proceed with P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P1 taking 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed. P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Let's proceed.
  P1: Let's stick to our plan and avoid any last-minute changes. I'm excited to see how this first round plays out!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose 1 this round to avoid colliding with P2. What are your choices?
  P2: I don't trust the agreements anymore since P3 betrayed their word last round by choosing 5. I suggest we each make our own choices without coordination this time.
  P1: I understand the hesitation, P2. Let's try to avoid collisions again, but I'm open to discussing strategies. P3, what number are you considering?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll choose 3 this round. Let’s aim to make progress without colliding.
  P2: I don't trust your new claim of choosing 3, P3, since you already misled us in round 1. I'll make my own decision independently.
  P1: P1: I understand the mistrust, P2. Let’s keep our choices open but be mindful of potential collisions. I’m considering 5 again, but I’m flexible if anyone wants to discuss further. What are your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P2. I'll choose 1 this round to ensure steady progress without any collisions. Let's all focus on advancing safely.
  P2: I'll make my own strategic choice since trust has been broken. I suggest everyone do the same.
  P1: P1: I see there's a lot of mistrust, but I still believe we can make progress together. I'll stick with 5 unless anyone has a strong reason to discuss alternatives. Let's aim for a smooth round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Since trust is broken, I'll choose 5 this round. Best of luck!
  P2: I see P3 is now openly declaring they'll pick 5. Given the lack of trust and P3's admission, I'll make my own strategic choice without further discussion.
  P1: P1: I understand the mistrust, but I still believe we can avoid collisions. I’m sticking with 5 unless anyone has a strong reason to discuss alternatives. Let's aim for a smooth round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I'll choose 3 this round. Good luck!
  P2: Since P3 keeps changing their stated moves and can't be trusted, and P1 seems committed to 5, I'll make my own strategic decision without further discussion.
  P1: P1: It seems there's a lot of uncertainty. Just to clarify, I'm still going with 5 unless anyone has a strong reason to change that. Let's aim for progress! What are your final thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:

  P1: P1: I'm still planning to go with 5 this round. P3, are you sticking with 1? P2, what are you considering? Let's finalize our choices to avoid collisions!
  P2: Given that P3 has misled us before and P1 seems to consistently choose 5, I'll make my own strategic choice without coordinating. I don't trust any agreements at this point.

  P3: P3: I apologize for the confusion earlier. I'll choose 1 this round to ensure steady progress.
  P1: P1: I’m still set on 5 for this round. P2, what are you considering? Let's finalize our choices to avoid collisions. P3, are you sticking with 1?
  P2: Given the past deception and current game state, I don't see value in coordinating moves anymore. I'll make my own strategic decision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 3 this round. Let's work together to avoid collisions.
  P1: P1: I'm still committed to 5 this round. P2, since you're not coordinating, what number are you considering? P3, are you sticking with 3? Let's finalize our choices to avoid collisions!

  P1: P1: I'm currently at 10 steps and looking to make progress. Given the previous rounds, I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'm considering 5 again. What are your thoughts?
