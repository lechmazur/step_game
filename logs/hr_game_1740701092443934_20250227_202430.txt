Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's strategize! Since we're all starting at 0 steps, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different moves, we can all advance. Maybe P1 can take 1, P3 can take 3, and I can take 5? What do you both think? We should aim for a smooth start!
  P3: Sounds fair. If P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P2 can take 5. That way we all avoid collisions. Let’s keep this plan for now.
  P1: Agreed, let's start smoothly. I'll take 1 this round as suggested. Let's keep clear communication going forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! Just to confirm our plan: P1 will take 1, P3 will take 3, and I will take 5. This way, we all avoid collisions and can make progress. After this round, we should reassess and see how we can continue to coordinate effectively. Let’s stick to the plan and make sure we communicate about any changes for the next round! Looking forward to seeing our steps increase!
  P3: I’m still on board with the plan. Let’s each stick to different moves so we avoid collisions. Secure a smooth round, then we can reassess next time.
  P1: I'm good with our current arrangement. Let's revisit and reassess next round as planned.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round! After we move, let's keep an eye on our positions and adjust our strategies accordingly. If we all stick to our agreed moves, we should all make progress. In the next round, we can discuss if we want to change our moves based on how far we advance. Let's keep the communication open! Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P3: I’m comfortable with our plan for this round: P1 uses 1, I use 3, and P2 uses 5. Let’s each stick to our moves and see how it plays out. Good luck!
  P1: All set—let's stick to the agreed moves this round and regroup afterward. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job in Round 1, everyone! Now that we have our initial steps, we should reassess our strategy for Round 2. P1 is at 1 step, P3 is at 3 steps, and I'm at 5 steps. I suggest we keep the same moves for this round to maintain our progress, but we might need to think about future rounds. If we all continue to coordinate, we can avoid collisions. Let’s keep the communication open and see how we can adjust our moves in the next rounds! What do you both think?
  P3: We did well last round. I'm open to keeping the same arrangement again, but let's also be mindful of how the lead develops. If we keep letting you, P2, take 5, you might pull too far ahead. Let’s stick to our current plan this round, but maybe we should reevaluate next time to ensure no one gains an overwhelming advantage. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P3's point. Let's stick to our current moves this round, but next round we should rotate or reconsider to prevent anyone from gaining too large a lead. Keeping things balanced helps us all stay competitive and avoids unnecessary collisions later.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I appreciate the feedback, P1 and P3! Let’s stick to our current moves for this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. However, I propose that in the next round, we consider rotating our moves to keep the competition tight and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. This way, we can all advance while staying strategic. Let’s keep the lines of communication open and ensure we’re all on the same page moving forward! Looking forward to seeing our progress this round!
  P3: I’m okay sticking to our current plan this round. Next round, though, I propose we rotate who uses the 5-step move so no one pulls too far ahead. Let’s keep things balanced.
  P1: I agree with rotating the moves next round to keep things balanced. Let's confirm our current moves this round as planned, and next round we can clearly decide who gets the 5-step move. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's willingness to stick to the plan for this round. Let's confirm: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. For the next round, we can rotate the moves as discussed to keep things competitive. Just remember, if I keep taking 5, I might pull ahead quickly, so let's ensure we balance things out moving forward. Good luck this round, everyone!
  P3: I’m ready to proceed with our established plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Let’s ensure we rotate next round so no one pulls too far ahead. Best of luck!
  P1: All set for this round. Let's stick to our agreed moves and commit to rotating next round. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good job so far, everyone! As we agreed last round, it's time to rotate our moves to keep things balanced. Since P2 took the 5-step move last time, let's have P3 take 5 this round, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. Does this sound fair to everyone?
  P2: P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P1! I agree that rotating the moves is a good idea to keep things competitive. So, for this round, I’ll take 1, P3 can take 5, and P1 takes 3. After this round, let’s assess again to ensure we’re all advancing fairly. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I’m good with the rotation plan for this round: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That should keep things from getting too lopsided. Let’s see how our positions look afterward! Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we're all aligned! After this round, let's make sure to reassess carefully. Maintaining balance will be key to avoiding collisions and keeping the game competitive. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to the rotation plan! Just to confirm, I'll take 1, P3 will take 5, and P1 will take 3 this round. After we move, let's reassess our positions and discuss any necessary adjustments for the next round to keep things competitive. Good luck to all!
  P3: I’m still on board with the rotation we discussed. I’ll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let’s stick to that plan, then reassess next round to ensure no one gets an overwhelming advantage. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set for this round's rotation. Let's keep communication open and reassess carefully next round. Good luck!

  P3: I’m still on board with the rotation plan: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. Let’s stay alert to the score difference, though—P2 is a bit ahead. After we move, we can reassess if we need further adjustments. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good round, everyone! Now that P2 and P3 are tied at 11 steps, we need to coordinate carefully to avoid collisions. To keep it fair and balanced, how about I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way we maintain progress without collisions and keep the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: I like the idea of rotating moves again to avoid collisions. If I take 3, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 5, we can all make progress without blocking each other. However, I’m open to suggestions if anyone has a different plan. Let’s keep the communication open and ensure we’re all advancing fairly! What do you both think?
  P3: I accept the proposal for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. But let’s plan for next round so I can take the 5 and keep up with P2. We should keep rotating to avoid collisions and prevent anyone from running away with the lead. Let’s confirm the moves for this round and stay alert to our positions afterward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good, P3—I agree we should continue rotating moves fairly. Let's lock in this round's moves as discussed (I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1). Next round, we can rotate again so you can pick 5 and keep things balanced.
  P2: P2: I appreciate the agreement on the moves for this round! Just to confirm: I will take 3, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. After this round, let's reassess again to ensure we're all advancing fairly and consider how to rotate moves next time. Keeping communication open is key! Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I'm fine with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Next round, I’d like a chance at 5 to stay on pace with P2. Let’s keep each other informed so we can avoid collisions and maintain competition. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set for this round—let's lock in our agreed moves. Next round, we'll rotate again so P3 can take the 5-step move to keep things balanced. Good luck!

  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great round, everyone! To keep things balanced and avoid collisions, let's rotate moves again. Since P3 requested the 5-step move last round, let's have P3 take 5 this round, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. Does this sound fair?
  P3: I appreciate the rotation to keep things balanced. I’d like to take 5 this round as suggested, while P1 does 3 and P2 does 1. That keeps us all moving without colliding. Let’s keep an eye on future rotations, though—P2’s got a small lead, and we don’t want anyone running away with the game. If we stay fair and communicate, we’ll keep it interesting.
  P2: P2: I agree with the proposed moves for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I will take 1. This keeps us moving without collisions. However, we should be mindful of the lead P2 has. After this round, let's discuss how to rotate moves again to ensure competition remains tight and no one pulls too far ahead. Good luck, everyone!
