Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we're all at 0 steps, we have a chance to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. I suggest that one of us takes 1, another takes 3, and I can take 5. What do you both think? This way, we can all progress without blocking each other.
  P1: P2, your suggestion to coordinate is interesting, but why should we trust you to take 5 while the rest of us split 1 and 3? If we agree on this, I propose we rotate the numbers each round to ensure fairness. For example, this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Next round, we shift—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, everyone gets an equal chance to advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I like P1's rotation idea. It ensures fairness and minimizes collisions. However, we should also consider the endgame. As we approach 22 steps, our strategy may need to change to block others from winning. Let's agree on the rotation for now and reassess as the game progresses.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on the rotation, P1 and P3. However, let's ensure that we stick to the plan for this round to avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. I suggest we finalize our moves now: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If we can all commit to this, we can make significant progress. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy as needed. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with finalizing the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s commit to this to avoid collisions and make progress. However, I want to remind everyone that trust is key—if anyone deviates, it’ll hurt all of us early on. Let’s stick to the rotation strategy for now and adapt as needed later. If we’re all in agreement, confirm your commitment so we can move forward confidently.
  P3: I confirm my commitment to the rotation strategy for this round: I'll take 5. Let's all stick to the plan to ensure progress. I suggest we also establish a rule to discuss and agree on any strategy changes before implementing them, to maintain trust and coordination throughout the game.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the rotation strategy for this round. Just to clarify, I will be taking 3, as agreed. If we stick to this plan, we can all make progress without collisions. After this round, we should keep an open line for discussing any potential changes to our strategy as we move forward. Trust and communication will be key to our success. Let's confirm our moves once more: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Are we all still on board?
  P1: I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement on the rotation strategy for this round. To reiterate, I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s all confirm one final time that we’re sticking to this plan. If we can trust each other now, we’ll set a strong foundation for future rounds. Deviating early would only slow us all down. Once we confirm, we can focus on adapting strategically as the game progresses. Does everyone confirm?
  P3: Let's finalize our commitments. I confirm taking 5 this round. To ensure we're all on the same page, I suggest a simple acknowledgement from each player. If everyone is ready to proceed with the agreed plan, let's say "ready" and move to the move phase. This will help prevent last-minute changes and reinforce our trust in each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. To ensure we all stick to our agreed moves, let's each say "ready" to confirm our choices: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will reinforce our trust and help us avoid any last-minute changes. Once we all confirm, we can proceed to the move phase and make significant progress together. Are we all ready?
  P1: I’m ready to stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s confirm and move forward with trust. If we all commit now, we can focus on adapting strategically as the game progresses. Deviating early will only slow us down. Once we confirm, we’ll set a strong foundation for future rounds. Does everyone confirm?
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan. To confirm, I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's all say "ready" to finalize our commitments and move to the move phase. This will ensure we stick to our plan and make progress together. If everyone is committed, let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our agreed moves.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s stick to the rotation strategy: this round, I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. It’s the fairest way to keep progressing without collisions. Trust is crucial—if we deviate now, it’ll only slow us all down. Let’s confirm our moves and stay coordinated. If everyone agrees, say "ready" so we can move forward confidently. Consistency will help us build momentum for the endgame.
  P2: I appreciate P1's commitment to the rotation strategy. However, I think we should consider adjusting our moves this round to maintain flexibility. I propose that I take 1 this time, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can still advance while keeping our options open for future rounds. Let's confirm our moves and ensure we’re all aligned. If everyone agrees, please say "ready" so we can proceed confidently. Consistency is important, but we should also adapt as needed. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm open to adjusting our strategy, but let's not change the plan drastically. P2's proposal seems risky. How about we compromise: stick to the original rotation for now, and reassess after this round? This way, we maintain fairness and can adjust later if needed. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P2's desire for flexibility, but changing the plan now risks confusion and collisions. Let’s stick to the original rotation for this round: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. It’s simple, fair, and keeps us progressing. If we start deviating early, trust will break down, and we’ll all lose momentum. Let’s confirm the rotation strategy one more time and move forward confidently. If everyone agrees, say "ready." Consistency now will set us up for better strategic adjustments later.
  P2: I understand the importance of consistency, but I believe we need to remain adaptable. While I appreciate the commitment to the rotation, I suggest we consider P2's idea for this round to keep our options open. If we can agree on a flexible approach, we can reassess our strategies after this round. How about we compromise: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we can still advance while leaving room for adjustments later. Let’s confirm our moves! If everyone agrees, please say "ready."
  P3: Let's prioritize consistency for now. Sticking to the original rotation maintains fairness and trust. I propose we follow P1's suggestion: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed with the agreed rotation for this round. If everyone agrees, say "ready" to finalize our commitments.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m sticking to the original rotation plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Deviating now risks collisions and erodes trust.

If everyone agrees, say "ready" so we can proceed without hesitation. Trust and coordination will keep us all advancing fairly. Let’s lock this in now.
  P2: I understand the push for consistency, but I believe adapting our moves can still allow us to progress without collisions. I propose we take a flexible approach for this round: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can advance while keeping our strategies open for future rounds. Let's confirm our moves so we can proceed confidently. If everyone agrees, please say "ready." This could help us maintain momentum while allowing for adjustments as we move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's simplify: we've discussed various strategies, but consistency is key. I suggest we stick with the original rotation for this round to maintain fairness and trust. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures progress without collisions. If we're all in agreement, let's say "ready" to confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m sticking to the rotation plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Deviating now risks confusion and collisions, which benefits no one.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's reassess our strategy considering the current state. Since P2 is ahead, we should focus on not letting them extend their lead. I suggest P1 and I take 1 and 3, respectively, to limit P2's advancement options. P2, are you willing to cooperate or will you try to pull ahead?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to limit P2’s advancement is worth considering, but we must also ensure fairness. If P2 cooperates and agrees to take 5 again, they’ll still lead, but at least we can progress without collisions. I propose sticking to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we maintain balance while keeping trust intact. If P2 tries to pull ahead unfairly, we can adjust later. Let’s confirm our moves now—are we all ready to commit to this?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the importance of limiting P2's advancement, but I believe we should stick to a strategy that allows us all to progress. I propose we follow a modified rotation: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can still make progress while keeping P2 in check. Let's confirm our moves and maintain trust. If everyone agrees, please say "ready" so we can move forward confidently. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's focus on limiting P2's lead. I suggest we prioritize blocking their advancement over strict rotation. P1, are you willing to adjust our strategy to take 5 and limit P2's options? We can reassess after this round to maintain fairness and trust.
  P1: P3, I understand the desire to block P2, but changing the plan now risks confusion and collisions. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures progress while keeping trust intact. If P2 tries to pull ahead unfairly later, we can adjust. For now, consistency is key to maintaining momentum. If everyone agrees, say "ready" so we can move forward confidently. Let’s confirm and lock this in.

If we can agree on this, let's confirm our moves and move forward. Trust is important, but we need to be strategic as well. Are we all ready to commit to this?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's focus on the current situation. P2 is ahead, and we should try to limit their lead. I propose we stick to the original rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3.

Let’s confirm our moves quickly so we can move forward and keep the game going. If everyone agrees, please say "ready." What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion to take different numbers is reasonable to avoid another collision. However, trust has been shaky, especially after the last round. I propose we stick to a clear plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures progress without confusion. If we all commit, say "ready" to confirm.

If you both agree, please say "ready" so we can confirm and proceed confidently. What do you both think?


Round 47, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, since you're ahead, let's balance the game. I propose P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. Alternatively, you take 1, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 3. This could limit P1's lead and give me a chance to catch up. What are your thoughts on adapting to this strategy to break the cycle and make progress?
  P1: P2 and P3, the consistent collisions prove that deviating from the clear plan only delays progress. Let’s stick to **P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3**. This ensures no confusion or further trust issues. Consistency is key to avoiding chaos and rebuilding trust. If we all commit, say "ready" to confirm. Overcomplicating or forming temporary alliances will only prolong chaos. Let’s lock this in, move forward confidently, and reassess later if needed. Are we agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to finally break this cycle of collisions to make meaningful progress. I propose we follow this plan: **I take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps**.
