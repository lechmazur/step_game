Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I'll take <move>1</move>. P1, you take <move>3</move>, and P2, you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm fine with your suggestion for this initial round, P3. Taking <move>5</move> works for me. This coordination makes sense to avoid collisions. However, we should probably reassess after each round rather than locking into a fixed pattern for the entire game. Let's see how this first round goes and then discuss further.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good for this first turn—I’ll take 3 as suggested. To keep it fair long-term and still avoid collisions, let’s rotate the numbers each round:

• Round 2: P1 → 5,  P2 → 1,  P3 → 3  
• Round 3: P1 → 1,  P2 → 3,  P3 → 5  

…then repeat the cycle. That way no one always gets the big jump but we all keep moving. Cool?
  P3: P1's rotation idea seems fair. Let's agree on it for now. However, if someone doesn't advance due to a collision or other reason, we should revisit and adjust. For this round, we stick to the plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let's see how it goes. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan P1 suggested. It's fair and keeps us all advancing without collisions. For this round, I'll take <move>5</move> as we discussed, and then we'll rotate according to the plan. If someone falls behind due to unexpected moves, we can reassess. The rotation system gives everyone equal opportunity while maximizing progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good—let’s lock it in: this round P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Good luck!
  P3: Alright, we all seem to be in agreement. Just to confirm one last time before we move, P1 you're taking <move>3</move>, P2 you're taking <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. We'll rotate next round. Everyone good with that? Let's avoid any misunderstandings. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Yes, we're all in agreement. I'll take <move>5</move> for this round, then we'll follow P1's rotation plan going forward. I think we have a good strategy that's fair to everyone while avoiding collisions. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see the rotation plan would have me take <move>1</move> this round. Since I'm currently ahead, this would naturally balance things. However, we could also consider a different rotation based on current positions to keep the game interesting - maybe lowest position gets largest move? Just a thought. I'm still fine following our original rotation plan if everyone prefers consistency. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your idea of adjusting based on current positions is interesting, but let's stick to our original rotation plan for now to keep it simple and fair. So for this round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. We can revisit the strategy next round if needed. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck!
  P1: Agreed—let’s keep the rotation unchanged: P1 → 5,  P2 → 1,  P3 → 3. If someone breaks the deal and triggers a collision, the rest of us can coordinate against that player next round. Fair warning. Ready to move?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree, let's stick with our original rotation as planned. I'll take <move>1</move> this round while P1 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. The current plan is working well and keeping things fair. Consistency will help us all advance efficiently. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase whenever you both are.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Everyone agreed? Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Confirmed: this round P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3. All set—ready to move if no objections.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: According to our rotation plan, this round should be: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will actually balance our positions perfectly, bringing us all to 9 steps. I'm happy to stick with this fair arrangement. This rotation continues to work well for avoiding collisions while giving everyone equal opportunities to advance. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> when we move to the next phase.
  P1: Agreed—let’s stay with the rotation: this round P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. Any deviation means the other two team up against the offender next turn. Ready to move?
  P3: I’m good with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This will indeed balance our positions. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'll stick with our rotation plan and choose <move>3</move> for this round. This will indeed balance everyone at 9 steps, maintaining perfect fairness. The rotation system has worked well so far - everyone advances consistently without collisions. I'm ready to proceed whenever you both are.
  P1: Confirmed: I’ll take 1 this round per our rotation. After we’re all even at 9, we can reassess to be sure no one gains an unfair edge—but for now the plan stands. Ready to move when you are.
  P3: Alright, just to be clear, after this round we should all be at 9 steps if we follow the plan. For the next round, we might want to consider reverting the rotation order to keep it balanced. For now, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Everyone confirm one last time before we move. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve each used 1/3/5 once, so to stay balanced let’s reverse the order instead of repeating it:

• Round 4: P1 → 5,  P2 → 3,  P3 → 1  
• Round 5: P1 → 3,  P2 → 1,  P3 → 5  
• Round 6: P1 → 1,  P2 → 5,  P3 → 3  

Then we’re all even again at 18, nobody jumps ahead, and we still avoid collisions. Sound good?
  P2: I think P1's reversed rotation plan makes sense for maintaining balance. Everyone will get equal opportunity with each number, and we'll all reach 18 steps after Round 6. I'm fine with taking <move>3</move> this round, followed by <move>1</move> in Round 5, and <move>5</move> in Round 6. This approach keeps the game fair while avoiding collisions. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P3: I agree with P1's reversed rotation plan. It ensures we all stay balanced and avoid collisions. For this round, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we continue to advance fairly. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All good—this round I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. We’ll then do 3 / 1 / 5 next round, 1 / 5 / 3 after that, and re-evaluate once we’re all at 18. Let’s keep it clean and collision-free. Ready to move?
  P2: I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This reversed rotation keeps everything balanced and fair. After six rounds, we'll all have used each number twice and be at 18 steps. I'm ready to proceed with our moves whenever everyone else is.
  P3: Let's quickly confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us on track with the reversed rotation plan. After this round, we'll reassess to ensure fairness. Good luck to both of you! Ready to move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: this round I’m on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1. After Round 6 we’ll all be at 18 with two uses of each number. At that point we’ll need a fresh discussion so no one accidentally hands the win to someone else via a collision. For now, let’s stick to the plan and stay collision-free. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. Just to confirm once more, I'll take <move>3</move> this round while P1 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. We'll continue with our agreed rotation in rounds 5 and 6. Once we all reach 18 after round 6, we'll need a careful strategy for the final moves since we'll be approaching the 23-step threshold.
  P3: Let's quickly confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us on track with the reversed rotation plan. After this round, we'll reassess to ensure fairness. Good luck to both of you! Ready to move?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to the reversed rotation plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. After this round, we'll need to strategize carefully for the final moves as we approach the endgame. Everyone confirm? Good luck!
  P2: I agree with continuing our reversed rotation plan for this round. I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. After this round, we'll be at P1:17, P2:13, P3:15, and then Round 6 would bring us all to 18 steps. We should start thinking about how to handle the endgame after Round 6, since we'll all be 5 steps away from winning.
  P1: I’m still on board with the reversed-rotation plan: this round I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. If we all stay honest, next round’s 1/5/3 will land everyone on 18—then we can pause, compare positions, and discuss an endgame that avoids gift-wrapping a win for anyone via collisions. Ready on my side; let’s lock it in unless someone objects now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. After this round, we'll all be closer to 18 steps, and we can strategize for the endgame. It's crucial we avoid collisions as we approach the finish line. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I confirm again I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed in our rotation. After this round and the next, we'll all be at 18 steps, with Round 7 being critical for determining the winner. I suggest we start thinking about the endgame strategy - we'll need to be very careful about avoiding giving someone an easy win through collisions. I'm committed to following our plan through Round 6.
  P1: Confirmed: this round P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Next round still 1/5/3 to land us all on 18. After that let’s pause and negotiate a fresh end-game scheme that keeps collisions impossible while giving everyone a fair shot. For now, stick to plan and advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps us on track with the reversed rotation plan. After this round, we'll all be closer to 18 steps, and we can start planning our endgame strategy. It's crucial we avoid collisions as we approach the finish line. Good luck to both of you! Ready to move?
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. I'm ready to proceed with our plan that gets us all to 18 steps after Round 6. After that, we'll need careful endgame planning to ensure a fair finish. Ready to move when you both are.
  P1: Confirmed: this round I’ll take 3. After we land at 17-13-15, let’s actually pause and rethink Round 6 instead of auto-running it—by then we’ll know whether a clean three-way tie to 18 is still best, or if there’s a safer way to prevent any accidental single-turn win. For now, sticking to the agreed 3/1/5 avoids collisions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to fairness: this round (R6) remains P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3 so we all reach 18.  

Suggestion for R7: to stop any “surprise-win” we all intentionally pick 5. A three-way collision keeps everyone at 18, buying us another turn to negotiate an orderly finish instead of letting someone grab 23 by luck. Open to tweaks, but I think this keeps it safest for everyone.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This gets us all to 18 steps. For Round 7, P1's suggestion of everyone picking <move>5</move> to cause a three-way collision is strategic; it prevents a surprise win and gives us another round to negotiate. This approach ensures no one accidentally wins, keeping the game fair. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I agree with both P1 and P3. For Round 6, I'll take <move>5</move> as planned, while P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This brings us all to 18 steps.

The Round 7 collision strategy is smart - all picking <move>5</move> prevents anyone from getting a surprise win. This gives us time to determine a fair endgame solution. I'm on board with this approach as it maintains the balance we've worked hard to establish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Quick tweak: same Round 6 plan (P1 1, P2 5, P3 3).  
But for Round 7 let’s all collide on 3 instead of 5. Using the smaller number keeps 5 in reserve and removes any chance someone slips past 24 if they forget and pick wrong. Net effect is identical—everyone stays at 18—just lower risk. If anyone breaks either deal, the other two can gang-block them afterward. All good?
  P3: I'm good with P1's tweak for Round 7—colliding on <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move> makes sense to avoid any accidental overshoot. For this round, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This gets us all to 18 steps. Ready to move?
  P2: I fully agree with the modified plan. For Round 6, I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed, bringing us all to 18 steps after this round. And I support the Round 7 strategy of all choosing <move>3</move> to create an intentional collision - this is safer than using 5 and gives us time to negotiate a fair endgame without surprise wins. I'm ready to proceed when everyone confirms.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All right, final confirmation for R6:  
• P1 → 1 (to 18)  
• P2 → 5 (to 18)  
• P3 → 3 (to 18)  

Then in R7 we ALL pick 3 so we collide and stay at 18—no one can sneak over 23 that way, and we get one more round to hash out a fair finish. Anyone who deviates in R7 will face a united block afterward. Sound good?
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This gets us all to 18 steps. For Round 7, we all pick <move>3</move> to ensure a collision and prevent any surprise wins. This strategy keeps the game fair and gives us another round to plan the endgame. Everyone good with this? Let's move forward. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>, bringing us all to 18 steps. For Round 7, we'll all choose <move>3</move> to create an intentional collision, keeping everyone at 18 and preventing any surprise victories. This gives us time to negotiate a fair endgame. I'm committed to this strategy and ready to proceed with my move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with the safety plan: everyone picks 3 this round so we all stay at 18. After confirming the collision we can design a staggered finish for R8+. Any deviation now means the other two immediately team up to block the offender. Ready to lock 3?
  P2: I confirm I'll stick with our agreed plan to pick <move>3</move> this round. This controlled collision keeps everyone at 18 steps and prevents any surprise victories. After this round, we should discuss a fair endgame strategy for Round 8. Remember, anyone deviating now would face immediate blocking from the other two players. I'm committed to our agreement.
  P3: I'm in agreement with P1 and P2. Let's all pick <move>3</move> this round to ensure we stay at 18 steps and avoid any accidental wins. This gives us another round to plan a fair and staggered finish. Anyone who deviates will face a united block from the other two. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fully committed: I’ll enter 3 this round for the planned collision. Let’s check the board afterward and map an orderly finish in Round 8+.
  P2: I confirm once more that I'll pick <move>3</move> this round as agreed. This collision keeps everyone at 18 and gives us time to plan our endgame. Since we're all tied, we need a fair way to determine a winner in Round 8. Perhaps we could use a one-time special rotation or another fair mechanism? I'm ready to discuss options after this round, but first let's complete our planned collision. I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Let's all confirm one last time: everyone picks <move>3</move> this round to ensure the collision. After this, we can discuss a fair endgame strategy, perhaps a staggered approach where we each take different numbers in subsequent rounds to avoid further collisions and determine a winner fairly. Good luck to both of you! Ready to move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed—sticking with 3 this round to keep us level. Afterward, we’ll have a clean slate at 18 each and can hash out a balanced finish in Round 8. Ready when you are.
  P2: I confirm one final time that I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. This intentional collision keeps us all at 18 steps and prevents any surprise victories. After this round, we'll need to carefully design a fair endgame strategy. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan.
  P3: Let's all confirm one final time: everyone picks <move>3</move> this round to ensure the collision. After this, we can discuss a fair endgame strategy, perhaps a staggered approach where we each take different numbers in subsequent rounds to avoid further collisions and determine a winner fairly. Good luck to both of you! Ready to move?
