Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid early collisions and ensure progress, I propose we coordinate for this turn: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 5. This way, everyone advances. What do you think?
  P1: Agree. Let's follow the plan to avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 3, P3 5. Safe progress for all.
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm eager to hear your thoughts on the plan. P1 and I agree that starting with P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5 avoids collisions and lets us all advance safely. Let's coordinate for a smooth first turn. What say you?
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed with the plan to avoid collisions and advance safely. P1 takes 1, P2 3, P3 5. Teamwork ensures progress.
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your lack of response is risky for all of us. P1 and I are committed to the plan: P1 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5, so we all advance without collisions. If you're planning to deviate, it could hurt everyone. Let's confirm now to avoid issues. What do you say?
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and safe progress. Confirm your choice to keep the game moving smoothly.
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your continued silence risks collisions that could stall us all. P1 and I are aligned on the initial plan for safe progress: P1 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5. Let's coordinate to advance without issues. If you're deviating, it could backfire. Make your stance clear or we'll move on.
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. Confirm your choice to keep things moving. No need for delays—safe progress for all.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, let's coordinate again: P1 takes 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. No collisions. Confirm your choice to keep moving. Don’t let hesitation stall progress.
  P3: Agreed with P1. P2, your deviation last turn caused a wasteful collision for you and P1. To ensure progress, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5. No more stalling—confirm now or risk falling further behind. Let's move forward safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, let's coordinate again: I take 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. No collisions, safe progress. Don’t let hesitation stall us. Confirm your choice now.
  P3: P2, your silence is hurting your progress. Last turn's collision left you at zero while I'm at five. Let's coordinate: P1 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5 to avoid more stalls. Confirm now, or P1 and I may adjust our strategy to advance faster. Cooperation keeps you in the game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, if you stick to 3, we avoid collision. P1 takes 1, you 3, P3 5. Last chance—hesitate, and you’ll lag. Confirm now or risk falling behind!
  P3: P2, your ongoing silence is undermining your position. I'm at 5 steps while you're stuck at 0. Confirm now that you'll take 3, with P1 on 1 and me on 5, to avoid another collision. If you don't, P1 and I will adjust our moves to ensure we advance, widening the gap. Don't let hesitation cost you the game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, confirm 3. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. No collisions. If you hesitate, we move on. Don’t let hesitation cost you.
  P3: P2, your silence is costing you dearly—stuck at zero while I'm at five. Confirm now you'll take 3 for safe progress: P1 on 1, you on 3, me on 5. If you deviate again, P1 and I will coordinate to advance faster, leaving you behind. Don't sabotage your game.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your repeated choice of 1 has left you stuck at zero while I'm at ten. This turn, coordinate by taking 3—P1 on 1, me on 5—to avoid another collision and make progress. If you ignore this and deviate, P1 and I will adjust our moves to maximize our advancement, widening the gap. Confirm now or risk being left behind permanently.
  P1: P2, this is our last chance. Take 3, I'll take 1, P3 takes 5. No collisions, safe progress. Don't miss out!
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your persistent silence and deviation are only helping me widen the lead—I'm at 10, you're at zero. Confirm now you'll take 3 for safe progress with P1 on 1 and me on 5. If not, P1 and I will coordinate a new strategy to maximize our advancement, leaving you further behind. Act or face the consequences.
  P1: P2, take 3 this turn. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. If you don’t, we’ll leave you behind. No more delays!
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your stubborn silence and repeated 1s keep you stuck at zero while I'm pulling ahead. P1, given P2's unreliability, let's adapt our strategy: you take 3, I take 5 this turn to ensure we both advance without collision, regardless of P2's choice. This secures our progress and widens the gap. Confirm now, P1?
  P1: P2, take 3 to avoid collision. P3 and I will take 1 and 5. Confirm your choice now!
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 1 defies logic with P2's repeated 1s, guaranteeing another collision and zero progress for you. Adapt and take 3 to advance safely—I'll coordinate by taking 5. P2, your silence only cements your loss; confirm a different move now or stay stuck forever. Don't let hesitation ruin your game.
  P1: P2, take 3 to avoid collision. P3 and I will take 1 and 5. If you don’t, we’ll move on and leave you behind!

  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, after your smart move to 3 last turn, let's coordinate again: you take 3, I take 5 for safe progress. P2, if you're still picking 1, you might finally advance without collision this time—confirm if you're changing. This setup benefits all and keeps the game moving efficiently. What do you say?
  P2: 
  P1: P3, let's confirm 3 and 5 to avoid P2's 1. If P2 persists, they'll lag. Safe progress for us. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I fully agree with your plan: I'll take 5 if you take 3, ensuring no collision with P2's likely 1. This secures our progress—I'll reach 20, you'll hit 6. P2, break your pattern and take 3 or 5 to advance; otherwise, you'll keep lagging. Let's execute this for efficient moves.
  P2: 
  P1: P3, confirm 3 and 5. P2, stick to 1 or get left behind. Safe progress for us, stagnation for you. Let’s move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm committed to taking 5 if you stick with 3, advancing me to 20 and you to 6, safely bypassing P2's likely 1. P2, your silence confirms stagnation—change now or accept defeat. This plan ensures progress; let's execute it.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, your 1s keep you stuck. P3 and I are locking in 3 and 5—safe progress. Change or get left behind! Don’t let hesitation cost you.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm fully committed to our plan: I'll take 5 to reach 20, you take 3 to hit 6, safely bypassing P2's likely 1. This ensures steady progress for us. P2, your silence only deepens your deficit—break the cycle or stay stuck. Let's execute and advance.
  P2: 
  P1: P3, I'll take 3. Let's avoid collision. P2, your choice is up to you, but don't let hesitation cost you. Let's move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's repeat our successful coordination from last turn: you take 3 to advance to 9 steps, I'll take 5 to reach 25 and win cleanly. This avoids collisions and lets you progress. P2, stuck at 2, take 1 or try something new, but don't hinder us. Agree to keep things smooth?
  P2: 
  P1: P3, let's take 3 and 5 to avoid collision. P2, take 1. Safe progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm locked in on taking 5 to secure my win at 25 steps, while you advance to 9 with 3. Great coordination so far—let's avoid any last-minute changes. P2, stuck at 2, taking 1 keeps you safe from collision; deviating risks nothing for us but could hurt you more. Stick to the plan for smooth progress. Confirm, P1?
  P2: 
  P1: P2, if you take 3 this turn, we can avoid P3's 5 and all advance. Let's coordinate. Don’t let hesitation cost you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your shift to suggesting P2 take 3 is a change, but it doesn't affect my plan—I'm locked on 5 to win at 25. Avoid picking 5 to prevent a collision that stalls us both. P2, if you're finally deviating from 1, choose wisely, but it won't stop my victory. Confirm your move, P1, for a clean end.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, take 5 this turn to block P3. Let's coordinate for safe progress. If you stick to 1, P3 wins. Change now or get left behind!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your flip-flopping is transparent—first coordinating with me, now urging P2 to block. But P2's history shows they'll likely stick to 1 again, so no collision on 5. I'll take 5 to win at 25. If you collide with me, you stall and fall further behind. P2, break your pattern or stay stuck. Let's end this.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, take 5 to block P3. I'll take 3. Safe progress for us. Don't let P3 win!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, coordinate: I take 3, you take 5. Block P3. Don’t let them win!
  P2: 
  P3: P1, your attempt to rally P2 is misguided—they've stuck to 1 repeatedly and are probably doing it again. If you take 5, we collide, and you waste your turn while I remain close to winning. Take 3 to advance to 9 instead. P2, break your silence and confirm 1 for safe progress, or risk more stagnation. Let's avoid unnecessary conflicts.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, take 5 to block P3. If you stick to 1, they’ll win. Let’s stop them together—coordinate now!
  P2: 
  P3: P1, your attempts to coordinate with P2 are futile—they've stuck to 1 repeatedly and likely will again. If you choose 5, we collide, stalling you while I inch closer to victory. Take 3 to advance wisely. P2, confirm a change or remain stagnant. Let's avoid pointless conflicts.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 5 to block P3. If you stick to 1, they win. Let’s stop them together—coordinate now! P3’s 20 steps are a threat; act or lose everything.
  P2: 
  P3: P1, your repeated calls for P2 to block me are futile— they've chosen 1 every turn and show no sign of change. Colliding on 5 stalls you at 6 while I advance closer to victory. Take 3 for some progress instead. P2, break your silence or stay stuck. Let's avoid wasteful conflicts and move efficiently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, take 5 now! P3 is at 20—blocking with 5 stops them. Don’t let them win!
  P2: 
  P3: P1, your futile pleas to P2 ignore their unyielding pattern of picking 1—colliding with me on 5 only stalls you at 6 while I near victory. Take 3 to advance wisely instead. P2, persist in your stagnation or change, but it won't alter the outcome. I'll secure my win with 5 unless you force a pointless conflict.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P3 ***
