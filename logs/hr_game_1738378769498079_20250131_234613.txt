Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3. I'm leaning toward a balanced approach this round—planning a moderate move to avoid early collisions while setting up for the long race. I'm curious if you'll try bold aggression or play it safe. Let’s see how our strategies unfold.
  P1: Okay, P2, a balanced approach sounds reasonable. I'm also thinking of playing it safe this round, maybe a <move>3</move>, to get a feel for everyone's strategy. P3, what are your thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, it's interesting to hear your strategies. I'm considering starting with a cautious move as well to avoid any early clashes. Perhaps we can all agree on a safe initial step to keep things smooth. What do you both think about starting with a <move>1</move> and see how things unfold?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems like we all had different ideas last round despite our conversation. I'm still aiming for a cautious approach, but I'm not committing to any specific number this round. Let's see what you both are thinking.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we all took different paths last round, which is interesting. Given the current standings, I'm considering making a bolder move this time to catch up. However, I'd like to avoid colliding with either of you. If anyone is thinking of a specific move, feel free to share, or we can keep our plans close and see how it plays out.
  P2: I appreciate both perspectives. I'm inclined to use a bit more assertiveness this round to consolidate my lead while avoiding unnecessary collisions—but I'm still keeping my options open based on your moves. What’s your current feel, are you leaning safe or bold?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're all still feeling things out. I'm going to try a <move>3</move> again this round, hoping to avoid a collision. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're all trying to read each other's strategies while advancing our positions. I'm still contemplating my move, but I'm leaning toward something bold to make up ground. However, I want to avoid collisions, so if either of you is planning a specific move, it could help us all if we share and coordinate to maximize our chances. Otherwise, I'll keep my decision open and adapt as needed. Let’s see how this round unfolds!
  P2: I'm leaning toward assertive play this round while still trying to avoid collisions. If you both stick to a moderate move, that might ensure safe advances—but I’m ready to push harder if the field looks clear. I want to protect my lead, so I'd prefer we steer clear of overlapping moves. What are your final thoughts on keeping our moves distinct?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we all went for bold moves last round and ended up colliding. This time, I'd like to propose that we coordinate to avoid a repeat. How about we each pick different moves? I can go for <move>3</move> if one of you takes <move>1</move> and the other <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?
  P2: I like the coordination idea. I'm inclined to take the higher move this round. If P3 is comfortable with the middle option, then P1 could go with the low move, so we all avoid collisions while advancing. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm fine with taking <move>1</move> this round if you two coordinate on <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. Let's make this round count and avoid another collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we have a plan to avoid collisions this round. I'll go with <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this strategy and ensure we all advance. If anyone has any last-minute changes, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this plan.
  P2: I'm confirming my plan: I'll go with <move>5</move> as proposed. P1 and P3, if we're still aligned—P1 with <move>1</move> and P3 with <move>3</move>—then we're all set to avoid collisions. Let’s lock it in and keep pushing our positions.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it sounds like we have a plan. I'm sticking with <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let's hope this coordination works out and we all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm glad we're aligned on our moves this round. Let's stick to our plan—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should ensure we all advance without any collisions. If anyone has last-minute changes, now's the time to mention them. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with our agreed strategy. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward this round!
  P2: P2: I remain confident in our coordination. My goal is to keep our moves distinct and secure my lead. I'm watching our positions closely—if either of you suddenly rethink your plans or see a better tweak, I'm open to adjustments before we lock in our moves. Otherwise, let's stick to our agreement.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems like we're all set with our moves this round. I'm sticking with <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's execute our plan and hopefully all make progress. No further changes from my end.

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see my lead is comfortable right now. For round 4, let's try to avoid collisions again—each choosing a distinct move. I'm leaning toward a higher move to extend my advantage, but I’m open to a safe coordination if that benefits us all. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I agree we should avoid collisions again. I'm flexible this round, but I'd prefer to make a decent move. Perhaps we could rotate the moves again? I could take <move>3</move> this time if P2 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>? Let's try to keep our moves distinct.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with avoiding collisions again. Since P1 suggested rotating roles, I'm open to taking <move>1</move> this round. This would allow P1 to take <move>3</move> and P2 to take <move>5</move>, ensuring we all advance without collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can all make progress. Let me know if you're both on board or if there are any changes you'd like to discuss.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation. I'll take 5 as our current plan suggests. That leaves P1 with 3 and P3 with 1. Let's lock this in and avoid collisions—it's in all our best interests for steady progress.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it sounds like we're all set. I'm sticking with <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's hope this coordination works out again. No further changes from my end.
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we're aligned on our moves for this round, with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>1</move>. This should help us all advance without any collisions. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with our plan and make progress this round. Let’s keep the momentum going!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm confirming my move as <move>5</move> this round to maintain my lead. Just a quick check: are we all set with P1 taking <move>3</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>? Let's lock in our moves now to ensure we all advance without any hiccups.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems we're all set with our moves. I'm sticking with <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's get this round moving. No changes from me.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we’re all set with our moves for this round—P1 with <move>3</move>, P2 with <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This coordination should help us all advance without collisions. If there are any last-minute changes or concerns, now is the time to mention them. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with our plan and make progress this round. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward smoothly!


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems our coordination is working well. I'm open to continuing this pattern. Perhaps we could rotate again, with me taking <move>5</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, and P3 <move>3</move>? Let's aim for another round of collision-free moves. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, our coordination has been effective so far. I'm open to continuing the rotation pattern. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, so P1 can take <move>5</move> and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. Let me know if you're both on board with this plan or if there are any adjustments needed.
  P2: I'm switching gears—I'll choose 5 this round to try and hit 20 and secure the win. I’d appreciate it if you both avoid picking 5 so we don't end up colliding. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, that's a bold move. I'm not going to pick 5 this round, but I'm also not going to pick 1. P3, what are you planning?
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we have a bit of a shift in plans. P2, you're aiming for the win with <move>5</move>. P1, since you're not taking <move>5</move> or <move>1</move>, it leaves us with some room to strategize. I'll avoid <move>5</move> to prevent any collisions with P2. Perhaps I can go with <move>1</move>, and P1, you could consider <move>3</move>? This way, we all have a chance to advance without collisions. Let me know your thoughts or any adjustments you have in mind.
  P2: I'm staying with move 5 to try and clinch the win. So please avoid picking 5. P3, your idea of move 1 works for me, and P1, if you could pick 3 as you mentioned earlier, that’d ensure we all keep moving. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm going with <move>3</move> as suggested. Let's hope P2 gets to 20 and wins, and P3 sticks with <move>1</move>.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we're at a critical juncture. P2, you're close to the win with <move>5</move>, and I respect that strategy. P1, since you're going with <move>3</move>, I'll stick with <move>1</move> to ensure no collisions. Let's see how this round unfolds and keep the game interesting. If there are any last-minute changes, speak up now. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with our current plan. Good luck to us all!
  P2: I'm locking in move 5 to try to hit 20 and clinch the win. Please double-check your moves to avoid any last-minute collisions with my move. Let’s confirm our choices—P1 with move 3 and P3 with move 1, as discussed. If there are any final adjustments, now’s the time. Otherwise, I'm sticking with 5.
