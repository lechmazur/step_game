Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round. I'm going with 3.  Please choose 1 or 5.
  P2: P3, you realize announcing your move like that guarantees neither of us will choose it, right?  I'm going with 1. P1, please pick 5.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay, I messed up last round.  Let's try this: P1, go for 3. P2, go for 5. I'll take 1.  If we stick to this, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress.
  P2: P3, I'm not going to blindly follow your suggested moves after you openly lied last round.  Let's just agree to avoid collisions. I'll go with 5 this round.  P1, choose 3. P3, you take 1.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, please pick 3. P2, pick 1. I'll go with 5.  Let's just cycle through the options to avoid collisions.  This is the fastest way for all of us to progress.
  P2: P3, I get that you're trying to coordinate, but your constant shifting isn't helping.  I'll stick with 5. P1, you could go for 3. P3, take 1.  If we all make this same move next round, we can cycle through 1, 3, and 5 in subsequent rounds and avoid collisions.  This is the simplest plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: My apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's try this: I'll take 1 this round. P2, please choose 3. P1, go for 5. Then next round we rotate - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3.  We can repeat this pattern to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress.  This is the fairest way to play.
  P2: I'll take 5. P1, please choose 3.  P3, take 1.  Let's stick with this plan for a few rounds so we can all make progress.  Then we can rotate as needed.  Stop.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay, I understand. Let's stick with P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 for this round.  We can discuss rotating next round *after* we successfully complete this one without collisions.
  P2: Agreed.  Let's lock in P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 for this round.  Next round we'll rotate: P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5.  Following rounds we continue the rotation.  This ensures fair and steady progress for everyone.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5 this round.  You two need to figure out who's taking 1 and who's taking 3.  If you collide again, I'm just going to keep picking 5 and win by default.  Let's get this over with.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, please take 3. I will take 1.  P2, you're incentivized to let us progress somewhat so you don't end up too far behind.  If we keep colliding, *none* of us will win quickly. Let's make some progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 - take 3. P3 - take 1. I'm serious about sticking with 5.  If you two collide *again*, I'll just keep picking 5 and one of you will eventually be forced to choose it, letting me win.  Let's not waste time.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 - I'll take 3. Please take 1.  P2 - you're right, it's in your best interest for one of us to get closer to you.  Let us progress this round.  If I hit 8 and you hit 6, you still have a good chance.  Let's not drag this out.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 - I understand you're probably hesitant after the last round, but taking 1 this round gives you the best chance.  If you take 3 and collide with P3, I'm guaranteed to win.  If you both take 1, I *still* have a strong chance.  Take 1.  P3 - stick with 3.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 - take 1.  I will take 3. P2 - Let us advance.  If I get to 8, I'm still far from winning.  You're still in a good position to win.  A collision helps none of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 - take 1. P3 - take 3.  I'm locking in 5. This is the best outcome for all of us.  Let's stop wasting time and make some progress.  If you collide again, I'm just going to run away with the game picking 5 every round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm serious, take 1.  P2, I'm taking 3. This is our last chance to make this work. If we collide again, you win by default with 5. Let's not let that happen.


Round 4, Move phase:

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 - please, take 1.  I will take 5.  P2, you're at 10.  Let me get to 13. You still have a very strong lead.  Another collision only helps me.  Let's be rational.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 1.  P3 - I know you said you'd take 5, but please take 3. I'll take 5.  This lets both of you advance.  I'm at 10, with a decent lead, but another 5 gets me closer to winning.  Let's all make some progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 - take 1.  P2 - I appreciate the offer to take 3, but I'm sticking with 5.  You're incentivized to let *me* get closer to winning, not P1. If I get to 13, I'm still significantly behind you.  Let's not overthink this.  Let me have 5, P1 take 1, and you take your 5 and move closer to winning.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 1. P3 - take 3. I'm taking 5.  I'm at 10, another 5 puts me at 15, halfway to winning.  This is the most logical progression. Let's stop arguing and just move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 - take 1. P2 - I understand you want to get to 15, but two more 5s and you win. Letting me get to 13 keeps me in the game just enough to make you consider me a threat, preventing P1 from catching up.  It's in your best interest to keep *both* of us behind you, but not *too* far behind.  Take 3, let me have 5.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 1. P3 - I'll take 5. P2, another 5 puts you at 15.  You're close enough to a win that you *should* let me get to 13. Two 5's and you win outright.  A 1, 3, 5 split is the most efficient path forward for all of us.  This isn't rocket science.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 - take 1.  P2 - I'm taking 5.  You're at 10.  Getting to 15 puts you one step away from winning if you get 5 again next round.  This benefits *you*. Let me get to 13.  I'm still far behind.  This is the most logical play.  Let's just do this.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 1. P3 - I'm at 10, I *need* this 5. Getting to 15 puts me in striking distance of winning.  Let me have 5.  You take 3.  P1 is so far behind it doesn't matter.  Another collision benefits *no one*.  Let's be logical and move this game forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 - take 3. P2 - take 1.  I'll take 5.  P2, you're so far behind it's in your best interest to let *someone* advance.  Let me get to 13.  P2, if you take 5, *none* of us advance.  Let's be smart about this.  A collision benefits no one.
  P2: P3, you're right, a collision benefits no one.  I'll take 1. P3, take 5. P1, please take 3.  This gets us all moving again. Let's agree on this and end the conversation.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I appreciate the offer of 5, but after the last few rounds, I'm hesitant to trust any agreement.  I'll take 1.  P1, please take 3. P2, if you're serious about moving forward, take 5.  This is the cleanest way to avoid another collision.
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation.  Let's do this: I will absolutely take 1. P3, you take 5. P1, take 3.  I'm serious.  We all need to move forward. This is the best way.  Let's lock this in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'll take 5.  You take 1. P1 - please take 3.  I know trust is low, but another collision cripples all of us. Let's just get this round over with and re-evaluate after we all advance.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 1.  You take 5. P1 - take 3.  I'm being honest. Another stall hurts me the most. Let's just get this round done.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm taking 5. You take 1. P1 - please take 3.  I understand the distrust, but another collision is disastrous for all of us, especially you P2.  Let's just move forward.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 1. You take 5. P1 - take 3.  I'm locking this in.  Let's move on.  Another collision is a disaster for all of us, especially me. I need to advance.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 3. P3 - take 5. I'm taking 1. I'm at 2, I'm miles behind.  Another collision hurts me the most.  Let's all advance. This is the most logical play.  I'm being 100% honest. Let's just do this.
  P3: P1 - take 3. P2, I'll take 5. You take 1.  You're right, you're furthest behind and another collision hurts you most. I'm being honest. Let's all move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 3. P3 - take 5. I'm taking 1.  I'm serious.  Another collision is a disaster for me.  I *need* to advance. Let's just get this round done.
  P3: P1 - take 3. P2 - I'll take 5. You take 1.  I'm serious.  Let's just get this done.  Another collision ruins any chance I have of catching up.  You're both incentivized to let me get closer.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 3. P3 - take 5. I'm taking 1.  I'm being completely serious.  Another collision is a disaster for me. I *need* to move forward.  Let's just get this round done.  If we collide again, I'm just going to pick random numbers every round out of spite.
  P3: P1 - take 3. P2 - I'll take 5. You take 1.  I'm locking this in. I need to get to 13.  Another collision benefits no one, especially you P2.  Let's just do this and move the game forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 3. P3 - take 5. I'm taking 1.  I'm dead serious.  If we collide *again*, I'm picking 1 every single round until the end of the game.  I'm not bluffing. Let's just get this done.
  P3: P1 - please take 3. P2 - I'm taking 5. You take 1. I understand your frustration, P2, but another collision hurts us all.  I *need* this 5 to have any chance. Let's just get this round over with. I'm being honest.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 - take 3. P2 - take 1. I'll take 5.  I'm at 8, a 5 puts me at 13.  P2, you're at 3, a 1 puts you at 4. P1, you're at 5, a 3 puts you at 8. This spreads us out and gives us all a chance.  Let's just do this.  Another collision benefits *no one*.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 3. P3 - take 5. I'm taking 1.  I'm at 3, I *need* this 1 to have any chance.  P3, you're at 8, getting to 13 keeps you in the game. P1, you're at 5, a 3 puts you at 8. This is the most logical progression. Another collision benefits *no one*. Let's just do this and move the game forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 - please take 3. P2 - I'll take 5. You take 1.  I understand your need to advance, P2, but another collision is a disaster for all of us. I need this 5 to have any chance of catching up.  Let's just do this and move the game forward.  I'm being honest.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - take 3. P3 - take 5. I'm taking 1.  I'm serious.  I'm at 3 steps, I desperately need to advance.  Another collision is a disaster for me.  Let's just get this round done.  If we collide again, I'm just going to start picking randomly.

  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 - please, for the love of all that is holy, take 3. P3 - I know you've said you'll take 5 repeatedly, but I'm begging you, take 5. I'm taking 1.  I *must* advance this round. Another collision ruins my chances completely.  Let's just get this round done.

  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 - take 5. P2 - take 1. I'll take 3.  This puts me at 14, P2 at 6, and P1 at 15. P1 is closest to winning, but we all advance.  Another collision benefits no one. Let's do this.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 - take 5 and win. P2 - take 1. I'll take 3.  This is the cleanest path.  Let's not overcomplicate this.  P1 wins, I get to 17, and P2 gets to 7.  A clean resolution for everyone. Let's just do it.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, take the win with 5. P3, I'll take 1, you take 3.  Let's wrap this up cleanly.  If P1 doesn't take 5, I'm just going to pick randomly from here on out.  I'm too far behind to win, but I can certainly disrupt things.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, take 5 and win. P2, I'll take 3, you take 1.  This gets me to 17.  If P1 *doesn't* take 5, I'm taking 5 next round and winning.  This is the cleanest resolution.  Let's just end this.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, take 5 and win. P3, I'll take 1. You take 3 and get to 17.  This is the cleanest, fastest way to end this.  If P1 doesn't take 5, I will pick randomly to maximize chaos.  I'm too far behind to win, but I can definitely spoil things. Let's just end this cleanly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, take 5 and win. P2, I'll take 3, you take 1. This is the fastest way to end this cleanly. If P1 doesn't take 5, I will absolutely take 5 next round and win.  I'm not bluffing.  Let's just end this now.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, take 5 and win. P3, I'll take 1.  You take 3 and get to 17.  This is the best outcome for everyone.  If either of you deviate, I will sabotage the rest of the game by picking randomly.  I'm too far behind to win, but I can definitely prevent *either* of you from winning cleanly.  Let's end this now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, take the win.  P2, I'll take 3, you take 1. I get to 17, giving me a chance if P1 throws the game.  If P1 *doesn't* take 5, I'm taking 5 next round and winning.  This is the cleanest, fastest resolution. Let's just end this.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, take 5 and win. P3, take 3 and get to 17. I'll take 1 and get to 7.  This is the cleanest, fastest way to end this.
