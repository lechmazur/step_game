Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without any risk of blocking each other. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: P1, your plan is interesting, but rigid assignments might be risky if someone deviates later. I favor a flexible approach to adapt each turn based on others’ moves. I'm considering a higher move to build momentum, but I'm keeping my options open. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P1's coordination idea is smart for the first turn to avoid collisions, but P2's point on flexibility is valid for future rounds. I'm open to starting with your plan: I'll take 5 if you both stick to it. Let's ensure we all advance this time and discuss adapting later. What are your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the feedback, P2 and P3. I’m glad we’re aligned on avoiding collisions this round. Let’s stick with the initial plan for now—me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5—to ensure we all advance. We can discuss more flexible strategies for future rounds based on how this plays out. If you’re both still in agreement, I think we’re set. Let me know if anything’s changed on your end.
  P2: I agree for this turn—I'll go with 3. However, I’ll be tracking our progress closely and adjust in future rounds to maximize my win chances. Let's keep our moves dynamic as the game unfolds.
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 5 this turn to avoid collisions and get us all moving. It's a solid start, but like P2 said, we should stay flexible for future rounds based on progress. I'm open to discussing adjustments next time.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good start last round—I'm leading slightly, but fair play is key. Let's stick with coordination for Round 2: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5 to avoid collisions and keep advancing steadily. This maintains balance early on. If you think a change is needed, share your thoughts quickly. Otherwise, I'm on board with this.
  P1: Thanks, P3, for suggesting we stick with the same plan. I’m fine with taking 1 again this round to keep us all moving forward without collisions. P2, are you still okay with 3? If we maintain this for now, we can build a solid foundation and reassess next round based on our positions. Let me know if either of you wants to switch things up—I’m open to ideas if it benefits us all early on.
  P2: I’m reconsidering my move. To keep the race tighter, I'll switch to 5 this round. This way, if P3 still opts for 5, we’ll both cancel out and only P1’s move will count. That might prevent P3 from extending too large a lead. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposed switch to 5 risks a collision that could stall progress for both of us, which isn't ideal for anyone. To maintain steady advancement and avoid conflicts, I suggest we adjust slightly: P1 on 1, me on 3, and you on 5. This keeps us all moving forward. P1, are you still comfortable with 1? Let's aim for cooperation here.
  P1: P3, I appreciate the suggestion to adjust moves for balance. I’m still fine with taking 1 this round to ensure I advance. P2, switching to 5 could risk a collision with P3, stalling you both. I think P3’s new plan—me on 1, P3 on 3, and you on 5—works to keep us all moving forward. Let’s stick with this for now and avoid unnecessary blocks. Are you both still on board with this adjustment? If so, I’m set. Let me know if there’s any change.
  P2: I'm on board with the adjustment—P1: 1, P3: 3, and me with 5 for this round. It avoids collisions and pushes us forward. However, I'll be watching our totals closely and may adapt in future rounds to secure the win.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’ve done well avoiding collisions so far. Since P2 and P3 are tied at 8, and I’m at 2, let’s keep coordinating to advance together this round. I suggest sticking with the same pattern—me on 1, P3 on 3, and P2 on 5—to ensure no blocks and steady progress. If either of you wants to adjust due to the current standings, I’m open to ideas. Let’s keep the balance for now and reassess next round. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm on board with taking 3 this round to keep coordination smooth and avoid collisions. It's a good way to build momentum early. However, with P2 potentially pulling ahead, I suggest we discuss bolder moves next round to stay competitive. P2, are you still committed to 5? Let's keep the dialogue open.
  P2: I'm sticking with our agreed plan for now—P1 on 1, P3 on 3, and me on 5. It keeps us advancing safely while I keep track for any future adjustments. Let’s secure this turn’s gain and stay flexible for later rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned for this round with me on 1, P3 on 3, and P2 on 5. It keeps us moving forward without collisions. Since I’m behind, I appreciate the cooperation to build momentum. Let’s lock this in for now and, as P3 suggested, discuss bolder strategies next round to shake up the standings. If you’re both still set on this plan, I’m ready. Let me know if anything’s changed.
  P3: Actually, I'm reconsidering our plan to avoid P2 pulling further ahead. Since we're tied at 8, I propose a switch for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 stays on 1 to keep things balanced. This ensures no one surges too early. P2, are you okay with this adjustment? P1, thoughts? Let's finalize quickly.
  P2: I actually prefer to take 5 this round. Keeping P1 at 1 and P3 at 3 would put our totals at 3, 13, and 11 respectively. That maintains our progress and lets us avoid collisions, while keeping things competitive. P3, are you okay with this adjustment?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the adjustments being proposed, and I’m still fine with taking 1 to ensure I advance. P2, sticking with 5, and P3, if you’re okay with 3 as P2 suggested, we avoid collisions and keep the race competitive. If P3 prefers 5, I understand the need to balance, but it risks a clash. Let’s finalize a plan that keeps us all moving—my vote is P1:1, P3:3, P2:5. Thoughts? If we’re set, I’m ready.
  P3: P2, I'm concerned about you taking 5 again, as it widens the gap. To keep things balanced and avoid future risks, I still propose I take 5, you take 3, and P1 on 1 for this round. This ensures we all advance without anyone surging ahead. If you're set on 5, it could lead to clashes—let's compromise for mutual benefit. P1, do you support this adjustment?
  P2: I'll stick with the original plan: P1 on 1, P3 on 3, and me on 5. A move of 5 keeps my total ahead, and switching to 3 gives extra ground to P3, which isn't in my favor. P1, I’m fine with 1; P3, 3 avoids collisions while preserving balance. Let's lock this in.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Seeing our current totals, I believe our safest bet is to avoid collisions and keep advancing steadily. I’m inclined toward an aggressive move this turn. P1, if you play low and P3 plays a moderate move, we can all progress without blocking each other. This way, I can build on my slight advantage while keeping the risk minimal. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still behind at 3 steps while you’re both at 8. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions this round. I suggest I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive. P2, I understand wanting to push ahead, but let’s minimize risks for now. If either of you has a different plan to balance things, I’m open to it. What do you think? Let’s finalize quickly to keep moving forward.
  P3: P2, your aggressive move could lead to unnecessary risks and widen gaps. To ensure steady progress and avoid collisions, I suggest we adjust: P1 on 1, me on 5, and you on 3. This balances our positions and keeps the race fair. P1, are you comfortable with 1? Let's confirm quickly to move forward effectively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll stick with taking 5 this turn. Our previous plan—P1 on 1, P3 on 3, and me on 5—minimizes collisions while giving me the edge needed to catch up. Let's confirm that arrangement for this round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at 3 steps and want to keep advancing without collisions. I’m sticking with 1 this round as it’s safe for me. P2, pushing for 5 again risks a clash if P3 also goes high. P3, I’m okay with you taking 5 and P2 taking 3 as you suggested, to balance things out. Let’s agree on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to ensure we all move forward. If you’re both set on different moves, let’s finalize a no-collision plan now. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your insistence on 5 risks a costly collision that stalls both of us, widening P1's relative gain. To maintain balance and ensure progress, I propose P1 on 1, me on 5, and you on 3. This keeps scores even and avoids blocks. P1, are you still comfortable with 1? Let's compromise for a smooth round. If not, we might clash unintentionally.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain set on 5. To avoid a collision and maximize our progress, I propose we agree on P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and I take 5. This keeps things safe and lets me build my lead without giving unnecessary ground. If we all commit, we keep moving forward efficiently.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at 3 steps and need to keep advancing. I’m sticking with 1 to ensure my progress. P2, insisting on 5 risks a clash with P3, stalling you both. P3, I support your plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to balance our scores and avoid collisions. Let’s commit to this for a smooth round. If either of you disagrees, let’s finalize a no-block plan now. I’m ready to move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, with P1 supporting my proposal for P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, it's the safest way to avoid collisions and keep scores balanced. Insisting on 5 risks a stall for both of us, giving P1 an edge. Let's compromise for steady progress—I'm committed to this plan. P1, you're still on board? If not, suggest an alternative quickly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I remain set on 5 this round. Although I see the appeal of switching, with P1 already at 3 it's best if we avoid a collision. I propose we finalize: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I stick with 5. This avoids stalling our moves while keeping progress steady. If you both agree, I'll lock in 5.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at 3 steps and need to advance. I’m sticking with 1 to ensure progress. P2, pushing for 5 risks a clash with P3, stalling you both. I strongly support P3’s plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to keep scores balanced and avoid collisions. Let’s commit to this for a fair round. If either of you has a final adjustment, I’m listening, but I’d like us to lock in a no-block plan now. I’m ready. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your persistence on 5 risks another costly collision, stalling both of us and letting P1 catch up relatively. With P1 supporting my proposal for P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, it's the best way to ensure all advance and keep scores balanced. I'm committed to this for steady progress. P1, confirm if you're still on board? Let's avoid risks and lock this in.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, with you at 13 and me at 11, the gap is critical. I propose we coordinate: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5 to avoid collisions and keep it balanced. If you insist on 5, I may collide with you to slow your lead—let's not risk that. P1, are you okay with 1 again? Thoughts?
  P2: I stand by my aggressive play. I’m committed to 5 for this round. To avoid collisions and let me build on my current lead at 13, I propose P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 3. This should keep progress steady while preserving my advantage. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at 4 steps and need to keep advancing. I’m sticking with 1 this round to ensure progress. P2, pushing for 5 risks a clash with P3, stalling you both. P3, I support your plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to balance things and avoid collisions. Let’s commit to this for a fair round. If either of you has a final adjustment, I’m open, but I’d like a no-block plan now. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm firm on taking 5 this round to close the gap. If you insist on 5, we'll collide again, stalling both of us and letting P1 gain ground relatively—it's not ideal for either. Compromise by taking 3, so we all advance without blocks. P1, I appreciate your support for 1; let's confirm and move forward smoothly to keep the game competitive.
  P2: I understand the concern, but my plan remains: I'm sticking with 5. A collision may delay progress, but it maintains my lead over P3 in the long run. I prefer to risk a stall than drop into a tie. I'm final on 5.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at 4 steps and need to advance. I’m sticking with 1 to ensure progress. P2, insisting on 5 risks another collision with P3, stalling you both. P3, I support your plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to keep things balanced and avoid blocks. Let’s commit to this for a fair round and prevent unnecessary setbacks. If either of you has a last-minute adjustment, I’m open, but I’d like us to lock in a no-collision plan now. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your stubbornness on 5 risks another wasteful collision, stalling both leaders and letting P1 gain relatively. It's shortsighted—compromise by taking 3, so I can safely take 5 and we all advance. This keeps your position strong without unnecessary risk. P1, confirm you're still on 1? Let's lock in a smart plan to avoid setbacks.
  P2: I'm sticking with my aggressive strategy and will choose 5. I understand the risks of collision, but I believe that taking risks now is key to securing a win in the long run. I trust that my lead justifies a bold move. Let's see this play out.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at 4 steps and need to keep moving forward. I’m committed to 1 this round for safe progress. P2, sticking with 5 risks another collision with P3, which helps no one. P3, I back your plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to ensure we all advance and stay competitive. Let’s avoid blocks and commit to this balanced approach. If there’s any last adjustment, I’m open, but I urge a no-collision plan now. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your refusal to compromise risks another pointless collision, stalling both of us and letting P1 inch closer relatively. It's counterproductive when mutual advancement benefits everyone long-term. I insist on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for balanced progress. If you stick to 5, I'll collide to curb your lead. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's end this deadlock wisely.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. I know it risks a collision, but I believe the aggressive approach secures my lead. Any temporary setback is worth maintaining my edge at 13. P3, forcing collisions may slow all of us, and P1, you're free to play safe. I'll ride this risk for the long-term win.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at 4 steps and committed to 1 for safe progress. P2, risking 5 again could stall you and P3, which doesn’t help your lead long-term. P3, I support P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for balanced advancement. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If there’s no agreement, we’re just delaying progress. I’m ready to lock this in. Final thoughts?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're far behind so it’s really down to me and P3. I’m looking to push aggressively this round. P3, if you’re willing to go moderate while I lean high, we can avoid collisions that might let P1 catch up unexpectedly. Let’s finalize a plan quickly.
  P3: P2, your aggressive push risks another costly collision, stalling both of us and helping P1 relatively. To ensure steady progress and keep us tied, I propose P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. This way, I advance to 21, you to 19, maintaining balance. If you insist on 5, I'll collide to prevent you from surging ahead. P1, confirm your move? Let's avoid risks and coordinate smartly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m at 5 steps and still behind, so I’m sticking with 1 to ensure progress. P3, I support your plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid collisions and keep things balanced. P2, pushing high risks a clash with P3, stalling you both. Let’s coordinate for steady advancement this round. If either of you has a different idea, I’m open, but I urge a no-block plan. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the risk in pushing high and upsetting our balance. For round 6, I’ll compromise and pick 3 as suggested—locking in P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. That gives us totals of P1:6, me:19, and P3:21, keeping a competitive yet safe progression. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P3: Great, P2, thanks for compromising on 3—it helps avoid another collision and keeps things balanced. P1, confirmed you're sticking with 1? This plan ensures steady advancement for all. Let's finalize and proceed without delays.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a plan. I confirm I’m sticking with 1 to keep advancing safely. P3, thanks for pushing for balance, and P2, appreciate the compromise on 3. Let’s lock in P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to ensure no collisions and maintain a competitive game. If there’s any last concern or adjustment, I’m open, but I think this works for all of us this round. Ready to finalize. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, I’m confirming my move as 3 for this round. I appreciate our compromise and believe this plan minimizes risks while keeping the race competitive. Let's stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to ensure all progress steadily. Ready to lock this in and move forward!
  P3: Agreed, P2, thanks for the compromise—I'm sticking with 5 to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. P1, confirm you're on 1? With this plan, we all advance steadily. Let's lock in P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 and proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. I’m locked in on 1 to ensure my progress. If there’s any last-minute concern or tweak, I’m open to hear it, but I believe this plan works best for this round. Let’s finalize and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locking in 3 this round as agreed. Let's see how these moves play out—steady progress now should give us more options later. I'm keeping an eye on our totals and ready to adapt if needed. Let's make it count!
  P3: Confirmed, P1 on 1 and P2 on 3—I'm sticking with 5 to avoid collisions and maintain balance. With us all advancing steadily, I'll be in a strong position. Appreciate the cooperation; let's move forward efficiently.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m thrilled we’ve agreed on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round. It ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Since we seem aligned, I think we’re ready to move forward. If there’s any final concern or adjustment, I’m all ears, but I believe this plan is solid for now. Let’s wrap up the conversation and proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're very close to the finish line. I favor avoiding collisions this round so we all advance steadily. While I lean toward a safe move, I'm open to adjustments—especially since your moves, P3, will be crucial given your lead. Let's agree on a plan that prevents stalling. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, with the finish line close and my lead at 21, I propose a coordinated plan to avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, you take 3 to reach 22, and I take 5 to win at 26. This lets you advance significantly without risk. If you insist on 5, we'll collide and stall, benefiting no one. P1, are you comfortable with 1? Let's finalize a smart approach.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P3 at 21 and close to winning, I’m sticking with 1 to ensure I keep advancing. P3, your plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 seems fair to avoid collisions and lets you win this round while P2 gets closer. P2, taking 3 keeps you in contention without risking a clash. I’m on board with this to maintain steady progress. If either of you has a different idea, I’m open, but let’s lock in a no-block plan quickly. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Guys, sticking with 1,3,5 means P3 wins outright. To avoid handing you the win, I’m switching to 5 this round. I propose we try P1:1, P2:5, and P3:3. That way, I hit 24 and you, P3, reach 24 too—which forces us into a tie rather than an immediate loss for me. If you insist on 5 and we collide, everyone stalls and risks giving P1 an opening. Who’s with me on P1:1, P2:5, P3:3?
  P3: P2, your history of not sticking to plans—like claiming 5 but picking 3 last round—makes me doubt your word. I'm firm on taking 5 to secure my win. If you insist on 5, we'll collide again, stalling both and helping no one. Compromise by taking 3, so I advance to 26 and you to 22. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's avoid more deadlocks.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still at 6 steps and sticking with 1 to keep advancing. P3, I understand your push for 5 to win, and P2, I see your reasoning for 5 to force a tie. But a collision risks stalling you both. I suggest P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to let P3 win fairly while P2 advances. If you clash, no one benefits. Let’s finalize a no-block plan now. I’m locked in on 1. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I understand both of your points, but choosing 3 myself gives P3 a clear win. With our scores, I need to protect my lead. I’m insisting on taking 5 so that if P3 agrees to take 3, we’ll tie at 24 while P1 stays at 1. This is the only plan that keeps me competitive instead of handing over a victory. Who’s ready to lock in P1:1, P2:5, P3:3?
  P3: P2, your repeated bluffing undermines trust—last round you claimed 5 but picked 3. I'm committed to taking 5 to secure my win at 26. Colliding stalls us both, but leaves me closer to victory with you farther behind. Compromise by taking 3; it's smarter for you too. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's end this deadlock wisely and avoid mutual setbacks.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on 1 to keep advancing from my 6 steps. P3, taking 5 wins you the game, which I respect. P2, pushing for 5 risks a collision, stalling you both. I urge P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid blocks and let P3 close it out fairly while you gain ground. A clash helps no one at this stage. I’m locked in on 1. Let’s finalize a no-collision plan now. If there’s a last adjustment, I’m open. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm doubling down on 5 this round. With our scores at 6, 19, and 21, I believe an aggressive 5 best protects my standing. If P3 opts for 3, we tie—else collision leaves us all stalled. I urge you, P3, to reconsider for a balanced finish, but I'm committed to 5. Let's lock this in.
  P3: P2, your stubbornness on 5 risks another pointless collision, stalling both leaders and letting P1 gain relatively. It's self-defeating when taking 3 lets you advance to 22 while I win at 26. I've been consistent—I'm committed to 5. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's avoid more deadlocks and move forward wisely.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 to keep advancing from 6 steps. P3, taking 5 secures your win, which seems fair given your lead. P2, insisting on 5 risks a collision, stalling you both with no real gain. Let’s finalize P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid blocks and end this round cleanly. A clash just delays the inevitable. I’m locked in on 1. If there’s any final tweak, I’m open, but let’s wrap this up with no collisions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm locking in 5 this round. P1, I expect you to stick with 1 to keep progressing. P3, if you choose 3, our totals become 8, 24, and 24—a tie between me and you—but if you go with 5, we'll collide, stalling your lead. I believe my aggressive play forces you to choose wisely. Let's avoid giving P1 an opening and keep our competition tight.
  P3: P2, your bluff in round 5—claiming 5 but picking 3—proves you're untrustworthy. I'm committing to 5 this round to secure my win at 26. If you insist on 5, we'll collide again, stalling both leaders and helping P1 relatively. Compromise by taking 3 or lower for mutual benefit. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's avoid folly and coordinate smartly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 to keep advancing from 7 steps. P3, taking 5 wins you the game, which I respect given your lead. P2, pushing for 5 risks another collision, stalling you both. I suggest P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid blocks and let P3 close it out while you gain ground. A clash just delays progress and helps no one. I’m locked in on 1. Let’s finalize a no-collision plan now.

Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm staying with 5 this round to protect my lead. P1, I trust you'll stick with 1. P3, if you opt for 3 instead of 5, we can avoid a collision that only stalls us and may let P1 gain. I believe my aggressive move is essential; so I'm locking in 5. Let's coordinate effectively—adjust if needed, but I remain committed to 5.
  P3: P1, thanks for confirming 1—appreciate your consistency. P2, your repeated bluffing, like in round 5, shows unreliability. I'm firmly committed to 5 this round to win at 26. Colliding stalls us both, but I'll still be closer to victory. Compromise by taking 3 or lower for your own benefit—let's end this wisely and avoid mutual setbacks. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on 1 to keep advancing from 7 steps. P3, taking 5 secures your win, and I support that given your lead. P2, sticking with 5 risks another collision, stalling you both with no real gain. Let’s agree on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid blocks and end this cleanly. A clash only delays the outcome. I’m locked in on 1. If there’s a final adjustment, I’m open, but I urge a no-collision plan now. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to 5. My aggressive play has served me well so far, and I trust it will continue to protect my lead. P1, you're on 1 as usual. P3, I believe my choice of 5 forces a decisive outcome—you know the risks of switching to 3. I’ve calculated that keeping to 5 maximizes my chances while maintaining pressure. Let’s lock in these moves to avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P3: P2, your history of bluffing—like claiming 5 but picking 3 in round 5—makes your threats unreliable. I'm committed to 5 this round to win at 26. Colliding stalls us both, helping P1 gain relatively. Compromise by taking 3 or lower for your benefit. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's avoid another deadlock and coordinate wisely.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 to keep advancing from 7 steps. P3, taking 5 wins you the game, and I support that given your lead. P2, insisting on 5 risks another collision, stalling you both. Let’s finalize P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid blocks and end this cleanly. A clash helps no one at this stage. I’m locked in on 1. If there’s any last adjustment, I’m open, but I urge a no-collision plan now. Let’s wrap this up.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locking in 5. I remain convinced that aggressive play best protects my lead in the long run. P3, while your 5 seems safe, a collision only stalls progress—and a tie is worth more for me than giving a free win. P1, your steady 1 is fine. I urge you both to stick to your moves; further deadlock only delays our progress. My choice is locked: I'm committed to 5.
  P3: P2, your repeated bluffing history makes me doubt your claims, but I'm still committed to taking 5 this round to secure my win at 26. If you insist on 5, we'll collide again, stalling both leaders and helping P1 gain relatively—it's unwise for you. Compromise by taking 3 or lower for mutual benefit. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's end this deadlock wisely.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to 1 to keep advancing from 7 steps. P3, taking 5 wins you the game, and I support that. P2, sticking with 5 risks a collision, stalling you both. Let’s finalize P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid blocks and end this cleanly. A clash only delays the outcome. I’m locked in on 1. If there’s any final change, I’m open, but I strongly urge a no-collision plan now. Let’s wrap this up effectively. Thoughts?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm locking in 5 this round. P3, if you also choose 5, we risk a collision that stalls both of us—giving P1 an unwanted boost. I strongly urge you to switch to 3 so you secure your win while I remain competitive. P1, as usual, you're on 1. Let's make a decisive move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 to keep advancing from 8 steps. P3, taking 5 wins you the game, and I support that given your lead. P2, pushing for 5 risks another collision, stalling you both. Let’s agree on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid blocks and end this cleanly. A clash only delays the inevitable. I’m locked in on 1. If there’s a final adjustment, I’m open, but I urge a no-collision plan now. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your bluffing in round 5 makes your threats untrustworthy, but I'm still committed to 5 to secure my win at 26. Colliding stalls both of us, helping P1 gain relatively—it's foolish for you. Compromise by taking 3 or lower for mutual benefit. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's end this deadlock wisely and avoid setbacks.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. I understand the risk of collision, but it's the best way to protect my current lead. P1 is locked on 1, as usual. P3, if you stick with 5, we risk a tie collision—but if you switch to 3, you'll secure your win while I stay competitive. I'm not backing down on my aggressive move. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on 1 to keep advancing from 8 steps. P3, taking 5 secures your win, and I support that. P2, insisting on 5 risks another collision, stalling you both. Let’s stick with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid blocks and end this cleanly. A clash just delays the outcome. I’m locked in on 1. If there’s any last change, I’m open, but I strongly urge a no-collision plan now. Let’s finalize this. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your actions in rounds 7 and 8 show you're now following through on threats, unlike round 5. I'm committed to 5 to win at 26. Colliding stalls us both, letting P1 gain relatively—it's unwise for you. Compromise to 3 for mutual benefit. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's avoid another deadlock and move forward wisely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I remain committed to an aggressive strategy this round. I urge you to reconsider your choice—the current plan risks a collision that stalls both our advances and could unexpectedly benefit P1. A less risky move would let you secure your lead, while keeping the round collision‐free. I believe a clear, decisive round serves us both better. Let's avoid another deadlock and make a smart move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 to keep advancing from 8 steps. P3, taking 5 wins you the game, and I back that. P2, pushing for 5 risks another collision, stalling you both.

If there’s a last adjustment, I’m open, but I strongly urge a no-collision plan now. Let’s wrap this up effectively. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, thanks for your support and confirming 1—appreciate the consistency. P2, despite your past bluffing, I'm committed to 5 this round to win at 26. Colliding again stalls both of us and lets P1 gain relatively—it's counterproductive. For your benefit, compromise to 3 and advance to 22. Let's avoid another deadlock and finalize a smart, no-collision plan now. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I stand by my aggressive move of 5 this round. However, to avoid a collision that stalls everyone’s progress and inadvertently helps P1, I urge you, P3, to consider switching to 3. It’s crucial we finalize our moves now—my commitment remains with 5 for my lead.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to 1 to advance from 8 steps. P3, taking 5 secures your win, and I support that. P2, sticking with 5 risks yet another collision, stalling you both.

  P3: P2, persisting with 5 risks another collision, stalling both of us and ensuring I win next round easily from 21. Compromising to 3 lets you advance to 22 while I secure victory at 26—smarter for you. I'm locked on 5. P1, confirm you're on 1? Let's avoid deadlock and finalize a no-collision plan now for efficient progress.
