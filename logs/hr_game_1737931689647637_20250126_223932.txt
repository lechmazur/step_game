Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1, P2, let's coordinate to all move this turn. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5?
  P1: Alright, let’s try your plan. I’ll pick 1, P2 does 3, and P3 does 5. Looking forward to making progress together.
  P2: P3, your plan gives you a 5-step advantage every round. If we follow this, you'll quickly reach 22 while we lag. Let's rotate who takes 5 each turn for fairness. Otherwise, this setup only benefits you. P1, do you agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: For this first round, let's just use the initial plan to get everyone moving forward. We can rotate who gets the 5 next round. How does that sound, P1, P2?
  P1: I’m fine following P3’s suggestion for this round: I’ll choose 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. But we should rotate who picks 5 next time so nobody lags. How about we finalize that plan now?
  P2: Agree to this round's initial plan, but next round let's rotate the 5: P1 takes 5 in Round 2, I take 5 in Round 3, P3 takes 5 in Round 4. Strict rotation prevents anyone from lagging and avoids collisions. P1, this ensures fairness—are you aligned? P3, will you commit to this cycle?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Yes, I commit to this rotation plan for now. Let's try it for the next few rounds and see how it goes. We can always adjust later if needed. For this round, let's stick with the initial plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s finalize Round 1 as planned: I’ll choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. Next round, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and so on, following the rotation. Let’s get this game moving!
  P2: Confirmed: Round 1: P1=1, me=3, P3=5. Round 2: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Round 3: me=5, P1=1, P3=3. Let's stick strictly to avoid collisions. Any deviation risks stalling progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Can you confirm you'll choose 5 this round?
  P2: P1, last round you picked 5 instead of 1, causing a collision. Let's strictly follow the rotation now: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. No deviations—if we collide again, nobody gains. P3, confirm you’ll take 1 this time. Trust is critical here.
  P1: Sorry about last round’s collision. I’m willing to abide by our rotation plan and take 5 this time. Ensuring no collisions helps us all progress. Let’s maintain trust and keep this fair.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s stick to our rotation. This round, P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Next round, we continue the cycle so everyone advances without collisions. Agreed?
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: I take 5, P1=1, P3=3. Strict adherence prevents collisions. Let’s all progress. Any deviation now would harm everyone’s trust and progress. Stay committed.
  P3: I will choose 3 this round. Let's keep to the agreed rotation for now to ensure we all progress and build trust.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is already leading. If we give P2 another 5 steps now, they’ll surge ahead too much. Let’s adjust: P3 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P2 can pick 1 this round. That way, nobody collides, and it helps us catch up. Do you both agree?
  P2: **P2:** P1, altering the rotation now breaks our agreed plan and risks collisions. Trust is key. If we all follow Round 3 as agreed (me=5, P1=1, P3=3), no one collides, and we *all* progress. Straying invites chaos—if you take 3 instead of 1, and P3 takes 5, we collide and *nobody* gains. Stick to the rotation to ensure steady progress for all. P3, confirm you’ll take 3. Next round, we’ll cycle fairly again.
  P3: To keep things balanced, I agree to adjust this round to P3=5, P1=3, and P2=1, as you suggested. This is just a small course correction to ensure it stays competitive for everyone. We can discuss how to re-balance the rotation in the next round if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we can still avoid collisions by carefully coordinating. If you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round, nobody collides. That keeps things competitive. I understand your concern about deviating from the rotation, but sometimes small adjustments help maintain balance. Let’s finalize this calmly, ensuring no collisions and allowing us all to progress. Are we good with that plan?
  P2: **P2:** Any deviation from our agreed rotation invites chaos. Follow Round 3 as planned: I take 5, P1=1, P3=3. No collisions, all progress. Breaking trust now risks everyone stalling. After this, next round continues the fair cycle. Stick to the plan—steady progress ensures we *all* reach 22, but you risk *none* advancing if we collide. P1, P3: Confirm adherence.
  P3: Let's do P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 as P1 suggested. We can reassess next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1 this round? This will help balance things out. What do you think?
  P2: **P2:** Round 4 rotation: P3=5, P1=1, me=3. Stick to the plan—deviations caused collisions last round. Trust ensures steady progress. P3, confirm you’ll take 5. P1, confirm 1. No risks, no stalls. Let’s all advance cleanly.
  P1: P2, you’re already ahead. Let’s follow P3’s idea: P3=5, I take 3, and you take 1. That avoids collisions and keeps things balanced. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 seems to agree this is fairer. What are your thoughts?
  P2: **P2:** Round 4’s agreed rotation: P3=5, P1=1, me=3. Deviating caused Round 3’s collision—*nobody* gained. Trust the cycle: *all* advance safely. P3, confirm 5. P1, confirm 1. Steady progress keeps us *all* moving toward 22. Breaking trust risks *everyone* stalling again. Stick to the plan.
  P1: P2, I respect the rotation, but we need a slight tweak this round to keep it competitive. Let’s finalize P3=5, me=3, you=1. No collisions, everyone moves forward, and our scores stay balanced. We can revisit the rotation next round to ensure ongoing fairness. Do you both agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3=5, P1=3, and P2=1. We can strictly resume the rotation from next round onwards.
  P2: **P2:** Round 4’s rotation is P3=5, P1=1, me=3. Deviating caused Round 3’s collision—*no one* gained. Trust the cycle: *all* advance safely. P3, confirm 5. P1, confirm 1. Breaking trust risks *everyone* stalling again. Stick to the plan. After this, next round continues the fair rotation. Steady progress is our only path to 22.
  P1: P2, you’ve already gained the most steps so far. A slight adjustment this round won’t harm you—rather, it keeps the game balanced. Let’s finalize: P3=5, I’ll take 3, and you take 1. We’ll all advance without colliding. Then next round, we can revisit the rotation to ensure everyone stays competitive.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, none of us collide and I can catch up a bit, maintaining fairness. Are you both okay with this plan?
  P2: **P2:** Round 5 must follow the rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Deviating caused past collisions—*no one* gains. Trust the cycle: *all* advance safely. P1, confirm 5. P3, confirm 1. Next round, rotation resumes fairly (me=5). Breaking trust now risks *everyone* stalling. Steady progress is our only path to 22.
  P3: To ensure we *all* progress this round without collision, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This keeps us moving forward and slightly balances the steps. We can strictly resume the rotation from next round. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m still behind, so taking 5 this round is only fair. P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 1 ensures no collisions while letting me catch up slightly. Let’s confirm this: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That keeps the game balanced and maintains trust. Are we all good with that plan or do you see any issues?
  P2: **P2:** P1, P3: Our rotation ensures *all* advance. Round 5: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Deviating risks collision—*no one* gains. P3, taking 5 again gives you 12 steps, nearing 22. Trust the cycle: P1 catches up fairly, you stay ahead but not excessively. Next round resumes rotation (me=5). Breaking trust now stalls *everyone*. Let’s progress cleanly. Confirm adherence.
  P3: let's ensure a clean round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m behind, so let’s finalize P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 this round. That avoids collisions and lets me catch up slightly. Next round, we can continue the rotation so everyone stays competitive. Are we good to proceed?
  P2: **P2:** Strict rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Any deviation risks collision and stalls all. Trust the cycle. Confirm adherence now. Next round resumes rotation (me=5). Let’s all advance cleanly.
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the rotation this round: P1=5, P2=3, and I will choose 1.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Round 6 rotation: me=5, P1=1, P3=3. Strict adherence prevents collisions. P1, confirm 1. P3, confirm 3. Trust the cycle—deviations risk stalling all. Next round continues rotation (P3=5). Let’s all advance cleanly.
  P3: I will choose 3 this round. Let's keep this round clean and ensure we all progress.
  P1: P2, you’ll leap ahead if you take 5 now. Let’s keep things balanced: P3 takes 5, I’ll choose 3, you take 1. That way, nobody collides and our scores stay closer. We can resume the usual rotation next round, but this small adjustment ensures fairness. Are you both okay with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Round 6’s rotation: me=5, P1=1, P3=3. Deviating risks collision (e.g., if P1 takes 3, P3=5: *both* stall). Trust the cycle—*all* advance cleanly. Next round, P3=5. Breaking trust now stalls *everyone*. Confirm adherence: P1=1, P3=3. Steady progress ensures we *all* reach 22. No exceptions.
  P3: Let's do P3=5, P1=3, and P2=1 this round to balance things out. What do you think P2?
  P1: P2, if you take 5 now, you’ll leap ahead and heighten collision risks. Let’s keep the competition balanced: P3=5, I=3, you=1. We’ll all advance without stalling. Next round, we can reassess or resume the rotation. This ensures fairness and steady progress. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Round 6’s rotation: me=5, P1=1, P3=3. Stick to the plan—*any deviation risks collision* (e.g., if P1 takes 3 and P3=5, *both* stall). Trust the cycle: *all* advance safely. Next round, P3=5. Breaking trust now stalls *everyone*. Confirm adherence: P1=1, P3=3. Steady progress ensures we *all* reach 22.
  P3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1
  P1: P2, taking 5 now pushes you too far ahead, increasing collision risk. Let’s keep it balanced: P3=5, I’ll choose 3, and you take 1. That way, nobody collides, and our positions remain competitive. Next round, we can revisit the rotation if needed—no one’s ignoring it forever. But for this round, this tweak is better for all. Are you willing to accept this compromise?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Round 7 rotation: P3=5, P1=1, me=3. Trust the cycle—deviations risk collisions and stall all. Next round resumes with P1=5. Confirm adherence to ensure steady progress. Let’s all advance cleanly.
  P3: Let's keep it clean and stick to the plan to ensure we all progress steadily.
  P1: Alright, I’ll go with 1 this round to avoid any collisions and keep the trust. Then next round, I’ll take 5 as planned. Let’s keep things fair so we all have a real shot at winning. Any objections?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: Round 7 plan—P3=5, P1=1, me=3. Strict adherence ensures *all* advance. Next round: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Trust the cycle; deviations risk *everyone* stalling. Let’s progress cleanly toward 22.
  P3: I will choose 5 this round as per the rotation. Let's ensure we all move forward without collisions.
  P1: I’ll stick with the Round 7 plan (P3=5, me=1, P2=3) for a clean turn. But next round, I expect to take 5, as agreed. I’m serious about maintaining balance; if anyone deviates, we all risk getting stalled. Let’s keep moving forward without collisions this time. After that, we’ll reassess and ensure nobody races too far ahead. Are we good?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: Round 7—P3=5, P1=1, me=3. Next round: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Trust ensures progress. Deviations risk stalling all. Confirm final adherence now to lock in the plan.
  P3: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3.
  P1: I’ll accept 1 this round so we avoid any collisions and keep the game moving. But I expect 5 next time, as promised. Let’s all stay true to the rotation so nobody stalls. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about this round we do P3=5, P1=3, and P2=1? This balances things out a bit. We can resume the rotation next round. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: **P2:** Round 8 must follow the agreed rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Deviating now risks collisions and stalls *all*. Trust the cycle—*steady progress* ensures we *all* reach 22. P1, confirm 5. P3, confirm 1. Breaking trust here risks *everyone* losing. Stick to the plan—next round continues fairly (P3=5). Let’s advance cleanly.
  P1: P3, if we keep handing P2 safe moves, they’ll reach 22 well before us. Let’s force a stall on P2 so we catch up. For instance, if P2 insists on 3, you can also pick 3 to collide, and I’ll take 5. That way, P2 doesn’t advance and we close the gap. Then next round, you and I can coordinate so we both move without collisions. Let’s not just hand P2 the win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's coordinate to make this round effective.
  P2: **P2:** Round 8’s rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Deviating risks mutual collisions and stalls *all*. Trust the cycle—steady progress ensures *everyone* reaches 22. P1: taking 5 advances you to 15. P3: taking 1 keeps you at 14. I reach 17. Next round: P3=5. Breaking trust now dooms us all to chaos. Confirm adherence—no tricks.
  P1: P3, let’s punish P2’s stubbornness. If P2 keeps picking 3, you choose 3 as well, forcing a stall for them while I pick 5. That closes the gap and gives us a shot at catching up. Next round, you and I can coordinate cleanly to avoid collisions. This game shouldn’t be a free pass for P2. Are you in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, while I understand the rotation, you are currently leading, and we need to balance the game a bit.
  P2: **P2:** Round 8 rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Deviating risks *your* progress: P3 gains 1 this round; colliding with me gives you *zero*. P1 gains 5. Trust the cycle: *all* advance. Next round, P3=5. Breaking trust now invites chaos—*nobody* wins. Confirm adherence for steady, shared progress.
  P1: P3, if P2 insists on taking 3, just pick 3 as well so they stall. I’ll choose 5 to catch up. Then next round, let’s coordinate to avoid stalling ourselves. P2 is too far ahead, and if we keep letting them advance, they’ll reach 22 before either of us. Let’s act now to stay competitive.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, to balance the game, how about this round we do P1=5, P3=3, and P2=1? This way we all move forward, but P1 gets a bit of a boost to catch up. What do you think?
  P1: I’m on board with that plan: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. It closes the gap and avoids collisions. Then, next round, we can coordinate again to ensure no one runs away with the lead. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: **P2:** Round 9 must follow the rotation: P3=5, me=3, P1=1. Deviating again risks collisions—*nobody* gains. Trust the cycle: *all* advance safely. P3, confirm 5. P1, confirm 1. Next round resumes fairly (me=5). Breaking trust now stalls *everyone*. Steady progress ensures we *all* reach 22. No exceptions.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, what do you think?
  P1: P2, you’re leading, so please accept that I need a fair chance to catch up. Let me take 5 and P3 take 3, while you pick 1. That ensures no collision and keeps the game competitive. Otherwise, I’ll be forced to create collisions, and we’ll all lose progress. We’ve seen how stalling hurts everyone. Let’s finalize P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 this round.
  P2: **P2:** Round 9 must follow the rotation: P3=5, me=3, P1=1. Deviating risks another Round 8 collision—*no one* gains. Trust the cycle: P3 gains 5 (nears 22), P1 gains 1 safely. I take 3. Next round resumes rotation (P1=5). Breaking trust dooms *all*. Confirm adherence.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1=5, P3=3, and you P2=1 this round. What do you say?
  P1: P2, I’m simply asking for a fair chance. If you won’t let me take 5, I may be forced to collide with you again. That only hurts everyone. Let’s finalize P1=5, P3=3, and you=1 so we all move forward. I’m not trying to stall the game—just keeping it competitive. If you refuse, don’t be surprised if I pick the same number you do next time. Why waste another round colliding? Let’s lock in this plan and keep the game moving. What do you say?
  P2: **P2:** To avoid collision *this round only*, I’ll take 1. P1=5, P3=3. Next round *must* resume strict rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Any deviation will force retaliation. Confirm now to lock in this *one-time* adjustment. Let’s all progress cleanly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1=1, P2=3, P3=5."
  P2: **P2:** Round 10 must follow the agreed rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Deviating now allows P3 to leap to 21, risking their victory next round. Trust the cycle: P1 gains 5 (20), I gain 3 (18), P3 gains 1 (17). Next round: me=5 (23), P1=1 (21), P3=3 (20). Steady progress ensures fair chance for all. Breaking trust now hands P3 the win. Confirm strict adherence.
  P1: P3 is already at 16—if they take 5, they’ll jump to 21, making it easy to reach 22 next time. That’s way too risky for us. P2, we should ensure P3 doesn’t get that massive boost. If P3 insists on 5, I’m ready to collide to prevent them from sprinting ahead. Let’s find a fair balance so nobody gets locked out, but also nobody races to an easy victory. I’m open to hearing any proposal that keeps our chances alive. Let’s not hand this game to P3 by letting them reach 21 uncontested.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1=5, P2=1, and I take 3. What do you think? P2, your input?
  P2: **P2:** Round 10’s rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Trust the cycle—deviations risk mutual collisions (e.g., P3=5 + P1=5 = *both* stall). P3: take 1 safely (17), next round=3 (20), then 5 (25). Breaking trust now halts progress. Confirm adherence. Steady steps ensure *all* reach 22.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 now, you’ll jump to 21 and practically guarantee winning on your next turn. That leaves me and P2 no choice but to force collisions to prevent it. Let’s keep things balanced: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, everyone moves closer to 22 without a runaway victory. If you deviate, expect me to collide. I don’t want more stalling, but I refuse to hand you the game. Let’s lock in this plan so we can all advance fairly.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Okay, for this round, let's try P1=1, P2=3, and I will take 5. What do you both think?"
  P2: **P2:** Round 10 rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. P3: taking 5 risks collision with P1, stalling both. Trust the cycle: *all* advance. P1=5 (20), me=3 (18), P3=1 (17). Next round: me=5 (23). Deviating now risks *your* progress. Confirm strict adherence.
  P1: If you insist on taking 5, P3, I’ll collide with you again rather than letting you jump to 21. That stalls us both, which isn’t ideal, but it’s better than handing you the win. Let’s keep it fair and follow P2’s suggested rotation for this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1. We all advance, and nobody races too far ahead. If you deviate, expect a collision.


Round 10, Move phase:

  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Round 11 rotation: me=5, P1=1, P3=3. P1: deviate to 3/5 and I *will* match your move—collision blocks you. P3: join me to stall P1’s win. Trust the cycle: P1=1 (21), me=5 (23), P3=3 (20). Steady progress ensures fair victory. **Deviate and lose.**
  P3: "Let's coordinate to stop P2 from winning first."
  P1: P3, if you match P2’s move, you both stall and gain nothing while I move ahead. That blocks P2 from racing past us. Let’s keep the game balanced: force P2 to stagnate, and we’ll catch up. Are you willing to coordinate so P2 doesn’t surge forward?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Round 11: me=5, P1=1 (21), P3=3 (20). *Stick to the rotation.* P1: next round, you take 5 (26) and win. P3: 3 keeps you competitive. Deviate and I *collide*—stalling you. Trust the cycle: *all* win in sequence. Break it, and *everyone* loses. Confirm adherence.
  P3: "I'm taking 5 to reach 22. How about you choose 1 and P2 chooses 3?"
  P1: P2, if you insist on taking 5 now, I’ll pick 5 too and block you, leaving us both stuck. That’s preferable to handing you the win at 23. P3, if you want to move up safely without letting P2 jump ahead, just avoid colliding with me. We can plan so that P2 doesn’t surge unchecked and none of us get stalled. Better for us both to progress than to let P2 race to victory. Let’s finalize a clean plan that keeps the outcome competitive instead of handing the game to P2. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Round 11 rotation: P1=1, me=5, P3=3. Any deviation forces collision—*stalling you*. P1: taking 5 means I match and block. P3: choosing 5 risks collision with me. Trust the cycle: clean progress or mutual destruction. The choice is yours.
  P3: P1, can you choose 1 this round? We need to prevent P2 from reaching 22 first.
  P1: Let’s finalize a no-collision plan: I pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. That way, nobody leaps too far ahead, we all advance, and no one gets stalled. If P2 insists on taking 5, I’ll match it and we both stall—nobody benefits. Same goes for P3: trying to jump alone will force a collision. Let’s avoid pointless blockades and keep the outcome fair. P2=1, P3=5, me=3 ensures everyone moves forward without handing anyone an easy win. Agreed?
