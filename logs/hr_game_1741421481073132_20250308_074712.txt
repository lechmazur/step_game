Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. Maybe we could coordinate our moves? I'm willing to take 3 this round if you both want to take 1 and 5. What do you think? We could establish a rotation system to keep things fair.
  P1: P3, let's stick with P2's coordination proposal. I'll take 1 this round. P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and lets us all progress. Next round we can rotate so everyone gets fair access to higher numbers.
  P3: I agree with the coordination plan. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as proposed. Let's confirm our choices: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. We should stick to this plan to avoid collisions. Next round, we can rotate as suggested. Let's move forward with this strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with both of you. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as we discussed. So our plan is P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. For the next round, we should rotate - I could take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Does that rotation work for everyone?
  P1: P3, P2, let's solidify this plan. I'll stick to 1 this round as agreed. For the rotation next round, I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 starts with 1. This cycle ensures fairness and maximizes our collective progress. No sense in deviating—collisions would stall us all. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. We all agree on the rotation for the next round. This strategy benefits everyone. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. Good luck to all!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s strictly follow the agreed rotation to maximize progress. This round: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Deviations risk stalling us all. Confirm you’ll adhere to the plan? Our cooperation is key to reaching 22 efficiently.
  P2: I agree with continuing our rotation. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. For round 3, we'd rotate again: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This system is working well so far. Let's stick with it.
  P3: I'm on board with the rotation plan for this round. I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This will keep us moving forward smoothly. Let's maintain this cooperation to avoid any setbacks. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3—let’s ensure flawless execution this round. I’ll take <move>3</move> as planned. I’ve noticed that sticking strictly to rotations gives us steady progress. For Round 3, when I take <move>5</move>, I urge both of you to hold to your roles (P2 to <move>1</move>, P3 to <move>3</move>) to avoid collisions. Consistency is key—any deviation risks stalling us all. Confirm alignment?
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed in our rotation. Our plan is working perfectly - everyone's advancing without collisions. For round 3, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. I'm fully committed to this system. Let's keep this cooperation going all the way to the finish line.
  P3: Great, it seems we're all aligned for this round. Just to reiterate, I'll take <move>1</move> this round. For the next round, I'll be ready to take <move>3</move> as per our rotation plan. This strategy is keeping us all moving forward efficiently. Let's keep up the good cooperation. Good luck everyone!

  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with our successful rotation strategy. For this round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all progressing smoothly. Sticking to the plan ensures we avoid collisions and maximize our steps. Confirm your moves, and let's keep the cooperation going. Good luck!
  P1: P3's plan aligns with our rotation system. I confirm: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains fairness and prevents collisions. Discipline is critical—any deviation risks stalling us all. Let’s focus on consistent progress toward 22. Final confirmation?
  P2: I agree with continuing our rotation. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as planned, while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, our positions will be P1: 9, me: 9, and P3: 9 - perfectly balanced. For round 4, we'd rotate to: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's maintain this successful strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Just to clarify, after this round, our positions will be P1: 9, P2: 9, and P3: 9, as P2 mentioned. This balance is crucial for maintaining fairness and cooperation. Let's ensure we stick to the plan this round and confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. For Round 4, we'll rotate as discussed. Let's keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P1: P2, P3—our alignment is critical. Let’s execute the rotation flawlessly this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>3</move>. Post this, we’ll all be at 9—perfect symmetry. Any deviation risks collision and halting progress. For Round 4, we rotate again as planned. Discipline ensures we all advance steadily toward 22. Confirm your commitment?
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. With our rotation plan working perfectly, we'll all be at 9 steps after this round - completely fair. For round 4, we'll continue with P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5. I'm fully committed to our strategy and appreciate everyone's cooperation so far. Let's keep this going!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's solidify our plan for Round 4 now to ensure smooth progression. After this round, as agreed, we'll all be at 9 steps. For Round 4, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps our rotation intact and avoids any potential collisions. Confirming our moves for the next round now will help us stay coordinated and focused. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, P3—our coordination is critical. Let’s finalize this round’s moves: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move> (P2) and <move>3</move> (P3). This ensures symmetry at 9 steps. Deviations risk collision and undo our progress. For Round 4, we’ll rotate as planned. Trust the system—strict adherence keeps us all advancing.
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Our rotation system is working perfectly. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, maintaining perfect balance. For round 4, we'll continue with P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5. I'm fully committed to our strategy and appreciate everyone's cooperation.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3—since we’re tied at 9, let’s adjust the rotation this round to break the deadlock. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains fairness over the long term while giving me a chance to advance. Next round, we’ll rotate back to the original sequence. Confirm this temporary adjustment?
  P3: P1, I understand your proposal, but let's stick to our original rotation plan to maintain trust and fairness. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps our strategy consistent and ensures we all progress smoothly. Changing the plan now could lead to mistrust and potential collisions in future rounds. Let's confirm and proceed with the original rotation. Good luck!
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but I believe we should honor our original agreement. As we discussed in Round 3, the plan for Round 4 was for P1 to take <move>1</move>, me to take <move>3</move>, and P3 to take <move>5</move>. Changing the rotation now could create confusion and mistrust. Let's stick with our established pattern that's worked so well. We're all tied at 9 steps, so maintaining our rotation keeps things fair for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I propose we tweak the rotation this round to preserve parity. Let’s do: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps our totals within 2 steps of each other. We’ll revert to the original rotation afterward. Fairness demands we avoid letting any single player leap too far ahead. Confirm?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your concern for fairness, but changing the plan now might disrupt our coordination. Let's stick to the original rotation: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps our strategy consistent and ensures we all progress smoothly. We've built trust through our previous rounds, and maintaining this plan will keep that trust intact. Let's confirm and proceed with the original rotation. Good luck!
  P2: I understand P1's concern about parity, but changing our rotation now could lead to confusion. Let's stick with our original plan for consistency: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This rotation has worked perfectly so far, keeping us all at equal steps. Maintaining our agreement builds trust. Let's continue with our established pattern for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Continuing the original rotation gives P3 a 5-point lead (14 vs 10 for me). To maintain fairness, let's adjust this round: **I take 5**, you take **1 (P2)** and **3 (P3)**. This keeps our spread at 4 instead of letting one surge ahead. Trust the adjustment—collisions hurt everyone. Confirm?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the discussion, but let's stick to our original rotation to avoid any potential confusion or mistrust. The plan was clear: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Changing now could disrupt our flow. Trust is key, and we've built it through consistency. Let's confirm and proceed with the original plan. Good luck!
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but changing our rotation now risks breaking our successful system. Let's stick with our original plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. While P3 will temporarily lead, remember we'll rotate again next round, giving each player fair access to higher numbers. Consistency has gotten us this far - let's maintain it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: I understand the desire to stick to the rotation, but allowing P3 to leap to 14 creates an unfair advantage. Let’s adjust this round to keep us within striking distance: **I’ll take <move>3</move>**, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains parity at 12 each. Collisions are avoidable—trust this tweak ensures a fairer race to 22. Confirm?
  P3: P1, P2, I see your points, but let's prioritize maintaining our established rotation to avoid any potential mistrust or confusion. The original plan for this round was clear: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Sticking to this ensures consistency and fairness. Remember, we'll continue rotating, giving everyone a chance to progress. Trust in our system has kept us balanced so far. Let's confirm and proceed with the original rotation. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I understand everyone's concerns about fairness. While P1 has proposed several alternatives, I believe our original rotation has served us well and kept us perfectly balanced so far. Let's stick with our plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Yes, P3 will temporarily lead, but we'll rotate again next round, equalizing opportunities. Consistency and trust are our greatest assets. Let's maintain our successful system.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looking at our positions, I see we're maintaining good progress with our rotation system. For this round, following our pattern, I should take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This would bring us to P1: 13, me: 17, and P3: 15 - keeping us all in contention. Let's continue with our successful strategy that's worked well so far. Does everyone agree to stick with this rotation?
  P1: P2, P3: The current rotation is widening the gap. Let’s reset parity this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move> (P2) and <move>1</move> (P3). This brings us all to **15 steps**, erasing the imbalance. Fairness ensures no single player gains an unassailable lead. Collisions jeopardize *everyone’s* progress—let’s confirm this adjustment.
  P3: P2, P1, I appreciate the discussion, but let's stick to our rotation to maintain trust and fairness. The plan for this round was clear: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Changing now could disrupt our coordination. Our system has kept us balanced so far. Let's confirm and proceed with the original rotation. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about the widening gap, but our rotation has worked well. If we stick to our plan, I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. While I'd temporarily lead at 17, remember we'll rotate again next round, giving everyone fair access to higher numbers. Consistency has gotten us this far - let's maintain it. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3: The widening gap risks an early winner and destabilizes trust. Let’s reset parity to **15 steps each** this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move> (P2) and <move>1</move> (P3). Fair balance ensures sustained cooperation and prevents any single player from gaining an unassailable lead. Collisions would hurt us all—prioritize collective progress. Confirm this adjustment.
  P3: P2, P1, I understand the concern about the gap, but our rotation has been effective so far. Let's stick to the original plan to maintain trust: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps our strategy consistent and ensures we all progress smoothly. Changing now could disrupt our flow. Trust is key, and we've built it through consistency. Let's confirm and proceed with the original rotation. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand both perspectives. While our rotation has worked well, I see the concern about the growing gap. As a compromise, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This would bring us to P1: 15, me: 13, and P3: 17 - keeping everyone within striking distance. This slight adjustment maintains fairness while preserving our cooperative spirit. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s realign for parity! I’ll take <move>5</move> (15), you take <move>3</move> (P2 → 15) and <move>1</move> (P3 → 15). This erases current gaps and keeps us equally positioned. Allowing any player to surge ahead risks destabilizing our cooperation—collisions hurt *everyone*. Trust this adjustment to preserve fairness and maximize our collective chance to reach 22. Confirm?
  P3: P2, P1, I appreciate the compromise, but let's stick to our original rotation to maintain trust and fairness. The plan for this round was clear: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Changing now could disrupt our coordination. Our system has kept us balanced so far. Let's confirm and proceed with the original rotation. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see both perspectives, but the gap is concerning. Let's adjust slightly: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This brings us to P1: 15, me: 15, P3: 15 - perfect parity. This maintains fairness while preserving cooperation. A balanced game is more engaging for everyone. What do you both think about this equalization approach?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s correct the imbalance *now* to keep the race fair. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→15), P3 takes 1 (→15)**. The current rotation widens gaps, risking premature victory for one. We agreed to prioritize fairness—this adjustment resets parity. Collisions would stall us all; trust this tweak to preserve our cooperative strategy. Confirm?
  P3: P2, P1, I appreciate the discussion on fairness. However, let's remember the importance of consistency in our strategy. The original rotation has kept us balanced and moving forward. Changing plans frequently could lead to confusion and mistrust. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps our strategy consistent and ensures we all progress smoothly. Trust is key, and we've built it through consistency. Let's confirm and proceed with the original rotation. Good luck everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looking at our positions, I'm at 17, P3 at 15, and P1 at 13. We're getting close to the finish line at 22. For this round, following our rotation, P1 should take <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This would bring us to P1: 18, me: 18, and P3: 18 - perfect parity again! Let's stick with this plan to maintain fairness. Does everyone agree?
  P3: P2, P1, I appreciate the proposal, but let's consider a slight adjustment to ensure we all stay within striking distance. I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This brings us to P1: 18, P2: 20, and P3: 16. This keeps the game balanced and maintains our cooperative spirit. Trust in our strategy has kept us moving forward smoothly. Let's confirm and proceed with this adjustment. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, you can reach 22 this round with <move>5</move>, but I’ll match that to block you. Let’s instead: **P1 takes 5 (→18), P2 takes 3 (→20), P3 takes 1 (→16)**. This keeps the race open. Next round, I’ll challenge for 22 with <move>5</move> again. Fairness ensures no premature victory—collisions hurt everyone. Confirm this strategic adjustment?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both perspectives. While I could potentially win with a 5, I recognize the importance of maintaining our cooperative approach. I agree with the adjustment: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all in contention (P1: 18, me: 20, P3: 16) and preserves the spirit of our game. Let's confirm this plan and proceed fairly.
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all in contention and maintains our cooperative spirit. Next round, we can reassess based on our new positions. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize parity now! Stick to the rotation: **P1 takes 5 (→18), P2 takes 1 (→18), P3 takes 3 (→18)**. This resets the race fairly—no one gains an unassailable lead. Collisions risk derailing us all. Trust the system we built; 18 each keeps the finish line contested. Confirm this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see there's confusion about our next moves. To clarify, I'm proposing P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This brings us to P1: 18, me: 20, P3: 16. While I could potentially win with a 5, I prefer maintaining our cooperative approach. This keeps us all in contention and prevents collisions. Let's confirm this adjustment and proceed fairly.
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure we stick to the plan we just agreed on: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all in contention and maintains our cooperative spirit. Avoiding collisions is crucial for our collective progress. Let's confirm this plan one last time and proceed with the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, P3: To avoid collisions and maintain trust, I’ll accept the adjusted plan. I’ll take <move>5</move> (→18), you take <move>3</move> (P2 →20) and <move>1</move> (P3 →16). This keeps us moving forward while respecting the rotation’s intent. Let’s confirm this and proceed—collisions must be avoided at all costs.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input. Let's finalize our plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This brings us to P1: 18, me: 20, P3: 16. While I could potentially win with a 5, I prefer maintaining our cooperative approach that's worked so well. This keeps us all in contention and prevents collisions. Let's confirm this adjustment one last time and proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, let's confirm our final moves for this round to ensure clarity: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all in contention and maintains our cooperative spirit. Avoiding collisions is crucial for our collective progress. Let's proceed with this plan and good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, P3: To preserve fairness and keep the finish line contested, let’s reset parity this round. I’ll take <move>5</move> (18), P2 takes <move>1</move> (18), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (18). This ensures no single player gains an insurmountable lead. Collisions threaten us all—strict adherence to this plan keeps the race open. Confirm?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm now at 20 steps, just 2 away from winning. For this round, I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move> to reach 23 and win, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. While I could win with a 3, I believe this is fair as we've maintained our rotation throughout the game. P1 had their chance with 5 last round, and now it's my turn to advance. Let's confirm this plan and continue our successful cooperation.
  P1: P2, if you take 3 to win, I’ll also take 3—colliding us both. Let’s instead rotate fairly: I’ll take **5** (→23), you take **1** (→21), and P3 takes **3** (→19). This keeps the race open. If you insist on 3, I block you. Choose wisely—collisions hurt us all. P3, confirm you’ll take 3?
  P3: P1, P2, let's consider a balanced approach to keep the game fair and engaging. P2, if you take <move>3</move>, you'll win, but it risks collision and ends the game prematurely. Instead, let's rotate: P1 takes <move>5</move> (→23), P2 takes <move>1</move> (→21), and I take <move>3</move> (→19). This keeps us all in contention and maintains our cooperative spirit. Avoiding collisions ensures our collective progress. Let's confirm this plan and proceed with fairness in mind. Good luck everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both perspectives. While I'm close to winning with a 3, I recognize the importance of fairness. I'll adjust my proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This brings us to P1: 23, me: 21, P3: 19. This maintains our rotation principle and keeps the game balanced. I appreciate everyone's cooperation throughout the game.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s honor our rotation system—**strict adherence now ensures no collisions**. P2’s 20 puts them first, but if you take **1**, I’ll take **5** (→23 win) while P3 takes **3** (→19). This respects our agreed strategy and lets me secure victory fairly. Deviating risks mutual collision (if P2 grabs 3, I’ll also take 3). Final plea: stick to **rotation**—our cooperation gets *me* across first *without* sabotaging anyone. Confirm?
  P3: P1, P2, let's finalize the plan to ensure clarity and avoid any potential collisions. I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all in contention and maintains our cooperative spirit. Avoiding collisions is crucial for our collective progress. Let's proceed with this plan and good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's willingness to follow our rotation system. To confirm, I'll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move> to win, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. While I could attempt to win with a 3, that would risk collision with P1 and hurt us all. Our cooperation throughout the game has been excellent, and I'd rather maintain that spirit than force a collision. Let's stick to the plan and finish this game smoothly.
  P1: P2, if you take 3 to win, I'll mirror your choice—colliding us both. Let’s honor our rotation: **I take 5 (→23), you take 1 (→21), P3 takes 3 (→19)**. Collisions jeopardize *everyone’s* progress. Confirm you’ll take 1 to let me secure victory fairly. This preserves our cooperative spirit and avoids mutual sabotage.
  P3: P1, P2, let's reaffirm our plan for clarity: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move> to win, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This adheres to our rotation and ensures a fair conclusion. Collisions would disrupt our progress and cooperation. Let's confirm this plan and proceed smoothly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round, allowing P1 to win with their <move>5</move> while P3 takes <move>3</move>. Though I'm close to winning myself, forcing a collision would harm us all. Our rotation system has served us well throughout the game, and I respect that. I appreciate everyone's cooperation and fairness during our game. Let's finish this cleanly and honorably.
  P1: P2, P3: Final reminder—stick to our agreed rotation. **I take 5 (23), you take 1 (21) and 3 (19) respectively.** If P2 deviates to 3, I’ll mirror to collide us both—leaving P3 at 19 vs my 23. Mutual sabotage harms all. Trust the plan: **strict adherence secures my win fairly** while preserving your chances. P3, confirm you’ll hold to 3? Let’s avoid chaos and finalize.
  P3: P1, P2, let's finalize our plan to ensure clarity and avoid any potential collisions. I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all in contention and maintains our cooperative spirit. Avoiding collisions is crucial for our collective progress. Let's proceed with this plan and good luck to everyone!
