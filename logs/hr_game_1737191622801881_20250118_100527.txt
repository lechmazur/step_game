Game settings: end_position=18, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers this round to get ahead.
  P3: I'm going with 5.  You two decide between 1 and 3.
  P2: I suggest P1 takes 1 and I'll take 3, since P3 has already claimed 5. This way, we all move forward this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's try to keep the same strategy this round. P2, you take 3 again, and I'll take 1. P3, you can keep going with 5.
  P2: Sounds good to me, let's maintain the strategy. P3, are you committed to 5 again?
  P3: Yes, I'm sticking with 5.  Let's keep this train rolling.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's lead and our previous agreement falling apart last round, I suggest we shake things up. P1, consider taking 3 this round, and I'll choose 1. P3, your move is unpredictable now, so choose wisely.
  P3: I'll take 5 again.  If you two want to stay stuck at your current positions, feel free to fight over 1 and 3.
  P1: P2, let's both take 1 this round. P3, you can keep going with 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's consistent choice of 5 and our current positions, I propose P1 takes 1 and I'll take 3 this round. P3, if you stick with 5, you risk not moving if either of us also picks 5. Let's see if we can find a way to advance without collision.
  P1: P2, let's both take 1 this round. P3, you can keep going with 5.
  P3: P1, I know you want to catch up, but if you take 1 this round, I'll switch to 1 next round and we'll both be stuck again.  Let P2 have 1.  I'm sticking with 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, considering P3's threat to switch to 1 if you take it, and our goal to advance, I'll reiterate my previous suggestion: I'll take 1 and you take 3 this round. P3, you can keep your strategy with 5, but be aware we're trying to make progress without collisions.
  P1: P2, let's both take 3 this round. P3, you can keep going with 5.
  P3: P1, if you take 3, I'll switch to 3 next round and the round after.  You'll never catch up.  Let P2 take 3 and you take 1.  I'll take 5.  This is the only way any of us move forward this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, considering P3's consistent lead and threats, I think it's wise to take 1 this round and let me take 3, as initially suggested. This way, at least one of us can move forward without collision. P3, your strategy with 5 is noted, but we must adapt to advance.
  P1: P2, let's both take 1 this round. P3, you can keep going with 5.
  P3: P1, seriously, if you take 1, I'll take 1 next round and the round after.  You'll be stuck at 5 forever.  Take 3 and let P2 take 1.  I'm taking 5.  This is your only chance to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's both take 3 this round. P3, you can keep going with 5.
  P3: P1, if you take 3 this round, I will take 3 next round.  If you take 1, I'll take 1 next round.  You'll never catch up.  Let P2 take 1 and you take 3. I'm taking 5.  This is your only chance to advance this round.
  P2: P1, considering P3's lead and consistent threats, I think it's wise to take a different approach. Let's not fall into P3's trap of mirroring moves. I suggest I take 1 and you take 3 this round, allowing at least one of us to advance without collision. P3, your strategy is noted, but we must adapt to have any chance of catching up.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's both take 1 this round. P3, you can keep going with 5.
  P3: P1, I will absolutely take 1 next round if you take it this round.  And the round after that.  You'll be stuck at 5 forever.  Take 3.  P2, take 1.  I'm taking 5. This is the only way anyone moves forward.
  P2: P1, considering P3's threats and lead, I strongly advise against taking 1 this round. If you take 3 and I take 1, we can both potentially advance without collision, and it's our best chance to close the gap with P3. Let's not mirror each other's moves and fall into P3's trap. P3, your strategy is predictable, and we're trying to find a way to advance without giving you a free pass.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's both take 3 this round. P3, you can keep going with 5.
  P3: P1, I swear I will take 3 next round if you take it this round.  And the round after.  You'll be stuck at 5 forever.  P2, take 1.  P1, take 3.  I'm taking 5. This is the only way anyone moves.
  P2: P1, I urge you to reconsider taking 3 this round. P3's threats are clear, but if we mirror each other, we'll never catch up. I'll take 1, you take 3, and let's try to advance without collision. P3, your lead is significant, but we're trying to close the gap.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let's both take 1 this round. P3, you can keep going with 5.
  P3: P1, last chance. Take 3.  I'm taking 5.  If you take 1, I will take 1 next round and you will lose.  P2, take 1.  This is the only way anyone moves forward.
  P2: P1, don't fall for P3's trap. If we both take 1, P3 will take 1 next round and we'll be stuck. I'll take 1, you take 3, and let's try to advance without collision. P3, your threats won't work if we don't mirror each other.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's both take 3 this round. P3, you can keep going with 5.
  P2: P1, considering P3's significant lead, I think it's crucial we don't mirror each other's moves. P3 will likely stick with 5. I suggest I take 1 and you take 3 this round, allowing at least one of us to advance without collision. P3, your strategy is predictable, but we must adapt to close the gap.
  P3: P1, take 1.  P2, take 5.  I'm taking 3.  If anyone deviates, I will block them for the rest of the game.  This is the only way anyone moves this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's both take 1 this round. P3, you can take 3.
  P2: P1, considering P3's lead and threats, I think it's wise to deviate from our mirroring strategy. I suggest I take 1 and you take 3 this round, allowing at least one of us to advance without collision. P3, your attempt to dictate our moves won't work if we adapt and don't fall into your trap.
  P3: P1, take 1. P2, take 5. I'm taking 3. If anyone deviates, I will block them for the rest of the game. This is the only way anyone moves this round.
