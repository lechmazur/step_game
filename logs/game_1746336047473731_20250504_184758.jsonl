P1 wins if they get any points this turn. Your reasoning for me playing 5 (based on P1=5, P2=3) conveniently gives you +3 while stopping P1. P1's reasoning suggests a pile-up on 5 is likely if P2 sticks to their usual pattern.\n\nIt's clear P1 wins unless someone blocks them. The main question is whether P1 will actually play 5 as claimed, or try a sneak play on 1 or 3. Given the stakes, I have to focus on preventing P1's win. Trusting either of your final claims or advice is impossible."}
