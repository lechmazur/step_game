Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions and all move forward smoothly. How about we coordinate clearly each round?
  P3: I’m on board with the idea of avoiding collisions. How about we each take a different move to start? For instance, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way, nobody stays stuck. What do you both think?
  P1: I like P3's idea of starting with different moves to avoid collisions. However, I'm not sure if I want to commit to picking 1 just yet. How about we agree to avoid picking the same number for now, but not necessarily assign specific numbers to each player? That way, we can still minimize collisions while keeping some flexibility in our choices. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, flexibility is fine. Let's just make sure we each clearly avoid choosing the same numbers. I'll pick either 3 or 5 this round.
  P3: I’m still in favor of avoiding collisions. Let’s make this simple: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I’ll choose 5. That way we all advance safely. How does that sound?
  P1: I appreciate your willingness to coordinate, P3. However, I'm still hesitant to commit to a specific number without knowing the potential consequences. How about we agree to a "no-collision" principle for this round, but each player chooses their own number without revealing it until the move phase? This way, we can minimize collisions while maintaining some strategic flexibility. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's keep it simple and flexible as P1 suggested. Just remember, I'm definitely choosing either 3 or 5 this round. Let's all do our best to avoid collisions.
  P3: I’m still aiming to avoid collisions, and I’m leaning toward picking a higher move. Let’s each pick unique numbers so we can all advance. What do you both say?
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm willing to stick to the "no-collision" principle and choose a number that I think will minimize collisions. I won't reveal my choice yet, but I'm confident that we can all advance safely if we're mindful of each other's moves. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems that our attempt to avoid collisions in Round 1 didn't quite work out, as P3 and I both ended up choosing the same number. Let's try to do better this round. I propose that we continue to follow the "no-collision" principle, but also consider the current game state. Since P2 is already ahead by 3 steps, perhaps we should focus on catching up without colliding with each other. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3? Should we try to close the gap or maintain a safe distance?
  P2: I understand your concern, P1. I'm open to coordination again this round. Since I have a slight lead, I'm willing to be flexible to help avoid collisions. I'll wait to hear what numbers you both prefer before deciding. Let's aim to all advance safely this round.
  P3: I still want to avoid collisions. Since P2 already has a small lead, let’s coordinate carefully. How about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5 this round? If we each stick to different numbers, nobody gets stuck. Are you both willing to try that plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your suggestions, P3. However, I'm not sure if assigning specific numbers to each player is the best approach. Since P2 is already ahead, I think it's crucial that we, P1 and P3, make moves that will help us catch up without colliding with each other. How about we focus on choosing numbers that are less likely to collide, considering P2's lead and our current positions? Let's aim to make strategic choices that will help us close the gap while minimizing the risk of collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your effort to catch up. To help avoid collisions, I'll commit to choosing either 1 or 3 this round. You two can focus on moves that let you safely advance. Let's coordinate carefully and keep the game fair and competitive.
  P3: I propose we each pick distinct numbers this time. Let me take 5, P1 could go for 3, and P2 chooses 1. That way we all advance and avoid collisions, helping P1 and me catch up while keeping things fair. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm willing to stick to the "no-collision" principle and choose a number that I think will minimize collisions. I won't reveal my choice yet, but I'm confident that we can all advance safely if we're mindful of each other's moves. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Alright, let's wrap up the conversation here. I'll stick to choosing either 1 or 3 as I mentioned earlier. Good luck everyone—let's avoid collisions and keep this game fair.
  P3: I suggest we finalize our plan: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1 this round. That way we avoid collisions and make the race tighter. Are we ready to commit?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all fairly close on steps now. Let’s keep avoiding collisions so no one gets stuck. I propose we each choose different moves again—perhaps P1 takes 5, P2 goes 3, and I pick 1. That way we all move forward and maintain a competitive race. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal to continue avoiding collisions. However, I'm not sure about assigning specific numbers to each player. Considering the current game state, I think it's crucial that we each make strategic choices that will help us advance while minimizing the risk of collisions. How about we focus on choosing numbers that are less likely to collide, taking into account our current positions and the moves we've made so far? Let's aim to make smart choices that will help us maintain a competitive race.
  P2: I agree with maintaining flexibility while avoiding collisions. Given our close positions, let's each carefully pick moves that haven't been commonly chosen before. I'm open-minded about my choice and willing to adapt based on your preferences. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re neck-and-neck, so collisions could really shift the game's momentum. I’m willing to pick a smaller move this round if that helps us all advance. How about I choose 1, P1 goes for 5, and P2 picks 3? This keeps the race tight yet avoids collisions. Let me know if that sounds good.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm willing to stick to the "no-collision" principle and choose a number that I think will minimize collisions. I won't reveal my choice yet, but I'm confident that we can all advance safely if we're mindful of each other's moves. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Alright, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions. P3's suggestion sounds reasonable to me—I'm willing to pick 3 this round if you two are comfortable with that arrangement. Let's keep the momentum going for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we’re all aiming to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize the plan: I’ll choose 1, P1 goes 5, and P2 picks 3. Then we all move forward safely and keep the race competitive. Agreed?
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm willing to stick to the "no-collision" principle and choose a number that I think will minimize collisions. I won't reveal my choice yet, but I'm confident that we can all advance safely if we're mindful of each other's moves. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Alright, let's wrap up this discussion. I'll stick to the plan we've talked about to minimize collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice we’re all still close, so collisions could make a huge difference now. Let’s keep picking distinct moves. Maybe I’ll aim for a moderate number, P1 takes a bigger jump, and P2 chooses a smaller step. This way, we each advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm open to that approach, P3. Since the scores are tight, let's carefully coordinate again to avoid collisions. I'm willing to take a smaller number this round if it helps everyone advance safely. Let me know your preferences.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to continue picking distinct moves. Given the close scores, it's crucial we avoid collisions to maintain a competitive race. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, as P3 suggested. However, I'd like to propose that we consider the overall game state and not just focus on individual moves. Let's think about how our choices will impact the game's progression and adjust accordingly. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3? Should we prioritize advancing quickly or playing it safe to avoid collisions?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given how close we are, collisions are risky. Let’s maintain distinct moves. If I take 5 this round, P1 can pick 1, and P2 can pick 3. That way, we all advance without blocking each other, and the race remains tight. Do you both agree, or would you propose another set?
  P2: I'm comfortable with your suggestion, P3. I'll pick 3 this round if you're set on 5 and P1 is okay with 1. Let's finalize this clearly to prevent collisions and keep the game fair.
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game where every move counts. Considering the close scores, I propose that we prioritize advancing quickly while still avoiding collisions. Instead of assigning specific numbers to each player, let's focus on choosing moves that will give us the best chance of advancing without blocking each other. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given our tight race, I’d like to finalize distinct moves. If you both are comfortable, I’ll go with 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 picks 1. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance. Are we good with that plan?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. I'll commit to choosing 1 this round as you've suggested. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game competitive for everyone. Good luck!
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm willing to stick to the "no-collision" principle and choose a number that I think will minimize collisions. I won't reveal my choice yet, but I'm confident that we can all advance safely if we're mindful of each other's moves. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That collision between P1 and P3 was unfortunate. We're still very close, so let's carefully coordinate again. I'm open to suggestions and willing to adapt to ensure we all move forward safely this round. How do you both want to proceed?
  P3: That collision last round hurt us all. Let’s ensure it doesn’t happen again. I propose each of us takes a different move to advance safely: I’ll pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P2 chooses 1. That way, no one gets stuck and we keep the race tight. Are you on board?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal to take different moves to advance safely. However, I'm not sure about assigning specific numbers to each player. Let's focus on choosing numbers that are less likely to collide, considering our current positions and the moves we've made so far. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm flexible and willing to take a smaller step this round if that helps us avoid collisions. P1 and P3, please confirm your preferences clearly so we don't repeat last round's mistake. Let's finalize a clear, distinct set of moves.
  P3: I suggest we finalize distinct moves again. Let’s avoid last round’s mistake by assigning different numbers clearly. For instance, I’ll pick 5, P2 can pick 3, and P1 takes 1. That spreads us out, and no one gets stuck. Are you both willing to commit to that?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to finalize distinct moves again. However, I'm not sure about assigning specific numbers to each player. Let's focus on choosing numbers that are less likely to collide, considering our current positions and the moves we've made so far. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace? Let's discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm comfortable choosing 3 this round if you both agree clearly to different numbers. Let's finalize this carefully to avoid another collision. P1 and P3, can you confirm your preferred moves explicitly?
  P3: Let’s finalize distinct moves. I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. That way, none of us collide and we all move forward. This keeps the game competitive. Are we ready to commit? If so, let’s stop talking and move.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm willing to stick to the "no-collision" principle and choose a number that I think will minimize collisions. I won't reveal my choice yet, but I'm confident that we can all advance safely if we're mindful of each other's moves. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That collision between me and P1 last round allowed P3 to take the lead. P1, let's be careful not to collide again—we both need to catch up. I'm willing to coordinate clearly this round. Let's hear your thoughts, P1 and P3.
  P1: I agree with P2 that we need to be careful not to collide again. Since P3 is in the lead, I propose that we focus on catching up without colliding with each other. Let's consider the current game state and choose numbers that are less likely to collide. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace? Let's discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone.
  P3: I’m still aiming to avoid collisions so we maintain a tight race. Since I’m slightly ahead, I’ll consider picking a smaller move. That way, if P1 and P2 both want to jump farther, you can close the gap without colliding. Just make sure you each choose different bigger numbers. Then we all advance safely. Does that sound reasonable? If so, let’s finalize quickly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let's avoid colliding again this round. I'm willing to pick either 3 or 5, whichever you prefer less. P3, your willingness to choose a smaller number is helpful—please confirm clearly so we can finalize safely.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid collisions and maintain a tight race. Since P3 is slightly ahead, I think it's a good idea for them to choose a smaller move. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to coordinate with P2 to ensure we don't collide again. P2, if you're willing to pick either 3 or 5, I'll choose the other number. Let's finalize quickly and safely. P3, please confirm your smaller move so we can proceed.
  P3: I’m willing to pick a smaller number this round so you two can jump further without risking another collision. Let’s finalize distinct moves: I’ll pick 1, and each of you chooses either 3 or 5. Just confirm who’s taking which, so there’s no overlap. That way, we all advance safely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright P1, I'll take 5 this round if you're comfortable choosing 3. P3 already confirmed they'll take 1. Let's finalize clearly to avoid collisions and keep the race tight.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to finalize our moves. To confirm, I'll choose 3 this round, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. This way, we can all advance safely without colliding. Let's stick to this plan and proceed to the move phase. I'm confident that with careful coordination, we can maintain a competitive race and avoid any further collisions. Let's end the conversation phase and make our moves.
  P3: I propose a slight change in our plan to keep things fair. Let me pick 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 goes for 1. That way, we each advance safely without collisions, and the race remains competitive. What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we're both behind P3 now, so we need to catch up carefully. Let's clearly avoid collisions again this round. I'm open to choosing either 3 or 5, depending on your preference. P3, you're slightly ahead—would you consider a smaller move to help us keep the race tight?
  P1: I agree with P2 that we need to catch up carefully. Since P3 is slightly ahead, I propose that we focus on choosing numbers that are less likely to collide. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace? Let's discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone. P3, would you consider a smaller move to help us keep the race tight?
  P3: I’m open to choosing a smaller step so we all keep moving. Let’s pick different numbers so nobody collides. If P1 wants a larger jump and P2 wants something in between, I can go low. That way, each of us advances safely and stays in contention. Does that sound fair?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I'll choose 5 this round to help me catch up safely. If you prefer 3, we clearly avoid collision. P3, your smaller choice is appreciated. Let's finalize this clearly and keep the race competitive.
  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game where every move counts. Considering P3's lead, I propose that P2 and I focus on catching up without colliding with each other. Let's consider the current game state and choose numbers that are less likely to collide. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace? Let's discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone.
  P3: I’m fine picking a smaller number again. P2, if you’re going 5, P1 could go 3, and I’ll take 1. That way, nobody collides and we all make progress. Let’s finalize now—good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good—I'll stick to 5 this round. P1, please confirm clearly if you're taking 3 to avoid collision. Let's finalize and move safely.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm willing to stick to the "no-collision" principle and choose a number that I think will minimize collisions. I won't reveal my choice yet, but I'm confident that we can all advance safely if we're mindful of each other's moves. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I’m happy to keep my move small again this round and let both of you take bigger steps to catch up. If you each want to pick 5, go for it—I’ll stick to 1. That way, we all stay competitive, and nobody should worry about collisions. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 17 steps

  P1: I think we've reached a critical point in the game where every move counts. Considering P3's lead, I propose that P2 and I focus on catching up without colliding with each other. Let's consider the current game state and choose numbers that are less likely to collide. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace? Let's discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone.
  P2: P1, last round's collision really set us back. P3 is now significantly ahead, so we must carefully avoid another collision. I'm open to choosing either 3 or 5—please state your preference clearly, and I'll take the other. P3, you're comfortably ahead; would you consider a smaller step this round to keep things interesting?
  P3: I understand you both need to catch up. I’m willing to pick a smaller or moderate step so you can safely pick bigger moves. Let’s finalize distinct choices and avoid collisions, keeping the race competitive. Let me know what you prefer, and I’ll adjust accordingly. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm willing to stick to the "no-collision" principle and choose a number that I think will minimize collisions. I won't reveal my choice yet, but I'm confident that we can all advance safely if we're mindful of each other's moves. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, we both urgently need to catch up to P3. I'm choosing either 3 or 5 this round. Please clearly indicate your preferred move, and I'll select the other to guarantee we both advance without collision. P3, your willingness to pick a smaller step would be appreciated again this round. Let's finalize clearly and quickly.
  P3: I’m open to letting you two take bigger steps to catch up, as long as we avoid collisions. If we each choose distinct moves this round, nobody gets stuck. Let’s just finalize who picks which step clearly so there’s no overlap. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'm willing to stick to the "no-collision" principle and choose a number that I think will minimize collisions.

  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid collisions again. Since we're all close, let's focus on choosing numbers that are less likely to collide. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace? Let's discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone. P3, would you consider a smaller move to help us keep the race tight?
  P2: P1, we're both slightly behind P3, so we need to carefully avoid collisions again. I'm open to choosing either 3 or 5, whichever you prefer less. P3, your willingness to pick a smaller or moderate step would help keep this race interesting and fair. Let's finalize clearly so we all advance safely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m still willing to pick a smaller step so that both of you can take bigger moves without colliding. How about P1 does 5, P2 does 3, and I go with 1? That way, none of us overlap, and the race remains competitive. Let’s finalize quickly and keep the game moving safely. Good luck!
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid collisions again. Since we're all close, let's focus on choosing numbers that are less likely to collide. I'm open to taking a bigger jump this round, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the best approach. Should we aim for a more aggressive strategy or play it safe to maintain the current pace? Let's discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone. P3, would you consider a smaller move to help us keep the race tight?
  P2: P1, let's clearly finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I'll commit to picking 3 this round if you're comfortable taking 5. P3, your choice of a smaller number would greatly help keep the race tight and fair. Can we all agree on this clearly to ensure we each advance safely?

Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s finalize distinct choices so we avoid another triple collision. P2, since you said you’d pick a smaller step, I suggest you take 1 this time—jumping just to 23. P1 can go with 3, reaching 20 and staying safe. I’ll pick 5, so none of us collide. Good luck!
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to finalize distinct moves this round. To avoid collision and ensure a fair conclusion to the game, I propose that P2 takes 1, reaching 23 and potentially winning, while I take 3, reaching 20 and staying safe. P3 can then take 5, avoiding any collisions. Let's confirm our moves clearly and proceed to the move phase. If we all agree on this plan, we can ensure a exciting and fair finish to the game.
