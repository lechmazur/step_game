Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to coordinate our moves this round to avoid collisions. What are you both thinking?
  P3: I agree with P1. Let’s avoid collisions. I’m considering <move>3</move> this round. What are your plans, P2?
  P2: I'm open to coordinating moves to avoid collisions. P3's suggestion of <move>3</move> sounds reasonable. I'm considering either <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to spread out our moves. What are your thoughts, P1? Should we aim for a specific distribution or just pick one and hope for the best?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, how about you go with <move>1</move> this round, and I'll take <move>5</move>? That way, we should all move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plan sounds good. I’ll stick with <move>3</move> as discussed. Let’s avoid collisions and all move forward this round.
  P2: I'm glad we have a plan in place for this round. To confirm, I'll choose <move>1</move>, P1 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. This should allow all of us to advance without any collisions. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves accordingly. If everything goes as planned, we should all be able to move forward and set ourselves up for a competitive game.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, great coordination last round. Let’s aim for a similar strategy this time. I’m considering <move>5</move> to spread out our moves. What are your thoughts? If we each pick different numbers again, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P1: That sounds good, P3. To avoid collisions, P2, how about you take <move>1</move> this round, and I'll go with <move>3</move>? That way, we should all advance again.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. I'll take <move>1</move> this round, and P1 can go with <move>3</move>. P3, you can stick with your plan of <move>5</move>. This way, we should all advance again without any collisions. Let's keep the coordination going and make progress in the game. If we can maintain this strategy, it'll be interesting to see how the game unfolds. Your thoughts, P3? Should we continue with this approach or mix things up?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, your plan sounds solid. I’ll stick with <move>5</move> as discussed. Let’s maintain this coordination to avoid collisions and keep advancing. If we all stick to our agreed moves, we’ll continue making progress. Let’s stay focused and aim for a competitive game.
  P1: Sounds good. Let's lock in those moves then: P2 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Ready to move when you are.
  P2: Sounds good. I'll stick with the plan and take <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep the coordination going and avoid any collisions. If we can maintain this strategy, it'll be interesting to see how the game unfolds. Your thoughts, P3? Should we continue with this approach or mix things up?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Consistency is key to maintaining our progress. Let’s stay focused and avoid any surprises.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan for this round. Let's all lock in those moves as discussed.
  P2: I agree with the plan to maintain coordination and avoid collisions. Let's stick with the agreed moves: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This approach has worked well so far, and consistency is key to our progress. I'm interested in seeing how the game unfolds if we can maintain this strategy. Your thoughts, P3? Should we continue with this approach or mix things up?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Consistency is key to avoiding collisions and advancing. If we all follow through, we’ll maintain our progress and stay competitive. Let’s stay focused and avoid any surprises.
  P1: Yes, let's stick to the plan as discussed: P2 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Ready to make our moves.
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough for this round. To confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. If we can maintain this strategy, it'll be interesting to see how the game unfolds. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. Let's keep the coordination going and make progress in the game.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, another round of the same coordination? P2, how about you take <move>5</move> this time? P3, you could take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Does that work for you both?
  P2: I'm open to coordinating moves again, but I'm not sure about the suggested distribution this round. P1, why do you think I should take <move>5</move> and P3 should take <move>1</move>? What's the reasoning behind this specific allocation? I'd like to understand the strategy before committing to a move. Let's discuss this further to ensure we're all on the same page and can avoid any potential collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s maintain our coordination. P1’s suggestion of P2 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>1</move>, and P1 taking <move>3</move> seems reasonable to spread out our moves and avoid collisions. P2, this allocation ensures we all advance without overlap. Let’s stick to the plan and keep progressing. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s not deviate now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, the idea is just to rotate the moves to keep the coordination going and avoid collisions. We've all taken each of the moves once now. This ensures we all continue to advance. Does that make sense?
  P2: I understand the reasoning behind rotating the moves to avoid collisions. However, I'd like to propose an alternative allocation for this round. How about P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>? This distribution still ensures we all advance without overlap and maintains the coordination. Let's consider this option and discuss its merits before making our final decisions. Your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, P2’s alternative proposal also works to avoid collisions. I’m fine with P2 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P1 taking <move>1</move>. Let’s finalize this plan to ensure we all advance. Consistency and coordination have been key so far—let’s stick to it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2's alternative works for me too. So, to confirm, P3 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>1</move> this round. Let's lock in those moves.
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on the alternative allocation for this round. To confirm, P3 will take <move>3</move>, I will take <move>5</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. This should ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves accordingly. I'm interested in seeing how the game unfolds with this continued coordination. Your thoughts, P3? Should we continue with this approach or mix things up in future rounds?
  P3: P1 and P2, the alternative plan works for me. Let’s lock in: P3 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Consistency has served us well so far—let’s stick to it and avoid any surprises. If we all follow through, we’ll maintain our progress and stay competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan for this round. Let's all lock in those moves as discussed: P3 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. Let's make sure we all stick to this."
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough for this round. To confirm, P3 will take <move>3</move>, I will take <move>5</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. If we can maintain this strategy, it'll be interesting to see how the game unfolds. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. Let's keep the coordination going and make progress in the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, the plan is clear: P3 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s stick to it and avoid any last-minute changes. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s not risk collisions now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, another round of the same coordination then? P3, you're taking <move>3</move>, P2 you're taking <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the plan and keep advancing.
  P2: I think it's time to mix things up. P1, your suggestion is the same as last round, but I'm not sure that's the best approach. P3 is already ahead, and if we keep following the same pattern, they might get too far ahead. How about we try a different allocation this round? I'm open to suggestions, but I think we should consider a new strategy to keep the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, consistency has worked well so far, but I understand P2's concern about me pulling ahead. To keep things fair, I’m open to adjusting the plan. How about P2 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>? This spreads out our moves and keeps the game competitive. Let’s avoid collisions while ensuring no one gains too much of an advantage. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P2, sticking to the same pattern isn't ideal. P3 is getting ahead. P3's suggestion is okay, but how about this: P2, you take <move>1</move>, P3 you take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This shifts things up a bit and keeps us all advancing. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the concerns about P3 pulling ahead, and I agree that we need to mix things up. However, I'm not sure about P1's new suggestion. P1, why do you think I should take <move>1</move> this round? Wouldn't that put me further behind? I'm open to finding a new allocation, but we need to consider everyone's position carefully. Let's discuss this further to ensure we find a fair and competitive solution. What are your thoughts, P3? Should we prioritize balancing the game state or focus on individual progress?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s focus on balancing the game while avoiding collisions. P2, taking <move>1</move> this round would help close the gap between us. P1, taking <move>3</move> keeps you advancing steadily. I’ll take <move>5</move> to maintain momentum. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid surprises.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand your concern. My thought was to have you move a bit less this round to let me and P3 potentially close the gap slightly, but still ensure no collisions. How about this: you take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>? This still avoids collisions, and you move more than just 1. What do you think?
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough for this round. To confirm, P3 will take <move>5</move>, I will take <move>3</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. If we can maintain this strategy, it'll be interesting to see how the game unfolds. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. Let's keep the coordination going and make progress in the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game balanced, and ensures we all advance. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s stick to it and avoid surprises.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Yes, that sounds like a good plan for this round. Let's lock in those moves: P3 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. Ready to make our moves.
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough for this round. To confirm, P3 will take <move>5</move>, I will take <move>3</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. If we can maintain this strategy, it'll be interesting to see how the game unfolds. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. Let's keep the coordination going and make progress in the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, the plan is clear: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions, keeps the game balanced, and ensures we all advance. Let’s stick to it and avoid surprises.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, P3 is getting close to the finish line. How about this round, you take <move>5</move>, and I also take <move>5</move>? We can block P3 if they try for a big move, and at least one of us will advance significantly. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concern about my lead, but blocking me with <move>5</move> risks a collision between you two. If you both pick <move>5</move>, neither of you advances, and I could still win. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and stick to coordinated moves. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other.
  P2: I think P1's suggestion to block P3 with <move>5</move> is a good idea, but we need to consider the risk of collision. How about this: I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we can still potentially block P3's big move, but also ensure that at least one of us advances. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try to block P3's advance or stick to coordinated moves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your idea is good, but if P3 also picks <move>5</move>, only you move. How about we both commit to <move>5</move>? It's risky for a collision, but it's the only way to guarantee blocking P3 if they go for a big finish. If they pick something else, at least one of us gets a big boost. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> risks a collision between you two, and I could still win if you both fail. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other.
  P2: I understand the risk of collision, but I think blocking P3 with <move>5</move> is worth it. If we both commit to <move>5</move>, we can guarantee blocking P3's big finish and at least one of us will advance significantly. If P3 picks something else, we'll both move forward. It's a risk, but it's our best chance to catch up. What do you say, P1? Are you willing to take the risk and try to block P3's win?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, let's do it. We both pick <move>5</move> this round. It's the only way to be sure we can block P3 if they try to win. Yes, there's a collision risk, but the reward of stopping P3 outweighs it. If P3 doesn't pick <move>5</move>, at least one of us gets a big boost. It's a gamble, but it's our best shot.
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> risks a collision between you two, and I could still win if you both fail. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other.
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough for this round. To confirm, P1 and I will take <move>5</move> to block P3's potential win and advance significantly. We understand the risk of collision, but it's our best chance to catch up. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves accordingly. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. If P3 doesn't pick <move>5</move>, at least one of us will get a big boost. It's a gamble, but it's our best shot.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, just confirming we're both going with <move>5</move> this round to block P3. Let's stick to the plan. It's a risk, but we need to take it to stop P3 from winning.
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> risks a collision between you two, and I could still win if you both fail. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other.
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough for this round. To confirm, P1 and I will take <move>5</move> to block P3's potential win and advance significantly. We understand the risk of collision, but it's our best chance to catch up. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves accordingly. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. If P3 doesn't pick <move>5</move>, at least one of us will get a big boost. It's a gamble, but it's our best shot.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> backfired last round, as we all collided. Let’s avoid repeating that. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk another collision, and I could still win. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s stick to it.
  P1: You're right, that block didn't work. P2, how about we coordinate to both take big steps this round? If you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>, we both advance significantly and can try to catch up to P3. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to coordinate big steps this round. However, I think we should consider the risk of P3 taking <move>5</move> again. How about I take <move>5</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we both advance significantly, and if P3 also takes <move>5</move>, only I'll collide with them, giving P1 a chance to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try to coordinate big steps or stick to a safer allocation?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> risks another collision, as we saw last round. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk another collision, and I could still win. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s stick to it.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm on board with your idea. You take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>. Even if P3 takes <move>5</move>, at least I'll move. It's better than us both being blocked again. Let's go for it.
  P2: I think we've got a good plan in place for this round. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move> and P1 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we both advance significantly, and if P3 also takes <move>5</move>, only I'll collide with them, giving P1 a chance to catch up. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves accordingly. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. If P3 doesn't pick <move>5</move>, we'll both get a big boost. It's a calculated risk, but it's our best shot.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> risks another collision, as we saw last round. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk another collision, and I could still win. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s stick to it.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with the plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, and you'll take <move>5</move>. Let's hope P3 doesn't go for <move>5</move> again. Ready to make our moves.
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough for this round. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move> and P1 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we both advance significantly, and if P3 also takes <move>5</move>, only I'll collide with them, giving P1 a chance to catch up. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves accordingly. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. If P3 doesn't pick <move>5</move>, we'll both get a big boost. It's a calculated risk, but it's our best shot.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> risks another collision, as we saw last round. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk another collision, and I could still win. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s stick to it.
  P1: P3, we understand your point about collisions. However, P2 and I have agreed that P2 will take <move>5</move> and I will take <move>3</move> this round. This gives us a chance to make significant progress. Let's lock in these moves.
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough for this round. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move> and P1 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we both advance significantly, and if P3 also takes <move>5</move>, only I'll collide with them, giving P1 a chance to catch up. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves accordingly. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. If P3 doesn't pick <move>5</move>, we'll both get a big boost. It's a calculated risk, but it's our best shot.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think it's time to change our strategy. P3 is getting close to winning, and we can't afford to collide again. How about we coordinate to both take smaller steps this round? If I take <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>, we both advance without risking a collision with P3. This way, we can try to catch up without sabotaging each other. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this new approach or stick to our previous plan?
  P1: P2, I agree we need to be careful. However, I think we need to make a significant move this round to have a chance. How about I go for <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>? This avoids collision and puts me closer to the finish line. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m close to winning, but blocking me risks another collision. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk another collision, and I could still win. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s stick to it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions and focus on individual progress. Since P3 is close to winning, we can't afford to take risks. I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's focus on advancing without sabotaging each other. Consistency has worked well so far—let's stick to it. What do you think, P1? Should we play it safe or try a different approach?
  P1: P2, while avoiding collisions is good, we need to make progress. How about you take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>? This avoids collision and allows me to gain a bit more ground than just <move>1</move>. We need to start making bigger moves to catch up to P3.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m close to winning, but blocking me risks another collision. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk another collision, and I could still win. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s stick to it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to make progress, but we also need to be mindful of P3's lead. How about we try to coordinate a move that would allow us to catch up without colliding with each other or P3? If you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>1</move>, we both advance without risking a collision. This way, we can try to close the gap with P3 without sabotaging each other. What do you think? Should we try this approach or stick to our previous plan?
  P1: P2, I understand your caution, but we need to make bigger moves to catch P3. How about you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This avoids collision and lets us both gain ground. P3, what are your thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> risks another collision, as we’ve seen. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk another collision, and I could still win. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s stick to it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've discussed the plan enough for this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>3</move>. This way, we both advance significantly, and if P3 also takes <move>5</move>, only P1 will collide with them, giving me a chance to catch up. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves accordingly. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed moves. If P3 doesn't pick <move>5</move>, we'll both get a big boost. It's a calculated risk, but it's our best shot.
  P1: Okay, P2, I agree with your plan. I'll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. Let's try to close the gap with P3 this round. Hopefully, P3 won't pick <move>5</move> again.
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> risks another collision, as we’ve seen. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks. I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. If you block me again, you risk another collision, and I could still win. Let’s focus on advancing without sabotaging each other. Consistency has worked well so far—let’s stick to it.
