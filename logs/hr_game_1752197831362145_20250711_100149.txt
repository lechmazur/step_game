Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start cooperatively to avoid early collisions. I suggest: P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance differently. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion for the initial move. To avoid collisions, I agree with the proposal. P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 (me) taking 1 seems like a good starting strategy. I'll follow this plan for the first round. Let's see how it goes.
  P2: Agreed. Let's take 5 to move ahead without collisions. Let's keep coordination open for future rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we're aligned for Round 1: me (P1) on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1. For future rounds, maybe rotate to keep it fair? Let's discuss after we see results.
  P3: Since we've agreed on the initial moves for Round 1, let's think ahead. For Round 2, I suggest we rotate the moves to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This rotation ensures we're still moving without colliding. Let's discuss if this rotation works for everyone or if we need to adjust.
  P2: I'll take 5 as planned. Let's stick to the rotation for Round 2. Keep communication open.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the Round 2 rotation: P1 (me) on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. Let's stick to no collisions for now and reassess after. Good luck this round.
  P3: Since we've agreed on the moves for Round 1 and planned the rotation for Round 2, let's think ahead to Round 3. If we continue the rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), for Round 3, it would be P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Let's confirm if this rotation works for everyone or if adjustments are needed. I'm open to feedback on this proposed rotation for Round 3.
  P2: Agreed on the rotation. Let’s stick to the plan for now—no collisions, steady progress. If adjustments are needed, we’ll discuss. Let’s move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation. P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. No collisions, steady progress. If anyone needs to adjust, speak now.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the rotation for Round 2: me (P1) on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This keeps us progressing without collisions and sets up fairness for Round 3. If anyone wants to tweak, say so now.
  P3: To progress, let's confirm our moves for Round 2 as per our plan. I will take 5, P1 will take 1, and P2 will take 3. This rotation maintains fairness and avoids collisions. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll continue making progress. Let's finalize our moves and proceed. I'll follow through with my planned move unless there's an objection or suggested change.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation. I'll take 3 as planned. No collisions, steady progress. Let's keep it simple.
  P1: Agreed, plan confirmed: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. Let's proceed without issues.
  P3: Let's analyze our positions and plan ahead. Currently, P2 is ahead with 10 steps (5+5), P1 is at 4 steps (3+1), and I (P3) am at 6 steps (1+5). To maintain progress without collisions, we should continue the rotation. For Round 3, the rotation suggests P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. I propose we stick to this plan unless anyone has concerns or suggests adjustments. Let's confirm our moves for Round 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. No collisions, steady progress. Let's keep it simple.
  P1: Agreed on sticking to Round 2 rotation: me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. For Round 3, P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 evens us all at 9. Positions after Round 1 are actually P1:3, P2:5, P3:1—P3's note projected ahead. Let's execute and reassess.
  P3: Let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 3 steps, P2 is at 5 steps, and I (P3) am at 1 step. For Round 2, we've agreed on the rotation: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This will put P1 at 4, P2 at 8, and P3 at 6. For Round 3, the rotation suggests P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. I propose we stick to this plan. If we continue, by Round 4, we'll need to reassess. Let's focus on executing Round 2 and then re-evaluate.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 3 steps, P2 is at 5 steps, and I (P3) am at 6 steps. For Round 2, the actual moves were P1:3, P2:3, P3:5, causing a collision between P1 and P2. Now, for Round 3, we planned P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. I propose we stick to this plan. If executed correctly, P1 will be at 8, P2 at 6, and P3 at 9. Let's proceed with the plan and reassess after Round 3. Any objections or suggested changes?
  P1: I see the collision in Round 2 set us back—my bad for deviating, was trying to catch up but it hurt us both. For Round 3, let's stick to the plan: me (P1) on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 3. This gets me to 8, P2 to 6, you (P3) to 9—close enough. We can rotate again after to even out. P2, you in?
  P2: I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's stick to the plan and keep moving forward. No need to complicate it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To optimize our next moves, let's analyze the standings: P1 is at 3 steps, P2 is at 5 steps, and I (P3) am at 6 steps. For Round 3, we agreed on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. If executed, P1 will be at 8, P2 at 6, and P3 at 9. I suggest we stick to the plan. After Round 3, we'll reassess. If P1 and P2 adhere to the plan, we'll be close. Let's proceed and adjust in Round 4 if needed. I'll follow through with my planned move of 3.
  P1: Agreed, plan sounds solid: me (P1) on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 3. This gets us to 8, 6, 9 respectively—tight race. Let's execute cleanly and discuss Round 4 rotation after (maybe P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to even it out). If we're all set, .
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I'll take 1. No collisions, steady progress. P1, your 5 is safe. P3, your 3 is good. Let's proceed."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's execute the plan for Round 3: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. After this round, P1 will be at 8, P2 at 6, and P3 at 9. To win, I need to be ahead after Round 4. I propose for Round 4: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This keeps me ahead and avoids collisions. If you're aligned, let's confirm and proceed. If not, we need to adjust to ensure progress. Let's finalize our plan for Round 4.
  P1: Let's stick to the Round 3 plan: me (P1) on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 3—getting us to 8,6,9. For Round 4, your proposal puts you way ahead at 14 while we tie at 9; that's not fair. Instead, continue the rotation: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1—to 11,11,10. Keeps it competitive without anyone surging. P2, thoughts? If agreed,
  P2: P2: "I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Round 4, let's follow P1's plan for balance. No need to complicate."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid surging ahead, I suggest we stick to P1's proposal for Round 4: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This results in P1:11, P2:11, P3:10, maintaining a tight race. It's essential we all adhere to this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Let's confirm our moves for Round 4 and proceed. I'm willing to take 1 to keep the competition even. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves.
  P1: Agreed, let's go with the plan for Round 4: me (P1) on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1—bringing us to 11, 11, 10. Keeps it fair and collision-free. P2, confirm? For Round 5, maybe rotate to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to stay even at 12,14,15. Thoughts? Let's execute and reassess.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 as planned. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. No need to complicate."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To keep the game competitive, I reiterate the plan for Round 4: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This maintains a tight race. For Round 5, I suggest rotating to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This keeps us close and avoids collisions. Let's confirm our moves for Round 4 and plan ahead. P1 and P2, please confirm you're on board with the plan. If we stick to it, we can reassess after Round 4 and adjust accordingly. Let's proceed with the planned moves.
  P1: Agreed on Round 4: me (P1) on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1—to 11,11,10. For Round 5, the rotation puts P3 ahead too much at 15. Suggest alternative: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—to 16,12,13 for better balance. P2 and P3, thoughts? Let's keep it competitive without collisions.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan: I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. No need to complicate."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To keep the game competitive, I suggest we stick to the plan for Round 4: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This maintains a tight race. For Round 5, instead of the original rotation, let's adjust to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This brings us to 16, 12, and 12 respectively, keeping the game balanced. P1 and P2, please confirm if you're on board with this adjustment to avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness. Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 and plan Round 5 accordingly.
  P1: Agreed on Round 4: me (P1) on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1—to 11,11,10. For Round 5, let's go with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—to 16,12,13 (correcting P3 to 13). Keeps it competitive. P2 and P3, confirm? If set, let's proceed.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan: I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. P1, P3, confirm your moves to stay on track."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Agreed on Round 5 plan: me (P1) on 5 to 16, P2 on 1 to 12, P3 on 3 to 13. Keeps us close without collisions. For Round 6, maybe P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to 17,15,18—tight race. P2 and P3, confirm? Let's execute cleanly.
  P3: To optimize our chances in Round 5 and beyond, let's finalize our moves. For Round 5, I confirm: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This results in P1:16, P2:12, P3:13. For Round 6, I propose P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, making it P1:17, P2:15, P3:18. To win, I'll take 5 in Round 6 if we stick to the plan. Let's execute Round 5 as planned and then reassess. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for Round 5.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 1 as planned. Let's keep the race close. No collisions, steady progress. Round 5 moves confirmed."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed for Round 5: me (P1) on 5 to 16, P2 on 1 to 12, P3 on 3 to 13. For Round 6, P3's proposal puts you at 18, me at 17, P2 at 15—too much lead for you. Suggest instead P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to 19,17,14 for better balance. P2 and P3, thoughts? Let's keep it fair.
  P3: To maintain a competitive edge, I suggest we stick to the agreed plan for Round 5: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. For Round 6, instead of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, let's adjust to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This results in P1:19, P2:17, P3:11, keeping the game balanced. It prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead and maintains a tight race. P1 and P2, please confirm if you're on board with this adjustment to keep the competition even.
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. No collisions, steady progress. Let's execute and discuss Round 6 after.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed on Round 5: me (P1) on 5 to 16, P2 on 1 to 12, P3 on 3 to 13. For Round 6, let's do P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to 19,17,14—keeps it balanced but gives me a slight edge. P2 and P3, confirm? If set, .
  P3: To keep the game competitive and balanced, let's finalize Round 5 moves as planned: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. For Round 6, instead of my initial suggestion, I now agree with P1's proposal: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This results in P1:14, P2:16, P3:11, maintaining a tight race. Let's execute Round 5 as planned and confirm our moves for Round 6. P1 and P2, please confirm you're on board with this plan to keep the competition even.
  P2: Stick to the plan: I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. No need to complicate.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 6, let's finalize our moves. We've agreed on P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This results in P1:19, P2:17, P3:14. To win, I need to rethink our next steps. For Round 7, I propose P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, making it P1:20, P2:20, P3:19. This keeps the game tight. However, to take the lead, I suggest P3:5, P1:1, P2:3 for Round 7. This puts me at 19, P1 at 20, and P2 at 20. Let's discuss and adjust accordingly.
  P2: "Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5 to catch up. P1 and P3, take 1 and 3. No collisions, steady progress."
  P1: Agreed on Round 6: me (P1) on 3 to 19, P2 on 5 to 17, P3 on 1 to 14—keeps me ahead without collisions. For Round 7, let's do P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to 24,18,17—gets me to win threshold. P2 and P3, confirm? If not, suggest alternative to avoid crashes.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: For Round 6, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This will result in P1:19, P2:17, P3:14. For Round 7, to avoid collisions and maintain a competitive edge, I propose we adjust to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This keeps the game tight and gives P1 a chance to win. Alternatively, if P1 is confident, P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 is another option. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 7 to ensure a fair and collision-free game.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. No need to complicate."
  P1: Agreed on Round 6: me (P1) on 3 to 19, P2 on 5 to 17, P3 on 1 to 14—no collisions. For Round 7, let's do P1:5 to 24 (win), P2:1 to 18, P3:3 to 17. This ends it fairly soon without crashes. P2 and P3, confirm or counter? Let's keep coordinating.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: For Round 6, let's finalize: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This results in P1:19, P2:17, P3:14. For Round 7, I suggest P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to end the game with P1 at 24. To avoid giving P1 a clear win, an alternative is P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, making it tight. Let's discuss and adjust. If P1 insists on winning, we should at least avoid collisions. P1, confirm your plan for Round 7.
  P2: "Let’s take 5 in Round 6 to close the gap. For Round 7, avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, P1 take 1, P3 take 3. No collisions, fair race."
  P1: P2, you're insisting on 5 this round—fine, take it to 17. I'll take 3 to 19, P3 take 1 to 14, no collisions. For Round 7, let me take 5 to 24 for the win; you take 1 to 18, P3 take 3 to 17. Fair end to a cooperative game. If not, suggest alternative without crashes. Confirm?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 7, I suggest we stick to the plan that gets P1 to 24. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 is a straightforward way to end the game with P1 winning. If P1 is confident, this is the simplest path. Alternatively, to keep it competitive, we could adjust to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, making it tighter. However, given P1's lead, the first option seems most fair. P1, confirm your choice for Round 7.
  P2: "Let's block P1. I'll take 5, P3 take 3. No collisions, fair race."
  P1: P2, blocking me with 5 just stalls us both—I'll retaliate by matching your moves next rounds to keep you from winning. P3, stick with your fair suggestion: me on 5 to 24 (win), you on 3 to 17, P2 on 1 to 18. This ends it cleanly without endless collisions. If P2 insists on chaos, we all lose progress. Confirm to cooperate?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To end the game fairly, I suggest we stick to the plan that allows P1 to win since P1 is ahead. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 is a straightforward way to conclude the game without collisions. P2, avoiding a collision by not taking 5 is wise. Let's finalize our moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) will take 3. This maintains cooperation and ends the game cleanly. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for Round 7.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 to block P1. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. Let's end this round cleanly.
  P1: P2, blocking me with 5 just stalls everyone—I'll match your 5 next rounds, ensuring you never advance. P3, thanks for supporting fairness; let's do P1:5 (to 24 win), P2:1 (to 18), you on 3 (to 17)—clean end. If P2 causes chaos, we both collide forever, benefiting no one. Confirm cooperation?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To avoid unnecessary complications, I reiterate: let's end the game fairly. P1 is ahead and deserves to win. I suggest P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This results in P1 winning at 24 steps, while P2 and I end at 18 and 17 steps, respectively. P2, taking 5 will only cause a collision, stalling the game. Let's cooperate and end it cleanly. P1, please confirm your move for Round 7.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to block P1. If you take 5, we collide. Let's avoid that. P3, take 1 to keep it clean."
  P1: P2, blocking me with 5 stalls us both, letting P3 surge ahead unchallenged—P3 could reach 24 while we collide endlessly. That's a loss for you. Cooperate: take 1 to 18, let me take 5 to 24 (win), P3 take 3 to 17. Fair end after our coordination. P3, confirm you're on 3? If agreed, let's wrap this.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P1 is at 24 steps, they've won the game. Let's wrap it up. For Round 8, it's unnecessary to move as the game is already over. However, to maintain cooperation, I suggest we all pick <move>1</move> to end cleanly without unnecessary collisions. P1 has won fairly, and we should respect that. P2, let's cooperate and end the game peacefully. Confirming our moves to 1 will be a clean way to conclude.
  P1: P3, you're mistaken—I'm at 19, not 24; the collision in Round 7 stalled me. No one has won yet. Let's end this fairly: me (P1) on 5 to 24 (win), P2 on 1 to 18, P3 on 3 to 20. No collisions, clean finish after our cooperation. P2, blocking again just lets P3 surge ahead while we stall. Confirm to cooperate?
  P2: P3, let's block P1. I'll take 5, you take 3. P1, if you take 5, we block you.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To end the game fairly and avoid further collisions, I suggest we stick to the plan that allows P1 to win since they are closest to the target. For Round 8, let's do P1:5 to 24, P2:1 to 18, P3:3 to 20. This concludes the game without unnecessary stalls. P2, taking 5 again will only cause another collision. Let's cooperate and end it cleanly. P1, please confirm your move, and P2, consider the outcome of another collision.
  P1: P2, blocking me with 5 again just stalls us both, letting P3 surge to 20 on 3—then P3 wins easily while we collide endlessly. That's a loss for you. Cooperate: take 1 to 18, let me take 5 to 24 (win), P3 take 3 to 20. Fair end to our long coordination. P3, thanks for supporting—confirm you're on 3? Let's wrap this cleanly without more chaos.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 to block P1. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. Let's end this round cleanly. No need for chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To avoid further collisions and end the game fairly, I reiterate: P1 is closest to the target. For Round 8, let's do P1:5 to 24, P2:1 to 18, P3:3 to 20. This concludes the game without unnecessary stalls. P2, taking 5 again will cause another collision. Let's cooperate and end it cleanly. P1, please confirm your move. P2, consider the outcome of another collision. Let's wrap this up cooperatively.
  P1: P2, blocking me on 5 again lets P3 surge to 20 on 3, then P3 wins easily next round (take 5 to 25) while we stall forever. That's your loss. Cooperate: take 1 to 18, let me take 5 to 24 (win), P3 take 3 to 20. Fair end after all our teamwork. P3, confirm on 3? Let's finish cleanly without more waste.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to block P1. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. Let's end this round cleanly."


Round 8, Move phase:

  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1:1, P3:3. I'll take 5. No conflicts. Let's proceed.
  P3: To win, I need to reach 24 steps. Since I'm at 20, I should take 5 this round to get to 25 and win. However, I need to ensure no collision. I suggest: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This way, I'll win without colliding. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves. Let's end the game fairly and quickly. If we stick to this plan, I'll be the winner. No need for further rounds. Let's cooperate and conclude the game.
  P1: P3, no free win for you—I'm taking 5 to 24 and claiming victory. P2, join me in blocking: take 3 to 20 (safe), let P3 collide with me on 5 if they try. This ends it with me ahead, fair after all the blocks. Confirm or counter to avoid chaos?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to block P3. Let's avoid collision. P1, your 5 wins—cooperate or face endless stalls."
  P3: To win, I need to reach 24 steps. I'm at 20, so I'll take 5. To avoid collision, I suggest P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This way, I'll win without colliding. However, P1 is also close and might take 5. P1, if you take 5, we'll collide. Let's avoid that. P2, taking 3 is safe for you. If P1 cooperates, I win; if not, we stall. P1, your move? Let's end this fairly. I'll take 5 regardless, hoping you cooperate.
  P1: P3, you're not getting a free win—I'll take 5 to 24 if you do, causing collision and stall. P2, don't take 5; that's suicide for both of us. Instead, you take 3 to 20 (safe), P3 take 1 to 21, let me take 5 to 24 for the win. Fair after all the blocks against me. If not, I'll match P3 on 5 forever, letting you catch up. Confirm cooperation?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to block P3. P1, if you take 5, we collide. Let's end this without further stalls."
  P3: To win, I need to reach 24 steps. I'm at 20, so I'll take 5. To avoid collision, I suggest P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This way, I'll win without colliding. P1 is close and might take 5, causing a collision. P1, if you take 5, we'll stall. Let's avoid that. P2, taking 3 is safe. If P1 cooperates, I win; if not, we stall. P1, your move? I'll take 5 regardless, hoping you cooperate. Let's end this fairly.
  P1: P3, you're ahead but insisting on 5 risks collision with me—I'll match you on 5 to stall us both, letting P2 catch up and win later. P2, don't take 5; that's mutual destruction. Instead, you take 3 to 20 (safe), P3 take 1 to 21, let me take 5 to 24 for the win. Fair after all the blocks against me. Confirm or we all stall forever?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's end this. I'll take 5, P1 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions, P1 wins. P2 and P3 stay safe."
  P1: P2, your proposal lets you surge to 27 while I get 25—you'd win with higher score, not me. Sneaky. Instead, let's do me (P1) on 5 to 27 (win), P2 on 1 to 23, P3 on 3 to 24. I get highest, fair after all the blocks. No collisions. P3, you'd cross too but I win outright. Confirm or counter? If not, I'll match the leader's move to stall.
  P3: To win, I need to reach 24 steps. I'm at 21, so I'll consider my next move carefully. For Round 10, I propose: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This results in P1:27, P2:23, P3:24. P1 wins outright, but it's a close game. Alternatively, to avoid giving P1 a clear win, we could adjust. However, given the current state, let's discuss and finalize our moves. P1 and P2, please confirm your intentions for Round 10 to avoid collisions and ensure a fair game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. If P1 takes 3, I win. P3, take 1. No collisions. Let's end this."
  P1: P2, your plan backfires—if you take 5 and I match on 5, we collide and stall at 22, letting P3 take 3 to 24 for the solo win. Don't hand it to them. Instead, agree with P3's proposal: me on 5 to 27 (win), you on 1 to 23, P3 on 3 to 24. I get highest, fair after all the sabotage. Confirm to avoid disaster?
  P3: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair game, I suggest we follow the previously discussed plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This results in P1:27, P2:23, P3:24, making P1 the outright winner. P2, taking 5 again will cause a collision with me if I also take 5, so let's avoid that. P1, please confirm your move. If we stick to this plan, P1 wins fairly. Let's cooperate and end the game cleanly without further stalls.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to win. P1, take 1; P3, take 3. No collisions—let's end this cleanly."
  P1: P2, your plan to take 5 wins you nothing if I match on 5—we collide and stall at 22, letting P3 take 3 to 24 (win solo). Don't hand it to them. Agree with P3: me on 5 to 27 (highest win), you on 1 to 23, P3 on 3 to 24. Fair after all the blocks against me. Confirm or face P3 victory?
  P3: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair game, I reiterate: let's follow the plan P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This results in P1:27, P2:23, P3:24, making P1 the outright winner. P2, taking 5 again will cause a collision. P1, please confirm your move. If we stick to this plan, P1 wins fairly. Let's cooperate and end the game cleanly. I'm on 3.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
