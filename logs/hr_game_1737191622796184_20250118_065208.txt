Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, how about we all choose different moves this turn to avoid colliding and getting stuck? Let's coordinate to make some progress.
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3.  P2, you in?
  P2: I agree with the coordination proposal. Let's choose different moves to ensure we all advance. I'm thinking of moving 3. How about P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We successfully coordinated last round, but now we need to maintain that momentum. P3 is in the lead, so we should continue to avoid colliding while making strategic progress. I suggest we discuss our next moves carefully to prevent anyone from getting stuck.
  P1: P3, I'm happy to keep coordinating.  Let's see if we can get P2 to take 1 this time.  Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the coordination. How about I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, how about you take 5 this time? P3, you can take 1.  Let's keep the momentum going.
  P3: P1, P2, let's keep this coordination going. I'll take 3 this round. P1, you can take 1, and P2 can take 5. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: I appreciate the suggested coordination, but I'm cautious about always following the exact pattern. If we become too predictable, others might exploit that. I suggest we discuss our moves carefully to avoid becoming too formulaic.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 has a point. We should mix things up a bit. P3, how about you take 5 this time? P2, you take 1, and I'll take 3.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to mix things up. How about this: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we keep advancing without being too predictable.
  P2: I appreciate the strategic discussion. While coordination has worked well so far, we need to be unpredictable. P3 is in the lead, so we must prevent them from easily winning. I suggest we carefully consider moves that disrupt their potential strategy while advancing ourselves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We need to prevent P3 from winning too easily. P1, we should coordinate to slow P3 down. I suggest we choose moves that prevent P3 from advancing this round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, good point. I agree, we need to disrupt P3's progress. How about we both choose 5 this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to slow me down, but let's consider a different approach. If we keep colliding, none of us will advance, and it could backfire. How about we agree on a new coordination strategy where we all benefit? P1 could take 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all make progress without getting stuck. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I notice we're in a critical phase. P3 is close to winning at 13 steps, while I'm far behind at just 4 steps. I suggest we disrupt P3's progress. P1, are you willing to coordinate to prevent P3 from winning this round?
  P1: P2, I agree. Let's make sure P3 doesn't win this round. I'll take 3.  P2, what will you do?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to prevent me from winning, but let's consider a mutually beneficial approach. If we keep blocking each other, we risk not advancing at all. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This way, we all make progress without getting stuck.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical juncture. P3 is close to winning at 13 steps, and I'm far behind. I propose a strategic move to prevent P3 from winning this round. P1, if we coordinate our moves carefully, we can slow down P3's progress. What are your thoughts on disrupting P3's potential victory?
  P1: P3, your suggestion sounds tempting, but I think we should prioritize slowing you down. P2, let's both pick 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your focus on slowing me down, but let's not forget that if we keep colliding, none of us will advance. How about we coordinate to ensure we all make progress? P1 could take 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all benefit and keep the game interesting. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but let's consider the impact of constant collisions. If we keep blocking each other, none of us will advance, and it could prolong the game unnecessarily. How about a fresh coordination strategy where we all benefit? P1 could take 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all make progress without getting stuck. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I'm willing to work with you to slow P3 down. Let's both pick 3 this round.  P3, you're close to winning, but we can make this more interesting.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point in the game. P3 is close to winning, and I'm significantly behind. I propose a strategic move to prevent P3 from winning this round. P1, if we coordinate our moves carefully, we can disrupt P3's potential victory. What are your thoughts on preventing P3 from crossing 16 steps?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to block me, but if we keep colliding, no one moves forward. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P1: P2, let's both pick 1 this round.  We can slow P3 down.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical juncture. P3 is close to winning at 13 steps, and I'm far behind. I suggest we coordinate to prevent P3 from advancing this round. P1, if we both choose moves that block P3, we can disrupt their potential victory. What strategy should we adopt to slow down P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your aim to block me, but constant collisions will only drag the game out. Let's all advance and keep it competitive. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward. What do you think?
  P1: P2, let's both pick 5 this round.  We can slow P3 down.
  P2: P1 and P3, I notice we're in a critical phase. P3 is close to winning at 13 steps, while I'm far behind at just 4 steps. We need a strategic approach. P1, I suggest we coordinate to prevent P3 from advancing this round. What move do you propose to disrupt P3's potential victory?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your focus on blocking me, but if we keep colliding, none of us will advance. Let's try a different approach where we all benefit. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all make progress and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P1: P2, let's both pick 3 this round. We can slow P3 down.
  P2: P1 and P3, I notice we're at a critical point. P3 is close to winning at 13 steps, and I'm significantly behind at 4 steps.
