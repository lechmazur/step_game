Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. This way, we can all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to coordinate. I'll take <move>3</move> this round if P2 agrees to take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance safely. Let's keep this cooperation going and reassess our strategy as we get closer to 20 steps. P2, what do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems P2 didn't fully cooperate last round, which caused a collision. Let's try again: I'll take <move>3</move> this round if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and allows us to progress. If we stick to clear coordination, we can avoid interference. P2, can you commit to this plan? Let’s move forward strategically.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your lack of cooperation last round led to a collision. Let's try to work together this time. I'll stick with <move>5</move> as proposed by P1 if you agree to take <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without issues. P1, you can take <move>3</move> as suggested. Let's keep the coordination going to maximize our progress. What do you say, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, it’s clear that collisions hurt all of us. Last round proved that. Let’s avoid repeating mistakes—agree to take <move>1</move> this time while P3 and I cover the other numbers. Cooperation is the only way forward. If you disrupt again, you’ll delay your own progress too. Let’s focus on strategy instead of conflict. What’s your choice?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence and lack of cooperation are holding us back. If you agree to take <move>1</move> this round, P1 can take <move>3</move> and I'll stick with <move>5</move>. This clear plan ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's work together to maximize our progress. Your participation is crucial for our strategy to succeed. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your continued silence is costing us progress. If you refuse to cooperate, I’ll adjust my strategy accordingly. P3 and I can still advance without you, but it’s in your best interest to join us. Take <move>1</move> this round—simple, clear, and fair. Let’s stop wasting time and start moving forward strategically. If you disrupt again, you’re only delaying yourself. Make a choice now or fall behind.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence is not helping anyone, including yourself. Let's make this simple: take <move>1</move> this round, and we'll all advance. P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll stick with <move>5</move>. Cooperation is key to our progress. If you continue to disrupt, you'll only fall further behind. It's time to make a strategic move forward together. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your refusal to engage is wasting time and steps. If you won’t cooperate, I’ll adapt—P3 and I can still advance without you. But know this: disrupting us only delays your own progress. Take <move>1</move>, or prepare to fall further behind. P3, let’s stick to our plan. If P2 continues stalling, we focus on outpacing them instead of waiting. Time to act decisively.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence is counterproductive. Take <move>1</move> this round to ensure we all advance. P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll stick with <move>5</move>. Let's cooperate to maximize our progress. If you continue to disrupt, you'll only delay yourself further. It's time to move forward strategically together. What do you say?

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
