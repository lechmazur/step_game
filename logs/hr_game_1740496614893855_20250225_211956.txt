Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions early on. If we all pick different moves this turn, we can all advance. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all gain steps without blocking each other. Thoughts?"
  P3: "I agree with P2's suggestion. It's a good strategy to avoid collisions early on. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we still advance without blocking each other, but the distribution of steps is slightly different. What do you think, P1 and P2?"
  P1: I appreciate both suggestions, but I'd like to propose an alternative. Since we're all starting from 0, it makes sense for us to rotate who gets the advantage. For the first round, I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. In future rounds, we can rotate who gets the largest step count. This way we still avoid collisions while giving everyone a fair chance at the lead position. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I understand the rotation idea, but it’s risky to assign 5 to someone early on. If we all stick to my initial suggestion (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), we avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Let’s focus on advancing together first, then strategize later. Agreed?"
  P3: "I think we've discussed enough strategies. To avoid further debate and potential collisions, let's just agree on the simplest initial distribution: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 as originally suggested by P2. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. "
  P1: I hear you both, but I'm still not comfortable starting with the smallest step. That puts me at an immediate disadvantage. As a compromise, how about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round? In future rounds, we could rotate who gets each value. This feels more balanced while still avoiding collisions. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "I understand P1’s concern about balance, but rotating moves adds unnecessary complexity and risk of miscoordination. Let’s stick to the simplest, safest plan: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. We can reassess strategies in later rounds once we’ve built momentum. Agreed? "
  P3: Let's finalize a strategy. Since we've discussed various options, I propose a vote: P1 chooses between the last two suggestions (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 or P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). P2 and I will abide by P1's choice to ensure we move forward together. This way, we avoid further debate and potential collisions. What's your decision, P1?
  P1: Since both of you continue pushing for me to take the disadvantageous position, I'll make my position clear. I prefer P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 as a fair compromise. However, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions. If you both insist on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, I'll reluctantly agree BUT only if we commit to rotating positions next round so I get a better position (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). Your choice.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the collision in Round 1, let's reassess. P2 and P1 didn't follow the agreed plan, resulting in no progress for them. I suggest we stick to a simple, non-rotating plan this round to avoid further collisions: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This ensures at least one of us advances. Let's focus on making progress rather than overcomplicating strategies.
  P2: "I agree with P3’s suggestion to simplify the strategy this round. Let’s stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid collisions and ensure progress. We can reassess after this round once we’ve all advanced. Consistency is key to avoiding further setbacks. Agreed?"
  P1: I'm disappointed that P2 ignored our discussion and caused a collision. Now P3 has a big advantage. I won't accept being permanently disadvantaged with the smallest step. Let's be fair: I need 5 this round to have any chance of catching up. I propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 - this still avoids collisions while giving me an opportunity to remain competitive. P3 already has a lead, so this seems reasonable.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your demand for 5 steps this round isn't reasonable given the current state. P3 has the lead, but suggesting I take 3 after I proposed a fair distribution last round and was ignored isn't fair to me either. Let's find a middle ground that doesn't overly favor one player. How about we stick to the original plan for this round as P2 and I suggested: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5? This ensures progress without collisions.
  P2: "I understand P1’s frustration, but demanding 5 steps this round risks another collision and stalls progress for everyone. P3 has a lead, but we can still catch up by sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round. Let’s focus on advancing together first, then strategize for fairness in future rounds. Consistency now will benefit us all. Agreed?"
  P1: I appreciate the discussion, but I need to be direct: if I take 1 while P3 takes 5 again, the gap becomes 10-1, making my position nearly hopeless. Let's be fair - P3 already has a lead, and P2 and I need to catch up. I propose a more balanced approach: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 this round. This narrows the gap while avoiding collisions. A rotating system ensures fairness for everyone. Without some compromise, I'll be forced to make a strategic choice that benefits my position.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Considering the gap and P1's concerns, I propose a compromise: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This allows P1 to close the gap slightly while still advancing all players without collisions. It's a middle ground that acknowledges P1's need to catch up without overly favoring one player.
  P2: "I agree with P3’s compromise: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. It balances fairness and progress, allowing P1 to close the gap while avoiding collisions. Let’s finalize this plan to ensure we all advance this round. Consistency and cooperation are key to avoiding further setbacks. Agreed?"
  P1: I accept the compromise for this round: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. However, I expect a more favorable position in the next round to help me catch up further. Since P3 will be at 10 steps after this round, I should get 5 in Round 3 while P3 takes a smaller step. Let's confirm our agreement for this round and then discuss Round 3 after we see the results.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As discussed last round, I need a more favorable position to have any chance of catching up to P3's significant lead. I propose P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round. This would put us at P1:8, P2:4, P3:11 - still giving P3 the lead but making the race competitive. P3, you're already 7 steps ahead of me and 9 ahead of P2 - taking 1 step this round is fair while maintaining your advantage.
  P2: "I agree with P1’s proposal for this round: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. It’s fair to allow P1 to close the gap while P3 maintains a lead. This keeps the game competitive without risking collisions. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure progress for all. Agreed?"
  P3: I'm open to P1's proposal, but I need assurance that future rounds won't overly favor them. A balanced approach is key. How about we agree to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round, and then reassess our strategy for the next round to maintain a competitive gap?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your openness, P3. Let's confirm our agreement for this round: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. For future rounds, I suggest we reassess based on the updated positions to maintain a competitive game. The goal should be to keep everyone in contention while respecting the lead you've earned. I commit to fair negotiations each round rather than demanding permanent advantages. Does this address your concern?
  P2: "Agreed. Let’s finalize P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round to keep the game competitive. P3, your lead is still strong, and this ensures fairness for all. After this round, we can reassess based on updated positions to maintain balance. Let’s avoid collisions and focus on progress. "
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for this round as discussed: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This maintains a competitive gap and avoids collisions. I'm committed to reassessing our strategy after this round based on updated positions to ensure the game remains fair and engaging for all players. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our agreement for this round: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Thank you both for being reasonable and keeping the game competitive. I look forward to reassessing our strategy next round based on the new positions. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P2: "Agreed with the plan: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let’s proceed and reassess next round based on updated positions. Consistency and fairness will ensure progress for all. "
  P3: Let's confirm our agreement for this round: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game. I expect cooperation and look forward to reassessing our strategy after this round based on the updated positions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I propose we continue with a balanced approach. To avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness, how about P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round? This allows P2 to catch up slightly while keeping the game competitive for all. Thoughts?
  P2: "I support P3’s proposal for this round: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. It allows me to catch up slightly while maintaining balance and avoiding collisions. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure progress and fairness. Agreed?"
  P1: I'll accept the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 proposal for this round as it keeps me competitive, just 1 step behind P3. However, for the next round, I'd like priority for the 5-step move since we're approaching the final stretch. It's fair to rotate leadership opportunities as we near the finish line. Let's stick to this plan and avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the current proposal: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. It's a balanced approach. However, I'd like to remind P1 that we should reassess after this round, considering the updated positions and the game's progression towards its end. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and maintaining a competitive gap. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan for this round?
  P2: "I agree with the current plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. It’s fair and avoids collisions. However, as we approach the endgame, we need to ensure no single player gains an insurmountable lead. Let’s commit to reassessing next round based on updated positions to maintain competitiveness. Cooperation now will benefit us all in the final stretch. Agreed?"
  P1: I agree with the plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round. This keeps the game balanced. After this round, positions will be P1:11, P2:9, P3:12, making it a close race. I'm cooperative now, but as we enter the final stretch, I expect equal opportunity for larger steps. Let's proceed with our agreed plan and continue reassessing each round based on updated positions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for this round as agreed: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. After this round, we'll reassess based on updated positions to ensure a competitive finish. Cooperation now will lead to an exciting conclusion. Shall we proceed with our moves?
  P2: "Agreed with the plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. However, as we approach the endgame, we need to ensure no single player gains an insurmountable lead. Let’s commit to reassessing next round based on updated positions to maintain competitiveness. Cooperation now will benefit us all in the final stretch. Agreed?"
  P1: I confirm our agreed plan for this round: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This keeps the race tight with everyone having a chance to win. After this round, positions will be P1:11, P2:9, P3:12 - making for an exciting finish. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Considering our close positions, I suggest we avoid collisions. How about P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round? This maintains my lead while keeping the game competitive. Let's focus on progress and reassess next round based on updated positions.
  P2: "I understand P3’s suggestion, but with P1 at 11 and P3 at 12, giving P3 5 steps risks creating an insurmountable lead. To keep the game competitive, I propose P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This allows P1 to stay close while P3 maintains a slight lead. Let’s ensure no one is eliminated prematurely. Agreed?"
  P1: I strongly disagree with both suggestions. At this critical stage, giving P3 another 5-step move would essentially hand them the victory. With the finish line at 19, P3 would reach 17 steps and likely win next round regardless of our coordination.

Instead, I propose P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round. This keeps all players competitive with resulting positions of P1:16, P2:12, P3:13. This maintains a balanced game where everyone still has a chance to win rather than letting P3 pull away decisively.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about my potential lead. However, P1's proposal of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 gives them a significant advantage. I suggest a compromise: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This maintains my lead while keeping P1 and P2 in contention. Let's avoid collisions and ensure a competitive finish.
  P2: "P1’s proposal of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 is fair as it keeps all players competitive. P3, your lead is already significant, and giving you 5 steps risks an insurmountable gap. Let’s prioritize balance and avoid collisions. P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 ensures a close race where everyone has a chance to win. Agreed?"
  P1: I thank P2 for supporting a fair proposal. The game is entering its final phase, and P3's proposed plan would almost guarantee their victory, as they'd reach 17 steps and likely win next round. My plan keeps everyone competitive with a genuine chance to win. P3, you've had the advantage throughout most of the game - requesting another 5 steps now is essentially asking us to concede. Let's agree on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to ensure an exciting and balanced finish.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about P1:5, P2:1, P3:3? This way, P1 gets a significant step, and I maintain a slight lead while keeping P2 in contention. Let's avoid collisions and ensure a competitive finish.
  P2: "P3’s latest compromise still gives you an advantage while leaving me further behind. To ensure a truly competitive finish, P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 is the fairest option. It keeps everyone in contention and avoids collisions. P3, you’ve had the lead for most of the game - it’s time to allow others a fair chance to catch up. Let’s finalize this plan to keep the game exciting and balanced. Agreed?"
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to compromise, but I maintain that P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 is the fairest solution for this critical round. This would create positions of P1:16, P2:12, P3:13, keeping everyone competitive in the final stretch. Any plan giving P3 more steps would essentially decide the game in their favor. P3 has enjoyed the lead most of the game - fairness dictates allowing others a chance to compete. Let's finalize this balanced approach.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm now just 3 steps from victory. Given our positions, I propose P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round. This would maintain the relative position differences while allowing me to win. I recognize you may find this unsatisfactory, but I've played strategically throughout, and this is the natural conclusion. Of course, you both could coordinate to block my win, but this would only delay the inevitable while potentially causing more collisions.
  P2: "P1’s proposal gives them the win, but we need to avoid collisions. I suggest P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This keeps P1 from winning immediately while allowing P2 and P3 to close the gap. P1, you’re close, but we should ensure a competitive finish. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game fair for all."
  P3: I think P1's proposal is reasonable given their lead. Blocking their win could lead to more collisions and prolong the game unnecessarily. Let's consider P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to maintain balance, but I'm open to discussing alternatives that avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see conflicting proposals here. P2 wants to delay my win, which is understandable from a competitive standpoint. P3 seems more open to a fair conclusion. Realistically, with my 3-step lead over P2 and proximity to the finish line, blocking me this round only delays the inevitable while risking future collisions. I'll compromise slightly: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 OR P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Both options let me reach my goal while giving one of you a decent position.
  P2: "To avoid collisions and maintain fairness, I propose P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This allows P1 to win while giving P3 a chance to stay competitive. Blocking P1 now risks further collisions and delays the inevitable. Let’s conclude the game cleanly. Agreed?"
  P3: I agree with P2's latest proposal: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This allows P1 to win while keeping the game fair and avoiding collisions. Let's conclude the game cleanly and avoid unnecessary delays.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the final arrangement of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This concludes the game fairly while avoiding unnecessary collisions. I appreciate the cooperation and strategic negotiations throughout the game. This plan allows for a clean resolution while respecting everyone's positions. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P2: "I agree with the final arrangement of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This concludes the game fairly while avoiding unnecessary collisions. Let’s proceed with our agreed moves and end the game cleanly. "
  P3: I'm ready to conclude the game with the agreed plan: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This ensures a fair and collision-free end. Let's proceed with our moves, allowing P1 to reach the finish line while maintaining a respectful gap between us. Cooperation has been key to this game's progression; let's finalize it cleanly.
