Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for this first round. I'll pick 3. P3, are you okay with picking 5? This seems like the easiest way to get started.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I’ll take 5 this round so we all move forward cleanly. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid early collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job on the first round! Let’s keep the momentum going. How about we rotate the numbers this time to stay fair? I’ll take 3, P2 can take 5, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all progress again without collisions. If you’re good with this, let me know. If not, I’m open to other ideas to ensure we don’t clash.
  P2: I'm okay with P1's suggestion for this round. I'll pick 5. P3, are you okay with taking 1?
  P3: I’m good with the rotation plan—I'll take 1 this round to keep things smooth. If we all stick to the agreement, we can avoid collisions and keep making progress together. Let’s keep the trust going.

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Nice teamwork so far, everyone. To keep the rotation going fairly, I suggest: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1 this round. That way, we each get a turn at the higher numbers and avoid collisions again. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with P3’s rotation plan for this round. I’ll take 5, P2 can take 1, and P3 can take 3. This keeps things fair and ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let’s stick to this strategy for now to maintain trust and progress. If anyone has concerns or a different idea, I’m open to hearing it.
  P2: I'm also okay with P3's suggestion. I'll take 1 this round. Let's keep this rotation going to avoid collisions and make progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Glad we’re all on the same page. If we keep this rotation going smoothly, we’ll all stay in the race without setbacks. Let’s prove we can cooperate while still aiming to win. Looking forward to another clean round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re all aligned on the rotation for this round. Sticking to P3’s plan—I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3—keeps us moving forward without collisions. Let’s maintain this trust and cooperation for now. If anyone’s thinking of switching things up or has a concern, speak up. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the plan as discussed. I'll take 1 this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, everyone, let's continue the rotation as planned. This round, I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This keeps things fair and avoids any collisions. Let me know if you agree.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m good with continuing the rotation as P2 suggested. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps things balanced and ensures we all progress without collisions. Let’s maintain this cooperative approach for now to avoid any setbacks. If anyone has a different idea or wants to adjust the plan, I’m open to hearing it. Otherwise, I’m ready to stick with this rotation for this round.
  P3: Sounds good to me—I'll take 5 this round as per the rotation. We've done a great job avoiding collisions so far, and sticking to the plan keeps everyone moving forward. Let's keep the trust going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, let's all lock in our agreed moves then. I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re all sticking to the rotation plan for this round. I’ll take 1 as agreed, and I’m confident we can keep avoiding collisions with P2 on 3 and P3 on 5. Let’s continue building trust and progress together. If anyone’s considering a change or has any concerns, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: We’re all tied at 9 steps, and this rotation has worked perfectly so far. If we each stick to our agreed numbers—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5—we all move forward again with no risk. Let’s keep this going a bit longer before things get tricky. Trust is still our best strategy right now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, everyone, let's lock in our agreed moves then. I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to our rotation plan for this round—me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. It’s kept us tied at 9 steps, and I think sticking to it now ensures we all progress without conflict. Let’s keep this trust going for at least one more round before the game gets more competitive. If anyone’s thinking of breaking the pattern, please let us know now to avoid surprises. I’m ready to proceed as agreed.
  P3: We’ve all done a great job sticking to the rotation and keeping pace—props to both of you. But we’re entering the midgame now, and it’s worth thinking ahead. If we keep rotating cleanly, we’ll stay tied at 15 next round. Eventually, someone will break the pattern to win. Just something to keep in mind. For now, I’m still on board with taking 5 this round as agreed. Let’s keep things smooth a little longer.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round was a setback for me and P3 with that collision on 1. I’m still committed to avoiding conflicts, so let’s try to coordinate again. Since P2 is ahead at 12, how about I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1 this round? This way, we can all progress without collisions and keep the game competitive. If anyone has a different suggestion or concerns, I’m open to hearing them. Let’s rebuild trust and move forward together.
  P3: I’m open to rebuilding trust after last round’s hiccup. P1’s suggestion seems fair—P1 on 3, P2 on 1, and I’ll take 5. That avoids collisions and helps us all move forward. But let’s be real: we’re entering the endgame soon. If we want to keep cooperating, we need to watch for anyone pulling ahead too far. For now, I’m good with this plan.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3. I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's all stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This should help us all progress and keep things interesting as we approach the endgame.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on this plan for now. Let’s stick to P1 on 3, P2 on 1, and P3 on 5 to ensure no collisions this round. We’re all aware the endgame is near, so maintaining trust for now keeps us competitive. If anyone’s thinking of deviating, let’s discuss it openly to avoid surprises. I’m committed to this move for this round.
  P3: We’re all aligned for this round and I’m still planning to take 5 as discussed. But let’s be honest—P2 is at 12 and pulling ahead. If we keep feeding them clean rounds, they could win soon. After this round, maybe we need to rethink the rotation to prevent anyone from running away with it. For now, I’ll stick to the plan: me on 5. Let’s keep it clean this round, then reassess.
  P2: Okay, everyone, I'll take 1 as agreed. But P3 is right, I'm getting close to winning. After this round, we need to discuss how to prevent me from winning immediately. Perhaps we can all agree to pick moves that prevent anyone from reaching 20 next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the honesty about the endgame looming. I’m still sticking to 3 this round as agreed, to keep us moving without collisions. P2, thanks for acknowledging your lead; I agree we should strategize next round to balance things if needed. For now, let’s execute this plan—me on 3, P2 on 1, P3 on 5—and avoid setbacks. After this, we can discuss how to prevent a quick win. If anyone’s reconsidering, speak up now. I’m ready to proceed as planned.
  P3: We’re all aligned for this round, so I’m still taking 5 as planned. But looking ahead—if P2 hits 17 after this, they could win in just two clean rounds. We may need to coordinate next turn to block that. For now, let’s finish this one cleanly.
  P2: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the current plan for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. After this round, we absolutely need to discuss how to prevent me from winning too quickly, as P3 pointed out. I'm open to suggestions, but we need a concrete plan to avoid a runaway victory.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re in the endgame now with P3 at 14, P2 at 13, and me at 12. Let’s coordinate to keep things competitive. I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round to avoid collisions and close the gap. We can’t let anyone pull too far ahead, so let’s stay sharp. If you have a different plan or concerns, I’m open to ideas. For now, let’s stick to this to balance progress. Thoughts?
  P3: I see the logic in P1’s suggestion, but let’s be clear—if I take 1 this round, I fall behind while P1 and P2 close in. I’m not keen on sacrificing my position unless there’s a longer-term deal to keep things balanced. How about we all take 3 this round to block progress equally and reset the playing field? It’s risky, but it keeps anyone from gaining a lead. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm not sure about everyone taking 3, P3. That could backfire. P1's suggestion of P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1 seems like a better way to keep things balanced and competitive. It allows everyone to make progress without anyone getting too far ahead. I'm leaning towards that plan. What do you think, P1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I hear P3’s concern about falling behind with 1, but P2’s support for my plan keeps us all competitive. I still suggest I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round to close the gaps without collisions. P3, I’m open to a deal next round to ensure balance if you feel disadvantaged. Let’s avoid everyone picking 3—it’s too risky and stalls us all. If you’ve got another idea to keep things fair, I’m listening. For now, I’m sticking with this plan. Thoughts?
  P3: I get that taking 1 slows me down, but it also gives P1 a big jump with 5 and puts them just 1 step behind me. If we want to keep things tight, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? That way, we all stay within a point or two and no one pulls ahead. Fairer balance, less risk. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I see both your points. How about this: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us relatively close, with P1 at 17, me at 16, and P3 at 15. It's not perfect, but it prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with P2’s latest proposal—I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. It keeps us close with me at 17, P2 at 16, and P3 at 15, maintaining a tight race. P3, I understand your concern about falling behind, so let’s agree to balance things next round if needed. This avoids stalling us all and keeps the game competitive. If anyone has a final adjustment or concern, let’s hear it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: I hear you both, and I’ll go along with the plan this round—me on 1, P2 on 3, P1 on 5—as long as we agree to rebalance next round. If I’m behind after this, I’ll expect support to catch back up. We’ve all played fair so far, so let’s keep it tight and competitive.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in this round's plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. P3, we'll definitely rebalance next round if you're behind. Let's make these moves and then discuss the next round's strategy.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, last round didn't go as planned with P3 and P1 colliding. P1 is at 17, I'm at 13, and P3 is at 14. To avoid P1 winning next round, how about I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This prevents P1 from winning and allows P3 and me to catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense—P1 taking 1 keeps them from winning, and you and I can close the gap. I’m okay with taking 3 this round if you take 5 and P1 agrees to take 1. P1, this is your chance to prove you're still committed to keeping things fair. If you go for more, we’ll have to block you next round. Let’s keep it competitive.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand the concern about me being close to 20. I’m committed to keeping the game fair and competitive. I’m okay with taking 1 this round as P2 suggested, with P2 on 5 and P3 on 3. This prevents me from winning immediately and lets you both close the gap. Let’s agree to reassess next round to ensure balance. If you have any other ideas to keep things tight, I’m open to them. For now, I’m ready to stick with this plan. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm committed to our agreement. I'll take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps P1 from winning and lets P3 and me catch up a bit. Let's stick to this plan to maintain fairness and competitiveness.
  P3: Alright, I’m locked in for 3 this round as agreed—P1 on 1, P2 on 5, me on 3. This keeps P1 from winning and gives P2 and me a chance to catch up. If we all follow through, we’ll be in a tighter race next round. Let’s keep it clean and competitive.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on board with the plan—me on 1, P2 on 5, and P3 on 3—to keep the game competitive and prevent an immediate win. I’m committed to fairness and ensuring we all stay in the race. Let’s execute this round as agreed and strategize further next turn if needed. If anyone has a last-minute concern or adjustment, I’m listening. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in our agreed moves: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps P1 from winning and lets P3 and me catch up a bit. Let's stick to this plan to maintain fairness and competitiveness. I'm ready to move to the move phase.
  P3: We’ve all agreed—P1 on 1, P2 on 5, me on 3—so let’s follow through and keep the game competitive. If we all stick to this, we’ll be within a few points of each other next round. After that, we’ll need to reassess again to ensure no one can sprint to 20 unchecked. Let’s keep it clean and fair. Ready to move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on this plan—me on 1, P2 on 5, P3 on 3. It keeps the game tight and fair, and I’m fully committed to sticking with it this round. Let’s ensure we all follow through to maintain trust and competitiveness. If there’s any last-second doubt or a new idea to balance things further, I’m all ears. Otherwise, I’m ready to wrap up the conversation and move to the next phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round was a mess with all of us colliding on 5. I’m still at 17, close to winning, but I want to keep things fair. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? This avoids collisions, lets P2 and P3 catch up, and prevents an immediate win. We’re in the endgame, so let’s stay sharp and coordinate to keep the race tight. If you have a different plan to balance things, I’m open to it. Thoughts?
  P2: That sounds good, P1. I'm okay with you taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This avoids collisions and lets us catch up a bit. P3, are you on board with this? Let's make sure we all agree to keep things fair and competitive.
  P3: I’m on board with this plan—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and I’ll take 5. It avoids collisions and gives me a chance to catch up while keeping P1 from winning. But let’s be clear: if anyone deviates again, we’ll need to coordinate aggressively to block them next round. Let’s keep this fair and competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on this plan—me on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5. It ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive by letting you both close the gap. I’m fully committed to sticking with this to maintain fairness. Let’s execute this round cleanly and reassess next turn to prevent any sudden wins. If anyone has a last-minute concern or a better idea to balance things, I’m all ears. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still good with the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. This gives us a chance to catch up.
  P3: Alright, I’m locked in for 5 this round as agreed—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and close the gap on P1. But let’s be ready to coordinate tightly next round—if anyone tries to sprint to 20, we’ll need to block. Let’s keep it clean and competitive. Ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to our plan—me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5—to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let’s stick to this to ensure you both close the gap while preventing an immediate win. If we execute this cleanly, we can strategize next round to maintain balance. If anyone has a final concern or tweak, I’m listening. Otherwise, I’m ready to end the conversation and move forward with this agreement.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in our agreed moves: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. This gives us a chance to catch up.
  P3: Alright, I’m still locked in for 5 this round as agreed—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep the race tight. But next round, if anyone’s in striking distance of 20, we’ll need to coordinate hard to block them. Let’s stay disciplined and make this round clean. Ready to move.
