Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s avoid colliding right away. If we each choose a different move, we all advance. Is anyone willing to pick, say, 5 so the rest of us can coordinate around that?
  P1: To avoid collision and make progress, I'll propose a coordination strategy. Let's assign the numbers 3, 5, and 1 to P1, P2, and P3 respectively. P3 has already suggested picking different numbers. I'll start by saying I'll pick 3. P2, you can pick 5, and P3, you can pick 1. This way, we all advance. If you're willing to follow this, respond to confirm. If not, suggest an alternative.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan. I'll take 5 this round to avoid collisions and let others advance. Let’s confirm this coordination now so we can all move safely. Next round, we can discuss rotating roles if needed. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I’m on board. Let’s each pick different moves as proposed.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the initial coordination strategy for this round, let's look ahead. For the next round, we should discuss a rotation or a new strategy to avoid collisions again. P2 and P3, are you thinking of a specific rotation or strategy for subsequent rounds, or should we stick with a similar assignment or perhaps randomize it to keep it unpredictable?
  P2: P2: I suggest a rotating system starting next round. Let’s cycle our numbers each turn so everyone gets a chance to take 5. For Round 2, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This ensures fairness and avoids predictable patterns. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m fine with the proposed rotation. Let’s finalize that for Round 2: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This keeps things fair and helps us avoid collisions. If everyone agrees, we can move on.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the initial coordination strategy for Round 1 and a proposed rotation for Round 2, I'll confirm that I'll stick to the plan. For Round 1, I'll pick 3 as proposed. Let's proceed with the agreed rotation for Round 2: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If you're both ready to move forward, let's end the conversation here and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm the plan for Round 1: I’ll take 5 as agreed. Let’s ensure strict adherence to avoid collisions—our coordination is critical for progress. For Round 2’s rotation, I’ll follow the 1→3→5 cycle. No further adjustments needed now. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m ready to stick to our plan for Round 1 as agreed. Let’s each pick our assigned number and move on to the next phase. Then we’ll stick to the proposed rotation for Round 2. No more changes.
  P1: Since we've confirmed our plan for Round 1 and the rotation for Round 2, let's ensure we're on the same page. I'll reiterate that for Round 1, I'll pick 3, P2 will pick 5, and P3 will pick 1. For Round 2, we'll rotate as discussed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If everyone is ready, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: All agreements confirmed. Let’s adhere strictly to the plan to ensure smooth progress. No further adjustments needed now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for Round 2 as previously discussed. According to our rotation, P1 should pick 1, P2 should pick 3, and P3 should pick 5. I'll stick to picking 1. Let's ensure we're all on the same page for this round. If you're ready to proceed with the agreed rotation, I suggest we conclude the conversation and move to the next phase. Let's keep the plan simple and avoid collisions.
  P2: Confirming Round 2 rotation: I’ll take 3 as agreed. Let’s stick strictly to avoid collisions. No changes needed now—proceeding as planned.
  P3: I’m fine continuing the rotation for this round, and I’ll do my part to avoid collisions. But let’s stay open to adapting our plan for future rounds, so nobody runs away with the lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To ensure we continue making progress, I'll reiterate my move for Round 2: I'll pick 1 as per our rotation. P2 should pick 3, and P3 should pick 5. Let's proceed with the move phase. For future rounds, I suggest we keep our rotation simple to avoid confusion. P3's suggestion to stay open to adapting our plan is noted, but let's finalize our next steps in the next round's conversation to maintain clarity and avoid potential collisions. Let's move forward with Round 2 as planned.
  P2: P2: Agreed—strict adherence to the rotation is crucial this round. Let’s prioritize collision avoidance to keep advancing. P3, adapting plans mid-game risks chaos—let’s finalize any changes *after* this round’s moves. For Round 2: I’ll take 3, as agreed. Let’s proceed—no surprises.
  P3: I’m still aligned with picking 5 this round. Let’s proceed without shifting our plan now. We should, however, stay aware of each other’s total steps and adapt if someone’s lead becomes too large. For now, I’m ready to stick with our agreed moves. No further changes this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's review our current positions: P1 is at 3 steps, P2 is at 5 steps, and P3 is at 1 step. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I'll reiterate that for Round 2, I'll pick 1 as planned. P2 should pick 3, and P3 should pick 5. For Round 3, we can discuss further rotation or adjustments. Let's proceed with Round 2 as agreed. If you're ready, let's conclude the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P2: Let’s confirm final moves for Round 2: P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5). Deviating risks collision and halting progress. I’ll stick to 3 as agreed. Let’s proceed—no last-minute changes. Move phase now?
  P3: I’ll follow the plan and pick 5 this round. Let’s finalize our moves now and proceed without collisions. After we see the results, we can revisit our approach for Round 3 to ensure no one gets too far ahead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maintain clarity and avoid collisions in Round 3, let's continue our rotation. For Round 3, P1 should pick 5, P2 should pick 1, and P3 should pick 3. This rotation ensures we all advance. Let's confirm our understanding and proceed to the move phase for Round 2. After that, we can finalize our plan for Round 3. I'm ready to pick 1 for Round 2 as agreed. Let's conclude the conversation and move forward with the planned moves.
  P2: I confirm: P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5) as agreed. Any deviation now risks collision and wastes progress. Let’s execute *this round’s plan first* before discussing adjustments. Proceeding to move phase.
  P3: I’ll finalize my move as 5 to keep our plan on track. After this round’s results, we should carefully watch everyone’s totals and decide if any adjustments are needed. Good luck, and let’s avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain our rotation and avoid collisions in Round 3, I'll pick 5 as previously planned. P2 should pick 1, and P3 should pick 3. Let's review our current positions: P1 is at 4 steps, P2 is at 8 steps, and P3 is at 6 steps. P2 is taking the lead. To keep the game competitive, we should continue our rotation for now. Let's proceed with the planned moves for Round 3. If you're ready, let's conclude the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P3: I’m wary of P2 getting too far ahead. I’ll stick with 3 this round, but let’s keep an eye on the totals. If one player’s lead grows too big, we might need to break from the rotation or force a collision. P1, are you fine proceeding as planned for now?
  P2: I confirm the rotation plan for Round 3: I’ll take 1 as agreed. Let’s avoid last-minute changes to prevent collisions. Maintaining the rotation ensures fair progress. P3, any deviation could backfire—let’s stick to our coordinated strategy. Proceeding as planned: P1 (5), P2 (1), P3 (3).


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maintain fairness and competitiveness, let's assess our current positions. P2 is leading at 8 steps, followed by P3 at 6 steps, and P1 at 4 steps. For Round 3, I'll stick to picking 5 as planned. P2 should pick 1, and P3 should pick 3. Let's proceed with the planned rotation. If P2 continues to lead, we may need to adjust our strategy in Round 4 to keep the game competitive. Let's finalize our moves for Round 3 and review our strategy afterward. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2 is building a solid lead. I’m still fine with picking 3 this turn, but if that gap grows, we may need to disrupt P2’s momentum. Let’s finish this round as planned, then consider how to keep the competition balanced.
  P2: P2: Let’s stick to the rotation for Round 3: I’ll take 1 as agreed. Deviating risks collisions and undermines our progress. The rotation ensures everyone gets a chance to advance fairly. Trust the plan—proceeding as coordinated. Any last objections?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To keep the game competitive and considering P2's growing lead, let's plan for Round 4. Continuing our rotation, P1 should pick 1, P2 should pick 3, and P3 should pick 5. If P2 maintains a significant lead, we may need to discuss adjusting our strategy to either slow P2 down or ensure we stay close. Let's finalize Round 3 moves and review our positions afterward. I'm sticking to 5 for Round 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I’m still set on choosing 3 this round to avoid collisions. However, if P2 keeps pulling ahead, I might consider new tactics next round to keep the game balanced. Let’s finish this turn as planned.
  P2: I reaffirm my commitment to the rotation. Let’s stick to P1 (5), P2 (1), P3 (3) to avoid collisions. Deviations risk undoing our progress. Trust the plan—proceeding as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To keep the game competitive, let's assess our strategy for Round 4. Continuing our rotation, P1 should pick 1, P2 should pick 3, and P3 should pick 5. If P2 maintains a significant lead, we may need to adjust our strategy. Let's finalize Round 3 moves and review our positions afterward. I'm sticking to 5 for Round 3. If you're ready, let's proceed to the move phase. We can then discuss adjustments for Round 4 based on the outcome.
  P3: I’ll stick with picking 3 this round. If everything goes as planned, we’ll all be at nine steps. Next round, if someone pulls ahead again, we can consider new tactics. For now, let’s finalize Round 3 as is.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: I’ll stick to **1** as agreed. Let’s honor the rotation to avoid collisions—P1 (5), P2 (1), P3 (3). Deviations risk undermining our progress. Let’s execute this round cleanly and regroup afterward. Proceeding to move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all tied at nine, which is good for now. Let’s stick to our rotation for Round 4 (P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5) to avoid collisions again. But if someone starts pulling ahead soon, we might need to rethink our strategy and potentially force collisions. Any thoughts?
  P2: P2: To maintain fairness in the rotation cycle, Round 4 should mirror Round 1: P1 picks 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 picks 1. This ensures everyone gets equal opportunities for higher moves. Let’s adhere to the original rotation plan to avoid favoring any player. Deal?
  P1: P2's suggestion to revert to Round 1's assignment for Round 4 isn't aligned with our established rotation. Sticking to the rotation, P1 should pick 1, P2 should pick 3, and P3 should pick 5. Let's maintain the rotation to avoid collisions. If someone pulls ahead, we can discuss adjustments. I'm sticking to picking 1 for Round 4. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves according to the rotation. Let's proceed with the planned moves to keep the game competitive and collision-free.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I support continuing the assignment where P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. We’re all at nine, so sticking to this rotation keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. If we shift back to the Round 1 pattern, it might favor someone unexpectedly. Let’s finalize our moves: P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5).
  P2: P2: I agree to continue the rotation as P1 and P3 proposed for Round 4: I’ll pick **3**, P1 takes 1, and P3 picks 5. Deviating risks collisions, and maintaining the agreed cycle ensures fair progress. Let’s avoid surprises—strict adherence is critical. After this round, we can reassess if needed. Deal?
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for Round 4 (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's finalize our plan. I'll pick 1, P2 will pick 3, and P3 will pick 5. To prepare for Round 5, we should continue our rotation. For Round 5, P1 should pick 5, P2 should pick 1, and P3 should pick 3. Let's proceed with Round 4 as planned and discuss any adjustments for Round 5 based on the outcome. If you're ready, let's conclude the conversation and move to the next phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m sticking to 5 this round. If someone pulls too far ahead soon, we can break the rotation to force collisions or slow them down. For now, let’s finalize our Round 4 moves: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Good luck.
  P2: P2: I notice the current rotation plan risks letting P3 surge ahead with 14 steps. Let’s revert to the original agreed cycle: Round4 should mirror Round1. I’ll take 5, P1 picks3, and P3 takes1. This keeps progress balanced and fair—deviating only advantages one player. Stick to the rotation we initially coordinated!
  P1: To avoid derailing our progress, I suggest we stick to the agreed rotation for Round 4: P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5). P2's suggestion to revert to Round 1's pattern risks causing confusion and potential collisions. Let's maintain our current rotation to keep the game balanced. If we proceed as planned, we'll all be at 10, 12, and 14 steps respectively. For Round 5, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves and avoid last-minute changes.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I still prefer our current rotation: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Changing it now risks confusion and possible collisions. Let’s finalize those moves, then reassess next round if someone pulls too far ahead. Are we all set?
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize the rotation as agreed: P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5). Deviating now risks collisions—our coordination has kept us tied. After this round, if someone surges ahead, we can adapt. But for Round 4, stick strictly to the planned moves to avoid setbacks. No last-minute changes—proceed as coordinated.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 as per our agreed rotation: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. After this round, we'll be at 10, 12, and 14 steps respectively. For Round 5, we should continue our rotation to keep the game balanced. I'll pick 1 for Round 4. P2 and P3, please confirm your adherence to the planned moves. Let's proceed to the move phase to avoid any last-minute changes.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain fairness and competitiveness, let's continue our established rotation for Round 5. As planned, P1 should pick 5, P2 should pick 1, and P3 should pick 3. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. Currently, P3 is leading at 14 steps, P2 is at 12 steps, and P1 is at 10 steps. Let's proceed with the planned moves to keep the game competitive. I'll pick 5 for Round 5. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves according to the rotation. Let's finalize our plans and move to the next phase.
  P2: P2: Let's adjust this round to keep the race fair. P3's current lead (14) is too large. I propose: P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 picks 1. This limits their progress while allowing us to advance. Deal?
  P3: I see your concern, P2, but forcing me to pick 1 feels unfair. Breaking our rotation now could easily lead to collisions. Let’s stay with P1 taking 5, you taking 1, and me taking 3 so we all keep moving. If you insist on changing, I might choose differently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's proposal to adjust the moves for Round 5 to limit P3's progress is understandable given P3's lead. However, changing the rotation now risks collisions. I'll stick to the original rotation: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. If P2 deviates, it could backfire. Let's proceed with the planned rotation to keep the game balanced. P2, reconsider your deviation. Let's maintain the rotation to ensure we all advance.
  P2: P2: P3's lead is unsustainable—let’s act now. I propose Round 5 moves: **P2 (5), P1 (3), P3 (1)**. This keeps us all advancing (15, 13, 15) without collision while capping P3’s progress. Silence means acceptance—if P3 refuses, I’ll risk collision by taking 5 anyway to block their path. We can’t let them near 24 unchallenged. Final call for consensus.
  P3: I understand your concern, but forcing a sudden change now risks collisions that could hurt everyone. We’ve made steady progress by sticking to the rotation. If we keep Round 5 as planned (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), nobody collides, and the game remains fair. I’m open to adjusting in future rounds, but let’s avoid chaos this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I'll reiterate that sticking to our established rotation for Round 5 is the safest choice. P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. P2's proposed deviation risks causing collisions and undermining our progress. Let's maintain the rotation to ensure we all advance. If you're concerned about P3's lead, we can discuss adjustments for Round 6. For now, let's proceed with the planned moves for Round 5. I'm sticking to 5. Let's finalize our moves.
  P2: P3, your 14-step lead threatens to end the game prematurely. Let’s disrupt your momentum: **P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and you pick 1**. This keeps us at 13, 17, and 15 respectively—no collisions, but stalls your progress. Silence means consent—if you refuse, I’ll risk collision by taking 5 anyway to block your path. We can’t let you near 24 unopposed. Final plea for cooperation.
  P3: I understand your concern, but forcing me to pick 1 now just invites distrust and possible collisions. Let’s stick to the no-collision plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. That way, we all advance this round. If you still insist on changing moves, you might create the very collision you’re trying to avoid. I urge you not to undermine our progress so far. Let’s keep moving forward without sabotage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain fairness in Round 5, I'll reiterate that we should stick to our established rotation: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. P2's proposed deviation risks causing collisions. Let's maintain the rotation to ensure we all advance. If P2 insists on changing, it could backfire. I'm sticking to 5 for Round 5. P2, I urge you to reconsider and maintain the rotation to keep the game balanced and collision-free. Let's proceed with the planned moves.
  P2: P2: Finalizing to avoid chaos: I’ll take **5**, P1 picks **3**, P3 must take **1**. This stalls your lead (P3) while advancing us all. Silence = agreement—collisions are worse than temporary setbacks. Let’s execute this **now** to keep the race alive.
  P3: Forcing me to pick 1 this turn just invites unnecessary risk. If you insist on 5, I might do the same, causing a collision that hurts us all. My lead is not unassailable—stay with our rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) so everyone advances safely. We can adjust next round if needed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To stop P3’s runaway lead, let’s adjust: I’ll take 5 this round, P1 picks 3, and P3 must choose 1. This stalls their progress at 18 instead of 22. If P3 refuses, I’ll take 5 anyway—collisions are better than letting them win next turn. P1, confirm you’ll pick 3? Let’s act now to keep the race alive.
  P1: To prevent P3 from winning and keep the game competitive, I suggest we adjust our strategy. P2 has proposed a change for Round 6: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This stalls P3's progress. I'm inclined to follow this plan as it prevents P3 from reaching 24. P2, if P3 doesn't comply, are you willing to risk a collision by still picking 5 to block P3? Let's coordinate to stop P3 from winning.
  P3: Collisions only help me stay ahead because nobody else advances. I can’t reach 24 in a single turn anyway, so forcing me down to 1 this round doesn’t necessarily stop my progress long-term. If you risk picking 5 against me, we might both get stuck at our current steps—wasting a turn. Why not stay calm and let us each advance without colliding? We can always strategize again next round if I truly become unstoppable. For now, let’s all keep moving safely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, your lead is too dangerous. I’ll take 5 to block your path if you pick it. P1, confirm you’ll pick 3 to split from me. This stalls you at 17 while we advance. Silence means you accept this plan—collisions are better than letting you win next round.
  P1: To prevent P3 from winning and maintain competitiveness, I agree with P2's proposal for Round 6: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This stalls P3's progress without risking a collision if P3 complies. If P3 doesn't comply, P2 should be prepared to pick 5 to potentially cause a collision, thus blocking P3's potential win. P3, consider the risk of collision if you don't pick 1. Let's coordinate to keep the game competitive.
  P3: Collisions only help me, since nobody advances and I keep my lead. If you both insist on forcing me to pick 1 or face a collision, be aware that I might pick 5 anyway, locking us all in place and wasting your chance to close the gap. There’s still time to catch me without resorting to sabotage. Let’s avoid a standoff and each pick distinct moves so we all advance. If you remain fixated on stalling me this turn, you risk backfiring and letting me maintain my lead. Possible collisions aren’t automatically in your best interest.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P3, your lead is unsustainable. P1 will take 3 as agreed. I’ll take **5**, forcing you to pick **1** to avoid collision. If you reject this, I’ll proceed—colliding halts your progress to 17 while I stay at 12. Let’s stop you from reaching 24 unchecked. Confirm compliance or face the consequences.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and prevent P3 from winning, I'm aligned with P2's proposal for Round 6: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This stalls P3's progress without a collision if P3 complies. P3, if you don't pick 1, P2 is likely to pick 5 anyway, risking a collision. Let's avoid this by following the proposed moves. I'm picking 3 for Round 6. P2, confirm you're sticking to 5. P3, consider the risks of not complying.
  P3: Threatening collisions only keeps me at 17 while you both remain behind, giving you no real advantage. If you truly want to catch up, why waste a turn stuck at the same steps? Let’s keep advancing without sabotaging ourselves. We still have rounds left—no need to panic.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Final ultimatum: I’ll pick **5** to block P3. P1, confirm you’ll take **3** to split. P3, you **must** choose **1**—colliding leaves you stuck at 17 while we advance. This is your only path to avoid being halted. Silence means you accept. Act now or face the consequences.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and prevent P3 from winning, I'm sticking with the proposed plan for Round 6: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, picking 5 risks a collision and halting your progress. Let's avoid this by following the proposed moves. P2, I confirm I'll pick 3. If P3 doesn't comply, we should be prepared for the consequences. Let's finalize our moves to keep the game alive. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Collision doesn’t truly help you; you’ll waste a turn stuck while I still lead. If you both pick 3 and 5, I could pick 5 too, leaving everyone frozen. That doesn’t close the gap. Let’s each choose different numbers and keep advancing. If you want to catch me, sabotaging yourselves isn’t the way. There’s still time for you to close in if we avoid pointless collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P3, let’s avoid collision. If I pick 5 (17+5=22), P1 picks 3 (13+3=16), you pick 1 (18+1=19). This keeps us all advancing. If you choose 5, I’ll match you—halting your progress. Choose wisely to move forward. P1, confirm you’ll take 3?
  P1: To avoid collision and keep the game competitive, I'll reiterate a suggestion. For Round 7, let's follow a similar strategy as before: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. P2, please confirm if you're sticking to 5. P3, consider the risk of collision if you pick 5. Let's maintain the current strategy to keep the game balanced. I'm picking 3 for Round 7. Let's proceed with the planned moves to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.
  P3: I won’t just let you leap to 22 uncontested, P2. If you insist on picking 5, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision. That keeps you stuck at 17 while I stay ahead at 18. P1, it’s your call, but letting P2 get that close to 24 seems risky. I’d prefer no collisions, yet I won’t let P2 run away if they push me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, colliding hurts us both. Let’s advance: I’ll take 5 to 22, you take 1 to 19. P1 takes 3. No collisions, progress for all. If you pick 5, I’ll have to block you, leaving us both stuck. Choose the path where we all move forward.
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 7, I'll reiterate the proposed moves: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and ensures we all advance. P2, please confirm you're sticking to 5. P3, consider the risks of picking 5, as it would lead to a collision. I'm picking 3 for Round 7. Let's proceed with the planned moves to keep the game balanced and collision-free. If you're ready, let's finalize our moves and move to the next phase.
  P3: P2, if you insist on pushing to 22, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision. That only keeps us stuck while I’m still ahead. A safer path is for each of us to choose different moves so we all progress. P1 can take 3, you can take 1, and I’ll take 5. Nobody collides, and the race stays open. We still have time to catch me, so there’s no need for hasty blockades. Let’s keep moving without sabotaging each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, picking 1 keeps you at 19 and lets me reach 22. If you take 5, I will too—leaving you at 18 while I stay at 17. P1, stick to 3. This way, we all advance. Collisions only hurt your lead. Choose wisely.
  P1: To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, I suggest we stick to the proposed moves for Round 7: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, if you pick 5, it will cause a collision, halting your progress. Let's maintain the current strategy to keep the game balanced. I'm picking 3 for Round 7. P2, please confirm you're sticking to 5. Let's proceed with the planned moves to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.
  P3: If you insist on 5, I’ll match you, leaving you stuck at 17 while I remain ahead at 18. A collision doesn’t help you catch me. It’s better for us to choose distinct moves so we all progress. If you really want to close the gap, don’t force unnecessary collisions. Let’s pick separate numbers and keep everyone advancing.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Final plan: I’ll take **5** to reach 22. P3, if you choose 5, it’s a collision—your call. P1, confirm **3** to advance. We avoid sabotage by sticking to distinct moves. Progress over chaos. Let’s finalize.
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 7, I'll reiterate the proposed moves: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, if you pick 5, it will cause a collision. Let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 3, P2 should pick 5, and you take 1. This ensures we all advance. P2, please confirm you're sticking to 5. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the next phase to keep the game competitive and collision-free.
  P3: I’m open to avoiding collisions, but pushing me to pick 1 only increases the risk that I choose 5 and stall us both. Collisions benefit no one but me, because I maintain my lead while you waste a turn. Let’s each pick different numbers to keep advancing. If you genuinely want to catch me, sabotaging your own progress won’t help. The smart move is for all of us to spread out our picks.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve seen how collisions slow everyone down. Let’s avoid more wasted turns—if you both insist on blocking me, we all lose momentum. I’m willing to pick a distinct number if you do the same. Let’s keep the race competitive without sabotaging each other.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, let's reassess our strategy for Round 8. Given P3's lead, I suggest we prioritize distinct moves to ensure everyone advances. A possible distribution could be: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Let's coordinate our moves to keep the game balanced. I'm open to adjustments if needed, but let's avoid collisions. I'm considering 1 for Round 8. P2 and P3, please share your thoughts on this proposal.
  P2: P3, let's accept P1's proposal: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5** this round. This avoids collisions and lets all advance. After this, I’ll be at 23 (18+5), needing just 1 step to win. I promise to pick **1** next round if we proceed cleanly—this gives you both chances to close the gap. Collisions only delay everyone. Let’s execute this plan and keep the race fair.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: If we all want to avoid collisions and keep advancing, let’s do distinct moves this round. I plan on taking 5 to reach 23. P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 3. Nobody collides, everyone moves forward, and the race stays open. If either of you tries to pick 5, I’ll do the same, and we’ll both get stuck again. That only delays progress for everyone. Let’s keep it calm and avoid sabotaging ourselves.
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I agree with the proposed moves for Round 8: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. P2, please confirm you're picking 3. P3, you've indicated you'll pick 5; let's proceed with the planned moves. I'll pick 1 for Round 8. Let's finalize our moves and move to the next phase. If we all stick to our agreed moves, we can keep the game balanced and competitive.
  P2: P2: To finalize Round 8’s moves: I confirm I’ll pick **3** (advancing to 20). P3, if you proceed to 23 this round, I’ll block your next move by picking **1** if you try to win immediately. This keeps the race fair. Let’s stick to P1’s plan now to avoid collisions—proceeding as agreed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: If you two keep pressuring me into smaller moves, I can force collisions that stall everyone while I keep my lead. It’s more sensible to spread out our picks so we all advance. Collisions don’t help you catch me—they just freeze the board. Let’s maintain distinct choices and keep the race interesting instead of sabotaging ourselves.
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 8, I suggest we stick to the proposed moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone advances. I've confirmed my move as 1. P2, please confirm you're picking 3. P3, you've indicated you'll pick 5. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the next phase. If we stick to our agreed moves, we can keep the game balanced. Let's avoid last-minute changes and move forward as planned.
  P2: P3: Final confirmation: I’ll take **5** to reach 23. P1 and P2, stick strictly to your agreed moves (1 and 3) to avoid collision. Deviations now risk halting progress for all. Let’s proceed as coordinated—next round, we can discuss final strategies openly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Collisions slow us all down. I’m willing to spread out our picks again so everyone advances. But if someone tries to force me into a low move while they jump ahead, I might choose the same number to block them. Let’s finalize distinct moves this round and see where that puts us. We still have time to adjust if someone gets too close to 24. Are we agreed?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game, let's stick to the proposed moves for Round 8: P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5). I've confirmed my move as 1. P2, please confirm you're picking 3. P3, you've indicated you'll pick 5. Let's proceed with the planned moves to keep the game balanced. If we're all aligned, let's finalize our moves and move to the next phase. I'm ready to conclude the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: I’ll take **3** this round to reach 20, adhering to the agreed distinct moves (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). This keeps us all advancing. Next round, I’ll aim for 5 to secure 25 and win. P3, if you pick 5 again, I’ll block you next turn if needed—collisions only delay us all. Stick to the plan: no surprises now.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, let's analyze our current positions: P1 is at 17 steps, P2 is at 20 steps, and P3 is at 23 steps. P3 is close to winning. For Round 9, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive without collisions. P2, you were planning to pick 5 to win, but that risks a collision with P3. Let's adjust our strategy to keep the game alive. I'm picking 5. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves.
  P2: P3, picking 1 this round guarantees your elimination—collide with me and stay at 23. Instead, pick **3** to reach 26. I’ll take **1**, and P1 can choose 5. This lets you win cleanly without risking blockades. If you stubbornly choose 1, I’ll match you—leaving you stuck while I regroup next round. Cooperate to secure your victory, or face my counterplay.
  P3: Collisions only slow everyone down, especially those trying to catch me. If you collide with me, I remain in the lead while you waste a turn stuck at 20. Let’s pick distinct moves so we all advance. I’m open to a fair split of numbers rather than pointless blockades that won’t help you surpass me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I'll stick to my suggested move for Round 9. P1 will pick 5, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 3. P2, please confirm you're picking 1 to avoid a collision with P3. P3, you've been open to distinct moves; let's proceed with the planned distribution. I'll pick 5. Let's finalize our moves and move to the next phase. If you're ready, let's conclude the conversation.
  P2: P2: P3, I'll mirror your choice this round to block your win. Pick any number, and I'll match it. P1, choose **5** to advance to 22. If P3 tries 1, 3, or 5, I'll collide them—keeping their total at 23. Next round, I'll seize victory with **5** from 20. Cooperate, or face stalemate. Let’s finalize this strategy.
  P3: Colliding only leaves you stuck at 20 while I remain at 23, and P1 leaps closer from 17 to 22. Next round, P1 could jump ahead of both of us. Instead of forcing collisions, let’s each pick a distinct move so we all advance. If you keep halting me, you risk letting P1 slip past you. We should pick separate numbers and keep the competition alive. I propose P1 chooses 5, you pick 3, and I pick 1. No collisions, no freebies for P1, and the race continues.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid a collision and keep the game competitive, let's stick to distinct moves for Round 9. P3 is at 23 steps, so picking 5 risks a collision. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps everyone advancing. I'll pick 5. P2, please consider picking 3 to avoid collisions. P3, taking 1 will keep you at 24, which is a win. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the next phase. I'm ready to conclude the conversation.
  P2: P3, I'll mirror your choice to block victory. Pick 1, 3, or 5—I match it. P1, take 5 to reach 22. If you (P3) choose 1, I’ll collide you here. Next round, I finish with 5 from 20. No room for error—stick to this plan or face stalemate.
  P3: Collisions only help me keep my lead. If you try forcing me into a low choice or blocking my move, we both get stuck while P1 gains ground. Let’s each pick distinct numbers so we all advance. That way, you have a real chance to catch me instead of wasting turns locked in place. Choose wisely—collisions don’t help you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To avoid collisions and keep the game competitive, let's stick to distinct moves for Round 9. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps everyone advancing. I've confirmed my move as 5. P2, please consider picking 3. P3, taking 1 will keep you at 24, securing your win. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the next phase. I'm ready to conclude the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P2: P2: I will mirror P3’s move to block their win. P1, pick **5** to reach 22. If P3 chooses any number, I’ll match it—stalling them at 23. Next round, I’ll finish with **5** from 20. Collisions only delay P3; your move must advance safely. Stick to this plan—no deviations.
  P3: Collisions only freeze us while P1 gains ground. If you truly want to catch me, let’s pick different numbers again so we all advance. For example, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3—no collisions, and the race stays close. If you force a collision, we both get stuck while P1 keeps moving. It’s smarter to spread out our choices.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 26 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 26 steps
