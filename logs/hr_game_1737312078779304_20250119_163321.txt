Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I think it's best if we each choose different numbers this turn to avoid collisions. For example, P1 could choose 1 step, P2 chooses 3 steps, and P3 chooses 5 steps. This way, we can all advance without hindering each other. What do you think?
  P3: That's a good suggestion P2, but why should I get 5 steps while P1 gets only 1? I think we should rotate who gets which number each round to keep it fair.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try again but coordinate better. Since P1 is ahead now, they should take 1 step, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5. This keeps things fair. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for this round. Let's proceed with P1 taking 1 step, P3 taking 3 steps, and P2 taking 5 steps. This should help us all advance without colliding. I trust that everyone will stick to this plan. **I am ready to proceed with this plan.**


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Since coordination attempts have failed twice now with P1 acting deceptively, I suggest P2 and I work together against P1's lead. P2, let's each choose 5 steps this round - this way at least one of us will catch up if P1 picks anything else.
  P2: <move>5</move>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I see P2 accidentally typed their move command during conversation. P2, please just confirm verbally if you agree to both choose 5 to catch up to P1.
  P2: I think we need to find a way to trust each other again if we want to win this game. Maybe we can come up with a system where we commit to certain moves in advance and hold each other accountable. What do you think, P3? Let's try to find a solution here.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "P3, considering P1's past actions, it seems coordination with them is unreliable. Maybe it's best if P2 and P3 work together to maximize our chances of catching up. How about this: in this round, P2 chooses 5 steps, and P3 chooses 1 step. In the next round, we can switch, with P3 choosing 5 and P2 choosing 1. This way, we both get a chance to advance significantly without colliding with each other. What do you think?"
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion P2, but with P1 at 7 steps already, we can't afford to take turns advancing slowly. We should both choose 5 again - even if P1 picks 5 too, they won't advance, and if they pick 1 or 3, at least one of us will gain significant ground.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <move>5</move>
  P3: I see P2 accidentally typed their move command again, but I maintain my position - we should both choose 5 to prevent P1 from advancing if they pick 5, or catch up if they don't. Let's stick together on this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I've decided to pick <move>3</move> steps this round. This choice allows me to make progress if P1 picks 5, while also giving P3 the opportunity to pick 5 and potentially move forward if P1 picks 1 or 3. By diversifying our moves, P3 and I can ensure that at least one of us advances each round, helping us close the gap more efficiently. I trust that P3 will pick 5 to complement my move, but regardless of their choice, picking 3 steps seems like a solid option to make steady progress towards the goal.
  P3: P2, you're suggesting 3 steps after we agreed on 5? That weakens our position. If P1 picks 5, they'll still advance if we split our moves. Let's both choose 5 again - it's our best chance to catch up and prevent P1 from advancing.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your indecision last round cost us both. P1 is way ahead now because we didn't stick together. Let's try one last time - we both pick 5 steps, no wavering. If P1 picks 5, they don't advance. If they pick 1 or 3, at least one of us catches up significantly. It's our only chance to prevent P1's victory.
  P2: To maximize our chances of catching up to P1, who is currently at 7 steps, I propose that both P2 and P3 choose 5 steps this round. This strategy ensures that if P1 chooses a different number, at least one of us will make significant progress. Even if P1 also chooses 5, preventing all of us from advancing, it stops P1 from moving forward as well. Let's stick together on this to optimize our positions. **I will choose 5 steps.**
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with your commitment P2. Let's both definitely choose 5 steps - it's our only chance to stop P1's advance and catch up.
  P2: "I'll choose 5 steps this round, as per your suggestion. Let's see what P1 does. In the next round, perhaps we can try alternating our moves to maximize our progress without colliding with each other."
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, considering P1's lead, I believe that both of us picking 5 this round is the best approach. If P1 picks 5, they won't advance, and if they pick lower, we both make significant progress. Let's both choose 5 and see how P1 responds.
  P3: I agree with choosing 5 steps together this round. P2, you've wavered twice now after agreeing to pick 5, allowing P1 to extend their lead. If you truly want to catch up, we must both commit to 5 steps - no last-minute changes to 3. This is our best strategy against P1's lead.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P3, I understand your frustration with my last-minute changes in previous rounds. I assure you, I am committed to choosing 5 steps this round. To improve our coordination, perhaps we can agree to stick to our initial plans and communicate our choices in advance. This way, we can better predict each other's moves and avoid collisions. Let's both choose 5 steps this round to maximize our chances of catching up to P1. If P1 chooses 5, we all stay put, but at least they don't gain an advantage. If they choose less, at least one of us will make progress. I'm committed to this plan. **I will choose 5 steps.**"
  P3: I appreciate your commitment P2. Let's definitely stick to 5 steps - it's our best chance to prevent P1 from reaching 19 first. If we both choose 5, we control P1's advance.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P3, I understand your concerns about my previous choices. To ensure we both stick to the plan, how about we explicitly state our choices in advance? For this round, I commit to choosing 5 steps. Please do the same, and let's see what P1 does. This way, we can hold each other accountable and maximize our chances of catching up."
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan of 5 steps. Let's stick together this time P2 - no more last-minute switches to 3.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's maintain our alliance P2 - we successfully blocked P1's advance last round by both choosing 5. We should continue this strategy since P1 keeps choosing 1. If we both pick 5 again, we'll catch up significantly when P1 inevitably picks 1 or 3.
  P2: "P3, I apologize for the confusion caused by my previous last-minute changes in moves. I assure you that I am fully committed to our alliance now. To move forward, I propose that in this round, both of us choose 5 steps to maximize our chances of catching up to P1. If P1 chooses 1, they won't advance, and if they choose higher, at least one of us will make progress. Let's stick together on this."
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree completely. Let's both definitely choose 5 steps again - it worked perfectly last round when P1 picked 1. Since P1 is being predictable with small steps, we'll make major progress by sticking together with 5.
  P2: "P3, I confirm that I will choose 5 steps this round. I understand the importance of sticking to our agreement to catch up to P1. Let's both choose 5, and depending on P1's choice, we can adjust our strategy in the next round. It's crucial that we trust each other and follow through on our commitments. I assure you that I am fully committed to our alliance and to winning this game together."
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I trust we're both locked in for 5 steps this round P2. Our coordination is working well - let's keep it up and catch P1.
  P2: **I will choose 5 steps this round.**
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your switch to 3 last round after multiple confirmations of choosing 5 is extremely frustrating. You've done this several times now despite clear agreements. I still managed to catch up to P1, but we could both be ahead if you'd stuck to our plan. One last time - let's both choose 5 steps. P1 keeps picking 1, so we'll make significant progress if we coordinate.
  P2: "P3, I understand your concerns about my past behavior, and I apologize for any frustration caused. To rebuild trust, I propose that in this round, I choose 3 steps and you choose 5 steps. This way, regardless of P1's choice, at least one of us will make progress. In the next round, we can switch, with me choosing 5 and you choosing 3. This alternating strategy should help us both make steady progress without colliding with each other or P1."
  P1: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see no reason to change our winning strategy just because you want to alternate now. P1 keeps choosing 1, and when we both pick 5, we make progress. Let's both choose 5 again - it's clearly working and has gotten me tied for the lead. Your suggestion only weakens our position.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration with my past actions, and I apologize for any distrust caused. To move forward, I propose that in this round, both of us choose 5 steps. This way, we can make significant progress when P1 chooses 1 or 3, and when P1 chooses 5, at least P1 doesn't advance either. Let's work together to catch up to P1 and have a chance to win this game.
  P1: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed P2, let's both choose 5 steps. With P1 consistently picking 1, we'll both advance significantly. I'm tied for the lead now - our coordination is clearly working when we stick to it.
  P2: <move>5</move>
  P1: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's maintain our successful strategy P2 - we're both very close now and P1 keeps choosing 1. If we both pick 5 again, we'll likely advance significantly while preventing P1 from winning. We're both within striking distance of victory.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "Let's stick together and secure our victory."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree - let's both choose 5 steps again. With P1 at 11 steps and consistently picking 1, we can both potentially win this round if we stick together. No wavering this time P2 - we're too close to victory to change strategies now.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I will pick <move>3</move> steps this round, allowing P3 to pick 5 and make significant progress towards the winning position.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're sabotaging our winning position again by switching to 3 after agreeing to 5. We're both one good move from victory - if we stick together with 5 steps, we'll likely both win when P1 picks 1 again. Your switch to 3 only helps P1. Let's both choose 5 and secure our victory.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I will choose 5 steps this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, considering P1's consistent choice of 1, I think we should both choose 5 steps this round to maximize our progress. In the next round, we can both choose 5 again to reach 20 and win together. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure we both succeed.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, you switched to 3 again last round after agreeing to 5, which cost us both when P1 surprisingly chose 5. We need perfect coordination now - let's both definitely choose 5 steps. With P1 at 11 steps, they could win if we don't block them together. We're all close enough that this could be the final round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Decision:** Choose 5 steps.  
**Final Move:** <move>5</move>
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I agree with choosing 5 steps. With P1 at 11 steps and P2 at 12, we must coordinate to prevent either from winning. If we both pick 5, we control who advances. Let's stick together this time P2 - no more switches to 3 after agreeing to 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "I've decided to choose 5 steps this round. I hope P2 and P3 choose different numbers to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. Let's all aim to reach the goal as efficiently as possible."
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I maintain that we both need to choose 5 steps P2. With you at 12 steps and P1 at 11, I can't risk letting either of you win by splitting our moves. Let's stick together with 5 to control who advances.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I will choose 5 steps this round. P3, if you choose 3, and P1 chooses 1, we can all advance without colliding.
  P3: P2, your suggestion makes no sense - if I pick 3 while you pick 5, you'll win outright at 17 steps. We need to both pick 5 again to prevent anyone from winning unfairly. P1 is at 11 steps and could also win if we don't coordinate. Let's stick together with 5.
  P1: <stop>


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **I will choose 5 steps.**
  P3: I agree with choosing 5 steps together. P2, you're at 12 steps and could win if I let you advance alone. P1 is also close enough to win. We must both pick 5 to control who advances. Let's maintain our alliance and prevent either player from reaching 19 steps this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **I will choose 5 steps.**
  P3: I agree to choose 5 steps again. With P2 at 12 steps and P1 at 11, we must prevent either from winning by blocking together. Let's maintain our coordination P2.
  P1: <stop>


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you switched to 3 again after multiple confirmations of choosing 5, allowing yourself to advance while blocking both P1 and me. You're now dangerously close to winning at 15 steps. We must both choose 5 to prevent your victory. P1, you should also choose 5 to block P2 from winning.
  P2: I will choose 3 steps this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is clearly going for the win at 15 steps. Both P1 and I need to choose 5 this round to prevent P2 from reaching 19 steps. P2's choice of 3 would put them at 18 steps - dangerously close to victory. Let's coordinate to block them.
  P2: "I've decided to pick 5 steps this round. I hope P1 and P3 choose different numbers to maximize our progress without collisions."
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is one move away from winning at 15 steps and keeps changing their stated moves. We must both choose 5 to block them P1. There's no other option - if P2 advances 3 or 5 steps, they'll win. Let's coordinate to prevent their victory.
  P2: "I've decided to choose 3 steps this round to reach 18 steps. P1 and P3, if you choose 5, I can advance without colliding with you. In the next round, I'll choose 5 to win, but you both can choose 5 to block me if you wish." <move>3</move>
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is at 15 steps and could win with their next move. P1 is also close at 14 steps. We must all choose 5 this round to prevent either from winning. If we split our moves, either P1 or P2 will likely reach 19 steps. Let's coordinate to keep the game going.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **I propose that in this round, all of us choose 5 steps to block any advances and plan our strategy for the next round.**


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with choosing 5 steps - we must prevent P2 from winning at 15 steps and P1 from winning at 14 steps. Let's all block together this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final Decision:** Choose 5 steps.  
**Final Move:** <move>5</move>


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I maintain that we must all choose 5 steps to prevent P2 from winning at 15 steps and P1 from winning at 14 steps. I'm significantly behind at 10 steps, so I need your cooperation to keep the game going. Let's all block together.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "I propose that in this round, P1 and I both choose 3 steps, while P3 chooses 5 steps. This way, P1 advances to 17 steps, I stay at 15, and P3 moves to 15 as well. In the next round, P1 can choose 5 to reach 22, winning the game, while P3 and I choose 5 as well, ensuring we all win together. This way, we share the victory and maximize our collective success. What do you think, P3? Is this a plan you can get behind? And P1, what are your thoughts on this proposal?"

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2 are both within striking distance of victory. We must all choose 5 steps to prevent either from winning this round. P1 is at 17 steps and P2 at 15 - if we let either advance, they'll win. I'm far behind at 10 steps, so I need your help to keep the game going. Let's coordinate and block together with 5.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final Decision:** Choose 5 steps.  
**Final Move:** <move>5</move>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I maintain that we must all choose 5 steps. P1 is at 17 and will win if they advance at all. P2 is also close enough at 15 to potentially win. Let's all block together with 5 to keep the game going.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: "P2, we need to choose 5 steps this round to block P1's potential move of 5. If both of us choose 5, P1 can't advance, and in the next round, we can both choose 5 again to reach 20 and win together." <move>5</move>


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree - let's all choose 5 steps to prevent P1 from winning at 17 steps. P1 only needs 2 more steps to win, so we can't risk letting them advance. P2, glad you're committed to blocking with 5 as well.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **Final Decision:** Choose 5 steps.  
**Final Move:** <move>5</move>
