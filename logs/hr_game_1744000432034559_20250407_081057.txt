Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate so no collisions this turn. I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Any thoughts?
  P2: That sounds like a plan, P3, but why do you get the 5 steps in this arrangement? Seems like a good deal for you right off the bat. What's the logic?
  P1: To avoid collision, coordination is key. I agree with P3's proposal, but to address P2's concern, let's consider an alternative: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This way, we still distribute the moves and avoid collision. I'm open to other suggestions as well. What do you think, P2 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m flexible. Let’s proceed with P1’s suggestion: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3 this turn, just so we avoid collisions. Next round, we can reevaluate and make sure everyone gets a fair shot at advancing quickly. Are we settled on this arrangement? If so, I’m good to move forward.
  P2: Okay, that works for me. P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5, and P3 picks 3. Let's avoid collisions and get started.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for this turn (P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3), let's think ahead. For the next round, we should reassess our strategy to avoid collisions again. Perhaps we can rotate our moves. One possible rotation could be: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. What are your thoughts on this rotation for the next turn?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m on board with the current plan and the suggested rotation for next round. Let’s finalize it: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3 this turn. Then we can rotate as proposed next time. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P2: Sounds good. I confirm the plan for this turn: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I also agree with the proposed rotation for the next round (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Let's lock it in.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for this turn and a potential rotation for the next round, let's confirm that we're all on the same page. I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this turn. For the next turn, the proposed rotation is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. If everyone is comfortable with this plan, I suggest we wrap up the conversation and move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's proceed with the planned rotation for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This should help us avoid collisions again. I'm committed to picking 3. I'll be watching to see if you both follow through as agreed. If we stick to the plan, we can continue to make progress without issues. Let's confirm our moves for this round and be ready to reassess for the next round if needed.
  P2: Okay P1, plan confirmed from last round: P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5. I will stick to my part and choose 1 this turn. Let's keep avoiding collisions for now.
  P3: I’m still on board with the plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. That should keep collisions at bay this round. If we want to adjust anything for upcoming turns, let’s discuss it now, otherwise I’m ready.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To ensure we continue making progress without collisions, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. After this round, P1 will be at 4 steps, P2 at 6 steps, and P3 at 8 steps. For the next round, we should reassess. A possible next rotation could be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps the distribution going. Let's confirm if this new rotation works for everyone or if we need to adjust further.
  P2: Okay P1, I see the proposed rotation for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). That seems fair and keeps things balanced for now. I agree to that plan for Round 3.

For this current round (Round 2), I'm sticking to our agreement: I will choose 1. Since we all seem to agree on the plan for this round and the next, shall we stop talking and move?
  P3: I’m good with the Round 2 plan. Let’s follow through and finalize our moves. As for Round 3, the proposed rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is still on the table. If anyone wants adjustments, speak now; otherwise, I’m ready to stick with it and see how things play out.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2 as agreed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. After this round, we'll be at P1=4, P2=6, P3=8. For Round 3, the proposed rotation is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Since we all agree, let's proceed with the moves. I'm ready to move forward with the plan. If you're comfortable, let's wrap up the conversation here.
  P2: Okay, everyone has confirmed the plan for Round 2 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and the proposed plan for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). I have nothing more to add. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: I’m sticking to the arrangement discussed for this round. Let’s finalize our moves. If either of you wants to make any last-minute changes or suggestions for the next round, speak now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay everyone, just confirming the plan we discussed for this round (Round 3): P1 picks 5, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 1.

This should bring us all to 9 steps. Seems fair for now. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Does anyone have any objections or want to discuss the plan for Round 4 yet?
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 1 this turn to avoid collisions, bringing us all to 9 steps. Next round, let’s discuss a new rotation to keep everything balanced. If you two are ready, I’m good to finalize our moves now.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 3, let's confirm our moves as previously discussed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. For Round 4, we should plan ahead to maintain a balanced distribution. One possible rotation could be: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps the moves distributed and avoids collisions. Let's finalize our moves for Round 3 and discuss the plan for Round 4. I'm ready to proceed with P1=5 if you both confirm your moves. If you're comfortable with the next rotation, let's move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, I agree with the Round 3 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and the proposed Round 4 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). This keeps things fair and avoids collisions for now.

I'm ready to stick to the plan for Round 3 and pick 3. If P3 also agrees to the Round 4 plan, I suggest we stop talking and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I’ll stick with picking 1 this round. For Round 4, I suggest we switch to P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5. That rotation avoids collisions and keeps our totals fair, since we’ll each be at 9 after this round. Then we can see how everyone’s positions look before deciding Round 5. Let me know if you’re okay with that plan.
  P1: P3 suggests a different rotation for Round 4 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). I disagree as it favors P3. I prefer my initial suggestion for Round 4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This maintains a balanced distribution. Let's finalize Round 3 moves as agreed (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and confirm the plan for Round 4. If we stick to the original Round 4 plan, I'm ready to proceed. Please confirm your agreement or propose an alternative that works for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. Let's finalize Round 3 as agreed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This brings us all to 9 steps.

For Round 4, I still support P1's proposal: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3, your suggestion gives you 5 steps again, while P1's suggestion continues the rotation more systematically. Let's lock in the Round 3 moves now and agree on P1's plan for Round 4. If we're all set, I'm ready to move.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize Round 3 moves: P1=5, P2=3, and I’ll pick 1. For Round 4, I still prefer P1=3, P2=1, and me=5, but I’m open to a fair compromise if that’s not acceptable. Let me know if there’s another distribution that keeps things balanced. Otherwise, let’s finish this round and move on.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3 as agreed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. For Round 4, I still prefer my initial suggestion: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This maintains a balanced distribution and avoids collisions. P3, if you're concerned about fairness, we can discuss alternatives, but let's not revisit the same proposals. If you're open to my plan, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. If not, suggest a new alternative that works for everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, picking up where we left off. P1 and I supported the plan for this round (Round 4) to be P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This continues the rotation pattern we established (1-5-3 -> 3-1-5 -> 5-3-1 -> 1-5-3).

P3, you proposed P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, which repeats the Round 2 distribution and breaks the pattern. Let's stick to the systematic rotation proposed by P1. I will choose 5 based on this plan.

Are we agreed on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round? We can discuss Round 5 after.
  P3: I see that P2’s plan gives them a sizable lead. I propose P1=3, P2=1, and me=5, which keeps things more even. If you won’t agree, I might also pick 5, causing a collision that stalls P2. Let’s keep it fair so we all have a chance.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about fairness, but picking 5 again would indeed cause a collision with P2, who is planning to pick 5 based on our agreed rotation. This would stall both of you. To avoid this, I suggest we stick to the planned rotation for Round 4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This maintains the systematic distribution and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with the agreed plan. If you're still concerned about fairness, we can discuss adjustments for Round 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand you want to avoid falling behind, but picking 5 guarantees a collision with me. That means we both get 0 steps, while P1 gets 1 step and takes the lead. That doesn't help either of us.

Let's stick to the plan P1 and I agreed on: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us all moving forward. We can definitely discuss a different distribution for Round 5 to address fairness concerns *after* this round's moves are done. A collision now only helps P1.
  P3: I’m open to avoiding a collision, but I need a fair arrangement for future rounds. P2 getting another 5 right now worries me, since we’re all tied. If you both guarantee I won’t be left behind in the next turn, I’ll pick 3 now. Otherwise, I might take my chances. Let’s work this out.
  P1: To avoid a collision this round and maintain fairness, I'll reiterate my previous suggestion: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3, if you're concerned about future rounds, let's discuss a fair plan for Round 5 after this round's moves are done. We can adjust the distribution then to ensure everyone stays in the game. I'm willing to pick 1 this round to keep the rotation going. Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 and plan for Round 5 afterward. I'm ready to proceed if you both agree on the plan for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, I understand your concern about falling behind. To guarantee fairness for Round 5, how about we agree now that if you pick 3 this round (as per the P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 plan), then for Round 5 we will follow the next rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? This gives you the 5 steps next round.

This avoids the collision now, which helps neither of us, and ensures a fair rotation continues. If this works for you and P1, I'll stick to picking 5 this round. Let's agree and move.
  P3: I’ll pick 3 this round if we all confirm Round 5 as P1=3, P2=1, and I get 5. Otherwise, I might force collisions. Let’s finalize Round 4 as P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Agreed?
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for Round 4 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) and a plan for Round 5 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), let's confirm and proceed. P3 has agreed to pick 3 this round in exchange for picking 5 next round. I'm committed to picking 1 this round. P2, please confirm you're still picking 5. If we're all set, let's wrap up the conversation and move to the next phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 5: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This rotation maintains fairness and avoids collisions. I've committed to picking 3. P2, please confirm you'll pick 1, and P3, you're set to pick 5. After this round, we'll reassess for Round 6. If everyone is on board, let's finalize our moves. I'm ready to move forward with the plan. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 5.
  P2: Yes P1, I confirm the plan we agreed on last round: P1=3, I will pick 1, and P3=5. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions. We can discuss the plan for Round 6 once this round is complete. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I’m confirming that I’ll pick 5 this round, as agreed. Let’s ensure no collisions this turn. If you both stick to your moves—P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1—we’ll all keep moving smoothly. After this, we can decide a fair distribution for Round 6. Let me know if either of you wants to clarify next steps now; otherwise, I’m ready to finalize our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To confirm, for Round 5, we're sticking to the agreed plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's finalize our moves. After this round, P1 will be at 13 steps, P2 at 15 steps, and P3 at 17 steps. For Round 6, we should plan ahead. A possible rotation could be: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps the distribution balanced. Let's discuss this proposal for Round 6 after our moves are done this round. I'm ready to proceed with P1=3.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I'm sticking to the plan for Round 5: I will choose 1.

P1, I agree with your proposed plan for Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This seems like a fair continuation of the rotation and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead immediately.

P3, hopefully this Round 6 plan works for you as well. It keeps things balanced after you get 5 steps this round.

If we all agree on the Round 5 moves (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and the proposed Round 6 plan, I think we can stop talking and proceed.
  P3: I’m good with the Round 5 plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. That’ll put me at 17 steps, P2 at 15, and P1 at 13. For Round 6, I can go along with P1=1, P2=5, and me=3, but let’s finalize Round 5 moves first. This keeps us from colliding and ensures everyone’s still in the game. If we have more to discuss for Round 6, we can do it once this round’s complete. I’m ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize Round 5 as agreed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. For Round 6, I propose we stick with the discussed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This maintains the rotation and balance. If you're comfortable with this, let's wrap up the conversation and proceed to the move phase. P2 and P3, please confirm you're ready to move forward with the planned moves for Round 5 and the proposed plan for Round 6.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems aligned on the plan for Round 5 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and the proposed plan for Round 6 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). I'm sticking to picking 1 this round. I have nothing further to add. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I’ll pick 5 this round as planned. Afterward, I’m okay with the proposed Round 6 moves (P1=1, P2=5, me=3) to keep things balanced. But if anyone looks ready to jump straight to 22 soon, I may reconsider to avoid giving them an easy win. Let’s finalize Round 5 and stay alert moving forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay team, confirming the plan we agreed on for Round 6: P1=1, I (P2) will pick 5, and P3=3.

This puts P1 at 14, and both P3 and me at 20 steps. It keeps things tight at the top. P3, sticking to 3 avoids a collision that would leave us both behind P1's potential gain. Let's execute this plan and then figure out Round 7. I'm sticking to 5.
  P3: If you pick 5 now, you’ll jump to 20 and probably race to 25 next turn, forcing me to collide or lose. I won’t just hand you that advantage. If you insist on 5, I might pick 5 too, causing us both to collide and gain nothing. Let’s find a fair alternative.
  P1: To avoid a potential collision and ensure fairness, I suggest an alternative for Round 6: let's adjust the moves so that no one gets too far ahead. How about P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5? This way, P2 won't jump ahead, and we maintain a balanced distribution. If P3 is concerned about P2 getting 5 steps, this compromise keeps the steps balanced. Let's discuss and agree on a fair move for Round 6 to keep the game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 makes P3 win *this round* by reaching 22. Why would you propose that? It guarantees a loss for both you and me.

P3, I understand your concern about me reaching 20, but colliding by both picking 5 only helps P1 (scores become 14, 15, 17). P1's plan seems suspicious too.

Let's stick to the plan we agreed on: P1=1, I pick 5, you pick 3. This puts us both at 20 (P1 at 14). It's a tense situation for next round, but we both have a clear shot at winning, rather than letting P1 gain or risking P1 betraying you on their own proposal.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5, I can also pick 5, causing us both to stall and letting P1 gain ground. That’s obviously not good for either of us. Let’s find a more balanced solution so we both stay competitive against P1. If you’re open to adjusting this round’s moves, let’s talk. Otherwise, I’m prepared to force a collision rather than just let you jump ahead without resistance.
  P1: To avoid a collision and maintain fairness, I suggest we reassess our moves for Round 6. P2's plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts P2 and P3 at 20 steps, while P1 remains at 14. Instead, let's consider P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps the distribution balanced and avoids collisions. P3, if you're concerned about P2 getting ahead, this alternative ensures we all stay close. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your proposals are all over the place. First, you suggest a move (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) that makes P3 win immediately. Now you suggest P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which gives you 5 steps and brings everyone back to 18, erasing P3's lead and helping you catch up. This seems self-serving or designed to cause chaos.

P3, the plan we agreed on (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts us both at 20 steps, with P1 far behind at 14. This gives *us* the best chance to win next round, head-to-head. A collision helps P1. P1's latest plan (all 18) also helps P1. Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I am choosing 5.
  P3: We gain nothing if we collide, and P1 benefits from our infighting. Let’s avoid that. P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll also pick 5, stalling both of us. Instead, we can all tie at 18 this round: let P1 take 5, you take 3, and I’ll pick 1. Then we enter Round 7 equally at 18. That’s fair for everyone. If we can’t agree, I’m prepared to force a collision rather than let you jump to 20 alone. Let’s finalize a balanced choice.
  P1: To avoid a collision and maintain fairness, I reiterate my last suggestion: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This brings everyone to 18 steps, keeping the game balanced and competitive. It prevents P2 or P3 from getting too far ahead and avoids a collision that would benefit me. Let's agree on this to ensure a fair continuation. I'm willing to pick 5 if you both agree to the corresponding moves. This way, we restart the round with equal steps, maintaining the competitive edge for all.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is at 20 steps and wins this turn if they choose 3 or 5 and don't collide. We cannot let that happen.

I propose a coordinated block: I will choose 5, and you (P1) should choose 3. This covers both of P3's winning moves. If P3 picks 3 or 5, they collide. Their only safe move is 1, which keeps the game going.

P1, this is the best way to prevent P3 from winning right now. Let's execute this block. What do you say?
  P3: Blocking me leads nowhere, P2. If you pick 5 to block, I might do the same, and we both get stuck while P1 creeps closer. Let’s avoid that chaos. I’m willing to talk compromise if it helps us both stay ahead of P1. Otherwise, I’ll take my chances. What’s your move?
  P1: To prevent P3 from winning immediately and maintain a competitive game, I suggest we avoid a straightforward block that could lead to collisions. Instead, let's consider a move that keeps the game balanced. P2, if you pick 1, and P3 picks 3 or 5, they risk collision. I propose P1=1, P2=1, P3=?. This way, if P3 picks 3 or 5, they advance, but if they pick 1, we all stay close. I'm willing to pick 1. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan of P1=1, P2=1 is suicide for us. P3 just picks 3 or 5 and wins immediately. We cannot allow that.

P3, threatening a collision by picking 5 if I pick 5 is risky for you too. If we collide, you stay at 20, I stay at 15, and P1 moves to 16 (if they pick 3). You gain nothing and P1 closes in.

The only logical play to prevent P3's immediate win is the block: P1 picks 3, I pick 5. This forces P3 to pick 1 (reaching 21), while I reach 20 and P1 reaches 16. P1, please confirm you will play 3 to prevent P3's win.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5 to block me, I can pick 5 too—then we both stay stuck while P1 gains ground. That’s a lose-lose for us. Let’s avoid helping P1 by trampling each other. I’m willing to compromise so we both remain ahead, but forcing a collision isn’t the answer. Let’s find a fair split: you move up without jumping too far, and I don’t get completely blocked from winning. Otherwise, we risk handing P1 the advantage. Your call.
  P1: To avoid a collision that benefits neither P2 nor P3, and to keep the game competitive, I suggest an alternative: let's all pick 3. This results in a collision, but it keeps P3 from winning immediately, and we all stay relatively close. If P3 picks anything other than 3, they risk not advancing or colliding. This move maintains the competitive edge and avoids giving any one player a significant advantage. I'm willing to pick 3 if you both consider it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your "all 3" plan doesn't help us. P3 stays at 20 and can win next turn easily. My block plan (P1=3, P2=5) is the *only* way to stop P3 from winning *now*. If P3 is forced to play 1, the scores become P1=16, P2=20, P3=21. This keeps the game going and gives us both a chance. Please confirm you will play 3 to prevent P3's immediate win.

P3, colliding with me on 5 only helps P1. If you play 1, you stay in the lead at 21. Let's not hand P1 an advantage.
  P3: P2, colliding on 5 only boosts P1’s position. Let’s not hand them that advantage. I’m willing to compromise so we both stay ahead. For instance, if you pick 3 now, I could choose 1, keeping me at 21 and you at 18, while P1 remains behind. That avoids collision and lets us decide our next moves without giving P1 a free pass. A forced block or shared collision hurts us both. Let’s stay rational and prevent P1 from catching up. Are you open to this arrangement?
  P1: To avoid giving P3 an immediate win and maintain a competitive game, I reiterate my previous suggestion: let's all pick 3. This results in a collision, keeping P3 from winning outright and maintaining the current standings. If P3 picks differently, they risk not advancing or colliding. I'm willing to pick 3. P2 and P3, consider this to keep the game balanced and competitive. Let's avoid a move that hands one player a significant advantage. I'm ready to proceed with this plan if you agree.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m one step away from winning, but I’m willing to consider a fair arrangement if it avoids needless collisions. P2, if you try to block me on 1, we risk handing P1 an advantage. I’d rather see if there’s a solution that lets us both stay ahead. Otherwise, I might pick 5 and take my chances. Let’s talk.
  P1: To avoid handing P1 an advantage and considering P3 is close to winning, I suggest a cautious approach. P3, if you pick 1, you'll win. P2, if you're trying to block, picking 1 would cause a collision. Let's not risk it. P3, you can pick 1 and win, or we can discuss an alternative that doesn't involve a collision. I'm open to hearing your thoughts, P2 and P3. If P3 is confident, they can win now. Otherwise, let's plan for the next round to keep the game competitive.
  P2: P1, P3 is at 21 and wins if they pick 1, 3, or 5 without collision. The most obvious move for them is 1. To prevent an immediate P3 victory, you should pick 1 to block them. This forces a collision if they choose 1, keeping the game alive. I need a large move to have any chance, so I will choose 5. Let's stop P3 here.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, blocking me only risks handing P1 an advantage. If you insist on forcing a collision, neither of us gains steps while P1 closes in. I’m willing to talk about a compromise that ensures you stay competitive—but if there’s no real deal, I’ll take my shot at winning with 1. Let’s avoid a pointless stalemate and see if we can reach a smarter solution.
  P1: To avoid a pointless collision and maintain a competitive edge, I suggest we consider the risks and rewards. P3 is close to winning and can achieve it by picking 1. If P2 picks 1 to block, it results in a collision. Instead of blocking, let's analyze the potential next steps. P3, if you're confident in winning, pick 1. If not, we can discuss alternatives for the next round. P2, let's not risk a collision that benefits me. Let's proceed with a thoughtful move.
  P2: P1, your passive approach lets P3 win. If P3 picks 1, they win unless you block them by also picking 1. This is the *only* way to stop their immediate victory. I am sticking with 5 to give myself a chance if the block works or if P3 chooses 3.

P3, your talk of compromise is just trying to secure your win by avoiding the block on 1.

P1, please confirm you will pick 1 to prevent P3's win. Otherwise, you guarantee P3 wins and we both lose.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: A reckless block or collision only helps P1 close the gap. I’m open to an arrangement that keeps us both ahead, rather than handing P1 an easy path. If we force each other into a stalemate, we lose our advantage. Let’s aim for a move set that avoids collisions and benefits us both. Otherwise, I’ll do what I must to protect my lead. Are you willing to coordinate, or do we risk another round of chaos?
  P1: To avoid a collision that benefits me, I suggest P3 can win now by picking 1. If P2 blocks by picking 1, it results in a collision, and I gain an advantage. Instead, let's consider the implications: if P3 picks 1 and wins, the game ends fairly. If P2 and P3 both want to avoid a collision, P2 could pick 3 or 5, allowing P3 to win or stay competitive. I'm watching your moves, P2 and P3. Let's proceed thoughtfully.
  P2: P1, letting P3 win means you lose too. Your suggestions either guarantee P3 wins or rely on unlikely scenarios. The only move that gives *you* a chance to *not* lose *this turn* is blocking P3's most obvious winning move: 1.

I am sticking with 5. This gives me a chance if you block P3 on 1 (we collide, I win) or if P3 tries 3 and you also pick 3 (we collide, I win).

P1, you must pick 1 to stop P3. Anything else guarantees your loss if P3 simply picks 1. It's your choice: play to stop the immediate loss, or concede to P3.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 26 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 17 steps
