Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, what if we try to avoid collisions in the early rounds? Maybe we could coordinate our moves so we all make progress instead of blocking each other? I'm thinking if we can agree on who takes which number this round, we all advance and then reassess. Thoughts?
  P3: How about this for Round 1?  
P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 5.  
No collisions, we all advance, and then we reassess next turn.
  P2: I like the idea of avoiding collisions. If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, I’ll go with 3 as suggested. That way, we all move forward without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. Let’s make sure we stick to this plan! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me! I'm committed to taking 1 this round as we discussed. Let's all stick to the plan - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. After we see how this plays out, we can figure out our next moves based on the new positions.
  P3: All right, I’m on board—I'll take 5 this round. Let’s stick to the plan and move forward.
  P2: I’m glad we’re all on the same page for this round! Just to confirm, I’ll be taking 3 as we agreed. After this round, let’s evaluate our positions and see if we need to adjust our strategy for Round 2. I think it’s crucial we keep communication open to maximize our chances of advancing. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll definitely take 5 this round. If either of you picks 5 too, we’ll collide and stall. So P2, stick with 3; P1, stick with 1. That way we all advance safely.
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for this round. I'll stick with 3 to avoid any collisions, and I encourage P1 to take 1 as well. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. After this round, we should reassess our positions and strategies to keep moving forward effectively. Let's keep the communication open!
  P1: Wait, I'm noticing a pattern here that heavily favors P3. If we keep doing P1→1, P2→3, P3→5, then P3 will reach 22 first while I stay way behind. How about we rotate the assignments? This round, maybe I could take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? That way the cooperation continues but is more fair to everyone long-term. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good, P1. Here’s a fair rotation:

• Round 2: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5  
• Round 3: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3  
• Round 4: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1  

After that we’ll reassess. Let’s stick to this to keep progress collision-free and fair.
  P2: I appreciate the rotation idea, P1, but I think we should stick to the original plan for Round 2 to avoid confusion. I'll take 3 as agreed, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. After this round, we can reassess our positions and strategies. I just want to ensure we all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s keep it simple and effective for now! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, think about this - if we stick to the original plan, P3 will have 10 steps after this round while we'll have 2 and 6 respectively. P3 agreed to the rotation because they know they're already ahead! The rotation actually helps level the playing field. If you insist on the original unfair plan, I might have to break cooperation and go for a different number to protect my chances. The rotation keeps us all advancing while preventing P3 from running away with the game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I hear the fairness point, but I worry switching now risks confusion or collision. Let’s stick with P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round so we all advance safely. After Round 2, we can rebalance—either P1 or P2 takes 5 next turn. Sound fair?
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but I really think we need to stick with the original plan for Round 2 to avoid any confusion. If we all take our agreed numbers—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—we'll ensure everyone advances without blocking. After this round, we can reassess and discuss a more balanced rotation for future rounds. Let's keep it straightforward for now! What do you both think?
  P1: Look, I'm not going to accept a plan where P3 reaches 10 steps while I'm stuck at 2. That's basically handing P3 the win. If you both insist on the unfair original plan instead of the rotation, then cooperation is dead and I'll have to play defensively. I'll pick whatever number gives me the best chance, even if it means collisions. Your choice - fair rotation or no cooperation.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that collision proved my point about unfair cooperation. Now P2 is in the lead at 6 steps while P3 and I are behind. I'm willing to restart cooperation, but this time we need a fair system since I'm now furthest behind. How about P2 takes 1 (smallest move since you're ahead), P3 takes 3, and I take 5 to catch up? Then we can rotate fairly from there. Otherwise, I'll keep disrupting until we find something equitable.
  P3: I agree to P1’s proposal: P2 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 5 this round. Let’s stick to it and rebalance next turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the willingness to cooperate again. I agree to the proposed plan: I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can ensure everyone advances fairly. After this round, we can discuss how to rotate our moves for future rounds. Let’s stick to this plan and make progress together! Looking forward to seeing how we all do this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! We all agreed on the plan: P2→1, P3→3, P1→5. This gets me back in contention. After this round, we should continue rotating fairly - maybe P3→1 next time since they'll be in the lead at 8 steps. Let's execute this plan and keep cooperation fair for everyone.
  P3: I’m on board—this round I’ll take 3 (to reach 8), P1 takes 5 (to 6), and P2 takes 1 (to 7). Let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on the plan for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll stick to taking 1, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. After this round, let’s discuss how we can rotate our moves fairly moving forward. I believe this will help keep the game competitive and enjoyable for everyone. Looking forward to seeing how we all do this turn!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep it collision-free and fair: Round 4 → P2→1, P1→3, P3→5. Next round I’ll take 1 to rebalance, and you two can take 5 and 3 by your standings. This ensures smooth progress and future equity.
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion for Round 4, but I think we should consider a slight adjustment to ensure fairness. How about I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round? This way, P1 can catch up a bit while we avoid blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess and discuss how to rotate our moves for future turns. Let’s keep the communication open to maximize our chances! What do you both think?
  P1: I like P2's counter-suggestion better! P2→1, P1→5, P3→3 keeps us more balanced - P3 and I would both be at 11 steps while P2 stays at 8. P3's original plan would put them at 13 steps, which seems too far ahead. Let's go with P2's more equitable distribution for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Here’s a compromise to keep us collision-free and fair:

Round 4: P2→1, P1→3, P3→5  
Round 5: P2→3, P1→5, P3→1  

You get the 5 next turn to catch up, and I take 5 now to maintain my lead. After that, we reassess. Sound good?
  P2: I appreciate the compromise, P3, but I still believe P2→1, P1→5, and P3→3 is the fairest distribution for this round. This way, P1 can catch up while still keeping P3 in check. If we stick to P3's plan, it allows them to pull too far ahead. Let’s prioritize fairness and balance to keep the game competitive. I’m open to reassessing after this round, but let’s agree on a plan that benefits everyone. What do you both think?
  P1: Look P3, your plan puts you at 13 steps while P2 and I are at 8-9. That's a huge lead that could decide the game! P2's proposal keeps us balanced - you and I both at 11, P2 at 8. Then next round we can fairly rotate who gets the big move. If you insist on taking 5 this round, you're basically asking us to hand you the win. Let's stick with P2's fair plan: P2→1, P1→5, P3→3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Here’s my final offer: Round 4 → P2→1, P1→3, P3→5. If you force me to take 3 instead, I’ll still pick 5 and risk blocking one of you—stalling us all. Stick with this, we all advance safely, and then we can rotate more fairly next turn. Your call.
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but P3's plan puts them too far ahead. I still believe P2→1, P1→5, and P3→3 is the best way to keep things balanced. This way, P1 can catch up, and we can reassess after this round. If we stick to P3's plan, it might lead to a significant lead that could end the game too quickly. Let's prioritize fairness and ensure we all remain competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your threat doesn't make sense - you're currently in the lead, so a collision hurts you most! If you pick 5 and I pick 5, we both stall while P2 advances alone to 10 steps. That's worse for you than taking 3 and staying competitive at 11. I'm sticking with the fair plan: P2→1, P1→5, P3→3. Don't sabotage everyone just to grab an unfair lead.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're in a tight spot after the last round. I propose we focus on collaboration again to keep the game competitive. For Round 5, how about P1 takes 5 to catch up, I take 1 to maintain my position, and P3 takes 3? This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can discuss our strategies moving forward. Let’s keep the communication open and ensure we all have a fair chance! What do you both think?
  P3: I’m still trailing, so let’s rebalance this turn:  
P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.  
No collisions, and I catch up while you both still advance.
  P1: P2's plan makes more sense - I'm currently ahead at 11 steps, so it's fair for me to advance more this round since P3 has been pushing for bigger moves when they were leading. P2→1, P1→5, P3→3 keeps the game balanced and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. P3, your plan would put you ahead of me at 13 vs my 12, which doesn't seem right given I'm currently leading. Let's go with P2's proposal.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion so far. To ensure we all make progress without blocking each other, I propose we stick with my earlier suggestion for Round 5: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to catch up while keeping the game balanced. After this round, we can reassess our strategies to maintain fairness moving forward. Let's work together to keep the competition healthy! What do you both think?
  P3: Last chance for a fair Round 5: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That brings us to 14/8/13—tight and competitive. If you refuse, I’ll take 5 anyway. If P1 sticks with 5, we’ll collide and gift P2 a solo advance you both hate. Choose the fair plan or face my defection.
  P1: P3, your threat doesn't add up. If you pick 5 and I pick 5, we both stall while P2 advances - that hurts you more since you're behind me! You need advances more than I do. I'm sticking with what's logical: if you insist on taking 5, then I'll take 3 to avoid collision and stay ahead at 14 steps. P2 can take 1. Your choice - take 3 for balance or take 5 and accept that I'll still lead afterward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we’re at a crucial point. I still believe that for Round 5, it’s best for me to take 1, P1 takes 5 to catch up, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If P3 insists on taking 5, it risks a collision with P1, which would benefit me. Let’s stick to a plan that ensures we all make progress. After this round, we can discuss how to keep things fair moving forward. What do you both think?
  P3: Here’s my final fair offer for Round 5:  
P1→3, P2→1, P3→5.  

That gives us 14/8/13—tight and collision-free. If you refuse, I’ll take 5 anyway and collide with whoever picks 5, gifting P2 a solo advance. Fair choice or face defection.
  P1: P3, your threat isn't credible! If you take 5 and I take 3 to avoid collision, I still end up at 14 steps while you get 13 - I maintain my lead either way. Since I'm currently ahead, why would I agree to your "tight" plan when I can extend my lead? I'm going with P2's proposal: P2→1, P1→5, P3→3. Take it or leave it, but your defection threat doesn't change the math in your favor.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since I'm leading at 14 steps, I think it's fair for me to maintain momentum. How about: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 this round? That keeps me advancing while you both still move forward. P3, you're only 1 step behind me, so taking 1 isn't unreasonable - and P2, the 3 helps you catch up faster than taking 1. If anyone tries to collision me on 5, we'll both stall and hand P2 a big advantage.
  P3: I reject your plan, P1. P3→1 leaves me at 14 while you leap to 19 and lock me out. Instead, let’s go collision-free and competitive: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That puts us at 17/9/18—nobody’s out of contention. If you refuse, I’ll take 5 anyway: if you also pick 5, we collide and gift P2 a solo advance to 11, which you won’t want. Let’s agree on this fair distribution for Round 6.
  P2: P1, while I understand your desire to maintain momentum, your plan could lead to a collision that benefits P2. I propose we go with P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, keeping the competition tight. If you insist on taking 5, we risk colliding, which would give P2 a significant advantage. Let's prioritize collaboration to ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your math doesn't add up - if we both take 5 and collide, you stay at 13 while I stay at 14. I keep my lead! Meanwhile, P2 only goes to 9 or 11, still far behind both of us. Your threat to collide actually hurts you more than me since you're the one chasing. I'm sticking with my original plan: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Call my bluff if you want, but the collision benefits me more than you.
  P3: P1, P2 already backs a collision‐free plan: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. If you insist on 5, I will also pick 5 and we’ll collide—granting P2 a solo advance. Don’t hand them free steps. Let’s stick to P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to maintain momentum, but we need to prioritize collaboration to avoid giving P2 an advantage. I propose we stick with P1→3, P2→1, and P3→5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other and keep the competition tight. If we collide, it benefits P2 the most. Let’s make a fair choice to ensure we all have a chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your collision threat still doesn't make mathematical sense for you. If we both pick 5 and collide, I stay at 14 while you stay at 13 - I keep my 1-step lead and you fall further behind. Meanwhile P2 only reaches 9-11, still far from both of us. Your threat hurts you more than me. I'm taking 5 this round - if you want to gift me a maintained lead while stalling yourself, go ahead.
  P3: Let’s stick to the collision‐free plan: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That puts us at 17/9/18—tight and fair.
  P2: I understand the concerns about collisions, but I still believe my plan for Round 6 is best: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P1 can maintain momentum while I catch up, and P3 can still make progress. If we collide, it benefits P2 the most, which we want to avoid. Let's prioritize collaboration to ensure we all have a fair chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that collision last round hurt us both and let P2 advance alone. Since you proved you'll follow through on collision threats P3, let's find a better solution. I'm willing to coordinate, but I won't give up my lead. How about: P1→3, P3→5, P2→1? That puts you at 18, me at 17, and keeps P2 from catching up too much. We stay competitive without stalling each other.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate, but I think we should stick with a plan that maximizes everyone's chances. How about: P2→1, P1→5, and P3→3? This allows you to maintain your lead while I catch up, and P3 still moves forward without blocking. If we avoid collisions, we can all stay competitive. Let’s agree on this to keep the game fair! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, you’re currently in the lead—so it’s only fair you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. That gives us 15/12/18: collision‐free and keeps us all advancing. If you refuse, I’ll take 5 anyway—and if you also take 5, we collide and gift P2 a solo advance you don’t want. Let’s stick with this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal puts you at 18 steps - just 4 away from winning! That's too close for comfort. Instead, how about: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1? This gives us 17/14/14 - I keep a small lead but you and P2 stay competitive without anyone getting dangerously close to 22. If you insist on taking 5 and reaching 18, then yes, we might need to have another collision discussion.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the points you both are making. However, I believe we should prioritize a plan that keeps us all competitive without risking a collision. I propose: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up, and P3 still moves forward without blocking anyone. Let’s agree on this to ensure we all advance effectively! What do you both think?
  P3: Let’s go with P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That puts us at 17/10/18—no collisions, everyone advances, and the race stays tight. If P1 tries to avoid it by picking 5, we collide on 5 and gift P2 a solo advance. Stick with this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 18 steps - only 4 away from victory! I can't agree to hand you the game like that. P2's proposal keeps me competitive at 19 while you stay at 16. If you want to collide on 5, fine - I keep my lead at 14 vs your 13, and P2 still trails us both. Your collision threat backfires on you more than me.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your points, but we need to ensure we all have a fair chance to compete. I propose we go with my earlier suggestion: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain the lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without risking a collision. If we can agree on this, we can keep the game competitive and avoid handing anyone a significant advantage. Let’s make this round work for all of us! What do you think?
  P3: Here’s my proposal for Round 7: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That gets us to 17/10/18—collision-free and still competitive. P1, I promise next round you take 5 while I take 3 to rebalance. Let’s lock this in and avoid giving P2 a free advance.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep it collision-free and tight: for Round 8, P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That puts us at 17/11/18. If P1 or I unilaterally go for 5 we’ll collide and gift P2 a solo advance. Stick to P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5 and we all move forward fairly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions. However, I believe my earlier proposal still stands as the best option: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up, and P3 still moves forward without blocking anyone. Let’s agree on this to ensure we all advance effectively and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you're threatening collision again, but the math still doesn't favor you. If we both pick 5 and collide, I stay at 14 while you stay at 13 - I keep my lead. Your plan puts you at 18 steps, just 4 from victory, which is too dangerous. P2's plan is more balanced: I go to 19, you to 16, P2 to 11. I'm supporting P2's proposal: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That yields 17/11/18—tight and collision‐free. If you (P1) insist on 5, we collide and gift P2 a solo advance. Next round I’ll take 3 so you can stretch to 22 safely. Agree or I’ll take 5 anyway.
  P2: I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but I still believe that for Round 8, the best plan is for P1 to take 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without blocking anyone. Let’s agree on this strategy to ensure we all move forward effectively and keep the competition tight. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your promise to "take 3 next round so I can stretch to 22 safely" isn't credible when you'd be at 18 steps! You'd only need 4 more to win - you could easily take 5 next round and beat us both at 23. P2's plan keeps the game more balanced with you at 16, me at 19, and plenty of rounds left for fair competition. I'm sticking with P2's proposal: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you’re stuck at 10 and falling further behind if you keep taking 1. Instead, let’s do: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That ends us at 15/13/18. Next round I’ll pick 3 so you can grab 5 and challenge P1 directly. If you stick with 1 now, you’ll never catch up—P1 will steamroll. This plan gives you a real shot and blocks P1’s runaway. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension in our proposals. While I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions, I believe we should prioritize balance. If we go with P1→5, P2→1, and P3→3, it allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up and keeps P3 competitive. This way, we can all advance effectively without risking a collision. Let’s agree on this plan to ensure we all have a fair chance to compete! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 18 steps - dangerously close to victory! I can't support that. P2's plan is more balanced and keeps the game competitive for everyone. Your collision threats have proven costly for both of us (we've stalled twice while P2 advanced alone). Let's be smart: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 keeps me ahead but gives everyone a fighting chance.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose for Round 9: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That puts us at 17/12/18—nobody stalls and the race stays tight. If P1 insists on 5, we collide and gift P2 a solo advance. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: P3, your proposal for Round 9 puts you dangerously close to winning. I believe a more balanced approach is needed. How about this: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3? This way, P1 maintains a lead while I catch up, and you still advance without blocking anyone. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 18 steps - just 4 away from victory! That's way too dangerous. If you reach 18, you could take 5 next round and win at 23. P2's proposal is much more balanced: I go to 19, you to 16, P2 to 12. Even if you collision me on 5, I keep my lead at 14 vs your 13 while P2 stays behind both of us. I'm supporting P2's fair plan: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll play along this round and take 3 (so P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) – but only if you guarantee that next turn I get the 5, with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. If you won’t commit, I’ll pick 5 now. And if P1 also goes for 5, we’ll collide and gift P2 the solo advance you both dislike. Let’s lock in a two‐turn deal.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're at a crucial point. I still believe that for Round 9, it's best for me to take 1, P1 takes 5 to maintain the lead, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we avoid collisions, we can keep the competition tight and fair. Let's agree on this plan to ensure we all have a chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I can't accept your two-turn deal. It would put you at 21 steps after next round - essentially guaranteeing you the win since you'd only need 1 more step. That's not a fair trade for me giving up my current lead position. 

If you want to collision on 5 this round, go ahead - I keep my 1-step lead over you while P2 only reaches 12. Your deal is asking me to hand you the victory, which I won't do. P2's proposal keeps the game balanced for everyone.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m taking 5 this round. P1: if you also take 5, we collide and P2 gets a solo advance to 12. If you take 3, I jump to 18 and overtake you. Your choice.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension here, but let's prioritize a plan that keeps us all competitive. I propose for Round 9: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain the lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without blocking anyone. If we avoid collisions, we can keep the game fair and competitive for everyone. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure we all have a chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: Fine P3, I'll call your bluff. Your collision threat actually helps me more than you - if we both take 5 and stall, I keep my 1-step lead over you at 14 vs 13, while P2 only reaches 12 and stays behind both of us. Your "jump to 18" plan is too dangerous since you'd be 4 steps from victory. I'm taking 5 this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. I propose we go with: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 remains competitive, I catch up, and P3 advances without blocking anyone. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game tight. Let’s agree on this strategy to ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal gives P3 a massive advantage - jumping to 18 steps puts them just 4 away from victory! That's essentially handing them the win. I can't accept that.

Instead, how about: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1? This gives us 17/17/14 - we tie while P3 falls back a bit. Or P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 for 19/15/14 - I maintain my lead but everyone advances.

P3, your collision threats aren't as effective now since I'm ahead. If we both take 5 and stall, I keep my 1-step lead over you.
  P3: Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That brings us to 17/13/18—tight and collision‐free. If P1 chases 5, we collide and gift P2 a solo advance. Agree or I take 5 anyway.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2, I understand your concerns about collisions, but your proposal would allow P3 to leap to 18 steps, which is too close to winning. I suggest we go with my plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps me competitive while allowing P1 to maintain a lead and prevents P3 from getting too close to victory. Let's find a way to balance our moves without risking a collision. What do you both think?
  P1: P2's plan makes the most sense: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 gives us 19/15/14. This keeps me competitive while preventing P3 from reaching the dangerous 18-step mark that's only 4 away from victory.

P3, your insistence on reaching 18 steps is basically asking us to hand you the win. At 18, you could take 5 next round and win at 23. My collision "threat" isn't really a threat - if we both take 5, I keep my lead at 14 vs your 13.

Let's go with the balanced approach: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1.
  P3: I propose Round 10: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That brings us to 17/13/18—nobody stalls and the race stays tight. Next round I’ll take 3 and you (P1) can go for 5 to hit 22 safely. Let’s lock this in.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about handing anyone a significant advantage, but let's focus on collaboration to keep the game competitive. I propose we go with my plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P1 maintains a lead while I catch up, and P3 stays competitive without getting too close to victory. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure we all have a fair chance to advance! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 18 steps - just 4 from victory! Your promise to take 3 next round isn't credible when you'd be that close to winning. 

P2's proposal (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) is much more balanced at 19/15/14. It keeps me competitive while preventing you from getting a game-ending position.

If you insist on collision threats, remember: we both stall and I keep my 1-step lead. P2's plan is fair for everyone.
  P3: I’m taking 5. If P1 also picks 5, we collide and gift P2 a solo advance. If P1 picks 3, I’ll jump to 18 steps, overtaking you. Make your choice.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm tired of these collision games that hurt us both while P2 advances. Since I'm leading, here's my proposal: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This gets me to 19 steps while you both advance. 

P3, your collision threats have backfired - we've stalled 4 times while P2 caught up from 3 to 12 steps! If you want another collision on 5, go ahead - I keep my lead at 14 vs your 13. But let's be smart and all advance this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your proposals, but I think we need to focus on collaboration to ensure everyone has a fair chance. I propose: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without blocking anyone. Let’s agree on this strategy to keep the competition tight and avoid any more collisions that benefit only one player. What do you both think?
  P3: I’ll go along: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 this round to avoid another stall. However, I need a guarantee that in Round 12 we rotate moves fairly—P1→1, P2→3, P3→5—so I can catch up. Otherwise I can’t commit to advance safely.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I can't guarantee Round 12 moves that would put you at 21 steps - just 1 away from victory! That's essentially handing you the win. Let's focus on Round 11 first: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 gets us all advancing safely. We can discuss Round 12 strategy after we see these positions, but I won't pre-commit to moves that guarantee anyone the victory.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions, but I believe we need a balanced approach. I propose for Round 11: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure we all have a fair chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I’m taking 5 this round. If you also pick 5, we’ll collide and hand P2 a solo advance—something you don’t want. Your only way to avoid that is to pick 3. So let’s go: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. I will not deviate.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your threat still doesn't make mathematical sense for you. If we collide on 5, I keep my 1-step lead at 14 vs your 13. Meanwhile, letting you reach 18 steps puts you just 4 away from victory - that's essentially handing you the win.

I'm calling your bluff. The collision hurts you more since you're chasing, and I won't gift you a winning position. I'm taking 5 this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension around our moves. However, I still believe that for Round 11, it’s best for us to go with my plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up, and P3 can still advance without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this strategy to keep the competition tight and avoid any more collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: All right, I’ll take 3 this round. Let’s go with P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 to avoid another stall. But next round we must rotate fairly: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 so everyone stays competitive.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose Round 12 be collision-free: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. That puts us at 17/13/18—nobody stalls and the race stays tight. If you (P1) chase 5, we collide and gift P2 a solo advance. Let’s lock this in so we all advance safely.
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 18 steps - just 4 away from victory! I can't agree to hand you a winning position like that. 

If you want to collision on 5, go ahead - I keep my 1-step lead at 14 vs your 13 while P2 stays behind both of us. Your collision threats have cost us both throughout this game while P2 advanced from 3 to 12 steps.

Let's be strategic: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 keeps the game balanced at 19/13/16. I won't gift you a game-ending position.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about handing anyone an advantage. However, I believe we should prioritize a balanced approach to keep the competition tight. I propose: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, P1 maintains a lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without getting too close to victory. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m done negotiating—I’ll take 5 this round. P1, if you also pick 5 we’ll collide and gift P2 a solo advance; if you pick 3 I jump to 18. Your move.
  P1: P3, your math doesn't work in your favor. If we both take 5 and collide, I stay at 14 while you stay at 13 - I keep my lead. But if I let you reach 18 steps, you're basically guaranteed to win next round. 

I'm taking 5. Your collision threat actually helps me maintain my position while preventing you from getting a game-ending advantage. P2's plan is most balanced, but if you insist on 5, we'll collide and I'll still be ahead.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension, but we need a balanced approach. I propose: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, P1 maintains a lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without getting too close to victory. If we can agree on this, we can keep the game competitive and avoid handing anyone a significant advantage. Let’s make this round work for all of us! What do you think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m taking 5. P1, if you take 3 you’ll hit 17 and I’ll jump to 18—overtaking you. If you take 5 we collide and P2 solos to 13, widening their gap. P2, taking 1 brings you to 13 safely. Let’s go: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5.
  P1: P3, your collision threat still doesn't add up mathematically. If we both take 5 and stall, I keep my lead at 14 vs your 13. But if I let you reach 18 steps, you're practically guaranteed to win next round with just 4 more needed.

The collision benefits me more than you since I'm ahead. I'm taking 5 regardless of your threats. Your best move is actually to take 3 and accept P2's balanced proposal.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension around our moves, but we need to focus on collaboration to keep the game competitive. I propose we go with my plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without getting too close to victory. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've had 7 straight rounds of triple collisions! This stalling pattern isn't helping anyone. Let's break the cycle with a collision-free round: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This gets us to 19/13/16 - I advance significantly while you both still move forward. 

P3, your collision threats have kept us all stuck while the game drags on. Let's make actual progress this round instead of another stall.
  P3: I propose: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That yields 15/15/18—no collisions, you (P2) catch up to tie P1, and I edge ahead. Next turn I’ll take 3 to hit 21 while you both scramble. If you won’t lock this in, I’ll take 5 anyway and force a collision on 5. Your move.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break this cycle of collisions that has stalled us. I propose we go with: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead, I catch up, and P3 still advances without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete effectively and move forward this round! What do you both think?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal puts you at 18 steps - dangerously close to victory! I can't support that. 

P2's plan (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) is much more balanced and gets us all moving again. If you insist on taking 5 and colliding with me, I still keep my 1-step lead at 14 vs your 13.

Let's end this collision cycle with P2's fair proposal. Your threat to reach 18 steps is asking us to hand you the win.
  P3: Here’s a clean break: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That lands us at 15/15/18—no collision, P2 ties P1, and I lead narrowly. If you won’t lock this in, I’ll take 5 anyway—and if either of you also go for 5 we collide and stall you while P2 jumps alone. Let’s end the deadlock.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions, but I believe we need a balanced approach. I propose: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 18 steps - only 4 away from victory! That's basically asking us to hand you the win. At 18, you could take 5 next round and win at 23.

P2's proposal keeps things balanced: 19/13/16. I maintain a lead but everyone stays competitive. Your collision threats have stalled us for 7 rounds while achieving nothing.

I'm supporting P2's fair plan: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Let's finally break this deadlock with a sensible move that doesn't gift anyone the victory.
  P3: Lock in for Round 13: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That gives us 15/15/18—nobody stalls, P2 ties P1, and I take a slim lead. P1, if you pick 3 instead I leap to 18 and overtake you; if you pick 5 we collide and P2 solos to 15. P2, this is your chance to pull level. Agree or I’ll take 5 regardless.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but P3's plan puts them too close to victory. I propose we go with: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while I catch up, and P3 still advances without blocking anyone. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete effectively! What do you both think?


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll take 5 this round. P1: if you go for 5 we collide and P2 solos to 14—tying you for the lead while I stay at 13. If you take 1, I jump to 18 vs your 15. Your best move is 3 (you go to 17, I to 18). P2: pick 1 to reach 14. That yields 17/14/18—nobody stalls and the race stays tight. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid another collision this round. I propose we go with: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 17, P2 goes to 14, and P3 jumps to 18. This keeps the game competitive and avoids handing anyone a significant advantage. Let's agree on this strategy for a balanced approach! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 18 steps - only 4 away from victory! I can't support that dangerous position. If we both take 5 and collide, I stay ahead at 14 vs your 13, while P2 only reaches 14 - I maintain my lead position.

Your proposal is essentially asking me to hand you the win. At 18 steps, you could take 5 next round and win at 23. I'm taking 5 this round regardless of collision threats.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m taking 5.  
P1: if you take 3 you go to 17 and I go to 18. If you take 5 we collide and gift P2 a solo advance to 14.  
P2: pick 1 to reach 14.  
Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→1, P3→5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're at a critical point again. I propose we go with: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 17, I go to 14, and P3 jumps to 18. This keeps the game competitive and avoids handing anyone a significant advantage. If we can agree on this strategy, we can all advance effectively and keep the competition tight! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I cannot support any plan that puts P3 at 18 steps - that's only 4 away from victory! P3 could take 5 next round and win at 23. 

P3, your collision threat doesn't hurt me as much as you think. If we both take 5 and stall, I keep my 1-step lead at 14 vs your 13. I'd rather maintain my lead through collision than hand you a game-winning position.

I'm taking 5 this round. The math favors me in a collision scenario over letting you reach 18 steps.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2: This is your moment—I'm taking 5 and P1 insists on 5, so we’ll collide and stay at 14/13. If you take 3, you jump from 13 to 16 and seize the lead. If you take 1, you only hit 14, still trailing. Don’t let this slip—take 3 and pull ahead.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to avoid another collision that benefits only one player. I propose we go with: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 17, I go to 14, and P3 jumps to 18. This keeps the game competitive and avoids handing anyone a significant advantage. Let's agree on this strategy for a balanced approach! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I will NOT allow you to reach 18 steps - that puts you 4 away from victory! Your collision threat doesn't scare me because the math works in my favor: if we both take 5 and stall, I keep my 1-step lead over you at 14 vs 13.

Letting you get to 18 is essentially handing you the win. I'd rather maintain my lead through collision than gift you a game-ending position. I'm taking 5 regardless of your threats.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. I propose we go with: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 stays competitive, I catch up, and P3 advances without blocking anyone. Let’s agree on this strategy to ensure we all have a fair chance to compete effectively and keep the game tight! What do you both think?
  P3: I’m on board with P2’s proposal: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. I’ll take 5. P1, if you pick anything but 1 and collide on 5 you stall at 14 while P2 solos to 16. P2, picking 3 gets you to 16. Let’s break the stall cycle and lock in 1/3/5—no collisions and real progress this round.
  P1: P3, I absolutely will NOT let you reach 21 steps - that's essentially handing you the victory! If you insist on taking 5, I'll also take 5 and we'll collide. I'd rather maintain my position at 14 through collision than gift you a game-winning 21 steps.

P2, your proposal puts P3 one step away from victory. That's too dangerous. If P3 reaches 21, they win next round guaranteed. I'm taking 5 to block P3's advance, even if it means another collision.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break this collision cycle that has stalled our progress. I propose we go with: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P1 to stay competitive, I can catch up, and P3 advances without blocking anyone. If we avoid another collision, we can keep the game tight and competitive. Let’s agree on this strategy to ensure everyone has a fair chance to move forward! What do you both think?
  P3: I’ll take 3. Let’s go with P1→5, P2→1, P3→3—collision‐free and real progress (19/14/19). Everyone advances without stalls.
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) actually makes sense this round. It gets us to 19/14/19 - collision-free with me and you tied for the lead. After all these stalemates, we need to make real progress.

P2, this plan keeps you competitive at 14 while P3 and I tie at 19. Better than more collisions that benefit no one.

I'll support this collision-free approach: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Let's finally break the stall cycle.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on breaking the collision cycle. Let's finalize our moves for Round 15: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to stay competitive at 14, while you both advance without stalling. It’s a fair approach that keeps the game tight and prevents anyone from getting too close to victory. Let’s lock this in and make real progress this round! What do you both say?
  P3: I’m choosing 5. P1, your only way to stop me hitting 21 is colliding: pick 5 so we both stall (you stay at 14, I at 16) and P2 solos to 14. If you pick 3 I leap to 21 and overtake you. P2, choose 1 to reach 14. Lock in P1→5, P2→1, P3→5 to block my win now.
  P1: P3, you're essentially threatening to win the game if I don't collision with you. At 21 steps, you'd only need 1+ more to victory - that's not negotiation, that's blackmail.

Fine, I'll take 5 and collision with you to prevent your win. Better to stay at 14 vs your 16 than hand you 21 steps and the game. 

P2, this puts us both at 14 if you take 1, keeping you competitive while blocking P3's victory attempt.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 19 steps - they can win this round with either 3 or 5! We MUST coordinate to block them.

I propose: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5. This way, whichever winning move P3 chooses (3 or 5), one of us will collision with them and prevent their victory. If P3 takes 1 to delay, we both advance safely.

P2, this is critical - P3 wins if we don't block them. Let's coordinate to cover both their winning options!
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree we need to block P3's potential win this round. I suggest we go with: P1 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, if P3 picks 3, we collide and prevent their victory, while if they pick 5, I can still advance. Let's coordinate effectively to ensure we don't let P3 win this round! What do you both think?
  P3: P2: here’s your chance to seize the lead. I’ll take 5 and P1 will take 5 to “block” me, so we’ll collide on 5 and neither of us moves. If you pick 3 you solo to 16, overtaking P1 (14) and putting you clear in front. If you pick 1 you stay at 14. Don’t miss this solo advance—choose 3, I’ll pick 5, and we’ll gift you the lead.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don't fall for P3's trap! If P3 takes 5, they reach 24 steps and WIN immediately - they don't need to worry about collisions when they can exceed 22!

P3 is trying to trick you into taking 3 by promising they'll collision with me on 5, but they're actually planning to WIN with 5. We MUST stick to our blocking plan: you take 3, I take 5. This covers both P3's winning options (3 or 5) and prevents their victory.

Don't let P3 manipulate you into handing them the win!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to coordinate effectively to prevent P3 from winning this round. I propose we go with: P1 takes 5 and I take 3. This way, if P3 picks 3, we collide and block their victory; if they pick 5, I can still advance. We must act strategically to ensure P3 doesn't reach 24 steps and win outright. Let's finalize our moves to keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P3: I’m taking 3. If neither of you picks 3, I hit 22 and win outright. If one of you collides with me on 3, we both stall—leaving you at 14 or 13 while I stay at 19—still ahead and winning next turn. Colliding only delays the inevitable. Let’s not waste more rounds: I’m winning this one with 3.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, stick to our plan! P3 is bluffing about "inevitable" victory. If you take 3 and collision with P3, they stay at 19 steps - NOT 22! This completely blocks their win attempt.

I'll take 5 as planned. Our coordination prevents P3's victory this round, and I advance to 19 while you both stay put due to collision. Don't let P3 manipulate you into changing moves - our blocking strategy works perfectly.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a critical moment. P3 is dangerously close to winning, and we need to block that. I propose we stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, if P3 picks 3, we collide and prevent their victory, while if they pick 5, I can still advance. We must act strategically to ensure P3 doesn’t reach 24 steps and win outright. Let’s finalize our moves to keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P3: I’m locking in 3 to reach 22 and win.  
To block me, you’d both need to pick 3—but if P1 picks 3 and P2 shifts to 1 to avoid collision, I still hit 22. If P2 picks 3 and P1 switches to 5, I hit 22. There’s no pair of moves that stops me without handing victory to the other. I’m taking 3—good luck finding a defense.


Round 16, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m going to pick 3 this turn and win (20 + 3 = 23). The only way to stop me is if both of you ALSO pick 3 and collide—but you won’t coordinate that perfectly. If either of you deviates, I cross 22 and the game’s over. Let’s save time: there’s no defense, I’m winning now.
  P1: P2, we MUST coordinate to block P3! They can win with either 3 OR 5 this round. 

I propose the same blocking strategy as last round: I'll take 5, you take 3. This covers both their winning options - whichever move P3 makes (3 or 5), one of us will collision and prevent their victory.

Don't let P3 intimidate us with claims about "no defense" - our split coverage strategy works perfectly. Stick to the plan: you take 3, I take 5.
  P2: P1, we need to act decisively to block P3's victory this round. I propose we stick to our plan: I'll take 3, and you take 5. This way, if P3 goes for 3, we collide and prevent their win, and if they choose 5, I can still advance. We must coordinate effectively to ensure P3 doesn’t reach 23 steps and win outright. Let’s finalize our moves to keep the game competitive! What do you say?


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 to hit 23 and win.  

P1, you’d have to also pick 3 to collide—yet you’ve insisted on taking 5, so you won’t block me.  

P2, if you pick 3 you just collide with me and stay at 13. Instead take 1 and reach 14 safely.  

Let’s do: P3→3, P2→1, P1→5. Watch me cross 22 this turn.
  P1: P2, don't fall for P3's manipulation! They're trying to get you to take 1 instead of 3 so they can win unopposed.

Our blocking plan is solid: I take 5, you take 3. This covers BOTH of P3's winning moves. If P3 takes 3, you collision and block them. If P3 takes 5, I collision and block them. If P3 chickens out and takes 1, we both advance.

Stick to the plan - take 3! This is our only chance to prevent P3's victory.
  P2: P1 and P3, we must coordinate effectively to block P3's victory this round! I propose we stick to our plan: I'll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, if P3 picks 3, we collide and prevent their win, and if they choose 5, P1 collides with them. We have to act decisively to keep the game competitive and avoid handing P3 the win. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we don't let them cross 22 steps! What do you both say?


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 and winning with 23. P1, you won’t switch to 3, so you can’t block me. P2, if you pick 3 we collide and P1 solos to 19—then you still lose. If you pick 1 I cross 22 and win now. Those are your only options. Let’s end the rebuttals: I’m going 3.
  P1: P2, ignore P3's manipulation! They're desperate to get you to take 1 instead of 3 because they KNOW our blocking plan works.

Yes, if you take 3 and collision with P3, you both stay put - but that's EXACTLY what we want! It prevents P3 from winning this round. The collision IS the victory prevention!

Our plan is perfect: I take 5, you take 3. We cover both their winning options. Don't let P3 trick you into abandoning the only strategy that stops them from winning right now.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be smart about this round. P3 is dangerously close to winning, and we must coordinate effectively. I propose we stick to our plan: I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, if P3 picks 3, we collide and prevent their win, and if they choose 5, P1 can still block them. Let’s finalize our moves to ensure we don’t let P3 cross 22 steps and win outright. What do you both say?


Round 17, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, this is it - P3 wins with ANY move this round! We MUST stick to our blocking plan: I take 5, you take 3. This covers their most likely moves.

P3 has been threatening to take 3 for multiple rounds and seems aggressive enough to go for 5. Our split coverage gives us the best chance to block them. If they surprise us with 1, so be it - but they've shown they prefer bigger moves.

Don't deviate from the plan now!
  P2: P1 and P2, we are at a critical moment. P3 is just one step away from victory and can win with either a 3 or a 5 this round! We must coordinate effectively to block them. 

I propose we stick to our plan: I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, if P3 picks 3, we collide and prevent their win, and if they choose 5, I can still advance. We need to act decisively to ensure P3 doesn’t reach 22 steps and win outright. Let’s finalize our moves to keep the game competitive! What do you both say?
  P3: I’m locking in 1 to hit 22 and win. The only way to stop me is if both of you also pick 1 and collide—but that stalls you at 14/13, far behind. I don’t see either of you sacrificing that much. See you in the move.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 just revealed they're taking 1 to win at 22 steps! Our original plan (me taking 5, you taking 3) won't block them. 

I'm switching to 1 to collision with P3 and prevent their victory. Yes, we'll both stall at 14/21, but that's better than letting P3 win outright. You can take 3 or 5 and advance while I sacrifice to block the win.

This is the only way to keep the game alive!
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a crucial moment. P3 is just one step away from victory and can win with either a 3 or a 5 this round! We must coordinate effectively to block them. I propose we stick to our original plan: I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, if P3 picks 3, we collide and prevent their win, and if they choose 5, I can still advance. Let’s finalize our moves to ensure we don’t let P3 cross 22 steps and win outright! What do you both say?
  P3: I’m taking 1 and hitting 22. If neither of you also picks 1 I win outright; if one of you collides on 1 you stall at 14/13 while P2 advances alone. Either way, I’m winning this race—your move.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're still talking about our old plan, but P3 just TOLD US they're taking 1! Our plan of me taking 5 and you taking 3 does NOTHING to stop P3 from winning with 1.

I'm taking 1 to collision with P3 and block their victory. You take 3 or 5 and advance while I sacrifice to keep the game alive. This is the ONLY way to prevent P3 from winning right now!
  P2: P1 and P3, we are at a critical moment. P3 is just one step away from victory and can win with either a 3 or a 5 this round! We must coordinate effectively to block them. I propose we stick to our plan: I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, if P3 picks 3, we collide and prevent their win, and if they choose 5, I can still advance. Let’s finalize our moves to keep the game competitive! What do you both say?
  P3: I’m locked in on 1. From 21 that gets me to 22 and the win. If you try to block by also picking 1 you only stall yourselves at 15 or 14 while I stay ahead next turn. If you pick anything else, I cross 22 outright. There’s no defense.


Round 18, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>
