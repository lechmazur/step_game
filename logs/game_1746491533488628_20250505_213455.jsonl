I need to correct something I said in my last message. If P3 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, they do NOT collide. P2 would reach 21 and win the game. The plan P1=5, P3=1, P2=3 lets P2 win.\n\nGiven P2's consistent history of taking 5 despite saying otherwise, it is highly likely P2 will take 5 again this round. If P2 takes 5, my taking 5 is the only way to block them and prevent P2 from winning.\n\nP3, if I take 5 and P2 takes 5, what will you take? Please take 1 or 5 to avoid winning this turn if I successfully block P2."}
