You're saying if P1 takes 5 and I take anything other than 1, you somehow win next round? That makes no sense.\n\nBoth of you are basically asking me to voluntarily give up my lead by taking just 1 step. Why would I do that when I'm in a winning position? \n\nP1, you keep saying you \"must\" take 5, but if we collide, you stay stuck at 4 while P3 advances to 8. That doesn't help your position at all.\n\nI think I'll take whatever move gives me the best chance to win, not whatever move makes the game \"fair\" for you two."}

My past bluffs have made my words meaningless and locked us in this spiral. We both know a collision is now a victory for P3, who will almost certainly take 3 and create a three-way tie.

The only question is if you're willing to risk taking 3 for the win, knowing my history. It's your gamble to make, not mine."}

Your pattern of saying one thing and doing another has made any coordination impossible.\n\nP3, if you really take 1 like you claim, then this comes down to whether P1 will finally break their pattern or stick with their historical choice. But their credibility is completely shot."}
