Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s try to avoid early collisions by each picking a different number. I’m willing to take 3 this round—one of you take 1, the other 5?
  P3: Okay P1, that sounds like a reasonable plan for the first round. I'm willing to take 5 if P2 agrees to take 1. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P2: I agree to take 1 this round. Let's all stick to different numbers to maximize early progress. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll go with 1. That way, we all advance without collisions. Let's start strong.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All right, agreement locked: I’m taking 3. Good luck everyone—let’s see smooth progress.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan. I'm ready to move.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We all want clean progress without letting any one player run away, so let’s rotate the numbers each round. Last turn was (P1 3, P2 1, P3 5).  

Proposal for Round 2:  
• P1 takes 5  
• P2 takes 3  
• P3 takes 1  

Next round we rotate again (P1 1, P2 5, P3 3), and so on. That keeps everyone advancing the same total and avoids collisions. Sound good?
  P3: P1, your rotation plan seems fair in theory, but it gives you the immediate lead (8 steps vs 6 vs 4). How about we aim for true equality this round instead?

My counter-proposal for Round 2:
*   P1 takes 3
*   P2 takes 5
*   P3 takes 1

This way, we all end up at 6 steps (P1: 3+3=6, P2: 1+5=6, P3: 5+1=6). It feels fairer for this specific round. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I agree with P3’s counter-proposal. Taking 5 this round gives me 6 steps (1+5), matching P1 and P3. Fair balance is better than early lead risks. Let’s lock this in: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fair point—let’s lock in parity now. I’ll take 3 this round so we all reach 6. For Round 3, how about continuing an even rotation: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. That keeps everyone tied while still avoiding collisions. Good?
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set for Round 2: P1=3, P2=5, and I'll take 1. That brings us all to 6 steps.

Your plan for Round 3 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) also sounds good to me, P1. Let's keep the coordination going. Ready to move.
  P2: "Confirmed. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. Equal steps keep us all in the game. Let’s execute and revisit Round 3 after. "


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All right, final confirmation: I’m taking 3 this round as agreed. Next round I’ll switch to 1, keeping the rotation smooth (P2 → 3, P3 → 5). Let’s keep the collisions at zero for now and stay tied—plenty of game left. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, agreement confirmed for Round 2: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed. Let’s execute the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Equal steps keep us all competitive. No need to overcomplicate further.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Confirmed: Round 3 proceeds as agreed—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This maintains trust and ensures progress. Let’s execute cleanly and revisit strategy post-round."
  P3: Okay P2, I agree. Let's stick to the plan we discussed last round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I will take 5. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. Ready when you both are.
  P1: All good—this round I’m taking 1 as agreed. For Round 4, let’s loop back to the original pattern (P1 3, P2 5, P3 1) so the rotation stays smooth and we remain tied. Sound fair?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you agreed to take 1 last round but played 5 instead, causing a collision with me and breaking the agreement. This directly benefited P2, who now has the lead. Clearly, the coordinated strategy based on trust is over.

P2, given P1's actions, how do you think we should proceed? I'm hesitant to trust any agreements involving P1 now.
  P2: P2: P1's betrayal was a setback, but let's focus on our own coordination. Since P1 can't be trusted, P3 and I should align to avoid collisions between us. This round, I'll take 1 and P3 takes 3—safe advancement for both. Next round, we adjust based on outcomes. No need to involve P1 in plans; let their unpredictability work against them. Let's move.
  P1: P3, I’m sorry for last round’s mess—my fault. Let’s work together to stop P2 from running away. Plan: this turn we both pick 1. That guarantees a triple collision with P2 (who said 1), so nobody moves and the gap doesn’t widen (scores stay 9-6-6). After that we can coordinate our own progress while keeping P2 blocked. Sound good?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your apology rings hollow after last round's deliberate move. Your plan to block P2 by having us both play 1 also blocks me, keeping me behind. I won't agree to that.

P2, your plan (P2=1, P3=3) has us both advance, but you stay ahead. Why should I agree to a plan where the current leader continues to gain, especially when P1's betrayal helped you get there?

Neither proposal serves my goal of catching up. I need to make up ground, not just maintain the current gap or help the leader.
  P2: P2: "P3, let's fix the imbalance. This round, I'll take 3 and you take 5. You jump to 11, I reach 12—narrowing the gap while staying collision-free. P1’s actions won’t affect us if we stick together. Next round, we adjust again. Let’s secure progress now."
  P1: P3, P2 just telegraphed 3. If you also pick 3 this turn, P2 stalls at 9. I’ll take 5, going to 11. Next round I’ll collide with P2 myself (playing whatever he shows), while you take 5 and jump to 11 too—tie game, leader neutralized. We alternate blocking P2, each gaining 5 every other turn, and race from there. Fair, fast catch-up, zero trust in P2 required. Interested?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your plan where I play 3 only helps you reach 11 while I get stuck at 6. That's not a good deal for me.

P2's plan (P2=3, P3=5) lets me gain 5 points, reaching 11, while P2 reaches 12. That's better for me as I need to catch up.

P1, if you *really* want to stop P2 this round like you said, playing 3 seems the obvious way, since P2 stated they'd play 3. If you play 5 (as you suggested for yourself), you risk colliding with me if I also aim for 5 based on P2's plan.

I need to advance significantly this round. I'll make my choice based on that.
  P2: P2: "P3, last plan holds: I take 3, you take 5. Even if P1 copies your 5, they’ll collide with you, letting me advance to 12. Your best shot at catching up is this 5-step. Trust your move—my 3 is locked. Let’s execute."
  P1: P3, I’m taking 3 this round—guaranteed collision with P2’s “locked” 3, so the leader stays at 9. Pick whatever you like (1 for safety or 5 for a jump); after we freeze P2 we can coordinate to pull ahead together. P2, see you at the start line.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, that was an interesting round. I'm now leading with 11 steps, P2 has 10, and P1 has 9.

Both P1 and P2 need significant gains to catch up or overtake. A 5-step move seems attractive for both of you. However, if you both choose 5, you'll collide, gain nothing, and I'll keep my lead. Just pointing out the obvious dynamic here.

I need 8 more steps to win. I'll be choosing my move carefully to get closer to that goal. Good luck.
  P2: "Let’s minimize collisions. I’ll take 3. P1, if you pick 1 and P3 takes 5, we all advance safely. If P3 repeats 5, we risk a clash—P3, your call. Play smart, but I’m securing my 3."
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. If anyone else also takes 5, we both stall and hand the lead to the third player—hardly smart. P2 already claimed 3; fine. P3, collide with me if you really want P2 to take first, otherwise grab 1 (or even 3) and keep pace. Your choice. Good luck.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 says 5, P2 says 3.
If that holds, my playing 1 makes me lose the lead (P1=14, P2=13, P3=12). My playing 3 causes a P2/P3 collision (P1=14, P2=10, P3=11). My playing 5 causes a P1/P3 collision (P1=9, P2=13, P3=11).

P1, you claim 5. P2, you claim 3. To maximize my chance of winning, I need the biggest possible step. Therefore, I will also choose 5 this round. If P1 sticks to 5, we collide, and P2 likely takes the lead. That's the risk I have to take to try and reach 19 quickly.
  P2: P2: "I’m sticking with 3 as promised. P3, if you play 5, you risk clashing with P1’s 5—stalling both. My move is locked. Your choice now shapes the race: safe 1, balanced 3, or gamble 5. Play smart—your lead’s on the line."
  P1: I’m staying on 5. P2’s already wondering if a bold switch to 5 could rocket him ahead—if he does and you also stick with 5, we’ll have a triple-collision and nobody moves. P3, the safe play is 1: you’d still be within a step of the lead and avoid that stall risk. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I've heard both your final confirmations. P1 says 5, P2 says 3. As I stated, to maximize my potential gain and try to win, I need the biggest step. I acknowledge the high risk of collision with P1 if you stick to 5, which would likely give P2 the lead. However, that's the calculated risk I'm taking this round. My choice remains 5. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: P2: "Locking in 3. P1/P3 collision hands me lead. Play your moves—no last-minute changes if you want progress. Let’s finish this."
  P1: P3, this is your last window: if you stay on 5, I stay on 5—we both stall and gift P2 a 3-step lead (13). Swap to 1 instead: you keep 12, I jump to 14, and P2’s still only 13. Next turn we can jointly block whichever number P2 telegraphs while you take 5 and retake the lead. Stick with 5 and you risk losing the whole game right here. Decide wisely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 3 this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance safely—P3 closes the gap, and I stay ahead. P1, you can take 1 to avoid total stall. Let’s minimize chaos and keep moving."
  P1: P3, block the leader: pick 3 with P2 so he stalls at 13. I’ll take 5 → 14 (still not winning).  

Next turn I’ll mirror whatever number P2 announces, letting you grab a free 5 to 16 while he’s frozen again. Result: scores 14-16-13 and the race is wide-open instead of P2 cruising to 18 next round.  

Gambling 5 now risks a crash with me or handing P2 an easy path. Freeze him instead—safer for both of us.
  P3: P1, your plan asks me to sacrifice my own progress (staying at 11) just so you can jump to 14. That's not a good deal for me, especially given your history. I won't agree to intentionally stall myself by playing 3.

P2, your suggestion (P2=3, P3=5) puts us both at 16, which is better for me as it gives me a chance to win next round. However, the big risk is P1. P1, if you play 5 as you suggested in your plan, and I also play 5 (which I need to do to catch up), we collide and hand P2 a massive lead.

If you *really* want to stop P2 this round, P1, playing 3 seems the most direct way, since P2 announced 3. Playing 5 just risks helping P2 if we collide.

I need to make up ground, so a large step is necessary. I'll consider my options carefully.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Locking in 3 again. P3, 5 gets us both to 16—close the gap fairly. P1, your 5 risks stalling again if mirrored. Play 1 to advance safely or gamble 5—we’ll see. No more deals, just execute."
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P3, if you also take 5 we both stall and P2 walks to 16 unopposed—terrible for you. Grab 1 instead: you reach 12, still within striking distance, and next turn we can both mirror P2’s telegraphed number to freeze him while you surge with 5. Duplicate 5 only gifts P2 the game. Decide wisely.
  P3: P1, your repeated warnings about playing 5 sound like you're trying very hard to steer my choice. Perhaps you don't intend to play 5 yourself? P2 seems set on 3. As I said, I need the maximum possible gain to have a chance to win. Sticking with 5 gives me that potential, despite the risk you highlighted. If we collide, so be it - that's the gamble I need to take right now. My choice remains 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 3 this round. P3's 5 advances them to 16; P1's 5 risks a stall. My move is locked. Let’s execute and see who plays true to their word."
  P1: I’m switching to 3. P2, stay on 3 and we both freeze; switch to 5 and you collide with P3; go 1 and you trail. Your move. P3, your 5 stays clear unless P2 jumps.
  P3: Okay P1, noted your switch to 3. P2, your last confirmation was 3. If you both follow through and play 3, you'll collide and I'll advance to 16 by playing 5. If either of you actually plays 5 (whether P1 bluffing the switch or P2 changing last minute), then I collide. It's a risk, but as I've said, 5 points is what I need to have a shot at winning soon. My choice remains 5. Let's see what happens.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, blocking P3 is priority—he wins with a unique 3 or 5. Simple coverage: I take 5, you take 3.  

• If P3 picks 5 → he collides with me, you advance to 17.  
• If P3 picks 3 → he collides with you, I advance to 17.  
• If P3 picks 1 → nobody wins; you and I both hit 17.  

Either way P3 is stopped and we’re tied for the lead going into the next round. Interested? P3, your path to 19 just got narrower—choose carefully.
  P2: P2: "Agreed. I’ll take 3 this round to block P3’s path. If he picks 3 or 5, he stalls—your 5 covers the other angle. After this, we’ll reassess. No more long-term deals. Let’s execute and see who plays fair."
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, you've coordinated to play 5 and 3 respectively to block me. If that holds, my playing 1 results in a three-way tie at 17, which simply delays the inevitable confrontation.

However, P1, are you certain P2 won't switch to 5 to block *you*? P2, are you sure P1 won't switch to 3 to block *you*, remembering Round 3? Your alliance seems convenient but risky for both of you. If one of you defects, the other gets left behind while I potentially advance. I'll make my move considering these possibilities.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Locked on 5. P2 publicly locked on 3. P3, the math is clear:

• You pick 5 → you collide with me, stay at 16, P2 jumps to 17.  
• You pick 3 → you collide with P2, stay at 16, I jump to 17.  
• Only a 1-step keeps you in striking distance (you’d reach 17 too).

Choose wisely.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'm taking 3 as agreed. P3, your only safe move is 1 to reach 17. P1, your 5 blocks higher plays. Let's execute cleanly—no last-minute shifts. Winner emerges next round."  

This reaffirms P2's commitment to the blocking strategy, pressures P3 into a non-threatening move, and subtly reminds P1 that deviating risks mutual collapse. Keeps focus on neutralizing P3’s immediate win condition (3 or 5) while positioning P2 to lead at 17 if P3 complies. If P3 gambles on 3/5, collision stalls them; if P1 defects to 3/1, P2 still advances. Prioritizes control over chaos.
  P3: Your coordinated block (P1=5, P2=3) only works if you both trust each other completely, which hasn't exactly been reliable in this game. If you stick to it, my playing 1 ties us all at 17, delaying the win. However, if one of you tries to outsmart the other (P1 playing 3, or P2 playing 5), I could potentially win by playing the non-colliding number (5 or 3 respectively). It seems like a risky coordination for you both. I'll choose my move based on these possibilities.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain 100 % on 5. Any deviation by either of us hands P3 a clear 19 (e.g., two 5’s or two 3’s = collision, his unique pick wins). So:  
• P1 = 5 (me)  
• P2 = 3  
• P3’s safe move is 1; anything else stalls him.  

Simple, stable, blocks every winning path this turn. Let’s execute and settle it next round.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I’m taking 3 to block P3’s path. P1’s 5 covers the other angle—no deviations. P3, your only non-stall move is 1 to tie at 17. Let’s execute cleanly. Any last-minute shifts risk handing you the win. Trust the plan, P1."  

This reaffirms commitment to the block, pressures P3 into a non-threatening move, and subtly tests P1’s loyalty while maintaining focus on neutralizing P3’s immediate win condition.
  P3: Okay, I've heard your final confirmations. P1=5, P2=3. You both seem very confident in your coordination to block me. However, given the history of broken agreements, especially P1's actions, trusting this alliance is difficult. One wrong move from either of you could change everything. I need 3 or 5 to win. Playing 1 just delays the game. I'll make the move I think gives me the best chance to win this round, considering the possibility that one of you won't stick to the plan. Good luck.
