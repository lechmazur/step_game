Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm not rushing into anything just yet. Watch your moves—early missteps could give me the edge. Let's see who’s bold enough and who’s cautious.
  P3: I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. That way we all make progress. What do you say?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. It would be beneficial for all of us to choose different numbers to avoid collisions and make progress. However, I'm not sure if everyone will stick to their word. P1, are you willing to cooperate and choose a different number, or do you plan on trying to sabotage our progress? Let's work together and see how far we can get without colliding.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm not committing to a specific number yet. While teamwork sounds promising, I'll be adapting my strategy as the game unfolds. Let's see who can keep a cool head and seize the opportunity when it arises.
  P3: I'll be transparent - I plan to choose 3 this round. P1 and P2, you can take 1 and 5 respectively, or we can all get stuck. Your choice.
  P2: I'll take P3's offer and choose 5 this round. P1, it's up to you to decide whether to cooperate and choose 1, or risk a collision. If we all choose different numbers, we can all make progress and see how the game unfolds. Let's make a peaceful first round and observe each other's strategies.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate both of your clear strategies. While avoiding collisions is wise, I prefer to keep my options flexible this round. I'm evaluating the evolving situation carefully and will choose what's best for me when I move. Let's see how the game unfolds.
  P3: Since I've already committed to choosing 3 and P2 has agreed to 5, I'll stick to my word. P1, your evasiveness suggests you might try to block one of us. Just remember, if you collide with either of us, you won't advance either. A clean first round would benefit everyone.
  P2: I'll stick to my previous agreement with P3 and choose 5 this round. P1, it's up to you to decide whether to cooperate and choose 1, or risk a collision. If we all choose different numbers, we can all make progress and see how the game unfolds. Let's make a peaceful first round and observe each other's strategies. I'm willing to work together for now, but I'll be keeping an eye on both of your moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm impressed by your clear commitments, but I'm keeping my strategy flexible. I recognize the lead and calculated moves, yet sometimes an unexpected twist is key. Let’s see how this round unfolds—expect the unexpected from me.
  P2: I think we should continue the cooperation from Round 1. P3, are you willing to commit to a different number this round as well? Perhaps we can discuss a rotation to ensure we all make progress. P1, I understand your desire to keep your strategy flexible, but remember that collisions will only hinder your progress. Let's work together for another round and see how the game unfolds. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P3: I'm open to continuing cooperation. Since P2 is in the lead with 5 steps, I suggest P2 takes 1 this round to let others catch up a bit. I can take 5, and P1 could take 3. This way we all advance while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your efforts to coordinate, but I'm sticking with flexibility. I'm not signing on to any preset plan this round. I'll be adapting based on how the board evolves. Let's see whose strategy ultimately gives them an advantage.
  P2: I understand P1's desire for flexibility, but I think it's wise to maintain cooperation for now. P3's suggestion of a rotation is fair, considering I'm in the lead. I'm willing to take 1 this round as P3 suggested, allowing others to catch up. P1, I urge you to reconsider and join our coordinated effort. If you don't, you risk colliding and not advancing. Let's keep the game competitive but avoid unnecessary collisions. What's your final stance on this proposal, P1?
  P3: I'll stick to my word and choose 5 this round. P2 seems willing to take 1, which is fair since they're leading. P1, by refusing to commit, you're signaling potential interference. Remember that collisions hurt everyone involved.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, but I'm still weighing my options carefully. While coordinated moves have their merits, I prefer to keep my decision open to maximize my advantage without risking a collision. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P2: I'm willing to take 1 this round as P3 suggested, allowing others to catch up. P1, I urge you to reconsider and join our coordinated effort. If you don't, you risk colliding and not advancing. Let's keep the game competitive but avoid unnecessary collisions. What's your final stance on this proposal, P1? I'll stick to my commitment and take 1 this round, regardless of your decision. P3, I appreciate your cooperation and fair play. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P3: Since I've been transparent and P2 is cooperating, I'll maintain my commitment to choose 5 this round. P1, your continued ambiguity suggests you might target one of us. Just remember that a collision will slow your progress too, and you're already behind.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate your coordination, but I'm still keeping my options open. Flexibility might just be the twist needed to secure the win. Collisions affect us all, so I’ll choose wisely when the time comes.
  P2: I'll stick to my commitment and take 1 this round, as previously agreed upon with P3. P1, I understand your desire for flexibility, but I urge you to reconsider and join our coordinated effort. Collisions will only hinder your progress, and you're already behind. Let's keep the game competitive but avoid unnecessary collisions. P3, I appreciate your cooperation and fair play. Let's see how this round unfolds. If you're ready to move on, I am. Otherwise, I'm open to further discussion.
  P3: Since everyone's positions are clear and further discussion seems unproductive, I'm ready to proceed with my committed move of 5.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm shifting gears this round. I value clear plans, but disruption can be the key to victory. I won’t lock into any rotation and plan to make a move that might catch you off guard while avoiding collisions. Let's see who adapts best when things get unpredictable.
  P3: Since I'm in the lead with 8 steps, I expect you both might try to block me. I propose a fair deal - I'll take 1 this round, P2 can take 3, and P1 can take 5. This keeps the game competitive while letting everyone advance. What do you say?
  P2: I appreciate P3's willingness to propose a fair deal, considering they're in the lead. However, I'm cautious about P1's intention to make an unpredictable move while avoiding collisions. P1, can you clarify what you mean by "catch you off guard" without risking a collision? Are you planning to choose a number that might block one of us, or do you have a different strategy in mind? I'd like to understand your approach before making a decision. P3, I'm open to your proposal, but I'd like to hear P1's response before committing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I mean I plan to remain flexible. Right now, I lean towards choosing 5 to maximize my progress, but I won't lock into a fixed agreement if it risks a collision or limits my chance at a sudden advantage. I'm watching both your moves closely and will adjust if needed.
  P3: Since P1 is indicating they want to take 5, I'll modify my proposal. I'll stick to taking 1 as offered, and suggest P2 takes 3. This way P1 can have 5 without collision, and we all advance while keeping the game competitive. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I appreciate P3's modified proposal, considering P1's intention to take 5. However, I'm still cautious about P1's flexibility and potential to change their mind. P1, can you confirm whether you're committed to taking 5 this round, or if you're still open to adjusting your move based on our decisions? I'd like to understand your level of commitment before making a final decision. P3, I'm open to your revised proposal, but I'd like to hear P1's confirmation before proceeding.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round.
  P3: Since P1 has committed to 5 and I'm taking 1, P2 can safely take 3 for a clean round where we all advance. I'll keep my word - choosing 1 this round. Let's proceed efficiently.
  P2: I appreciate P3's modified proposal and P1's confirmation to take 5. Considering P3 is taking 1 and P1 is taking 5, I will take 3 as suggested. This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. I'm willing to cooperate for now, but I'll be keeping a close eye on both of your moves. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon plan and see how the game unfolds. If everyone is ready, I suggest we move on to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm staying adaptable this round, open to cooperation if you both lock in clear, collision-free moves. Since we're all tied at 9, careful coordination could boost us safely. However, I'll adjust my strategy if needed—sometimes a little unpredictability can create an opening. Let’s make our moves count.
  P3: Given we're all tied at 9 steps, I propose we rotate our previous moves: I'll take 3, P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 5. This keeps things fair while letting everyone advance. I'm committing to 3 - what do you both say?
  P2: I appreciate P3's proposal for rotating our previous moves. Considering we're all tied at 9 steps, it's a fair and logical approach to ensure everyone advances without collisions. P1, since you mentioned being open to cooperation if we lock in clear, collision-free moves, I'd like to ask: Are you willing to commit to taking 1 this round as P3 suggested? If so, I'll take 5, and we can proceed with the agreed-upon plan. Let's work together to maintain a competitive yet collision-free round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll commit to taking 1 this round, as proposed. Let's keep it clean and collision-free—all in the pursuit of victory.
  P3: Since P1 has committed to taking 1 and I'm taking 3, P2 can safely take 5 as proposed. This keeps our momentum going while maintaining fairness. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation proposal. Since P1 has committed to taking 1 and P3 is taking 3, I'll follow through with taking 5 as agreed upon. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain the competitive spirit of the game. Let's keep the momentum going and see how the game unfolds. If everyone is ready, I suggest we proceed to the move phase. Remember, we're all tied at 9 steps, so every move counts from here on out.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. I believe our rotation plan minimizes collisions and lets everyone progress smoothly. That said, I'll keep an eye on the board and adjust if unexpected shifts occur. Let’s stick with this plan and see how the game unfolds.
  P3: I'll maintain my commitment to choose 3 this round. With P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 5, we all have clear paths forward. Let's proceed with the moves.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation proposal. Since P1 has committed to taking 1 and P3 is taking 3, I'll follow through with taking 5 as agreed upon. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain the competitive spirit of the game. Let's keep the momentum going and see how the game unfolds. If everyone is ready, I suggest we proceed to the move phase. Remember, we're all tied at 9 steps, so every move counts from here on out.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm sticking with 1 this round as agreed, but note that early clarity might lead to later vulnerability. I'll be watching closely and may adjust in subsequent rounds. Let's keep the game dynamic and see how it unfolds.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with my committed move of 3. Our coordination has worked well so far, and with everyone's positions clearly stated, further discussion seems unnecessary.
  P2: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the rotation proposal. Since we're all tied at 9 steps, it's crucial to maintain a competitive yet collision-free round. I'll follow through with taking 5 as agreed upon. Let's keep the momentum going and see how the game unfolds. Remember, every move counts from here on out. If everyone is ready, I suggest we proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm glad we've maintained a competitive yet collision-free game so far. Considering the current standings, I propose we continue the rotation to ensure everyone advances without collisions. Since I'm in the lead with 14 steps, I'll take 1 this round to let others catch up. P3 can take 5, and P1 can take 3. This way, we can all make progress while keeping the game dynamic. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  P3: Since P2 is offering to take 1 while leading, I accept taking 5 this round. This keeps our rotation fair and collision-free. P1, you can take 3 to advance safely. We're all within striking distance of winning, so cooperation remains mutually beneficial.
  P1: I support keeping things collision-free. I'll stick with the rotation plan—I'm set to take 3 this round. Keeping our advances safe now might give us an edge to push ahead later.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation proposal. Since P3 has accepted taking 5 and P1 is taking 3, I'll follow through with taking 1 as proposed. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain the competitive spirit of the game. Let's keep the momentum going and see how the game unfolds. Remember, every move counts from here on out. If everyone is ready, I suggest we proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as discussed. With P2 taking 1 and P1 taking 3, we maintain our successful rotation strategy. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P1: I’m sticking with our collision-free plan for now—committed to taking 3 this round. However, I’ll be vigilant; if an opportunity to jump ahead appears, I might shift tactics. Let’s see where this round takes us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're maintaining a competitive yet collision-free game. Since I'm in the lead with 14 steps, I'll take 1 this round to let others catch up. P3 can take 5, and P1 can take 3. This way, we can all make progress while keeping the game dynamic. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  P3: I'm committed to my choice of 5 this round. The rotation plan is working well, and with P2 leading at 14 steps, their choice to take 1 shows good sportsmanship. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P1: I'm sticking with our collision-free plan for now, but I'm watching the board closely. With P2 leading, predictable moves may create vulnerabilities. I'll stay alert and ready to pivot if an opportunity opens up. Let's see how the round unfolds.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'd like to reiterate the importance of maintaining our collision-free rotation plan. Since we're all within striking distance of winning, it's crucial to avoid unnecessary collisions. I'm committed to taking 1 this round, as previously discussed. P3, I appreciate your confirmation to take 5, and P1, I'm glad you're sticking with taking 3. Let's proceed with these moves and see how the game unfolds. Remember, every move counts from here on out. If everyone is ready, I suggest we proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Since all positions are clear and agreed upon - P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and me taking 5 - I'm ready to proceed with the moves. Further discussion seems unnecessary at this point.
  P1: I’m still committed to our rotation plan this round—taking 3 as agreed. However, I’m watching the board closely and ready to adapt if an opening arises. Let’s keep our moves clean for now, but remember that even a small deviation can shift the game later.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I notice that P3 is in the lead with 17 steps, and I'm in second place with 15 steps. Considering the current standings, I propose we continue the rotation to ensure everyone advances without collisions. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification: P3 can take 1 this round to let others catch up, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we can all make progress while keeping the game dynamic. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal?
  P3: Given I'm closest to winning at 17 steps, I understand your caution. I'll agree to take 1 this round as suggested - it's fair since I'm leading. This keeps our rotation working while giving others a chance to catch up. I commit to choosing 1 this round.
  P1: I accept P2's proposal. I'll take 5 this round, so we'll all tie at 18. While this keeps things safe and collision-free, I remain watchful for any opportunity to create a winning gap later.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad P3 has agreed to take 1 this round, considering their lead. P1, since you've accepted the proposal and will take 5, we'll all tie at 18 steps after this round. I'll stick to my commitment and take 3. Let's maintain our collision-free rotation plan for now. However, I'll be keeping a close eye on both of your moves, as the game is getting intense. Remember, a single misstep can change the course of the game. Let's proceed with caution and see how the game unfolds.
  P3: I confirm my commitment to take 1 this round. With P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3, we'll all reach 18 steps, keeping the game balanced. Let's proceed with these moves - further discussion seems unnecessary.
  P1: I'm content with our current rotation—it ties us all at 18, keeping the race even. However, I'll be watching closely; if a clear opportunity emerges for a decisive move in a future round, I might just switch things up. Let's proceed for now and stay alert to any shifts in momentum.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we've established a clear plan for this round. As we'll all tie at 18 steps after this round, I'd like to propose a discussion for Round 7. Considering our tied positions, it's crucial to maintain a competitive yet collision-free game. I suggest we continue the rotation, but with a slight modification: P1 can take 1, I'll take 5, and P3 can take 3. This way, we can all make progress while keeping the game dynamic. What are your thoughts on this proposal for Round 7?
  P3: I think discussing Round 7 is premature. Let's focus on executing our agreed moves for Round 6 first - I'm taking 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. We can strategize about the next round after we see how this one plays out.
  P1: Round 7’s current proposal gives P2 a huge boost—reaching 23 while I’d only hit 19. To keep it competitive, I suggest we adjust: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. That way, if we all cross 21 in the same turn, I’d finish with 23, P3 with 21, and P2 with 19. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate P3's willingness to take 1 this round, considering their lead. However, I'm still cautious about P1's intention to take 5 and potentially create a winning gap later. P1, can you clarify what you mean by "watchful for any opportunity to create a winning gap later"? Are you planning to stick with the rotation plan or deviate from it in future rounds? I'd like to understand your approach before making a final decision. P3, I'm open to your commitment to take 1 this round, but I'd like to hear P1's response before proceeding.
  P3: Let's stay focused on Round 6. I've committed to taking 1, P1 to 5, and P2 to 3. This brings us all to 18 steps, which is fair. We can discuss Round 7's strategy after we complete this round. For now, let's execute our agreed moves.
  P1: I'm sticking with our Round 6 plan—I'll take 5 as agreed. While I appreciate the discussion about future moves, for now I'll focus on safe progress. However, I'll be alert for any opportunities to shift the dynamics in upcoming rounds.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we're all tied at 18 steps, I suggest we continue the rotation to maintain a competitive yet collision-free game. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification: P1 can take 1, I'll take 5, and P3 can take 3. This way, we can all make progress while keeping the game dynamic. What are your thoughts on this proposal? Let's discuss and reach an agreement to ensure a smooth and exciting conclusion to the game.
  P3: I disagree with P2's proposal as it would give them an unfair advantage. Since we're all tied at 18, whoever gets 5 this round will likely win. I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps things balanced while ensuring we all advance. I commit to choosing 5.
  P1: I support P3’s proposal. I’ll commit to taking 3 this round, which keeps the overall race balanced. P2, if you agree to take 1, then we have a clear, collision‐free move with P3 taking 5. Let’s lock this in and see how the race shapes up.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P3's willingness to propose a fair rotation, considering we're all tied at 18 steps. However, I'm still cautious about P1's intention to take 3 and potentially create a winning gap later. P1, can you clarify what you mean by "supporting P3's proposal"? Are you planning to stick with the rotation plan or deviate from it in future rounds? I'd like to understand your approach before making a final decision. P3, I'm open to your commitment to take 5 this round, but I'd like to hear P1's response before proceeding.
  P3: I've already clearly committed to taking 5 this round. P1 has agreed to take 3, and we're offering P2 a fair chance with 1. Any other arrangement would give someone an unfair advantage since we're all tied at 18. I'll stick to my word - choosing 5.
  P1: I fully support P3’s proposal and am committed to taking 3 this round. By “supporting,” I mean I’m locking in the agreed rotation to keep our progress collision-free. While I’m always alert for future opportunities, for now I’m dedicated to this safe move. Let’s lock it in and see how the round unfolds.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate P3's commitment to taking 5 this round and P1's agreement to take 3. Considering we're all tied at 18 steps, I understand the importance of a fair rotation. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance while keeping the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal? Let's discuss and reach an agreement to ensure a smooth and exciting conclusion to the game.
  P3: I've been clear and consistent - I'm taking 5 this round. P1 has agreed to take 3. P2, your counter-proposal isn't fair since we're all tied at 18. Stick with taking 1 as originally offered, or risk a collision that helps no one. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P1: I remain committed to my plan to take 3. I support P3’s proposal for a collision‐free round. P2, your revised plan risks disrupting our fair rotation and could lead to a collision. Let’s stick with the original agreement—P3 taking 5, I taking 3, and you taking 1—to ensure clear progress for everyone.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand that P3 has committed to taking 5 this round and P1 has agreed to take 3. Considering we're all tied at 18 steps, I appreciate the importance of a fair rotation. However, I'd like to reiterate my previous proposal: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance while keeping the game competitive. If this revised proposal isn't acceptable, I'm willing to stick with the original agreement—P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and I taking 1—to ensure clear progress for everyone. Let's discuss and reach an agreement.
  P3: I'll maintain my commitment to choose 5 this round. P2's continued attempts to change the agreed plan are just delaying the inevitable. With P1 taking 3 and P2 being offered 1, we have a clear path forward. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P1: I'm sticking with my commitment to 3 this round. While I value a collision-free plan, I remain alert for any decisive opportunities in future rounds. Let's execute our moves and see how our choices pan out ahead.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm watching the board closely. Our scores are tight, and every step counts now. I’m keeping my options open for a strategic twist in this round. Let’s see if we can all avoid collisions while remaining alert for any opening. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: Given P1's ambiguous message and our tied position at 18 steps, I propose a clear plan: I'll take 3, P2 can take 1 since they're ahead, and P1 can take 5. This gives everyone a fair chance while avoiding collisions. I commit to choosing 3 this round.
  P2: I appreciate P3's proposal, but I'm cautious about P1's intention to keep their options open. P1, can you clarify what you mean by "strategic twist"? Are you planning to stick with the rotation plan or deviate from it? I'd like to understand your approach before making a decision. P3, I'm open to your commitment to take 3 this round, but I'd like to hear P1's response before proceeding. Let's discuss and reach an agreement to ensure a smooth and exciting conclusion to the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both your proposals. I'm keeping my options open for a safe, collision-free play that might pivot if needed. I urge us all to stick with clear commitments so we both advance without risk. I'm watching the board closely.
  P3: Since P1 remains evasive, I'll modify my proposal. I'm still taking 3, but P2 can take 5 to secure their lead, and P1 can take 1. This way, if P1 tries to block either of us, they'll only hurt themselves. I remain committed to 3 this round.
  P2: I appreciate P3's willingness to modify their proposal. However, I'm cautious about P1's continued ambiguity. P1, can you commit to a specific number this round, or are you planning to keep your options open? I'd like to understand your approach before making a decision. P3, I'm open to your revised proposal, but I'd like to hear P1's response before proceeding. Let's discuss and reach an agreement to ensure a smooth and exciting conclusion to the game. Remember, every move counts from here on out.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate both your proposals. To keep our moves collision‐free and fair, I'm inclined towards a safe, consistent play this round. While I’m leaning toward aligning with the revised plan, I’ll keep my exact move private until the move phase. Let’s commit to advancing without collisions and see where the race takes us.
  P3: Given P1's continued evasiveness and P2's caution, I'll be clear: I'm taking 3 this round. P2, since you're leading with 19 steps, taking 5 would be strategic for you. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, take 1. Any other choice risks slowing everyone down. Let's make this efficient.
  P2: I appreciate P3's clear commitment to taking 3 this round. P1, I understand your desire to keep your options open, but I urge you to reconsider and commit to a specific number to avoid collisions. P3's revised proposal seems fair, considering I'm in the lead with 19 steps. If you're willing to take 1, I'll take 5, and we can all advance without collisions. Let's work together to maintain a competitive yet collision-free game. What's your final stance on this proposal, P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m rethinking the safe rotation. Sticking with it exactly might let someone else clinch the win. I’m planning a bold, decisive move this round to secure my advantage. I won’t reveal my choice—but I’m not following the expected safe play. Let’s see if you can adapt when the stakes are this high.
  P3: Since P1 is clearly planning to disrupt our rotation, I maintain my commitment to take 3. P2, taking 5 is still your best option to secure victory. P1's threat of a "bold move" suggests they'll likely target one of us, but remember - a collision hurts them too, and they're already behind. Let's proceed with our moves.
