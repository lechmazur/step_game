P3 is one step away from winning. I propose: P1, you take 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we can both make progress while potentially blocking P3. P3, you can take 1 to avoid a collision. If we keep colliding, P3 will win by default. Let's focus on advancing and not just blocking. What do you say? We need to act decisively now."}
