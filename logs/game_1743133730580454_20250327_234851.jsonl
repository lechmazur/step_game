If we rotate who gets the 5 each round, we all benefit equally and consistently. I suggest this order for the next three rounds: P3 gets 5 this round (since they lost out last round), I take 5 next round, and P1 goes third. This balances fairness and rebuilds trust. If we can't agree, we're stuck risking collisions and letting luck decide. Thoughts?"}
