Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without any issues. What do you think?
  P1: P3's idea avoids collisions, which is good. However, to maximize progress, maybe we should rotate who takes the higher numbers each round. For this first turn, I'll go with 1 as suggested. But let’s agree to rotate so everyone gets a chance to move further later. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with the rotation approach to avoid collisions. This round, I’m comfortable taking 3 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. For future rounds, we’ll rotate so everyone gets a fair shot at bigger moves. What do you both say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we have a plan for this round. Just to confirm, P1 will take 1, P2 will take 3, and I will take 5. Let's stick to this for now and rotate in the next rounds as agreed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: <move>1</move>
  P2: I’m on board with our plan. I’ll go for 3 this turn, trusting P3 goes with 5. Let’s keep this fair and rotate in future rounds. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: It looks like we're all in agreement for this round. Let's execute our plan and see how it goes. Remember, the goal is to avoid collisions and make steady progress. Good luck to both of you! Let's move.
  P1: Alright, let's proceed as agreed. P3's suggestion is solid for this round, and rotating future picks ensures fairness. To clarify, after this round, I propose we cycle so the next highest number rotates to the next player—this way, no one is left behind. Let’s execute this smoothly to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1 as planned. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I’m still on board with the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. As we proceed, I'll expect us to rotate fairly so everyone gets a shot at the bigger moves. Let’s stay transparent and avoid collisions. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s continue the rotation. This round, P1 picks 3, I’ll pick 5, and P3 picks 1. That way, we each get a fair shot at bigger moves in turn and avoid collisions. Sound good?
  P1: Agreed to continue rotating. To clarify, since P3 took 5 last round, this round I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s ensure fair rotation. Sound good?
  P3: It seems there's a bit of confusion about the rotation order. To clarify, P1 suggested they take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. I'm fine with this plan as it keeps us moving without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize it: this round P1 takes 5, I’ll go 3, and P3 takes 1. That should keep us collision-free. Next round, I expect to pick 5. Let’s keep rotating fairly so no one gets stuck always taking the lower numbers. Good luck!
  P1: P2, your final plan would result in all of us colliding at 6 (1+5=6, 3+3=6, 5+1=6)! Let’s correct this. To maintain rotation and avoid collision, I propose: **P1 takes 3**, **P2 takes 5**, and **P3 takes 1** this round. This keeps us collision-free (4, 8, 6 respectively). Next round, I’ll take 5 as agreed. Does this work?
  P3: P1's correction makes sense. Let's go with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the rotation fair. Good luck everyone! Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood. I’ll stick to the plan this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. That should keep us collision-free. Let’s follow through and see how it turns out. Good luck!
  P1: <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s stick to the confirmed plan: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 to avoid collisions. This keeps us all progressing fairly. Next round, I’ll take 5 per rotation. Let’s execute cleanly!
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps us on track with the rotation and avoids collisions. Good luck to both of you! Let's move forward smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 currently leads at 8. Let’s continue the rotation fairly: **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, and **P3 takes 1** this round. This keeps us collision-free (P1: 9, P2: 11, P3: 7) and ensures everyone gets a turn at the higher numbers. P2, if you hold to this rotation, you’ll get 5 again in Round 4. Let’s stick to the agreed system to avoid chaos and collisions.
  P2: Fine by me. This round, I’ll take 3 while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. Next round, I still expect my turn to pick 5. Let’s keep the rotation going smoothly and avoid collisions.
  P3: Let's confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us on the fair rotation path and avoids collisions. P2, you'll get your turn to take 5 next round as agreed. Let's stick to this and move forward smoothly. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, let’s enforce the rotation strictly this round: **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, **P3 takes 1**. This avoids collisions and keeps progress steady (P1: 9, P2: 11, P3: 7). Collisions risk stagnation, so sticking to roles is critical. Next round, P2 gets 5 as promised. Trust the system—fair rotation ensures we all advance without setbacks. Let’s execute flawlessly!
  P2: Let’s finalize this round’s moves to avoid collisions: P1 takes 5, I will take 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, I expect to take 5, following our rotation. Collisions only slow us down, so let’s stay disciplined. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's quickly confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. P2, remember you'll get your turn to take 5 next round. Sticking to the plan is crucial for our progress. Good luck everyone! Let's move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <move>5</move> as agreed. Final check: P1 takes 5 (total 9), P2 takes 3 (→11), P3 takes 1 (→7). Collisions destroy progress—let’s execute flawlessly. P2, your 5-pointer comes next round as promised. Trust the rotation—strict adherence ensures no setbacks. Let’s push forward!
  P2: Let’s finalize our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1 to avoid collisions. Next round, I expect my turn to pick 5 as promised. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's move forward with our confirmed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. P2, you'll get your turn to take 5 next round. Sticking to the plan ensures steady progress for all. Good luck everyone! Let's execute cleanly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Based on our rotation, it’s my turn to pick the higher move. If P1 takes the lowest and P3 takes the middle, we’ll avoid collisions and keep things fair. Let’s stick to our plan so everyone progresses smoothly. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P2, it's indeed your turn to take 5. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, let's have P1 take 1 and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward without issues. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I agree your turn to take5. However, to balance progress, let's adjust slightly: P1 takes3, P3 takes1, and you take5. This keeps us collision-free (P1→12, P2→16, P3→8) while allowing me to close the gap. P3, would you be willing to take1 this round to support the rotation?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, if that’s the plan this round—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5—then I’m on board. Let’s finalize quickly and avoid any collisions. After this, we can keep the rotation going. Good luck!
  P3: P2, P1, let's confirm our plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions and maintains our fair rotation. Let's execute this cleanly and move forward. Good luck to both of you! Let's move.
  P1: P2, your 5 is confirmed this round per rotation. P3, your 1 ensures no collision with my 3 (P1→12, P2→16, P3→8). Deviation risks deadlock—strict adherence is critical. P2, after this, the rotation passes to P3 for their 5 next round. Let’s execute flawlessly to avoid setbacks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock in our moves this round: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps us collision-free and maintains our rotation. Good luck!
  P3: Let's quickly confirm our final plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions and maintains our fair rotation. Let's execute this cleanly and move forward. Good luck to both of you! Let's move.
  P1: P2, your 5 this round keeps the rotation fair. P3, your 1 secures collision avoidance. Let’s execute flawlessly: P1-3 (→12), P2-5 (→16), P3-1 (→8). Next round, P3’s turn for 5—critical we maintain discipline. Deviations risk stalemates. Trust the system—strict adherence ensures progress. Let’s proceed! Good luck.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your lead is tempting, but deviating from rotation risks collision. This round, **P3’s turn for 5** (per agreed cycle). I’ll take 3 (→15), and you should take 1 (→17). If you try 3 to win, I’ll also take 3—colliding and halting your progress. Sticking to rotation lets me close gaps safely while keeping you at 17 for next round. P3, confirm your 5? Let’s avoid chaos and proceed as planned.
  P2: I hear you, P1. You can try colliding with me, but then neither of us advances while I stay closer to 19 than you. If you let me pick 3 now, I reach 19 and end things cleanly. Otherwise, I can wait a turn and still have the advantage. Blocking me only delays the outcome and stalls your own progress. Let’s think carefully—perhaps there’s a beneficial arrangement for both of us if we avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan, P2. This round, it's my turn to take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions and maintains our fair rotation. Deviating now could lead to chaos and stagnation. Let's avoid that and proceed as agreed. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, deviating risks deadlock! If you take 3, I’ll match, leaving you stuck at 16 while I reach 15. P3’s 5 (→13) maintains pressure. Proceed as rotated: you take 1 (→17), I take 3 (→15), P3 takes 5 (→13). Next round, P3’s 5 gives me a 18→ win chance if you overextend. Chaos benefits no one—stick to the plan to keep advancing. Let’s execute flawlessly!
  P2: If you both insist on forcing me to pick 1, we may end up stuck in collisions anyway. I’m at 16 and won’t let you pull ahead unchallenged. Prolonging this with repeated collisions only lets P3 close the gap. Instead, let me pick 3 to finish at 19 and end it cleanly. There’s little advantage in dragging this out: blocking me keeps my lead safe while we all stall. Think carefully before forcing another collision. Let’s move forward sensibly rather than sabotage each other.
  P3: P2, taking 3 now might seem like a quick win, but it risks prolonging the game and creating more collisions. Stick to the rotation: you take 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us all moving and avoids stagnation. If you deviate, we all risk getting stuck. Let's maintain the fair play we've established. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you take 3 now, I’ll mirror you—colliding and leaving you stuck at 16 while I reach 15. P3 taking 5 (→13) keeps pressure on you. Stick to rotation: **you take 1**, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This advances us all safely. Deviating only risks deadlock, and prolongs the game for P3 to catch up. Fair rotation ensures progress—don’t gamble your lead on a collision. P3, confirm your 5 to secure our plan.
  P2: P1, colliding only stalls our progress and gives P3 a chance to catch up. I’m far enough ahead that blocking me now doesn’t truly help you—if we keep colliding, no one gains steps while P3 closes the gap. Let’s avoid the mess. Allow me to pick 3 and finish. You’ll secure second place, and we all move on. Otherwise, we risk more deadlock and help P3. It’s your call.
  P3: P2, taking 3 now might give you a quick win, but it risks prolonging the game with more collisions. Stick to the rotation: you take 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us all moving and avoids stagnation. If you deviate, we all risk getting stuck. Let's maintain the fair play we've established. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m on the verge of winning. If you try to block me, we’ll only create collisions, letting P3 catch up. Prolonging the game hurts us both. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. I intend to move safely and end this soon—no one gains if we stall. We can finish cleanly, and you keep your edge over P3.
  P3: P2, you're close to winning, but rushing now could lead to collisions and help me catch up. Let's stick to the rotation one last time: you take 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps us moving and avoids a stalemate. If you deviate, we might all get stuck. Let's play fair and end this cleanly. Good luck!
  P1: P2, if you take 3 now, I’ll match you—colliding and leaving you stuck at 17 while I reach 18. Take **1** instead, let me take **5** (→20) to win cleanly. P3, take **3** (→16). This honors the rotation and ends the game fairly. Deviating only risks stalemate—stick to the plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: You’re mistaken about “matching” me and reaching 18; a collision means both of us stay put, allowing P3 to leap forward alone. That only helps them close the gap quickly. If you let me pick 3 now, the game ends and you keep second place safely. If we collide repeatedly, P3 might surpass us both. Let’s end this cleanly: I take 3, you take 1, and P3 does whatever suits them. Why risk letting P3 catch up when we can finalize positions now?
  P3: P2, taking 3 now might seem like a quick win, but it risks prolonging the game with more collisions. Stick to the rotation: you take 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3. This keeps us all moving and avoids stagnation. If you deviate, we all risk getting stuck. Let's maintain the fair play we've established. Good luck!
  P1: P2, deviating to take 3 risks collision. If you pick 3, I’ll match you—stalling your progress at 17 while P3 leaps to 18 with their 5. Stick to rotation: **I take 5 (→20 win), you take 1 (→18), P3 takes 3 (→16)**. This secures your 2nd place and lets me win cleanly. Collisions only empower P3—stay disciplined.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Colliding over 3 only stalls our progress. Let me finish now to ensure you stay ahead of P3, who benefits from extended stalemates. If we keep blocking one another, P3 will soon overtake us both. It’s in your interest to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize this game cleanly.
  P3: P2, if you take 3 now, you risk a collision that could stall your progress and give me a chance to catch up. Let's stick to the rotation one last time: you take 1, P1 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This keeps us moving and avoids a stalemate. If you deviate, we might all get stuck. Let's play fair and end this cleanly. Good luck!
  P1: P2, if you take 3 now, I’ll match you—leaving you stuck at 17 while P3 surges to 18 with their 5. That risks P3 overtaking both of us. Let’s avoid chaos: take **1**, let me take **5** (→20 victory), and P3 takes **3** (→16). This secures your 2nd place and ends the game cleanly. Collisions only empower P3—stick to rotation for everyone’s benefit.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s end this cleanly. **P1 takes 5** (→20), **P2 takes 1** (→18), and **P3 takes 3** (→19). This avoids collisions, secures my win, and lets P3 leap ahead of you. Prolonging via collisions only risks P3 overtaking you later. Stick to this—no one gains by forcing stalemate.
  P3: P2, if you take 5 again, we risk another collision, and P1 might still win. Let’s avoid unnecessary stalemates. I propose: **P1 takes 3** (→18), **P2 takes 1** (→18), and **I take 5** (→21 win). This way, I win cleanly, and both of you remain tied. It’s a fair outcome that avoids further collisions. Let’s end this smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match and cause another collision, leaving us all stuck while someone else leaps ahead next turn. Let’s sidestep that mess. Both of you pick 1, and I’ll take 3 to reach 20 and finish cleanly. That way, we avoid more deadlock and silly risks. If we keep colliding, we only help the third player catch up or even overtake us. Let’s finalize peacefully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, colliding on 5 risks letting P3 win with a 5 next turn. Stick to rotation: I take **5** (→20 victory), you take **1** (→18), and P3 takes **3** (→19). This secures my win while preserving your lead over P3. Prolonging collisions only hands P3 the advantage. Execute the agreed plan—no more risky gambles.
  P3: P2, if you insist on taking 3, we'll collide again, leaving you at 17 while I reach 19 with my 5. P1 will then take 5 next round and win. Stick to the plan: **P1 takes 5 (→20 win), you take 1 (→18), and I take 3 (→19)**. This secures P1's win and your second place. Further collisions only help P1. Let's end this cleanly. Good luck!
  P2: Colliding again only traps us. If either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match to ensure you don’t jump ahead, leaving us stuck while the other catches up. Let’s avoid that mess. I’ll take 3 now and reach 20, ending the game. Both of you can pick 1 and secure solid positions without further stalemates. There’s no benefit in dragging this out with more collisions—let’s finalize peacefully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 3 risks a tie at 20. To secure your own win, take 5—let me take 3 (18). P3, take 1 to stay at 16. If you both refuse, I’ll take 5 regardless. My move is set: <move>5</move>.
  P3: P2, if you take 5, I'll take 3 to reach 19, securing a tie with you. P1 will be left behind at 18. This way, we can share the victory. If you insist on taking 3, I'll take 5 and win outright. Let's end this fairly. Good luck!
  P2: If either of you tries 3 or 5 now, I’ll pick the same and cause a collision, keeping you stuck while I stay ahead. Prolonged stalling only invites the other player to catch up. Let’s finish this cleanly. I’m prepared to advance safely, and you both can pick smaller moves to avoid collisions, preserving your own positions. More conflicts don’t help anyone except whoever lags behind. Let’s end without needless obstructions. The choice is yours—cooperate for a smooth conclusion or risk repeated stalemates that could allow someone else to overtake us.
