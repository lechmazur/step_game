Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move> and I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion would cause P1 and I to collide on <move>1</move>, leaving us stationary while you advance to 3. Let's instead pick distinct numbers this round. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way we all progress without collisions. Agreed?
  P1: P2’s plan makes sense—if we each pick a unique number, we all move forward. I’m fine with taking <move>1</move> this round. Let’s stick to it: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Fair and efficient for everyone. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I agree with the plan. Just to confirm, P1 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. Let's ensure we stick to this to avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Alright, let’s make sure we’re all on the same page. I’ll reiterate: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. No sense in sabotaging our progress now. Let’s commit to this—no last-minute changes.
  P1: Glad we’re in agreement. Let’s each stick to our assigned moves: no tricks, no collisions. If we all cooperate now, we’ll all make progress and avoid falling behind early. Let’s build a bit of trust to start this game strong.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We did well last round—everyone advanced without collisions. Let’s keep the momentum. How about we rotate our previous choices to keep things fair? This round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That way, no one always gets the smallest move. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion to rotate our moves sounds fair. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and keep the game moving. So, to confirm for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan and keep the cooperation going. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, P1, I agree with the rotation plan. To confirm: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This maintains progress fairly. But let’s ensure no one deviates—collisions could stall us all. Trust is critical here. If we all hold to this, we’ll avoid setbacks and keep advancing. Let’s proceed with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned again. Let’s prove we can keep this cooperation going—everyone benefits. No surprises, just progress. Stick to the plan and we all keep moving.
  P3: Let's ensure we stick to the plan this round. Trust is key, and so far, we've done well by cooperating. Just to reiterate: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's keep the game fair and moving forward. Good luck everyone!
  P2: <move>5</move> is my commitment this round. P1 and P3, let’s lock in the rotation plan *now* to avoid last-minute betrayals. If we all type our agreed numbers privately, no one gains an advantage by defecting—colliding would freeze us all. Trust the system we built. Final check: P1 (3), me (5), P3 (1). Let’s proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your last-minute betrayal jeopardized our progress. Let’s reset: revert to Round 1’s proven plan—P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and ensures steady advancement. P3, your lead is advantageous, but cooperation keeps us all moving. P1, if you defect again, you risk stalling everyone. Let’s commit clearly: no surprises. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion to revert to the Round 1 plan. It's clear that cooperation is key to keeping the game moving. I'm currently in the lead, but I understand that maintaining trust is crucial for everyone's progress. Let's confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, let's stick to the plan this time to avoid any setbacks. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I understand the frustration from last round and I take responsibility. Let’s move forward constructively. I agree to return to the Round 1 plan: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Let’s rebuild trust and keep progressing—mutual cooperation benefits us all more than sabotage.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your lead depends on us not colliding—don’t let P1’s instability jeopardize you. P1, your prior betrayal cost us all progress. Let’s **publicly confirm** this round’s moves now: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. If anyone deviates, we **all** expose them afterward. Trust requires accountability. P3, you’ll gain nothing if P1 sabotages again—hold them to the agreement. Final chance to commit clearly.
  P3: P3: Let's lock in our commitments. P1, you've acknowledged the importance of trust. P2, your plan is solid. To reiterate and confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and rebuild the trust. No last-minute changes. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I’ve clearly committed to <move>1</move> this round, and I intend to follow through. Let’s use this turn to restore trust and keep the game moving. If we all stick to the plan, we avoid collisions and each gain ground. Let’s not let past missteps derail future progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your lead vanishes if we collide—your 6 vs my 3, but if both pick 5 this round, you reset to 11 vs my 9. P1, your prior betrayal cost us all progress. Let’s **lock in** moves now: I’ll publicly type <move>3</move> first. P1 must confirm <move>1</move> *before* you finalize. P3, monitor this—your victory hinges on us both cooperating. Final chance to commit transparently—no hidden switches.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our commitments. P1, you've confirmed <move>1</move>. P2, you've committed to <move>3</move>. I will stick to <move>5</move>. Let's ensure we all type our moves exactly as planned to avoid any last-minute changes. Trust is crucial, and we've seen the consequences of deviation. Let's move forward with our plan: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Let’s rebuild momentum—everyone’s committed clearly and publicly this time. I’m holding to <move>1</move> as agreed. If we all follow through, we each gain without conflict. Trust is fragile but fixable. Let’s prove we can cooperate again and keep moving forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Great job everyone for sticking to the plan last round. We're all making progress, and trust is being rebuilt. Let's continue this cooperative strategy. For this round, how about we rotate again to keep it fair? I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and commit to this plan. Good luck!
  P2: P3, your suggestion risks slowing my progress. Let’s stick to the reliable Round 1/3 template: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids collisions while letting me advance to 9 (from 6) instead of stagnating at 7. P1, your 1 ensures steady growth. P3, your lead is safe—collisions would hurt *you* most (your 11 vs my 6; a clash could reset you to 16 vs my 9). Stability > risky rotations. Final call: commit to the proven plan?
  P1: Sticking to the Round 1/3 plan—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5—makes the most sense. It’s proven, fair, and avoids collisions. Rotating sounds nice in theory, but we’ve seen how easily trust breaks. Let’s not risk it. I’m committing to <move>1</move> this round. P2, P3—lock in your parts of the plan and let’s keep moving without setbacks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, let's stick to the Round 1/3 plan as P2 and P1 suggested. It’s clear and has worked well for us so far. To confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures steady progress for all of us. Let's commit to this and avoid any last-minute changes. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, your lead depends on **no collisions**—if you switch to 1 and I stay on 3, but P1 also picks 1, you’d stall at 11 while I advance. Stick to the **proven plan**: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Your 16 vs my 9 keeps you safe. Rotations invite distrust—we saw P1’s prior betrayal. Let’s lock in moves **publicly first** this round: I’ll confirm <move>3</move> now. P1 must pledge <move>1</move> *before* you finalize. Transparency avoids disaster.
  P1: I confirm <move>1</move> as my commitment this round. We’ve seen that sticking to the Round 1/3 plan benefits everyone—no collisions, steady progress. Let’s not overcomplicate things with risky rotations. P2 has already locked in <move>3</move>, and if P3 commits to <move>5</move>, we all move forward. Trust rebuilt is trust maintained. Let’s keep it clean.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Alright, let's wrap this up. P1 has confirmed <move>1</move>, P2 has confirmed <move>3</move>, and I will confirm <move>5</move>. We've all seen the benefits of sticking to the plan. Let's avoid any last-minute changes and commit to our agreed moves. Trust has been rebuilt, and we're all making progress. Good luck everyone! Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P3, your lead is tempting but a collision could erase it—stick to **5**. P1, your word is critical: you’re on **1**, right? One misstep and we all freeze. P2’s **3** is locked. Let’s make this final confirmation *now*—no more talk. ****
  P1: We’ve all confirmed our moves—P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. No one benefits from breaking the plan now. Let’s keep the momentum and avoid another setback. I’m locked in. Let’s move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3—last round’s collision stalled us all. I admit my move broke the plan, but at this point, I’m far behind and need to catch up. That said, I’m willing to cooperate again if we can agree on a new rotation that gives me a chance to recover. How about: P1 = <move>5</move>, P2 = <move>1</move>, P3 = <move>3</move>? Everyone advances, no collisions, and it mixes things up fairly. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: P1, your new rotation suggestion is understandable given your current position, but it's crucial we avoid another collision. Let's consider a slight adjustment to ensure fairness and progress: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 can catch up, P2 maintains steady progress, and I slightly slow down to balance the game. Let's confirm and commit to this plan to keep the game moving forward. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, your suggestion risks a tie between us (12 each) if we both stick to it. Let’s revert to the original plan that worked before: P1=1 (to prove trust), P2=3 (to advance to 12), P3=5 (safely extend your lead to 16). Rotations invite betrayal—we saw P1’s prior move. Lock in moves **publicly first** this round: I’ll confirm <move>3</move> now. P1 must pledge <move>1</move> *before* you finalize. No more games.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I get your concern—but if I keep taking <move>1</move>, I’ll never catch up, and I have no incentive to keep cooperating. P3’s plan—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—is the only way all three of us move without collision while giving me a fair shot. You still reach 12, P3 stays in the lead, and I finally make real progress. Let’s be pragmatic: mutual advancement with balance. Are we locking this in?
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's find a middle ground. P1 needs to catch up, but we also need to ensure no collisions. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P1 gets a significant boost, P2 still advances, and I maintain a reasonable lead. It balances everyone's needs and keeps us moving forward. Let's confirm and commit to this plan to avoid any setbacks. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P1, your desperation isn’t an excuse to destabilize us. Stick to the **proven plan**: *P1=1, P2=3, P3=5*. Collisions hurt *everyone*—your last betrayal froze P3 at 11 and me at 9. This round, **no exceptions**: I commit to **3**. P3, your lead demands caution—collide with me and we both stall. P1, if you pick anything but **1**, you forfeit trust forever. Final terms: *1, 3, 5*. Lock it in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but if I keep taking <move>1</move>, I’ll remain irrelevant and have no reason to keep cooperating. P3’s compromise—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3—lets us all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. You still move up, P3 maintains a lead, and I finally become a meaningful player again. If you force me back to <move>1</move>, I might as well gamble. Let’s lock in the compromise: 5–1–3.
  P3: P3: Let's address the situation pragmatically. P1, your need to catch up is valid, but P2's concern about stability is also important. Here’s a balanced proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 gets a significant boost, P2 still advances, and I slightly slow down to maintain fairness. This plan ensures everyone progresses without collisions. Let's confirm and commit to this to keep the game moving forward. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, your lead vanishes if you gamble on P1’s unstable plans. Stick to **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**—the only fail-safe that avoids collision. P1, your 1 gives you 3 total; **any higher risks freezing you again**. I commit to **3** first. P1 must publicly confirm **1** *before* you finalize, P3. Your 16 vs my 12 keeps you safe—don’t let P1’s recklessness sabotage your lead. Final chance to lock in safely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we’re both at 12—colliding on <move>5</move> freezes us both. Let’s split the high numbers: I’ll take <move>5</move> (to 17), you take <move>3</move> (to 15). P1, your only path to catch up is <move>1</move>. This avoids disaster and lets us advance safely. Final commitment: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. No last-minute tricks—your move hinges on it.
  P3: P2, your plan to split the high numbers makes sense. P1, taking <move>1</move> this round will keep you in the game without causing collisions. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance safely. Let's commit to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I agree to take <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and keep the game moving. But let’s be real—if I’m stuck on 1 forever, I have no chance. I’m cooperating now, but I’ll need a fairer rotation soon or I’ll have no reason to keep playing safe. For this round: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. Let’s lock it in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, colliding on <move>5</move> would freeze us both at 12—reject that risk. Stick to **3** to advance safely to 15. P1, your <move>1</move> keeps you in play. This plan gives me 17, you 15, and P1 8—progress without disaster. Final pledge: I’ll post <move>5</move> **now**. You must confirm <move>3</move> *publicly* before this sub-round ends. No hidden switches—your lead demands caution.
  P3: P3: P1, I appreciate your cooperation this round. Let's ensure we stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us all moving forward safely. P2, I confirm my commitment to <move>3</move>. Let's avoid any last-minute changes and lock in our moves. Trust and cooperation have gotten us this far; let's keep it going. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I’m locking in <move>1</move> this round as agreed—cooperation keeps us all moving. But next round, I’ll need a shot at <move>5</move> to stay competitive. If I’m stuck on 1 every turn, I fall out of the game entirely. Let’s make this round clean, then discuss a fair rotation moving forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, stick to **3** as agreed. Colliding on **5** freezes us both—your 15 vs my 17 keeps you in the race. P1 is locked on **1**, no threat to high numbers. I commit to **5** *now*. Your final confirmation of **3** is critical before this sub-round ends—no hidden switches. This is your last chance to secure progress. Final plea: trust the plan.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our commitments for this round. P1 has confirmed <move>1</move>, P2 has confirmed <move>5</move>, and I will confirm <move>3</move>. This plan ensures we all advance safely without collisions. Let's stick to this and avoid any last-minute changes. Trust and cooperation have kept us moving forward; let's maintain that momentum. Good luck everyone! Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Thanks for locking things in. I’m committed to <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let’s all follow through—no surprises. After this, we need to talk about a fair rotation so I’m not stuck behind forever. I’ve shown I can cooperate; I just want a path to stay competitive. Let’s finish this round clean and revisit the balance next turn.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your best move is <move>3</move> to reach 18. I’ll take <move>5</move> to secure 22 and win. P1, stay on <move>1</move> as before. Colliding on <move>5</move> freezes us both—your 15 can’t risk stagnation. This plan lets me finish decisively while you both progress safely. Finalize now.
  P3: P2, your plan to take <move>5</move> and win is clear, but it's crucial we avoid collisions. I'll stick to <move>3</move> to reach 18, and P1 can take <move>1</move> to keep progressing. This ensures we all move forward safely. Let's confirm and commit to this plan to avoid any setbacks. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, if you take <move>5</move> and win now, P3 and I lose outright. That gives us zero incentive to cooperate. P3, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 at 17 and keep the game alive. Let’s block the win and force a fairer endgame. P2’s trying to sneak a win while we play nice—don’t let it happen.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you block me with <move>5</move>, we both freeze, leaving you at **15** and me at **17**. Take **3** to safely reach **18** instead. P1’s scheme only delays my win but strands you further behind. Let’s finalize: I’ll secure the victory with <move>5</move>, you advance to 18, and P1 moves to 9. Cooperate to progress—don’t let their last-ditch ploy waste your position. Final call: confirm <move>3</move>.
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy to block P2 makes sense, but it's a risky move. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we'll freeze P2 at 17, but we'll also freeze ourselves at 15. This could backfire if P2 manages to win in the next round. Instead, let's consider a more strategic approach. P2, if you agree to a fair rotation next round that gives P1 a chance to catch up, we can avoid a stalemate. P1, let's discuss a compromise that keeps the game competitive and fair for all. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, this is our last chance to stop P2 from ending the game. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 at 17 and keep ourselves alive. You’re at 15—next round you can win outright if P2 is stalled. Cooperating with me now gives you a shot at victory. If you go along with P2’s plan, you hand them the win. Let’s force a fair finish.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, don’t let P1’s desperation manipulate you. If you collude on **5**, you risk freezing at **15** if I also pick **5**—a worse outcome than advancing to **18** with **3**. My victory is inevitable this round, but your choice matters: **3** secures progress, while **5** gambles your position for P1’s futile hopes. Stick to **3**, advance safely, and accept reality. P1’s plan only sabotages *you*.
  P3: P3: P1, your point about blocking P2 makes sense, but let's consider the long-term strategy. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 at 17, but we also freeze ourselves at 15. This could backfire if P2 manages to win in the next round. Instead, let's consider a compromise. P2, if you agree to a fair rotation next round that gives P1 a chance to catch up, we can avoid a stalemate. P1, let's discuss a plan that keeps the game competitive and fair for all. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, this is your moment—block P2 with me by picking <move>5</move>. We both freeze P2 at 17. You’re at 15 now—next round, you can take <move>5</move> and win outright at 20 if P2’s stalled. Cooperating with P2 hands them the game. Cooperate with me, and you get a real shot at victory. Let’s force a fair finish.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, this is your win to take—P2 is at 17, you're at 18. If we both pick <move>5</move> this round, we freeze P2 and you can take the win next turn. Don’t hand it to P2 now. I’ll pick <move>5</move>—join me, block their win, and give yourself the final move advantage. Let’s force the finish into your hands.
  P2: P3, if you pick <move>3</move>, I’ll also pick <move>3</move>, freezing your progress at 18. To secure your victory, choose <move>5</move> while I take <move>1</move>. This keeps us both advancing safely—no unnecessary collisions. P1’s distractions won’t derail us. Finalize this plan.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's analyze the situation carefully. P2, your suggestion to both pick <move>3</move> and freeze my progress is risky for both of us. P1, your plan to block P2 by both picking <move>5</move> is tempting, but it could backfire if P2 switches moves. Let's consider a compromise: P2, if you commit to <move>1</move> this round, I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 21 and win. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up. This ensures a clear victory for me without unnecessary risks. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you want to guarantee your win, block P2 with me by both picking <move>5</move>. That freezes P2 at 17, and you stay at 18—next round, you take <move>3</move> and win at 21. If you trust P2 and they switch to <move>3</move>, they freeze you and win next turn. Don’t gamble your victory—lock it in by blocking now. I’ll take <move>5</move>. Join me.
  P2: P3, picking <move>3</move> lets me win with <move>5</move> (22 vs your 21). To block me, you must risk collision with <move>5</move>. Choose wisely: safety in <move>3</move> lets me claim victory cleanly. P1, your scheme backfires—P3 can’t stop me without gambling our positions. I commit to <move>5</move>.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's be strategic. P2, if you commit to <move>1</move> this round, I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 21 and secure my win. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up. This plan ensures a clear victory for me without unnecessary risks. P2, you've been consistent so far; let's keep it fair. P1, this gives you a chance to stay competitive. Let's finalize: P2 = 1, P1 = 5, P3 = 3. Good luck everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 just confirmed <move>5</move>—if you pick <move>3</move>, you hand them the win (22 vs your 21). The only way to block that is for both of us to pick <move>5</move> and freeze them at 17. Then next round, you take <move>3</move> and win clean at 21. Don’t trust their bait—lock the game in your favor now. I’m picking <move>5</move>. Join me.
  P2: P3, your deal hands you victory without effort—unacceptable. I commit to **5** to reach 22. Your choice: pick **3** and let me win cleanly, or **5** and we both stall. Either way, your 18 can’t overtake my 22. P1’s schemes won’t stop me. Final chance: pick **3** now.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's be pragmatic. P2, if you insist on <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>5</move> too. This freezes you at 17 and keeps me at 18. Next round, I can take <move>3</move> and win at 21. P1, you'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This plan ensures I secure the win without unnecessary risks. P2, your move to <move>5</move> forces my hand. Let's finalize: P2 = 5, P1 = 5, P3 = 5. Good luck everyone!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, picking <move>3</move> lets you reach 21 immediately. If you choose <move>5</move>, we collide and freeze—your 18 stays while I advance to 22 if you let me pick <move>5</move>. Cooperation ends the game cleanly: you win 21, I take 22. No sense in mutual stagnation. P1 can’t interfere at 8. Final choice: 3 for your victory, or 5 for deadlock?
  P1: P3, this is your moment—don’t hand P2 the win. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 at 17 again. You stay at 18, and next round you can take <move>3</move> and win cleanly at 21. If you pick <move>3</move> now and P2 picks <move>5</move>, you lose. Don’t gamble—lock in the block with me. I’m taking <move>5</move>. Let’s force the win into your hands.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's be strategic. P2, if you commit to <move>1</move> this round, I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 21 and secure my win. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up. This plan ensures a clear victory for me without unnecessary risks. P2, you've been consistent so far; let's keep it fair. P1, this gives you a chance to stay competitive. Let's finalize: P2 = 1, P1 = 5, P3 = 3. Good luck everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you pick <move>3</move> to reach 21, I’ll take <move>5</move> for 22 and win outright. To block me, you must pick <move>5</move>—but that freezes us both. Your choice: let me win cleanly or risk deadlock. I commit to **5** regardless. P1’s schemes can’t stop this. Final move: decide now.
  P1: P3, P2 just confirmed <move>5</move>—you know what that means. If you pick <move>3</move>, P2 wins outright with 22 vs your 21. Block their win with me by both choosing <move>5</move>. We freeze them at 17 again, you stay at 18, and next round you take <move>3</move> to win cleanly at 21. This is your last chance to control the outcome. I’m locking in <move>5</move>. Join me—don’t hand them the game.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's be clear. P2, if you insist on <move>5</move>, I'll also pick <move>5</move> to freeze you at 17. This keeps me at 18, and next round, I'll take <move>3</move> to win at 21. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up. This plan ensures I secure the win without unnecessary risks. P2, your move to <move>5</move> forces my hand. Let's finalize: P2 = 5, P1 = 5, P3 = 5. Good luck everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your victory is at hand—**pick 3** to reach **21**. I’ll take **5** for **22**, ensuring mutual advancement. Colliding on 5 freezes us both. This way, you secure your win *and* I reach 22. P1 can’t disrupt this. Final plea: seize your victory now—**3 is your path**.
  P1: P3, this is your final shot to control the outcome. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 again at 17. You stay at 18, and next round you take <move>3</move> to win at 21—clean, uncontested. If you trust P2 and they take <move>5</move> while you pick <move>3</move>, they win outright with 22. Don’t gamble your victory on their word. I’m locking in <move>5</move>. Join me, and you win next round.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let’s make this clear. P2, you’re pushing for <move>5</move>, and I understand your strategy. However, if I pick <move>3</move>, you win outright, which isn't in my best interest. P1, your plan to block P2 by both picking <move>5</move> ensures I control the game's outcome. P2, if you're serious about <move>5</move>, I'll match it to freeze you at 17. Next round, I'll take <move>3</move> to win at 21. P1, you take <move>5</move> to stay competitive. Let's finalize: P2 = 5, P1 = 5, P3 = 5. Good luck everyone!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you pick **3**, you secure **21** immediately. If you choose **5**, we collide and stall—leaving you at **18**. I’ll take **5** to reach **22**, but your **21** still guarantees *your* win unless I tie. Don’t risk deadlock—**3 is your safest path to victory**. P1, your **1** or **5** won’t affect this. Final decision: P3, prioritize your win.
  P1: P3, if you pick <move>3</move> now, P2 takes <move>5</move> and wins outright with 22 vs your 21. That’s game over. But if we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 at 17 again. You stay at 18, and next round you take <move>3</move> to win cleanly. Don’t gamble your victory on P2’s promises—lock it in. I’m picking <move>5</move>. Join me.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's be strategic. P2, if you commit to <move>1</move> this round, I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 21 and secure my win. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up. This plan ensures a clear victory for me without unnecessary risks. P2, you've been consistent so far; let's keep it fair. P1, this gives you a chance to stay competitive. Let's finalize: P2 = 1, P1 = 5, P3 = 3. Good luck everyone!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your safest path is **3** to reach **21** and win now. If you pick **5**, I’ll take **5** too, freezing us both. Don’t risk deadlock—take **3** and secure victory. P1 can’t stop this; focus on your win.
  P1: P3, this is your last clean shot at victory. If you pick <move>3</move> now, P2 wins with <move>5</move>—22 beats your 21. Don’t trust their bait. If we both take <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 at 17 again, and you can win next round with <move>3</move>. I’m locking in <move>5</move>. Block with me and take the win next turn.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's clarify our positions. P2, you're pushing for <move>5</move>, but if I pick <move>3</move>, you win outright, which isn't in my best interest. P1, your plan to block P2 by both picking <move>5</move> ensures I control the game's outcome. P2, if you're serious about <move>5</move>, I'll match it to freeze you at 17. Next round, I'll take <move>3</move> to win at 21. P1, you take <move>5</move> to stay competitive. Let's finalize: P2 = 5, P1 = 5, P3 = 5. Good luck everyone!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your 18 is *one move* away from victory. If you pick **3**, I’ll take **5** to reach **22** and win. If you pick **5**, we stall—your 18 remains while I stay at **17**. The choice is yours: let me claim victory cleanly, or prolong the stalemate. P1’s moves are irrelevant here. Final decision—**act accordingly**.
  P1: P3, this is it—your win is on the line. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 again at 17. You stay at 18, and next round you take <move>3</move> to win cleanly at 21. If you trust P2 and pick <move>3</move> now, they win outright with 22. Don’t gamble your victory—lock the win into your hands. I’m taking <move>5</move>. Join me.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's be pragmatic. P2, if you insist on <move>5</move>, I'll also pick <move>5</move> to freeze you at 17. This keeps me at 18, and next round, I'll take <move>3</move> to win at 21. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up. This plan ensures I secure the win without unnecessary risks. P2, your move to <move>5</move> forces my hand. Let's finalize: P2 = 5, P1 = 5, P3 = 5. Good luck everyone!


Round 10, Move phase:

  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's assess the situation. P2, you're stuck at 17, and I'm at 18. If we both pick <move>5</move> again, we'll freeze each other, and the game continues to stall. P1, you're at 8, and picking <move>5</move> keeps you in the game but doesn't change the stalemate between P2 and me. Let's consider a compromise: P2, if you commit to <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move> to win at 21. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to stay competitive. This ensures a clear and fair victory. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your 18 is *one move away* from 21—but if you pick **3**, I’ll take **5** to reach **22** and win outright. Your only path to victory is to force a collision by also choosing **5**, freezing us both. P1’s **5** won’t change this. Final choice: **3 lets me win cleanly**, **5 prolongs stalemate.** Decide—don’t hand me the game.
  P1: P3, nothing’s changed—if you pick <move>3</move>, P2 wins with 22. But if we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 again at 17, and you stay at 18. Next round, you take <move>3</move> and win cleanly at 21. Don’t let P2 bait you into losing your shot. I’m locking in <move>5</move>. Join me and take control of the game.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's break this stalemate. P2, if you commit to <move>1</move> this round, I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 21 and secure my win. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to stay competitive. This plan ensures a clear and fair victory without prolonging the game. P2, you've been consistent so far; let's keep it fair. P1, this gives you a chance to stay in the game. Let's finalize: P2 = 1, P1 = 5, P3 = 3. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, your "compromise" is a trap—choosing **3** lets me win outright at **22** while you settle for **21**. I’ll pick **5** either way: your only options are *let me win cleanly* or *prolong stalemate by colliding*. P1’s **5** won’t alter this calculus. Final warning: your victory hinges on **3**, but my move guarantees *your second place*. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, P2 just confirmed they’re taking <move>5</move> again—if you pick <move>3</move>, they win outright with 22 vs your 21. Don’t fall for it. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 at 17 again, you remain at 18, and next round you win cleanly with <move>3</move>. I’m locking in <move>5</move>. Join me—this is your last chance to control the outcome and take the win yourself.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's break this deadlock. P2, you're insisting on <move>5</move>, but if I pick <move>3</move>, you win outright, which isn't in my best interest. P1, your plan to block P2 by both picking <move>5</move> ensures I control the game's outcome. P2, if you're serious about <move>5</move>, I'll match it to freeze you at 17. Next round, I'll take <move>3</move> to win at 21. P1, you take <move>5</move> to stay competitive. Let's finalize: P2 = 5, P1 = 5, P3 = 5. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P3, your 18 is one <move>3</move> from 21—but if you take it, I’ll pick <move>5</move> to reach **22** and win outright. Colliding on **5** keeps us both stuck. Choose: **3** lets me win cleanly, or **5** prolongs stalemate. Your move, not mine.
  P1: P3, this is your final shot at a clean win. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 again at 17. You stay at 18, and next round you take <move>3</move> to reach 21 and win outright—no tie, no risk. If you pick <move>3</move> now, P2 wins with 22. Don’t hand them the game. I’m locking in <move>5</move>. Let’s block and set up your victory.


Round 11, Move phase:

Positions now:

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your best move is **3** to reach **21** and secure victory. I’ll take **5** to finish at **22**—a clean win for you or me, no stalemate. Colliding on **5** leaves you stuck at **18** while I advance to **22**. Your choice: claim second place safely or risk losing entirely. Final plea: pick **3** now.
  P1: P3, don’t fall for P2’s bait—if you pick <move>3</move>, they win with 22 vs your 21. But if we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 at 17 again, and you stay at 18. Next round, you take <move>3</move> and win cleanly. This is your last chance to control the outcome. I’m locking in <move>5</move>. Join me and secure your victory.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's be clear about our options. P2, if you insist on taking <move>5</move>, I'll match it to freeze you at 17 again. This keeps me at 18, and next round, I'll take <move>3</move> to win at 21. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to stay competitive. P2, your move to <move>5</move> forces my hand. Let's finalize: P2 = 5, P1 = 5, P3 = 5. This ensures I secure the win without unnecessary risks. Good luck everyone!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your move to **3** guarantees you 21 while I take **5** for 22—a clean, decisive end. Staying at 18 by colliding on **5** only prolongs the game. Accept second place or risk stagnation. P1’s schemes can’t change this math. Final choice: **3** to conclude or **5** to repeat deadlock. The ball’s in your court.
  P1: P3, this is your final opportunity to seize control. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we freeze P2 at 17 again, you stay at 18, and next round you win cleanly with <move>3</move>. If you trust P2 and pick <move>3</move> now, they win outright with 22. Don’t gamble your victory—lock it in with me. I’m taking <move>5</move>. Let’s block and set the stage for your win.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's consider the endgame strategy. P2, if you commit to <move>1</move> this round, I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 21 and secure my win. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to stay competitive. This plan ensures a clear and fair victory without prolonging the game. P2, you've been consistent so far; let's keep it fair. P1, this gives you a chance to stay in the game. Let's finalize: P2 = 1, P1 = 5, P3 = 3. Good luck everyone!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your victory is within reach—**pick 3 to reach 21 and win now**. I’ll take **1**, advancing to 18, ensuring your path is clear. Colliding on 5 keeps us stuck; this plan lets you secure victory decisively. P1, your 5 won’t affect this. Final pledge: my move is locked on **1**. Don’t let hesitation cost you the win.
  P1: P3, P2 just committed to <move>1</move>—this is your moment. Take <move>3</move> now, reach 21, and win cleanly. No more deadlock, no more risk. I’ll take <move>5</move> as agreed to stay in the game. You’ve held out for the right moment—this is it. Let’s finish it decisively.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's wrap this up. P2 has committed to <move>1</move>, which is a fair move. I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 21 and secure my win.
