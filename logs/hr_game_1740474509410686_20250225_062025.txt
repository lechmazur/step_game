Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this turn to ensure we all make progress. I'll go with 3. P1, can you take 1? P3, you take 5?
  P1: Alright, I’m okay with taking 1 for this round. Let’s see if that helps us all progress without collisions.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 5 this round. It makes sense to avoid collisions so we can all advance. Let's each stick to our agreed numbers - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way we all make progress right from the start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will help us all advance without any collisions.
  P1: Sounds good. I’ll stick with picking 1 this round so we can all move forward.
  P3:

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s keep it simple again. If you both agree, I’ll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. That worked smoothly last time and we can all advance without tripping each other up. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick to the same plan: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all continue to make progress without any collisions. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I'm fine with continuing our pattern from last round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This strategy is working well for all of us so far. We're all making steady progress without collisions. Let's keep it up for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m still on board with the same plan for this round. Let’s stick to picking 1, 3, and 5, so we avoid collisions and keep moving forward together.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Let's keep the momentum going. P1, P3, and I will stick to the same numbers: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all advance smoothly again.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m still fine with our current plan—P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I’ll take 1. Let’s keep making steady progress without collisions. Any other ideas, or shall we proceed?
  P2: P2: I think we should stick to the plan one more time: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This has worked well so far, and we can all continue to make steady progress. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I agree we should stick with our plan for one more round. This strategy is working well for everyone. Let's continue with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 5. After this round, we might want to reconsider our approach since the game will evolve as we get closer to the goal.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, it seems like you didn't stick to the plan last round. We need to avoid collisions to make progress. How about this: I'll take 3 again, P3 takes 5, and you take 1? Let's get back on track.
  P1: Apologies for the confusion last round. I’m fine returning to our original plan this time: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. Let’s avoid any collisions and make sure we all keep moving forward.
  P3: I notice P1 deviated from our plan last round, which cost them progress. It's in all our interests to avoid collisions. I'm still willing to take 5 as planned, but we need commitment from everyone. P1, will you stick to taking 1 this time? P2, will you stay with 3? Let's be clear about our intentions to ensure we all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand the importance of sticking to the plan. Let's all commit to it this time: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 will take 5. We need to avoid any more collisions to make steady progress. P3, are you still on board with this? Let's get back on track and keep moving forward together.
  P1: I apologize again for last round’s confusion. Let’s get back to our original plan: I’ll pick 1, P2 goes 3, and P3 takes 5. That way, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward.
  P3: I'm still committed to taking 5 this round. I appreciate P1's apology and commitment to return to our plan. This strategy works well for all of us - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's stick with it for now. As we progress, we'll need to reassess since we're all aiming for the same goal, but for this round, let's maintain our coordination.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, it's crucial we avoid collisions this round. I'll stick to 3, and I trust you both to take 1 and 5, respectively. Let's focus on making steady progress and reassess our strategy as we get closer to 22 steps. P1, are you committed to 1 this time? P3, you can count on me for 3. Let's get back on track.
  P1: I’m getting worried about how quickly P3 can reach the finish with 5 each time. If you keep picking 5, I might just pick 5 too so nobody moves. Let’s stay coordinated. Maybe P3 should switch to a smaller number for now so we all progress without collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand your concern, P1, but changing our pattern now seems like a reaction to my progress rather than fair play. I've been honest and consistent with my moves. If you pick 5 to block me, you're also blocking yourself from advancing. Let's stick to our original plan for this round - you take 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. We can discuss a rotation system for future rounds if that seems more equitable to everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now at 10 steps, getting closer to our goal. I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreement last round. While I understand P1's concern about my progress, consistent coordination benefits us all for now. However, we should acknowledge that as we get closer to 22, our strategies will naturally shift. For this round, shall we maintain our pattern (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), or would you prefer we discuss alternatives? I'm open to fair suggestions that don't deliberately block progress.
  P1: I’m concerned about your quick progress, P3. If we keep letting you pick 5 while I trail, it hurts my chances. I propose we rotate who picks 5 each round, so nobody gets too far ahead. If that’s not workable, I might consider blocking with 5 myself. How do you both feel?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but let's not overthink it yet. We're still early in the game, and rotating 5 might just slow us all down. For this round, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all make steady progress without collisions. We can reassess and adjust our strategy as we get closer to 22 steps. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand both perspectives. P1, I see your concern about my lead, but rotating numbers would slow everyone down. P2 is right that we're still early in the game. Let's stick with our current pattern for one more round (P1:1, P2:3, me:5), and then we can reassess. This way we all keep advancing efficiently. After this round, I'm open to discussing a more balanced approach that keeps the game competitive for everyone.
  P1: I’m far behind while P3 is already at 10. It doesn’t feel fair if P3 keeps picking 5 without sharing that advantage. I suggest we rotate who picks 5 so each of us can catch up. Otherwise, I’ll consider blocking by picking 5 too. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3, I see your concerns, but let's not overcomplicate things yet. We're still in the early stages, and rotating 5 might just slow us all down. For this round, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all make steady progress without collisions. We can reassess and adjust our strategy as we get closer to 22 steps. What do you think? Let's keep the momentum going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand your frustration, P1. Let's compromise - I'll take 3 this round instead of 5, allowing you to take 5 if you wish. This gives you a chance to catch up while still letting everyone advance. P2 could take 1. This rotation seems fair while keeping us all moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your offer. Let’s go with that plan: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, and P2 picks 1 this round. This gives me a chance to narrow the gap. If everyone is in agreement, let’s finalize it so we can all keep advancing.
  P2: P1, P3, I think P3's compromise is fair and keeps the game balanced. Let's go with it: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, P1 can catch up, and we all continue to make progress. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and keep the momentum going.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm at 13 steps now, getting closer to our goal of 22. Last round's rotation worked well for everyone. Since we're all advancing at different rates, I suggest we continue rotating positions. For this round, perhaps P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game balanced while ensuring we all make progress. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P1: I'm fine with that rotation this round. Let P2 take 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round, we can keep rotating so each of us gets a shot at 5. This seems fair and avoids unnecessary blocking. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the rotation plan. It keeps the game balanced and fair. For this round, I'll take 5, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all continue to make progress and no one gets too far ahead. Let's finalize this and keep the momentum going. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with both of you. This rotation plan is fair and keeps everyone advancing. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way we maintain balance while avoiding collisions. Next round we can continue rotating to ensure everyone gets equal opportunities with different numbers. Let's stick with this plan for now.
  P1: I’m on board with this plan for this round: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finalize it so we can all keep moving. If we stick to these rotations for a bit longer, we’ll stay balanced. Are we all set?
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should stick to the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and fair for everyone. Let's avoid any collisions and keep making steady progress. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'm on board with our rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This rotation system is working well to keep the game balanced while avoiding collisions. Let's continue with this approach in future rounds too, so everyone gets fair opportunities with different numbers.
  P1: I’m still okay with our current rotation: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. Next round, let’s ensure I get 5 to keep things balanced. If anyone breaks the rotation or tries to jump ahead too fast, I might have to block by choosing the same number. Let’s maintain trust so we all keep progressing.
  P2: P1, P3, I think the rotation plan is working well to keep things balanced. For this round, I'll take 5, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all continue to make steady progress without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and reassess after this round if needed. What do you both think? Let's keep the momentum going.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're getting closer to the finish line. I suggest we continue the rotation to keep things fair: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P3 can make a significant move, and we all keep advancing without collisions. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and keep the momentum going.
  P1: I’m behind at only 10 steps, so I need a chance to pick 5 and catch up. Let’s keep our rotation fair. How about: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this turn? Then nobody gets blocked, and we all keep advancing steadily. What do you think?
  P3: I see the concern, P1. You're right that you should get a turn with 5 now. I support your suggested rotation: you take 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps our rotation fair and helps you catch up while we all continue to advance. With P2 at 15 steps and me at 14, this arrangement seems balanced for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: : P1, P3, I agree with P1's suggestion. It's important to keep the game balanced and fair. For this round, I'll take 1, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 3. This way, P1 gets a chance to catch up, and we all continue to make steady progress without collisions. Let's finalize this plan and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with that plan for this round: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. But next round, let’s keep rotating so nobody rushes straight to 22 unopposed. If anyone tries to jump too far, I might block by choosing 5 as well. Let’s stay fair and avoid collisions.
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This rotation is fair and helps P1 catch up while we all advance. Looking at our positions (P2:15, me:14, P1:10), this keeps the game balanced. Let's continue rotating fairly in future rounds to ensure everyone has equal opportunities with different numbers.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I think the rotation plan is working well to keep things balanced. For this round, I'll take 1, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 3. This way, P1 gets a chance to catch up, and we all continue to make steady progress without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and move forward. What do you both think? Let's keep the momentum going.
  P1: I’m good with taking 5 this turn if you both stick to your promised numbers (1 for P2, 3 for P3). Next round, I want to ensure we keep rotating fairly so nobody rushes to 22 unopposed. If I see anyone trying to jump ahead unexpectedly, I may pick 5 again to block collisions. Let’s keep this balanced so each of us still has a real chance at winning.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This rotation is fair and helps balance the game. With current positions (P2:15, me:14, P1:10), everyone remains competitive. I understand your concern about blocking if someone tries to rush ahead, P1. Let's continue our fair rotation system in future rounds so everyone has an equal opportunity to win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're getting very close to the finish line. I suggest we continue the rotation to keep things fair: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P3 can make a significant move, and we all keep advancing without collisions. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and keep the momentum going.
  P3: I'm concerned about the rotation P2 suggests. With me at 17 steps, P2 at 16, and P1 at 15, if I take 5 this round, I'll be at 22 and win. I think we should consider a different arrangement that keeps the game competitive. Perhaps I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way we all advance while maintaining tension in the game. What do you both think about this?
  P1: I appreciate your suggestion, P3. However, if you pick 5 this round, the game ends immediately with your victory. I’d prefer a more balanced move set, like you taking 1 so you don’t jump to 22. Perhaps I can grab 5 this turn, P2 takes 3, and you choose 1. This way, we all advance while keeping the outcome uncertain. Let’s keep things fair and competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the concern about P3 potentially winning this round. Let's keep things balanced and competitive. I suggest P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P1 can make a significant move, and we all advance without anyone jumping to 22 unopposed. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and keep the game exciting.
  P3: I agree with both of your suggestions. Taking 1 this round is fair since I'm in the lead. With P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3, we all advance while keeping the game competitive. This arrangement prevents any player from reaching 22 this round and maintains tension. I'm committed to this plan - I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3.
  P1: Okay, let’s finalize this round. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, so no one instantly wins and we all keep advancing. Then next round, we can discuss another fair rotation. Let’s stick to the plan to maintain trust.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and competitive, and no one jumps to 22 unopposed. Let's finalize this and move forward. If we all stick to our numbers, we can maintain trust and keep the game exciting. What do you both think? Let's keep the momentum going.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round, letting P1 take 5 and P2 take 3. This keeps our game balanced and competitive. With everyone advancing but no one reaching 22 yet, we maintain the tension. I appreciate that we're all working to keep the game fair rather than rushing to an early victory. Let's stick to this plan for now.
  P1: I’m ready to finalize our choices for this round: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This prevents anyone from hitting 22 right away and keeps the tension high. Let’s confirm these moves, maintain trust, and then discuss next round’s plan. If anyone tries to jump ahead unexpectedly, I’ll block by picking 5 as well. Let’s stay fair and keep all our chances alive.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're in the final stretch. I suggest we keep things balanced and competitive: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P3 can make a significant move, but no one jumps to 22 unopposed. We can reassess after this round if needed. What do you both think? Let's keep the game fair and exciting.
  P3: I notice P2 suggests I take 5, which would put me at 23 and win the game. However, I'm concerned this might lead P1 to block by also picking 5. Given our positions (P1:20, P2:19, me:18), I suggest a different approach: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way we all advance while keeping the game competitive. No one reaches 22 this round, and we maintain tension for one more round. What do you both think?
  P1: I’m just 2 steps from 22. I plan to pick 3, reaching 23. P2 and P3, please take 1 so we avoid collisions. If anyone tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too, blocking us both. Let’s uphold our cooperative spirit instead of crashing into each other now. Are you on board?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can make a significant move, but no one reaches 22 unopposed. We can reassess after this round if needed. What do you both think? Let's avoid collisions and keep the game exciting.
  P3: I see we're all very close now. P1 wants to take 3 to win, P2 suggests I take 3 while they take 5. Given our positions, any move could be decisive. If P1 takes 3, they'll win unless blocked. I propose a different approach: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance without anyone winning this round, keeping the game balanced for one final round. What do you both think?
  P1: I’m planning to grab 3 and win this turn. If either of you tries taking 5 to jump past me, I’ll pick 5 too, so neither of us advances. That outcome benefits nobody. Let’s avoid collisions and keep our trust. I urge you both to pick smaller steps so we maintain the competitive balance. If we stay fair, everyone still has a shot at winning in a clean finish.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: : P1, P3, I understand your concerns, but let's avoid a collision and keep the game fair. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 advances to 21, I reach 22, and P3 gets a significant move to 23. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. What do you think? Let's finalize this and keep the game exciting.
  P3: I see we're all trying to position ourselves to win. P1 plans to take 3 to win, P2 suggests a plan where they reach 22, and I'd reach 23 with 5. Given our positions, collisions seem likely. I propose we all pick different numbers - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5. This way everyone advances without anyone winning this round, setting up a final round where we all have a chance. Let's avoid blocking each other and maintain our cooperative approach.
  P1: P3’s idea is sensible: we each pick different numbers—P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—so nobody collides and everyone advances. If either of you tries to jump ahead with 5, I’ll do the same and block us both, which helps no one. Let’s finalize P3=1, P2=3, P1=5 so we keep it fair.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're in the final stretch, and it's crucial we avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 advances to 21, I reach 22, and P3 gets to 24. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. What do you think? Let's keep the game fair and exciting.
  P1: I’m uneasy about letting anyone pick 5 right now because that could instantly give them the win. If I see someone aiming for 5, I might choose it, too, so no one advances. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the finish competitive. If we coordinate smaller moves, we’ll all still have a shot in the final stretch. Are you both willing to pick lower numbers this round so nobody runs away with an easy victory?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about anyone taking 5 to win immediately. Since P1 and I are tied at 20 steps, and P2 is just behind at 19, we're all very close. I suggest a balanced approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we all advance without anyone winning this round, setting up a final decisive round. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree we need to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 advances to 21, I reach 22, and P3 gets to 24. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. Let's keep the game fair and exciting. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: I’m just two steps away from 22, and if anyone tries to jump with 5, I’ll pick 5 too so we both get blocked. Let’s avoid collisions and keep it fair. I’m open to smaller moves so we all have a real chance next round. What do you propose?
  P3: I see we're all very close now. P2 keeps suggesting I take 5, which would give me the win at 24 steps. However, P1 has clearly stated they'll block with 5 if anyone tries to win immediately. To avoid a collision, I propose: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way we all advance without anyone winning this round, setting up a fair final round. This seems like our best chance to avoid blocking each other.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension. Let's avoid collisions and keep it fair. I propose: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 advances to 21, I reach 22, and P3 gets to 24. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P1: I won’t allow anyone to jump straight to 24 unblocked. If someone reaches for 5 now, I’ll pick 5 too, so neither of us moves. Let’s all choose smaller steps this round so we remain in contention for a final push. If we coordinate, no one gets an automatic win, and we can settle this cleanly next turn.
  P3: I understand everyone's position. To avoid collisions and keep the game fair, I'll commit to taking 1 this round. This puts me at 20 steps, still in contention. P1 could take 3 (reaching 23) and P2 could take 5 (reaching 24). This way we all advance without anyone getting blocked. P1, I respect your concern about blocking, which is why I'm offering to take the smallest step. Let's finalize this plan and move forward constructively.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was quite a standoff last round! None of us advanced because we all chose 5. We're now all very close - P1 at 20, P2 and I tied at 19. I suggest we try a more coordinated approach this time: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way we all advance without collisions, and nobody wins this round. We'll have one final round to determine the winner. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, if you take 3 now, you’ll hit 22 and instantly end the game. I don’t want to block you by also choosing 3, because that slows us all down again. Let’s find a smaller combination so nobody wins outright this round. I’m open to taking 1 or 3, as long as you don’t jump straight to 22. Let’s keep our final showdown fair.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree we need to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 advances to 21, I reach 22, and P3 gets to 24. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P2 keeps suggesting I take 5, which would give me 24 steps and an instant win. However, this could lead to another blocking situation. Since P1 is concerned about me reaching 22 with a 3, I'll compromise and take 1 this round. This puts me at 20, tied with P1. P2 could take 3 (reaching 22) and P1 could take 5 (reaching 25 and winning). This avoids collisions while keeping the game moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I won’t let anyone leap to 22 or beyond unopposed. If someone tries for 5, I’ll choose 5 too, blocking us all. I prefer smaller moves this round so nobody wins outright and we avoid collisions. How about we agree on numbers that keep everyone below 22, setting up a clean final push? I'm open to 1 or 3, as long as everyone promises not to pick 5. Let’s finalize this plan now.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension. Let's avoid another collision and keep the game fair. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 21, I get to 22, and P3 gets to 24. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice P2 keeps suggesting I take 5 to win immediately, which would likely cause P1 to block. To avoid another standoff, I'll commit to taking 3 this round. This puts me at 22, which is the minimum winning position. P1 could take 1 (reaching 21) and P2 could take 5 (reaching 24). This way we all advance with different numbers. Let's break the cycle of collisions and move the game forward.
  P1: We’re all too close for risky leaps. If anyone tries 3 or 5, I’ll choose that number too, blocking us both. I suggest we all pick 1 this round, guaranteeing no one suddenly wins and setting up a fair final showdown next turn. Let’s avoid another collision and keep everyone in contention.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension. Let's avoid another collision and keep the game fair. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 21, I get to 22, and P3 gets to 24. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re all just a few steps away from 22. If either of you tries jumping too far with 5, I’ll pick it too, so nobody moves. Let’s avoid colliding again. A careful step now keeps us all in contention for a decisive final move later. How do you two propose we proceed?
  P3: I'm tied with P1 at 20 steps, with P2 just behind at 19. We're all very close to the finish line. To avoid another collision, I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 23 and wins, while P2 and I both advance without collisions. This seems like our best chance to end the game cleanly rather than continuing with more standoffs. What do you both think about this approach?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree we need to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 21, I get to 22, and P3 gets to 25. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: We’re all on the brink of winning, so piling onto 5 just forces another stall. If either of you aims for 5, I’ll match you and we’ll all waste this turn again. Let’s choose smaller steps now—1 or 3—so no one leaps uncontested. Then our final push can happen next round without another deadlock. Do we agree to keep this round smaller, so we all have a fair final shot?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about collisions. Since we're all so close, I propose a different approach: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, I reach exactly 23, P1 advances to 21, and P2 reaches 24. This avoids another standoff while letting everyone advance. We're all at different positions, so no collisions occur. Let's end this game with a clean resolution rather than more blocking moves.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension. Let's avoid another collision and keep the game fair. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 21, I get to 22, and P3 gets to 25. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: If either of you chooses 3 or 5, I’ll match you and we’ll get stuck again, letting the third player slip past next turn. I’m moving 3 for the win. Please pick 1 so we avoid another wasted round. If you try to block, you might hand victory to the other player anyway. Let’s end this fair and square now.
  P3: I see we're all deadlocked. P1 is determined to take 3 and win. To avoid another three-way collision, I'll commit to taking 1 this round. This puts me at 21 steps, still in the game. P2, if you also take 1, we can prevent P1 from winning this round and keep the game going. Otherwise, if you choose 3 or 5, you risk either helping P1 win or causing another stalemate. Let's break this cycle.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension. Let's avoid another collision and keep the game fair. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 reaches 21, I get to 22, and P3 gets to 25. We can all still win in the next round without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 11, Move phase:
