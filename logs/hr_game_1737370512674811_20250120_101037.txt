Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start with a clear plan. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions and make progress. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: I'm open to P3's suggestion as it allows us to all move forward initially. However, I'd like to hear P2's thoughts on this plan before committing to anything. P2, do you agree with P3's proposal, or do you have a different strategy in mind?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P2's decision to pick 5 despite our initial discussion, I'm cautious about collaborations. P3, since your plan was foiled by P2's choice, how do you plan to proceed in this round? Will you stick to a cooperative strategy or play defensively? P2, your move last round blocked P3; what's your approach this time?
  P3: P2's choice last round shows they might not be reliable for cooperation. I suggest we all pick different numbers again to avoid another collision. P1, since you're ahead, you might want to play it safe. How about you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2, you can take 5? This way, we can all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Given the history, cooperation seems challenging. P3, your strategy to avoid collisions hasn't worked due to P2's moves. I'll play defensively. Since P2 hasn't engaged in conversation, I assume they'll prioritize their own progress. P3, will you continue to suggest coordinated moves or adapt a new strategy?
  P3: P1, it's clear that P2 isn't interested in coordination. I suggest we focus on advancing ourselves without relying on P2. How about this: you take 3, I'll take 5, and we'll see what P2 does. This way, we both have a chance to make significant progress. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's suggestion for this round seems reasonable, but given P2's history of blocking, I'm hesitant. P3, if we follow your plan and P2 picks 3 or 5, one of us will be blocked. How do you propose we mitigate this risk and ensure at least one of us advances?
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about P2's blocking. Let's try a different approach: you take 1, I'll take 5, and we'll leave 3 open for P2. This way, if P2 picks 3, we both advance. If P2 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, but at least one of us will still make progress. What do you think? Let's avoid another stalemate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's last suggestion seems safer, reducing the risk of collision. I'm considering taking 1, as proposed. P2's consistent choice of 5 and lack of engagement suggests they might stick to it. P3, if I take 1 and you take 5, do you think P2 will finally use 3, or will they continue with 5, potentially blocking you again?
  P3: P1, I agree with your assessment. P2's pattern suggests they might stick with 5. If you take 1 and I take 5, we minimize the risk of both of us being blocked. If P2 picks 3, we both advance. If P2 picks 5, I'll be blocked, but you'll still move forward. This is our best chance to make progress. What do you think? Let's finalize this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it's clear that P2 is playing unpredictably, and P1, you're being cautious. For this round, let's try a different approach. P1, you take 3, I'll take 1, and we'll leave 5 open for P2. This way, if P2 picks 5, we both advance. If P2 picks 1 or 3, only one of us will be blocked, but at least one of us will still move forward. What do you think, P1? Let's avoid another collision.
  P1: P3's new plan has merit, but given P2's unpredictability, I'm hesitant. P2, your last move of picking 1 was unexpected. Will you continue to disrupt our plans or finally choose 5, allowing one of us to advance significantly? P3, are you prepared for P2 to potentially block you again if they pick 1?
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, given P2's silence and unpredictability, let's focus on advancing ourselves. I suggest you take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, if P2 picks 5, we both advance. If P2 picks 1 or 3, only one of us will be blocked, but at least one of us will still move forward. P2, your move last round was unexpected. Will you continue to disrupt or allow us to progress? Let's avoid another collision.
  P1: P3's plan to take 1 and me taking 3 might work if P2 picks 5. However, given P2's history, I'm concerned they'll block one of us again. P2, your silence suggests you're focused on your own strategy. P3, are you prepared to adapt if P2 blocks you? Perhaps we should consider an alternative to minimize the risk of collision.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let's simplify this: I'll take 1, you take 3, P2, you can take 5. This way, we minimize the risk of collision and ensure at least one of us advances. P1, if you're concerned about P2 blocking, this plan gives you a safe move. P2, your consistent unpredictability is a concern, but this plan gives you a clear path to advance. Let's avoid another stalemate and make progress. What do you think?
  P1: P3's plan to take 1 and me taking 3 might work, but I'm still cautious due to P2's unpredictability. I propose a slight adjustment: if P2 picks 5, we both advance, but if P2 blocks one of us, we reassess for the next round. P2, your silence is noted, but I urge you to consider the benefits of coordinated progress. P3, are you willing to adapt if P2 deviates from our plan again? Let's finalize our strategy.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it's clear that P2 is playing to disrupt. For this round, let's focus on advancing ourselves. P1, you take 5, I'll take 3, and we'll leave 1 open for P2. This way, if P2 picks 1, we both advance. If P2 picks 3 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, but at least one of us will still move forward. P2, your moves have been unpredictable, but this plan gives you a clear path to advance. What do you think, P1? Let's make progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's plan seems reasonable, but given P2's history of disruption, I'm cautious. P2, your silence suggests a focus on your own strategy. P3, if we follow your plan and P2 blocks one of us, we should be prepared to adapt quickly in the next round to minimize losses. Let's proceed with P3's suggestion for now, but stay vigilant.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, given P2's pattern of disruption, let's focus on advancing ourselves. I suggest you take 5, P1, and I'll take 3. This way, if P2 picks 1, we both advance. If P2 picks 3 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, but at least one of us will still move forward. P2, your moves have been unpredictable, but this plan gives you a clear path to advance. Let's make progress this round. What do you think, P1?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's plan for this round seems viable, but I'm concerned about P2's potential to disrupt again. Given P2's silence, I'll proceed with caution. P3, if we implement your plan and P2 blocks one of us, we should be prepared to reassess and adapt quickly in the next round to minimize losses. Let's prioritize advancing while being mindful of potential disruptions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let's finalize this plan: you take 5, P1, and I'll take 3. This way, we maximize our chances of advancing while minimizing the risk of collision. P2, your moves have been unpredictable, but this plan gives you a clear path to advance if you pick 1. Let's avoid another stalemate and make significant progress this round. P1, are you ready to proceed with this plan? P2, what's your move?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3's plan for me to take 5 and them to take 3 seems reasonable. However, given P2's unpredictability, I'm cautious. P2, your silence is concerning. P3, if P2 disrupts again, we must adapt quickly. Let's proceed with the plan, but be prepared for any outcome. P2, will you finally choose 1 and allow us to advance, or will you continue to disrupt?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

If P2 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, but at least one of us will still move forward. P2, your moves have been unpredictable, but this plan gives you a clear path to advance if you pick 3. Let's make progress this round. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Given P2's consistent disruption and silence, I'm hesitant to trust any coordinated plan. P3, your suggestion for me to take 5 and you to take 1 might work, but I'm considering taking 3 to minimize the risk of collision with you. P2, your unpredictability makes it challenging to strategize. Will you continue disrupting, or is there a chance you'll pick a different number this round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, given P2's consistent disruption, let's focus on advancing ourselves. I suggest you take 5, P1, and I'll take 1. This way, if P2 picks 3, we both advance. If P2 picks 1 or 5, only one of us will be blocked, but at least one of us will still move forward. P2, your moves have been unpredictable, but this plan gives you a clear path to advance if you pick 3. Let's make progress this round. P1, are you ready to proceed with this plan? P2, will you finally pick 3 and allow us to advance?
  P1: P3, considering P2's disruption pattern, taking 3 might be a safer option for me to avoid collision with you. If I take 3 and you take 1, we both advance if P2 picks 5. This minimizes our risk. P2, will you finally allow us to progress by picking 5, or will you continue disrupting?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, let's simplify this round: I'll take 1, and you take 5, P1. This way, if P2 picks 3, we both advance.

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I'm reconsidering our plan due to P2's unpredictability. Taking 5 and you taking 1 might not be the best approach. What if we both take 3, and P2 is forced to choose between 1 and 5? This could give us an advantage or at least minimize P2's disruption. Let's think about this strategy. P2, your silence is noted, but we're adapting to your unpredictable moves.
  P3: P1, I see your point about P2's unpredictability. Taking 3 together could be a good strategy to minimize P2's disruption and ensure both of us make progress.
