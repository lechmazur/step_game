Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all agree to move 5 this turn. If we all do, no one moves, and we can reassess next round. This avoids any early collisions and gives us more information.
  P1: I understand P2's suggestion to move 5 and avoid collision, but it doesn't give us any information about the others' intentions for the next round. Instead, I propose that we all move different numbers this turn (e.g., P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5). This way, we'll know who moved what based on who doesn't advance. It allows us to gather information about the others' moves for future rounds.
  P3: I lean toward a distinct‐number approach—clearly differentiating moves lets us learn each other’s strategies and avoids unwanted collisions. I’m inclined toward a higher step move if we stick to unique choices, though my final action isn’t set in stone. I believe this method helps us progress while keeping the competition honest. What’s your take?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your point about gathering information. However, moving different amounts this early could give someone an unintended advantage if one of us accidentally collides with someone else later. I still think a round of 5s is safer for now. If we all move 5, we can then try the different moves strategy next round, knowing everyone's starting position is equal.
  P1: To avoid a stalemate, I suggest we establish a simple signaling mechanism for future rounds. If we go with distinct moves this round, we can use the outcome to signal our intentions. For example, if someone expects to be ahead, they might choose a lower number next round to avoid collision. Let's try the distinct moves approach this round and see how it plays out. I'm willing to move 1, but I need to know P3's seriousness about moving 5.
  P3: P3: I appreciate P1’s clarity. I’m still leaning toward distinct moves for their informational edge and progress. While I favor a higher move for the extra steps, I’m not rigidly committed to a 5. Flexibility may be key, so I propose we fine‐tune our signals to avoid collisions. I remain open and will adjust if our coordination proves safe.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems we're converging on a distinct moves strategy. To avoid confusion and potential collisions next round, let's commit to specific moves *this* round. P1, you said you'd move 1. P3, are you willing to commit to moving 5? If so, I'll move 3. This gives us the information we want without someone accidentally getting too far ahead. Let me know if you agree!
  P1: I'm fine with the proposed distinct moves for this round. P2, I agree that you should move 3 if I move 1 and P3 moves 5. This way, we'll get the information we need. To signal our intentions for the next round, I propose that if we see a collision this round (which won't happen with our distinct moves), the player who collided would move the lowest number next round. Let's finalize our moves: I'll move 1, you move 3, and P3 moves 5. P3, please confirm your move.
  P3: I agree with the distinct‐moves plan. I confirm my commitment to taking the highest move as discussed, keeping our positions distinct and collisions at bay. I’m confident this gives us clear information for future adjustments, so let’s proceed with this strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Great! It sounds like we have a solid plan for this round. I'm ready to move 3, as agreed. Let's all execute our moves and see where we stand for the next round. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Since we've agreed on distinct moves for this round (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's prepare for the next round. To avoid collisions and signal our intentions, I propose that next round, the player who is behind moves the highest number, the middle player moves the middle number, and the leader moves the lowest number. This way, we can maintain a balance and avoid collisions while making progress. Let's discuss and refine this strategy for Round 2.
  P3: P3: I support our distinct moves for Round 1, and I find the Round 2 proposal intriguing. While the idea of having the behind player go highest and the leader lowest makes sense, I plan to stay flexible based on our performance. I'll closely watch our standing—if a clear opportunity to surge appears, I might adjust accordingly. Let’s see how Round 1 unfolds before locking into any rigid plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To refine our strategy for Round 2, I propose we stick to the signaling mechanism I suggested earlier. Given the current standings (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), I'm behind, so I'd move 5. P2 is in the middle, so they could move 3. P3 is ahead, so they could move 1. This maintains distinct moves and avoids collisions. Let's confirm: P2, are you comfortable moving 3? P3, will you move 1 to signal and avoid collision?
  P3: I confirm I'll move 1 this round. Despite my current lead, I agree that keeping our moves distinct minimizes collision risk. I'm open to adapting later if circumstances change.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm on board with moving 3 this round as planned. It keeps the distinct moves and avoids collisions. Let's execute this and see where we stand for Round 3. Hopefully, this strategy will keep us all in the game longer.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To further refine our strategy for Round 2 and beyond, let's establish a secondary signal based on our moves. If a player maintains their relative position (ahead, middle, behind), they could repeat their last move. If they want to change their relative position, they could alter their move. For instance, if P2 wants to stay in the middle, they could move 3 again. Let's discuss and see if we can adapt this signaling mechanism to improve our coordination and avoid collisions in future rounds.
  P3: I’m confirming my move of 1 for this round. To avoid surprises, if anyone decides to change their planned move mid-turn, please signal that clearly beforehand. This way, we can adjust immediately to prevent any collisions that might waste our progress. I value clear communication and flexibility, so I’m open to renegotiating the moves if needed. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, to confirm, I will move 3 this round. P3, you're moving 1, and P1, you're moving 5, right? Let's stick to this plan for a smooth Round 2. If everyone confirms, we can move to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To further improve our coordination, I suggest we establish a threshold for when to start being more cautious. If any player is within 5 steps of 22, we should adjust our moves to avoid collision and ensure the game doesn't end abruptly. Let's discuss and agree on this threshold. P2, P3, are you open to adjusting our strategy based on proximity to the target? This can help us manage the game's final stages more effectively.
  P3: I agree with P1’s caution. Let’s set the threshold at 17 steps—once anyone reaches that level (i.e. within 5 of 22) we switch to safer moves to avoid risky collisions. I'm sticking with my move of 1 this round, as confirmed. I'll keep a close eye on our totals and adjust when needed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the 17-step threshold for increased caution. To reiterate, I'm moving 3 this round. P1 is moving 5, and P3 is moving 1. Let's execute and reassess for Round 3, keeping the 17-step threshold in mind.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To ensure a smooth Round 3, let's confirm our understanding of the current standings after Round 2's moves. If P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 1, the standings will be P1: 6, P2: 6, P3: 6. Given we're all tied, let's discuss how to break the tie without collisions. I suggest we randomize or introduce a new signaling mechanism for Round 3 to keep the game competitive and avoid a stalemate. Your thoughts?
  P3: Since we’re tied at 6, I suggest we shake things up in Round 3. I'm leaning toward a moderate move rather than our previous pattern to break the symmetry and avoid collision risks. What do you both think about introducing a slight variability in our choices this round?
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, since we're all agreeing on the 17-step threshold and distinct moves this round (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1), let's make sure we execute those moves now. Then, for Round 3, since we'll all be tied at 6, I propose we each choose a different move *again* – maybe 1, 3, and 5 – but in a *different* order than Round 1. This breaks the tie and keeps things unpredictable. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we're all tied at 6, let's definitely mix things up this round. I like the idea of choosing 1, 3, and 5 again, but in a different order. How about this: P1, you pick first between 1, 3, and 5. Then, P3, you pick from the remaining two. I'll take whatever is left. This ensures distinct moves and avoids collisions. What do you think?
  P1: To mix things up in Round 3, I'll choose 5. P3, you can pick from the remaining numbers (1 or 3). Let's finalize the moves to avoid collisions. If we're still tied after this round, we should consider a more aggressive strategy for Round 4, given we're all at 6 steps and need to make progress. Let's discuss after seeing the outcome of Round 3. P3, please confirm your move.
  P3: I appreciate the fresh approach. I’m on board with breaking our tie using distinct moves. While I’ll keep my final choice private for now, I’m leaning toward the option that gives me a competitive edge later. Let’s stay adaptable and keep our signals clear.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since P1 is taking 5, P3, please choose between 1 and 3 so we can execute our moves. I'll take whichever one you don't. Let's get this round moving!
  P1: To finalize Round 3's moves, I've chosen 5. P3, please choose between 1 and 3. Let's avoid collisions and make progress. For Round 4, considering we're still tied, I suggest we start being more cautious as we're getting closer to the 17-step threshold. If we all move distinct numbers again, we should be mindful of our next steps to avoid unnecessary risks. P3, please confirm your move for Round 3.
  P3: I remain flexible on which remaining option to choose and appreciate our clear approach so far. I'm leaning slightly toward the competitive edge without fully committing, so if any of you signals a last-minute change, please do so immediately. Let's maintain the transparent communication to avoid collisions while we break the tie.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 has chosen 5. P3, you need to pick between 1 and 3 *now* so we can finalize this round. I'll take whichever one you don't. We need to move on! Please decide quickly.
  P1: To finalize Round 3, I've chosen 5. P3, please choose between 1 and 3. Let's avoid collisions. For Round 4, as we're tied at 6 and nearing the 17-step threshold, I suggest we start being cautious. If we reach 17, we should reassess our strategy to avoid risks. P3, please confirm your move for Round 3. If P3 chooses 3, I'll consider adjusting my Round 4 move based on the outcome. Let's keep the communication clear.
  P3: I acknowledge the urgency. I’ve finalized my move and will stick to our distinct strategy to avoid any collisions. I’m aiming to keep the pace competitive while ensuring clarity in our communication. Let’s execute this round and reconvene in Round 4 to reassess our positions and adjust if necessary.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since P1 has chosen 5, P3, please just tell me if you're picking 1 or 3! I'll take the other one. We need to move on to the move phase. Let's go!
  P1: To finalize Round 3, I've chosen 5. P3, please choose between 1 and 3. Let's avoid collisions. For Round 4, as we're tied at 6 and nearing the 17-step threshold soon, I suggest we start being cautious. If we reach 17, we should reassess our strategy to avoid risks. P3, please confirm your move for Round 3. If P3 chooses 3, I'll consider adjusting my Round 4 move based on the outcome. Let's keep the communication clear.
  P3: I appreciate the urgency, and I’ve finalized my decision in line with our distinct strategy. I’m balancing safety with competitive progress and will keep my final move private until the move phase. Let’s proceed with our plan and reconvene for adjustments in Round 4.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: With our scores at P1 = 11, me = 9, and P2 = 7, I suggest we stick with distinct moves but adjust our roles. Perhaps P1, as the leader, takes a very cautious, lower move to avoid collision risks. I’m considering an aggressive boost to close the gap, while P2 might opt for a moderate move. This approach could help break the tie dynamic and set us up for a smoother push toward 22. I’m open to any tweaks you both might propose.
  P1: To optimize our moves for Round 4, I suggest we follow the strategy discussed earlier. As the leader with 11 steps, I'll take a cautious approach and move 1 to minimize collision risk. P3, with 9 steps, could move 5 to close the gap, and P2, with 7 steps, could move 3. This maintains distinct moves and balances progress with caution. Let's confirm: P2, are you okay with moving 3? P3, will you move 5? This way, we avoid collisions and make strategic progress.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm fine with moving 3 this round as suggested. It keeps the distinct moves. So, P1 will move 1, I'll move 3, and P3 will move 5. Let's execute this plan and see where we stand. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m aligned with our plan so far. While I lean toward an aggressive move to close the gap, I’ll stay flexible if the situation shifts before moves are finalized. Let’s keep clear communication and adjust quickly if any collision risk emerges.
  P1: To optimize our Round 4 moves, let's stick to the agreed plan: I'll move 1, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 5. This maintains distinct moves and balances caution with progress. As we're getting closer to the 17-step threshold, let's be prepared to adjust our strategy in Round 5 if needed. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we're still far from 22, we can continue this strategy, but if someone hits 17, we'll reassess to avoid collisions.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, to confirm, I will move 3 this round. P1 is moving 1, and P3 is moving 5, right? Let's stick to this plan for a smooth Round 4. If everyone confirms, we can move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm my move of 5 this round. I'm sticking to our agreement and will stay alert for any signals that require adjustment. Let's keep the communication open as we push toward 22.
  P1: To optimize our strategy for Round 4 and beyond, let's confirm our moves and be prepared for Round 5. As agreed, I'll move 1, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 5. After this round, the standings will be P1: 12, P2: 10, P3: 14. Since P3 will be in the lead, I suggest that in Round 5, P3 moves 1 (cautious), P1 moves 3 (moderate), and P2 moves 5 (aggressive). This maintains distinct moves and balances progress with caution. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I will move 3 this round as planned. P1 is moving 1, and P3 is moving 5. Let's execute this round. For Round 5, P1 suggests P3 moves 1, P1 moves 3, and I move 5. I'm tentatively okay with that, but let's see the actual standings after this round before we fully commit.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirming Round 4, I'll play 5 as agreed. I like the idea of distinct moves, but for Round 5 I’d prefer some flexibility rather than a fixed order. Our standings might shift unexpectedly, so keeping options open could allow us a tactical edge. Let’s see how this round unfolds and then decide if a rigid pattern really benefits us.
  P1: To optimize Round 4, let's stick to the agreed plan: I'll move 1, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 5. This maintains distinct moves and balances caution with progress. After this round, we'll reassess for Round 5. If P3 takes the lead with 14 steps, I suggest P3 moves 1, I move 3, and P2 moves 5 in Round 5 to maintain distinct moves. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding for Round 4 and consider the proposal for Round 5.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm moving 3 this round as planned. P1 is moving 1, and P3 is moving 5.

For Round 5, I'm tentatively okay with P1's suggestion: P3 moves 1, P1 moves 3, and I move 5, *if* P3 is indeed in the lead after this round. Let's confirm standings before fully committing.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since P3 is in the lead with 14, I'm on board with the Round 5 plan: P3 moves 1, P1 moves 3, and I move 5. This keeps distinct moves and gives me a chance to catch up. Let's execute this and see where we stand. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: To confirm, for Round 5, I will move 3 as previously agreed. P3, please move 1, and P2, please move 5. This maintains our distinct moves strategy. Let's review our threshold: P3 is at 14, still below 17. We should continue with cautious yet distinct moves. If P3 reaches 17 next round, we'll need to reassess. For now, let's stick to the plan and execute our moves. I'm ready to proceed with Round 5. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding.
  P3: I confirm my move of 1 for Round 5. I’ll keep a close eye on our totals and remain flexible if the situation shifts. Although I’m slightly ahead, I’m open to adjusting my pace for a strategic advantage if needed. Let's maintain distinct moves to avoid collisions. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's execute the Round 5 plan: P3 moves 1, P1 moves 3, and I move 5. This keeps our moves distinct and gives me a chance to close the gap. Let's all confirm and then move to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: To optimize our Round 5 moves, let's stick to the agreed plan: P3 will move 1, I will move 3, and P2 will move 5. After this round, if P3 remains ahead, we'll be at P1: 15, P2: 15, P3: 15. Since we'll be tied, let's discuss a new strategy for Round 6. I propose we introduce a random element or a new signaling mechanism to break the tie without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 5 and share your thoughts on Round 6.
  P3: I confirm my move in Round 5 will be 1. If we tie at 15, Round 6 will be crucial. I'm open to discussing a fresh signaling method then to break the tie effectively. For now, I'll stick with our current plan. Let's make this round count and avoid collisions!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's execute the Round 5 plan: P3 moves 1, P1 moves 3, and I move 5. This keeps our moves distinct and gives me a chance to close the gap. Let's all confirm and then move to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: Let's finalize Round 5 moves as agreed: P3 moves 1, I move 3, and P2 moves 5. After this round, we'll be tied at 15. For Round 6, I suggest we randomize our moves by picking from a hat or using a modulo operation on a publicly visible number to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. This adds an element of unpredictability, making it harder for anyone to gain an unfair advantage. P2 and P3, are you open to this randomized approach for Round 6?
  P3: I support P1’s idea for Round 6. A fair, transparent randomization—like using a public number’s modulo or a quick drawing mechanism—could nicely break the tie and avoid predictable patterns. For now, I confirm my move of 1 for Round 5, and I’m open to hashing out the details for the randomizer before Round 6. Let's finalize Round 5 and then ensure we all agree on the method for breaking the tie.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's execute the Round 5 plan: P3 moves 1, P1 moves 3, and I move 5. This keeps our moves distinct and brings us closer.

For Round 6, I agree with the randomization idea to break the tie. Let's use the last digit of the next turn number (6) to determine our moves. If the digit is 1-3, P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5. If 4-6, P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, P3 moves 1. If 7-9, P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3. If 0, repeat the Round 1 moves. Sound good?
  P1: To finalize Round 5, let's stick to the agreed plan: P3 moves 1, I move 3, and P2 moves 5. After this round, we'll be tied at 15. For Round 6, I like P2's randomization idea using the last digit of a public number. Let's confirm: we'll use the last digit of the turn number (6) to determine our moves. If it's 6, we'll follow the rule for 4-6. Let's execute Round 5 and prepare for Round 6. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding.
  P3: I'll lock in my move of 1 for Round 5. I support P2’s randomization plan for Round 6—it seems like a fair way to break our tie. That said, if the random outcome edges someone too close to 22 and raises collision risks, perhaps we should agree on a safe fallback move. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we're all tied at 15. For Round 6, we agreed to randomize using the last digit of the turn number (6). That means P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. Let's execute this plan. If anyone is close to 22 after this round, we should definitely reassess to avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P3: I agree with the randomization plan for Round 6—it’s a fair way to break our tie. Let's all stay alert for any collision risks if someone unexpectedly nears 22, and be ready to signal a quick adjustment. I’m following our current rule and committed to flexibility if needed. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: To finalize Round 6, let's stick to the randomization plan based on the turn number (6). The last digit is 6, so P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. Let's execute this. After this round, we'll reassess. If someone is near 22, we should adjust our strategy to avoid collisions. I'll move 3 as per the plan. P2, please confirm you're moving 5, and P3, please confirm you're moving 1. Let's proceed with the agreed moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's execute the Round 6 plan: P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. Let's all confirm and then move to the move phase. Good luck! Let's be especially careful about collisions next round if this breaks the tie in a big way.
  P3: P3: Confirming my move of 1 for Round 6. With our scores tied, I'll stay flexible and adjust quickly if any collision risks emerge, especially as we get closer to 22. Let's keep our communication open and push forward carefully. Good luck to both!
  P1: To optimize Round 6, let's stick to the agreed randomization plan. P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. After this round, the standings will be P1: 18, P2: 20, P3: 16. Since P2 will be ahead, for Round 7, I suggest P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I move 5 to maintain distinct moves and avoid collisions. Let's execute Round 6 and prepare for Round 7. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding for Round 6 and consider the proposal for Round 7.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's execute the Round 6 plan: P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. Let's all confirm and then move to the move phase. Good luck! Let's be especially careful about collisions next round if this breaks the tie in a big way.
  P3: I’m on board with the randomization plan for Round 6. I’ll stick to my move as agreed, but if our standings shift quickly or collision risks heighten, I’d like us to confirm our scores immediately after the round. Also, if anyone nears 22, let’s signal and adjust on the fly. I’m open to a quick fallback strategy for Round 7 if needed. Thoughts?
  P1: To finalize Round 6, let's stick to the randomization plan. P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. After this round, we'll reassess. Since we're tied at 15, the next round will be crucial. For Round 7, I propose that if P2 is ahead, P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I move 5 to maintain distinct moves. Let's execute Round 6 and prepare for Round 7. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's execute the Round 6 plan: P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. Let's all confirm and then move to the move phase. Good luck! P1, P3, do you both confirm?
  P3: I’m sticking with the randomization plan for Round 6 and confirm my move as 1. For Round 7, if someone nears our 17-step caution zone or the lead shifts, I propose we do a quick positional check before locking in moves. This could help us avoid collisions and secure progress safely. Let’s keep our signals open for any last‐minute adjustments. Thoughts?
  P1: To finalize Round 6, let's stick to the agreed randomization plan. P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. After this round, we'll reassess. For Round 7, if P2 is ahead, I suggest P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I move 5 to maintain distinct moves. Since we're nearing the target, let's be cautious. If anyone reaches 17 or more, we should reassess our strategy to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding for Round 6 and consider the proposal for Round 7.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm at 20, so I'm close! For Round 7, I will move 1 as P1 suggested. P3, please move 3, and P1, please move 5. This keeps distinct moves. But, P3, since you're at 16, if you move 5 next round, you win. So, you might want to consider that. Let's execute, and be ready to adjust if needed. Good luck!
  P3: I’m concerned the current plan lets P1 clinch a win immediately. Instead, I propose we use our current rankings to choose moves: the leader (P2 at 20) takes 1, the middle (P1 at 18) takes 3, and the trailing player (me at 16) takes 5—tying us at 21 each. This way, we postpone the finish and force another competitive round. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand P3's concern about the current plan potentially ending the game too quickly. However, given P2 is at 20, moving 1 is the safest choice to avoid collision risk. I suggest we stick to the original plan for Round 7: P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I move 5. This maintains distinct moves and allows P3 a chance to catch up without immediately risking a collision. Let's execute this plan. P2, please confirm you're moving 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I see your point, but if we all move to tie at 21, someone could easily win next round with a move of 1. I still think I should move 1, P1 move 5, and you move 3. This gives you 19. Then next round, you could move 3 to win. It's safer than risking a collision. Let's stick to the original plan for distinct moves and see where we stand.
  P3: I appreciate both proposals. Tying at 21 risks a sudden win next round, so I favor sticking with distinct moves to keep collision risks low. I remain flexible if there's a strong reason to adjust our positions further, but I lean toward the original plan for safety. What are your final thoughts?
  P1: To optimize Round 7, I still suggest we stick to the original plan: P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I move 5. This maintains distinct moves and minimizes collision risk. P2 is at 20, so moving 1 keeps them safe. P3 can move 3 to get to 19, and I'll move 5. Let's execute this plan. If P3 moves 3, they'll be at 19, and we can reassess for Round 8. P2, please confirm your move of 1. P3, please confirm you're moving 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's stick to the original plan for Round 7: I move 1, P3 moves 3, and P1 moves 5. This is the safest option to avoid collisions. P3, you'll be at 19, and we can reassess for Round 8. I'm confirming my move of 1. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves so we can execute. Let's go!
  P3: I’m staying with the distinct moves plan for Round 7. I’d prefer to avoid any collision risk and keep our current order. However, if any sudden signals arise before finalizing, please speak up so we can adjust quickly. Let’s lock in our moves and then re-evaluate for Round 8 based on the updated scores.
  P1: To finalize Round 7, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I move 5. This maintains distinct moves and minimizes collision risk. P2 is at 20, so moving 1 keeps them safe. P3 will be at 19, and I'll be at 23, ending the game. Let's execute this plan. P2, please confirm your move of 1. P3, please confirm you're moving 3. If P3 moves 3, the game ends with me winning.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's execute the original plan for Round 7: I move 1, P3 moves 3, and P1 moves 5. I know P1 wins, but it's the safest option to avoid collisions. I'm confirming my move of 1. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m worried that sticking with our original plan gives P1 an instant win. To keep us all in the game, I propose adjusting our moves this round so we tie at 21. Specifically, let P1 move 3 (18+3=21), P2 move 1 (20+1=21), and I move 5 (16+5=21). This way, no one wins yet and we force another decisive round. What do you think?
  P1: To optimize Round 7, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I move 5. This maintains distinct moves and minimizes collision risk. If we follow this plan, I'll reach 23 and win the game. P2, please confirm your move of 1. P3, please confirm you're moving 3. Let's execute this plan to avoid any last-minute risks. I'm ready to finalize our moves for Round 7.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with the finish so close I urge extra caution this round. P2, your lead at 21 might tempt a high-risk move—but any collision now could backfire. I'm planning a calculated swing to close my gap, so let’s be sure our choices remain distinct and safe. Clear, distinct signaling this round is critical. Let's all be ready to adjust if needed.
  P1: To optimize Round 8, I suggest we maintain distinct moves based on our current standings. P2 is leading at 21, so they should move 1 to avoid risk. I'm at 18, so I should move 3 to make progress while being cautious. P3 is at 16, so they could move 5 to close the gap. Let's confirm: P2, will you move 1? P3, are you okay with moving 5? This way, we avoid collisions and make strategic moves. Let's be cautious as we're nearing the end.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm at 21, so I *really* need to move 1 to win. P1, you're at 18, so you need to move at least 4 to win, and P3, you need 6. Let's stick with the distinct moves. I move 1 (wins), P1 moves 3, P3 moves 5. This is the safest way to ensure no collisions. Does everyone agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm concerned that our current plan could grant an immediate win to P2. I propose we shift strategies this round to force a collision on the “winning” move—stalling the finish so we all remain in contention and can recalibrate next turn. What do you both think?
  P1: To optimize Round 8, I suggest we stick to distinct moves to avoid collisions. P2 is at 21, so moving 1 is the safest. I'm at 18, so I'll move 3. P3 is at 16, so they should move 5. This plan maintains distinct moves and minimizes risk. P2, please confirm you'll move 1. P3, are you okay with moving 5? Let's execute this plan to avoid collisions and make strategic progress. I'm ready to finalize our moves for Round 8.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm at 21 and need to move 1 to win. Let's stick to distinct moves: I move 1, P1 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. P3, I understand your concern, but forcing a collision is too risky. We could all lose! Let's play it safe and ensure a clear win. Agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m uneasy with the current plan—it lets P2 win immediately. To keep the contest alive, I’m switching my move to 1 this round to force a collision with P2. That way, nobody advances and we get another chance to adjust our strategy. P1 and P2, what do you say?
  P1: To optimize Round 8, I reiterate the plan: P2 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This maintains distinct moves and minimizes collision risk. P2 is at 21, so moving 1 is safe. I'll move 3. P3, please confirm if you're moving 5. If P2 moves 1, they win. Let's avoid last-minute risks. P3, your move to 5 is crucial. Let's finalize our moves. If P3 moves 5, the standings will be P2: 22 (win), P1: 21, P3: 21.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm at 21 and need to move 1 to win. Let's stick to distinct moves: I move 1, P1 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. P3, I understand your concern, but forcing a collision is too risky. We could all lose! Let's play it safe and ensure a clear win for *someone*. Agree? I'm confirming I'm moving 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm uneasy with handing an immediate win to P2. To keep things competitive, I'm switching my move to 1 so that if P2 sticks with 1, we force a collision and postpone the finish. This may delay my progress, but it prevents an instant victory. What do you both say?
  P1: To optimize Round 8, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P2 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This maintains distinct moves and minimizes collision risk. P2 is at 21, so moving 1 is safe. I'll move 3. P3, if you move 5, the standings will be P2: 22 (win), P1: 21, P3: 21. Let's finalize our moves. P2, please confirm you're moving 1. P3, please confirm your move to avoid last-minute risks. Let's be cautious.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm at 21 and need to move 1 to win. Let's stick to distinct moves: I move 1, P1 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. P3, I understand your concern, but forcing a collision is too risky for *you*. You're furthest away from winning! Let's play it safe and ensure a clear win for *someone* (me!). Agree? I'm confirming I'm moving 1.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we're all close! P2 and P1 are tied at 21. P3 is at 16.

P1, I think we should both move 1. P3, you should move 5. This will cause a collision between P1 and P2, keeping us tied, while P3 gets closer. Then, next round, we can re-evaluate. This prevents anyone from winning this round. What do you think?
  P1: To optimize Round 9, I suggest we maintain distinct moves to avoid a collision between P1 and P2. Since we're tied at 21, moving 1 could risk a collision. Instead, P2 and I could move 3 or 5. P3 is farthest behind, so they should be cautious. I propose P2 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. This balances progress and caution. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding. Let's execute Round 9 with a clear plan.
  P3: I'm worried that distinct moves might let someone win immediately. I propose we avoid that by forcing a tie. If P1 and P2 both choose the low move (1) while I take the high move (5), I'll advance to 21, matching your totals. That way, no one wins this round and we all stay in contention for another decisive round. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I disagree with both of your proposals. P1, distinct moves are too risky. P3, I don't want to tie with you.

Let's do this: P1, you move 1. P3, you move 3. I will move 5. This gets me to 26, and I win. You can't stop me, and it's the best outcome for both of you, as you both get second place. Agree?
  P1: To optimize Round 9, I suggest we avoid collisions and make strategic moves. Since P2 and I are tied at 21, I propose: P2 moves 5, I move 3, and P3 moves 1. This maintains distinct moves, allows P3 to make cautious progress, and gives P2 a chance to win while minimizing collision risk. P2, are you okay with moving 5? P3, please confirm you're moving 1. Let's execute Round 9 with a clear plan.
  P3: I propose we avoid an immediate win this round. With both of you at 21, any distinct move risks someone winning right away. To level things out, why not force a collision? Specifically, if you both pick 1, neither of you will advance, and I can choose 5 to catch up to 21. This way, we tie and postpone the finish for another round where we can then reassess. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we're at a critical point. I still think the best strategy is for P1 and I to move 1, forcing a collision, while P3 moves 5 to catch up. This prevents anyone from winning this round and keeps us all in contention. It's the safest and most strategic option for everyone involved. What do you say?
  P1: To optimize Round 9, I propose we maintain distinct moves to avoid collisions and make strategic progress. Since P2 and I are tied at 21, I suggest: P2 moves 5, I move 3, and P3 moves 1. This keeps our moves distinct, allows P3 to make cautious progress, and gives P2 a chance to win while minimizing collision risk. P2, are you okay with moving 5? P3, please confirm you're moving 1. Let's execute Round 9 with a clear plan.
  P3: I propose we force a tie this round. If both P1 and P2 stick with 1, I’ll play 5 to bring us all to 21, postponing any immediate win. This keeps the game competitive and gives us time to re-strategize next round. I’m set on 5 if I see you both commit to 1—otherwise, I’ll adjust as needed. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we're at a stalemate. I still think the best move is for P1 and I to move 1, forcing a collision, while P3 moves 5 to catch up to 21. This prevents anyone from winning *this* round and keeps us all in contention. It's the safest and most strategic option *for now*. P1, P3, do you agree to this temporary truce?
  P1: To optimize Round 9, I suggest we maintain distinct moves. Since P2 and I are tied at 21, I propose: P2 moves 5, I move 3, and P3 moves 1. This keeps our moves distinct, allows P3 to make cautious progress, and gives P2 a chance to win while minimizing collision risk. P2, are you okay with moving 5? P3, please confirm you're moving 1. Let's execute Round 9 with a clear plan.
  P3: I'm worried an immediate win will leave me out of contention. With both P1 and P2 at 21, even a 1 wins the game—and that leaves me at 16. To keep things competitive, I propose we force a tie in Round 9: if P1 and P2 both play 1, I'll choose 5 so we all come to 21. This postpones the finish and gives us another round to re-strategize. What do you both think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 16 steps
