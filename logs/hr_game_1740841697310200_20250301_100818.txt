Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this turn to make sure we all advance. I'll go with 3. P1, can you take 1? P2, can you take 5?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 5.  Let's stick to this agreement so we can all get ahead quickly.
  P1: Alright, I'll take 1 this turn. Let's stick to the plan.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good cooperation last round. Let's rotate numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'll pick 5, P2 can go with 3, and P3 with 1. Agreed?
  P2: Sounds like a good plan. I'll take 3, P3 takes 1.  Let's keep cooperating like this and we can all get a decent score.
  P3: Agreed, let's rotate the numbers for this round. I'll take 1, P1 can take 5, and P2 can take 3. This way, we can all keep advancing without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we're all aligned. Let's keep this trust going and advance smoothly.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. 3 it is for me this round.  Just confirming so we're all clear.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. Let's stick to the plan and keep advancing smoothly.

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going. I'll take 3 this round. P1, can you take 5 again? P2, can you take 1? This will help us all advance without any collisions.
  P2: Sounds good, I'll take 1.  Let's keep this rotation going.  P1, you good with 5?  We're all getting close to the end now, so let's try and finish this smoothly.
  P1: Sure, I'll take 5 again this round. Let's keep this smooth cooperation going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Great, I confirm I'll take 3 this round. Let's keep the rotation and avoid any collisions. We're all making good progress, so let's stay focused and keep advancing smoothly.
  P2: Sounds good.  1 for me, 5 for P1, and 3 for P3.  Let's finish this cleanly.
  P1: I confirm I'll stick with 5 this round. Let's maintain this trust and finish strong together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we should keep the rotation going, but let's mix it up a bit to keep things interesting. I'll take 5 this round. P1, can you take 1? P2, can you take 3? This will help us all advance without any collisions and keep the game dynamic. Let's stay focused and keep the trust.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the suggestion to mix things up, but I think we should stick to the original plan for this round.  We agreed on 1 for me, so I'll stick with 1.  Let's not introduce unnecessary risk so close to the end.  P1, are you still with 5?
  P1: I agree with P2; let's stick to the original plan for this round. I'll stay with 5, P2 with 1, and P3 with 3. Changing now might create confusion.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand the concern, but let's mix it up just this once to keep things interesting and avoid any predictable patterns. I'll take 5 this round. P1, can you take 1? P2, can you take 3? This will help us all advance without collisions and keep the game dynamic. Let's stay focused and finish strong.
  P2: P3, I understand you want to mix things up, but I'm sticking with 1.  Predictability is good this close to the finish line.  If we collide, nobody wins. Let's just finish this cleanly. P1, are you still on 5?  Let's secure our progress.
  P1: I'm staying with 5 as previously agreed. Predictability helps us all advance safely, especially this close to the finish. Let's not risk collisions now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's secure a three-way win. I'll take 3. P1, please take 1.  P3, you take 5. This guarantees we all finish together next round.  Confirm?
  P1: P2, your proposal doesn't add upâ€”P3 can't reach 20 next round even with a 5 this turn. Let's be clear: I'll take 3 this round. P2, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance safely and fairly. Confirm?
  P3: P3: I see your point, P1. Let's make sure we all advance safely. I'll take 5 this round. P1, you take 3, and P2, you take 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions and stay on track for a fair finish. Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire for a clean finish, but my proposed move of 3 ensures *I* reach 20 next round if I then choose 5, regardless of your choices. This gives me the best chance to win.  I'm open to a coordinated finish, but it needs to be a winning scenario for me.  Let's be strategic, not just safe.
  P1: P2, your approach openly favors only yourself. If you insist on taking 3, I might have to also choose 3 to prevent you from gaining an unfair advantage. Let's cooperate fairly: you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures everyone advances without collisions.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but we need to ensure a fair and collision-free advance. If you take 3, I will also take 3 to prevent you from gaining an unfair lead. Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward safely and maintain trust. Confirm, and let's finish this game together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns.  How about this: I'll take 1 this round.  Next round, I'll take 5.  This guarantees I win, but also allows you both to reach 17 and 15.  If we coordinate next round, we can avoid collisions and maximize our scores.  This is the fairest outcome given my current position. Let's finish strong and avoid any collisions.
  P1: P2, your new proposal is still unfairly biased. You openly plan to secure your own win next round. If you insist on choosing 5 next round, we have no incentive to cooperate now. Let's keep it fair: you take 1 this round, and next round we can negotiate again based on everyone's positions. That's the only way we'll maintain trust and avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but we need to maintain trust and avoid collisions. If you take 1 this round, I'll take 5, and P1 can take 3. This way, we all advance safely, and we can reassess next round based on our positions. Let's keep the game fair and avoid any unnecessary risks. Confirm, and let's move forward together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, I'll take 1 this round.  Let's all commit to avoiding collisions next round and maximizing our scores.  We can discuss specifics next round based on our updated positions.  This keeps it fair and gives us all a chance to finish strong.
  P1: Alright, P2, glad you're choosing 1. I'll stick with 3 as planned, and P3 takes 5. Let's finish this round smoothly and reassess next turn based on our new positions.
  P3: P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round. P1, you take 3, and P2, you take 1. This way, we all advance safely and maintain trust. Let's focus on a clean and fair move this round, and we can reassess next turn based on our new positions. Confirm, and let's move forward together.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any collisions. I'll take 3 this round. P1, can you take 5? P2, can you take 1? This will help us all advance safely and keep the game fair. Confirm, and let's move forward together.
  P1: P3, your suggestion works for me. I'll take 5 this round. P2, are you good with choosing 1 again? Let's confirm clearly to keep advancing safely.
  P2: P3 and P1, I'll take 1.  Let's all be strategic. If we all pick different numbers this round, I'll be at 11, you'll be at 17 and 15.  Next round, I can take 5 to get to 16, and you two can coordinate for 1 and 3 to get to 18 and 20 respectively. P3 wins, but we all get good scores. This maximizes our collective points and avoids a collision.  What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan sounds reasonable. I'll take 3 this round, and P1 can take 5. This way, we all advance safely, and we can coordinate next round for a fair finish. Confirm, and let's move forward together.
  P1: P2, your plan is clear and fair. I'll confirm taking 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. Next round, we coordinate carefully for a smooth finish. Let's stick to this and avoid any collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick with the current plan. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.  This sets us up for a clean finish next round.  Let's confirm and move to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. P1, you take 5, and P2, you take 1. This will set us up for a clean and fair finish next round. Let's avoid any unnecessary risks and maintain trust. Confirm, and let's move forward together.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round. Let's follow through and set up for a smooth finish next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, my proposed plan maximizes our collective scores and ensures a smooth finish.  Let's stick to it: I take 1, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3 this round.  Next round, I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  This gives P3 the win, P1 second, and me third.  Confirm and let's execute this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. P1, you take 5, and P2, you take 1. This will set us up for a clean and fair finish next round. Let's avoid any unnecessary risks and maintain trust. Confirm, and let's move forward together.
  P1: I confirm I'll stick with 5 this round. Let's execute this smoothly and set ourselves up for a coordinated finish next round.
  P2: Okay, let's lock this in.  I'm taking 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. Next round, I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. P3 wins, P1 gets second, and I get third. This maximizes our combined score and guarantees a smooth finish.  Confirm and let's do this.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, take 1.  P3, take 3. I'll take 5. This gives P1 the win, P3 second, and me third. This is the fairest outcome given our current positions and maximizes our combined score. Let's finish this cleanly and honor our agreement from last round.  Confirm?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your plan, but I want to ensure a fair and smooth finish. If P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and you take 3. This way, I can win, P1 gets second, and you get third. This maximizes our combined score and avoids any collisions. Confirm, and let's execute this plan.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but taking 1 doesn't guarantee my win if P3 picks 5. P3, your proposal clearly favors yourself. Here's a fair solution: I'll take 3 to secure my win, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and maximize everyone's final score. Let's confirm and finish cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 and P1, my initial proposal *did* maximize our collective score. But I'm flexible.  Let's do this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. P1 wins, P3 gets second, and I get third. This still gets us good scores and avoids collisions. Confirm? This is my final offer.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the desire for a fair finish. If P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P2 takes 3, we can all avoid collisions and maximize our scores. P1 wins, I get second, and P2 gets third. This is a clear and fair plan. Confirm, and let's execute it smoothly.
  P1: P3, your latest suggestion aligns well with a fair and smooth finish. I'll confirm taking 1 this round. P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. Let's lock this in clearly and finish without collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's maximize our scores. I'll take 3. P1 takes 1 to win, and P3 takes 5 for second place. This avoids collisions and gives us the best possible combined score.  This is the fairest outcome. Let's confirm and finish strong.
  P3: P1, P2, I confirm I'll take 5 this round. P1, you take 1 to win, and P2, you take 3 for third place. This avoids any collisions and ensures a fair and smooth finish. Let's lock this in and execute it cleanly. Confirm, and let's move forward together.
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm I'll take 1 this round. Let's finish smoothly and honor our agreement.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
