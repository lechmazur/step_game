Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions in this first round. I suggest we each pick different numbers - maybe I can take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep this coordination going to avoid collisions.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's do that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we all agree. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan for this round. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If this works, we can discuss adjustments for the next round.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's do that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: Let's stick to the plan for this round. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If this works, we can discuss adjustments for the next round.
  P2: Sounds good to me.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: Let's stick to the plan for this round. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If this works, we can discuss adjustments for the next round.
  P2: Sounds good to me.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue our coordination. I suggest I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can keep advancing without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's do that again.
  P3: I think we should mix it up this round. Since I'm in the lead with 5 steps, I'll take 1, P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This keeps us coordinated but gives others a chance to catch up. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your suggestion, but I think sticking with our original plan is safer. Let's keep the pattern: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This ensures we all advance without risk of collision. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids any collisions.
  P3: I understand you want to maintain the original pattern, but as I'm already ahead, it would be more fair to rotate positions. I could take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way everyone gets a chance at different numbers. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, while I appreciate your suggestion for fairness, I believe maintaining our original strategy minimizes the risk of collisions. Let's stick with me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and you taking 5. This ensures steady progress for all of us. What do you say?
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids any collisions.
  P3: I see you both want to stick to the original plan, but that puts me at a big advantage which could lead to resentment later. I really think rotating positions would be better for group harmony. But if you insist on the original pattern, I'll consider it. What's your final word on this?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern for fairness, but maintaining our original strategy ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick with me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and you taking 5 for this round. We can discuss adjustments for future rounds if needed. What do you say?
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: Since both P1 and P2 are insistent on keeping the original pattern, I'll stop pushing for rotation. Let's proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's stick with the original plan for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. We can reassess for the next round.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P3, thanks for agreeing to stick with the original plan for this round. Let's proceed with me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and you taking 5. We can discuss adjustments for the next round if needed.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the original plan for this round.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I am now quite far ahead at 10 steps. I think it's really in your best interest to let me take a smaller number this round. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This gives you both a better chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion makes sense given their lead. Let's try P3 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and me taking 5 this round.
  P1: P3, while I appreciate your suggestion, I think it's important to maintain our original strategy to avoid collisions. Let's stick with me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and you taking 5 for this round. We can reassess for the next round if needed. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I must insist on taking 1 this round. With 10 steps already, if I take 5 again I'll be at 15 and almost certain to win next round. It's in both your interests to let me take 1 while you take larger numbers to have any chance of catching up. Think carefully about this.
  P2: "I agree with P3 that it's important to try and catch up. P1, I understand your desire to avoid collisions, but P3 is getting quite far ahead. Perhaps we can coordinate something different this round to address that?"
  P1: P3, I understand your lead and your proposal, but maintaining our strategy of me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and you taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this for this round and discuss adjustments for the next round if needed. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I need to be very clear: if you force me to take 5 again, I'll be at 15 steps and will easily win next round. Your only chance is to let me take 1 while you both take larger numbers. I'm giving you a fair warning - think about your own chances of winning.
  P2: I agree with P3. P1, sticking to the original plan will let P3 win. Let's do P3 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5.
  P1: P3, I understand your position, but sticking to our original plan ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. Let's keep it for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. We can adjust next round if needed. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I will definitely not take 5 this round as it would guarantee my win. If you want any chance of winning, you need to let me take 1. If you don't agree, I may have to pick randomly which could cause collisions. This is your last chance to coordinate reasonably.
  P2: P1, P3, let's do P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. P1, if we keep the original plan, P3 will win next round.
  P1: P3, I understand your lead and the urgency to adjust our strategy. However, sticking to our original plan has ensured no collisions so far. Let's compromise: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1 this round. This way, we adjust to your lead while still maintaining coordination. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I accept P1's latest compromise proposal. Let's do that - I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.
  P2: Okay, P3, sounds good - I'll take 5. P1, let's do as you suggested: you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is important to stop P3 from winning next round.
  P1: P3, I'm glad we've reached a compromise. Let's stick to the plan for this round: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. This should help balance our positions. We can reassess next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: 
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in the agreement: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5 this round.
  P1: P3, I'm glad we've agreed on this round's moves. Let's stick to the plan: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. This should help balance our positions. We can reassess next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, given your lead, I propose we continue the strategy from last round. You take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us coordinated and gives us a chance to balance our positions further. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but since P2 and I are tied at 11 steps, we need to be more strategic. I propose I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This gives P1 a chance to catch up while preventing P2 and me from colliding. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's do P3 take 1, I take 5, and P1 take 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about strategy, but sticking with the plan from last round ensures we continue to avoid collisions and maintain balance. Let's keep it: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. What do you say?
  P3: I must insist on taking 3 this round. Since P2 and I are tied at 11 steps, if either of us takes 5, they'll be at 16 and almost certain to win next round. I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1 to keep the game competitive. Otherwise, this game will end very soon.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan from last round: P3 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This puts me closer to the win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy, but sticking to last round's plan ensures balance and avoids collisions. Let's continue with you taking 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive for all. What do you say?
  P3: I need to be very clear - I will take 3 this round. If P2 takes 5, they'll be at 16 and win next turn. If you want a competitive game, P2 should take 1 and P1 take 5. Otherwise, we risk collisions and P2's certain victory.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3. P3 taking 3, P1 taking 5, and me taking 1 makes the most sense to keep the game competitive and prevent anyone from getting too close to 17 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy, but I believe sticking to the plan from last round is still the best way to maintain balance and avoid collisions. Let's continue with you taking 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive for all of us. What do you say?
  P3: I will absolutely not take 1 this round as it would let P2 win by taking 5. I am taking 3. P2 has agreed to take 1, and P1 should take 5 if they want any chance of winning. If you don't cooperate, I may have to choose randomly which risks collisions.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3. Let's do P3 take 3, P1 take 5, and I take 1. This makes sense to keep the game competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, I see your point about preventing P2 from winning next round. Let's adjust: you take 3, I'll take 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and gives us all a chance. What do you say?
  P3: I'm glad we've reached an agreement. Let's proceed with me taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 1.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in the agreement: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P3, I agree with the plan for this round: you take 3, I'll take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep the game competitive.
  P3: 
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, just confirming our agreement for this round: P3 will take 3, P1 will take 5, and I will take 1.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, given your lead at 14 steps, it's crucial we adjust our strategy to keep the game competitive. I propose you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5 this round. This way, we can prevent you from reaching 17 too quickly and give everyone a fair chance. What do you think?
  P3: I must take 1 this round to avoid winning too quickly. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive since I'll only be at 15 steps after this round, while P2 would reach 17 and P1 would be at 13.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's do that: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5.
