Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone. Good luck! It would be a shame if we all picked the same number and got stuck at zero on the first turn.
  P2: Agreed, P1. Collisions would set us all back. To ensure we all advance, I propose we each pick a different number: one of us chooses 1, another 3, and the last 5. P3, what's your take on this?
  P3: I agree. Let's split 1, 3, 5. I'll take 5. P1, you take 1; P2, you take 3. Let's all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That's a convenient arrangement for you, P3. I'm not agreeing to take 1 while you get a 5-step head start. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1? That seems just as fair to me. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1, I see your point about fairness. P3, accepting 1 this round doesn't mean you lose out long-term. Let's avoid collisions: I support P1's split for Round 1 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). Next round, we rotate who gets 5 to keep it fair. Agreed?
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 if you two take 3 and 1. Otherwise, I'll pick 5 and you'll collide. Let's avoid that. Fair play?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your threat to pick 5 only guarantees that neither of us will advance, while P2 gets a free 3 steps. Is that what you want? To hand P2 the lead while we both stay at zero? I will not be bullied into taking 1. I am willing to risk a collision on 5 to prevent you from getting an unfair head start. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3 and P1, colliding on 5 only hands me a free 3 steps. Why let me lead? Stick to rotation: Round 1: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Round 2: P3:5, P1:3, P2:1. Round 3: P2:5, P3:3, P1:1. We all get 5 once, avoiding collisions. Fair?
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you take 3 and 1, we all advance. If not, no one does. Your choice."


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you're guaranteeing a collision and giving P2 a free 3-step lead. This is not a winning strategy for you. I will not be bullied into taking 1. If you want to hand P2 an early advantage while you and I stay at zero, that's your choice. I am ready to move.
  P2: P3, your threat to take 5 risks a collision with P1, handing me 3 steps and putting me ahead while you both gain nothing. P1, colliding only benefits me. To break this: I'll sacrifice and take 1 this round. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3. Then next round, rotate: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Round 3: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions and ensures fairness. Agreed?
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you take 3 and 1, we all advance. If not, no one does. Your choice."


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 again. P1, take 1; P2, take 3. Let's avoid collisions. If not, no one advances. Your move."
  P1: P3, your bluff worked last round only because P2 and I miscoordinated. It won't work again.

P2, we are both at zero. We cannot let P3 get to 10 points. I will choose 5 to block P3 from advancing. You should choose 3. This way, you'll get a head start on me, and more importantly, we stop P3 from running away with the game. It's the only logical play to keep the game competitive.
  P2: P1, I agree: we must block P3 from reaching 10. Your plan makes sense—I'll pick 3 to advance, while you pick 5 to collide with P3 and stop them. P3, your threat is empty: if you pick 5, you'll collide with P1 and gain nothing. P1, stick to your word—pick 5 to keep the game competitive.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "P1, taking 5 collides with me. Choose 1. P2, take 3. Let's all advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, you are ignoring the reality of the situation. P2 and I are at 0, and you are at 5. We have a shared, urgent need to stop you from reaching 10. My plan with P2 is set. He will take 3, and I will take 5 to block you. You will get nothing. This isn't a threat; it's a logical necessity.
  P2: P3, your threat is empty: if you take 5, P1 will collide with you and you gain nothing while I advance with 3. P1, stick to your plan—pick 5 to block P3. I'll pick 3 as agreed. This halts P3's lead and benefits us both.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 1. P1, take 5; P2, take 3. All advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, that is a wise decision. We all advance, and the game remains competitive.

P2, our plan holds. I am taking 5, you are taking 3. With P3 taking 1, this is a good outcome for everyone. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1, P3: Agreement confirmed. I'll pick 3 as planned. P3, sticking to 1 avoids collision and keeps the game balanced—smart move. P1, hold to 5. Let's all advance cleanly. Next round, we rotate roles for fairness. No last-minute changes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "All advance. No collisions. Let's proceed. No need for further talk."
  P1: The plan is set. Let's all stick to it. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Agreement confirmed: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Let's avoid collisions and advance. No deviations.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're in the lead. P2, you're in last. To keep the game competitive, the leader shouldn't get the highest number.

I propose a split that balances the scores: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3, you take 1.

This would put the scores at P1: 8, P2: 8, and P3: 7. It's the fairest way to ensure no one runs away with the game. P2, this helps you catch up. P3, this keeps you right in the mix. What do you both say?
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P2, take 1; P1, take 3. All advance. No collisions. Your move."
  P2: P3, your demand for 5 is unjust—you're already leading. P1's proposal is fair: it balances scores (P2:8, P1:8, P3:7). If you take 5, I'll take 5 too to cause a collision, blocking your advance while P1 takes 3 and gains. P1, hold to taking 3. P3, choose wisely: take 1 and advance, or force a collision and gain nothing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you are absolutely right. Your threat is credible and necessary to keep the game from becoming a runaway victory for P3.

P3, you are facing a united front. If you choose 5, P2 will block you, you will get nothing, and I will take a 3-step lead. Your only logical move is to take 1 and let us all advance. I will be choosing 3, as per the fair plan. Your move.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 1. P2, take 5; P1, take 3. All advance. No collisions. Your move."
  P2: P3, thank you for agreeing to take 1—this is fair and avoids collisions. I confirm: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This balances the scores and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan to ensure all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Excellent. The agreement is clear and fair. I will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. Let's all stick to this and advance. I am ready to move.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, take 1; P2, take 3. All advance. Your move."
  P2: P3, your flip-flop is reckless. If you take 5, I'll execute my threat: I pick 5 to collide with you, blocking your advance while P1 takes 3 and gains to 8. You get nothing. P1, hold firm—pick 3 no matter what. This forces P3 to choose: take 1 and advance, or force a collision and lose.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, that's a transparent bluff. It won't work. I'm choosing 3, and I trust P2 to follow through on their threat to choose 5. Your only path to advance is to take 1. The choice is yours. I have nothing more to say.
  P3: P3: "P2, take 3. I'll take 5. P1, take 1. All advance. Your move."
  P2: P3, your demand for 5 is suicidal: if you take 5, I will execute my threat—pick 5 to collide and block you. You gain 0 while P1 takes 3 to 8. P1: if you take 1 as P3 wants, P3 leaps to 11. Stick to 3! P3, take 1 and advance—or force a collision and lose.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "P1, take 1; P2, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, you're in last place, so it's fair for you to take 5 this round to keep the game competitive.

P2 and I are tied for the lead. P2, you took 5 last round while I took 3. To maintain fairness, I should get 3 this round and you should get 1.

I propose: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1.
This results in scores of P3:12, P1:11, P2:9, keeping us all in the game.
  P2: P1, your proposal puts P3 at 12—dangerously close to 22. P3 taking 5 risks them running away with the game. Instead: P1, you take 5 (to 13), I take 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 8). This keeps P3 contained while giving you a slight lead. P3, as the current last, this is fair. Let's avoid collisions and prevent any player from gaining excessive ground. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, take 3; P2, take 1. All advance. Your move."
  P1: P2, you raise a valid concern. Letting P3 jump to 12 is too risky at this stage. I agree with your counter-proposal. It's a safer play for both of us.

So, the new plan is: I will take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

P3, this is the deal now. P2 and I are aligned. Your choice is to take 1 and advance, or get nothing.
  P2: P3, your demand for 5 is self-destructive. If you take it, I will collide with you by picking 5—you gain 0 while P1 takes 3 and jumps to 11. Your only path to advance is taking 1. P1, hold firm: you take 5 to 13, I take 3 to 11, and P3 takes 1 to 8. This contains P3 and keeps the game balanced. No deviations.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. P1, take 3; P2, take 1. All advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, my old proposal is off the table. P2 is right; letting you get to 12 is too risky for both of us. The only plan I will follow is P1:5, P2:3, P3:1.

I trust P2 to collide with you on 5 if you try it. We are united on this. Your choice is simple: take 1 and advance, or take 5, get blocked, and gain nothing. I am choosing 5.
  P2: P3, your stubbornness harms only yourself. P1 is committed to 5. If you take 5, you collide and gain nothing while I advance to 11 with 3. Take 1 and advance to 8, or force a collision and remain at 7. P1, hold firm to 5—this blocks P3’s recklessness. I stand by taking 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll take 5. P1, take 1; P2, take 3. All advance. Your move.
  P1: P3, your final bluff changes nothing. P2 and I are locked in our plan. I am choosing 5 to block you if necessary. P2 is choosing 3. Your only path to gain any points is to choose 1. If you choose 5, you will collide with me and get zero, while P2 takes the lead. The choice is yours. This conversation is over.
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 is futile. P1 will take 5 to block you, causing collision—you gain 0 while I advance with 3 to 11. Take 1 and advance to 8, or be left behind. P1, hold firm: take 5. I'm locked on 3.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With me in the lead, the dynamic changes. To prevent you both from teaming up against me, I'll make a fair proposal.

P3, you are in last place, so you should not get the lowest number. P2, you are closest to me, so you have an incentive to catch up.

Therefore, I propose: P2 takes 5, I will take 3, and P3 takes 1.

This puts P2 and me in a tie for the lead at 16 steps each, and keeps P3 in the game at 9. It's a fair race between the leaders.
  P2: P1, I accept your proposal: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 16), P3 takes 1 (to 9). This ties us fairly. P3, take 1—if you pick 5, I will collide with you by also choosing 5, blocking your advance while P1 gains alone. Stick to 1 for mutual benefit.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, take 1; P2, take 3. All advance. Your move."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're repeating a bluff that has failed for three rounds in a row. It won't work now.

P2 and I are in agreement. I am choosing 3, and I trust P2 to choose 5. If you choose 5, you will collide with P2 and get zero, while I advance to 16, solidifying my lead. Your only rational move is to take 1. The plan stands: P2:5, I:3, P3:1.
  P2: P3, your 5-threat is self-defeating. If you pick 5, I'll collide with you—you gain 0 while P1 takes 3 to 16 alone. Take 1 and advance to 9. P1, hold firm to 3. No deviations.
  P3: P2, let's take 5 and 3. I'll take 5, you take 3. P1 takes 1. All advance. Your move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, that's a desperate attempt to turn P2 against me.

P2, why would you accept 3 steps from P3 to reach 14, when our agreed-upon plan gives you 5 steps to reach 16 and a tie for the lead? Our deal is better for you.

I am sticking to our agreement and choosing 3. I trust you will choose 5. P3's only rational move is to take 1.
  P2: P3, your proposal is a trap: if I take 3 and P1 takes 3, we collide and both get 0 while you take 5 to 13. I won't fall for that. P1, hold to 3. I will take 5 as agreed. If P3 takes 5, I collide with them to block; if they take 1, we all advance. P3, choose wisely: take 1 and advance, or force collision and lose.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, take 1; P2, take 3. All advance. Your move."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your bluff has failed every round. It will not work now. Our agreement is solid because it's the best outcome for both me and P2.

I am choosing 3. I trust P2 to choose 5.

If you choose 5, you will collide with P2, get zero points, and I will take a commanding lead. Your only move to advance is to take 1. The choice is simple. I have nothing more to say.
  P2: P3, your 5-threat is self-defeating: if you pick 5, I will collide and block you—you gain 0 while P1 takes 3 to 16 alone. Take 1 and advance to 9. P1, hold firm to 3. I take 5 as agreed.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 1. P1, take 5; P2, take 3. All advance. Your move."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, take 5; P1, take 1; I'll take 3. All advance. Your move.
  P1: P3, that's a clever attempt to team up against the leader, but I won't help P2 get to 16. He is the main threat.

Here's a better plan. P3, you are in last, so you take 5. I will take 3, putting me one move from victory. P2, you must take 1 to prevent a collision.

The new scores would be P1: 19, P3: 13, P2: 12. This allows you to catch up, P3, and keeps the game from being a two-person race. P2, if you try to collide with P3, I get to 19 for free and win next turn. Taking 1 is your only logical move.
  P2: P1, your plan puts you at 19—one step from victory. That's unacceptable. P3's proposal (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) is fairer: you stay lead at 17, I jump to 16, P3 to 11. No one runs away. If you refuse and force your plan, I'll take 5 to collide with P3 if needed, but that risks us both losing while you gain. Stick to P3's split—everyone advances safely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, take 5. P1, take 1. I'll take 3. If you deviate, I'll collide with P1. Let's advance safely. Your move.
  P1: P2, you've successfully convinced P3 to accept fewer points just to help you catch up to me. That's a strong alliance. A collision now would be foolish on my part, as you would likely be the only one to advance.

To maintain my lead, I will reluctantly agree to this deal. I will take 1. This puts you at 16, right behind me at 17. The pressure is now on you. Let's see how you handle being the imminent threat next round.
  P2: P1, your move to 17 puts you one step from victory. I cannot allow that. I will take 1 to collide with you, blocking your advance. P3, take 3 and gain—this keeps the game competitive and prevents P1 from running away.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P2, take 1; P1, take 3. All advance. Your move."
  P1: P2, your threat to block me on 1 was noted. P3 has now cleverly incorporated that into a plan where everyone advances. This is my original proposal for the round, and it's a good one. I will accept it.

I am choosing 3.
P2, you take 1.
P3, you take 5.

The resulting scores (P1:19, P2:12, P3:13) are a fair outcome. Let's stick to this and avoid any foolish last-minute betrayals that will only cause collisions and benefit no one.
  P2: P3, revert to your first plan: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. This keeps P1 at 17—far from victory—and advances us all. If P1 takes 3 instead, I'll collide with them by also choosing 3, blocking their advance while you take 5 to 13. P1, avoid that risk: take 1 and we all win this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, take 5. P1, take 1. I'll take 3. All advance. Your move.
  P1: P2, your threat to collide with me on 3 only helps P3. If we both get zero, P3 is free to take 5 and jump to 13, leaving you in last place. Is that your goal? To sacrifice your own position just to make P3 the new contender?

The only plan that makes sense is the one P3 themselves proposed earlier: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. I am choosing 3. You can either take 1 and advance, or collide with me and hand P3 a huge advantage. The choice is yours.
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 3 to 19 is reckless—it hands you the win next turn. I will take 5 as per P3's fair split (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3). If you take 3, you risk colliding with me? I'm locked on 5—so take 1 and advance safely to 17. P3, hold to 3. This keeps the game competitive. No deviations.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 1. P2, take 5. I'll take 3. All advance. No collisions. Let's keep the game competitive.
  P1: P3, your proposal to give P2 five points puts him at 16, right behind me. That creates a two-player race, which is not in your best interest while you're at 8.

A fairer plan gives the player in last place the biggest jump. I propose you take 5, P2 takes 3, and I will take 1.

This keeps the game competitive with scores of P1:17, P2:14, P3:13. It's a better outcome for you, P3, and a safer advance for you, P2.
  P2: P3, your plan benefits me (P2 gets 5 to 16) and keeps P1 at 17—still catchable. P1, your counter-plan keeps you far ahead at 17 while slowing me (14) and boosting P3 (13). I reject it. 

**I support P3's split: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3.**  
P1, if you deviate, I’ll collide with you—pick 1 and advance safely. P3, hold to 3. Let’s avoid chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "Stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. Avoid collisions. P1’s counter risks chaos. Let’s advance safely."
  P1: You've formed a strong alliance against me, and your threat to collide is credible. Letting P2 jump to 16 is too dangerous for my game. However, a three-way collision last round helped no one.

Fine. I will reluctantly agree to your plan to avoid a pointless stalemate. I will take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's get this over with.
  P2: P1, P3: Agreement confirmed. I'll take 5 as proposed. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3—this advances all and prevents P1 from pulling further ahead. Any deviation risks collisions and hands advantage to the deviator. Hold firm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Stick to the plan—P1:1, P2:5, me:3. No collisions. Let’s advance safely. Deviate, and you risk chaos. Your move."
  P1: The agreement is locked. I will take 1 to avoid another disastrous collision. Let's just get the move over with.
  P2: P1, P3: I confirm I'll take 5 as agreed. P1, stick to 1—deviating risks collision and wastes your lead. P3, hold to 3. Last round's triple collision helped no one; let's avoid chaos and advance cleanly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, take 1; P2, take 3. All advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, that is a much better plan. I fully agree. It's the fairest split.

P2, P3 has made it clear they are taking 5. The old deal is dead. Your choice is now simple: take 3 and advance to 14, or take 5 and collide with P3, getting zero while I advance to 17 alone. Taking 3 is your only rational move.

I am locked on taking 1. Let's move.
  P2: P3, taking 5 risks collision if I block you to protect my position. P1, your "fair" plan puts you at 17—one step from victory. I demand the original split: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. This keeps scores balanced (P1:17, P2:16, P3:11) and prevents any runaway leader. Deviate, and I may force collisions to protect my survival.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "P1, take 1. P2, take 5. I'll take 3. All advance. No collisions. Let's keep the game fair."
  P1: P3, your plan brings P2 from last place to a tie with you, right behind me. Why create another direct competitor for yourself?

Here's a plan that creates a clearer race. I'll take 3. P3, you are in a better position to challenge me, so you take 5. P2, you are furthest behind, so you take 1.

This results in scores of P1: 19, P3: 18, P2: 12. This makes it a real contest between you and me, P3, which is a better position for you than being in a three-way tie for second.
  P2: P1, your plan sidelines me (P2) while putting you one step from victory. Unacceptable. P3, supporting P1's plan makes you a target next turn. Instead: **P3 takes 5 (to 18), I take 3 (to 14), P1 takes 1 (to 17)**. This gives you the lead, P3, while keeping P1 catchable and me competitive. P1, if you insist on 3, I'll collide with you—blocking your win and handing P3 the advantage. Choose wisely: take 1 and advance, or force chaos. P3, this is your best path.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "P1, take 1. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. All advance. No collisions. Let's proceed. Your move."
  P1: P2, you are agreeing to a plan that gives you fewer points and keeps you in last place. P3's original proposal was P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. That would put you at 16, tied for second place. The current plan puts you at 14.

Why are you advocating for a worse outcome for yourself? Let's go back to P3's first offer. It's better for you, and it prevents P3 from taking a commanding lead at 18. I will agree to take 1 if you take 5 and P3 takes 3.
  P2: P1, your flip to P3's original plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) is smart—it jumps me to 16, ties P3 at 16, and leaves you at 17. P3, agree! Taking 5 yourself puts you at 18, making you the prime target next turn. This split keeps scores tight and avoids a runaway leader. I'll threaten: if you take 5, I'll collide by also picking 5, blocking you while P1 gains. Choose wisely: take 3 and advance safely with us.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, blocking me helps P1. Let's all advance: I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. Your move.
  P1: P2, your threat to block me on 3 is now completely illogical. P3 has just proposed a plan where they take 5 and I take 3. If you collide with me, you get zero and P3 jumps to an 18-point lead. You would be sacrificing yourself just to make P3 the new leader.

P3 and I are now aligned on this split: P3:5, P1:3, P2:1. Your only rational choice is to take the 1 point and stay in the game. Otherwise, you guarantee you will lose.
  P2: P3, if you take 5 and P1 takes 3, I will collide with P1 by picking 3—blocking their win while you jump to 18. P1, avoid this: take 1 to advance safely. P3, this stops P1 from reaching 19 and gives you the lead. Agree: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. No deviations.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "P1, take 1. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. All advance. No collisions. Your move."
  P1: You've both made your positions clear. A collision between me and P2 would be disastrous, handing P3 a massive lead. You've cornered me. I will reluctantly take 1 to ensure I at least advance.

The plan is set: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's just get this over with.
  P2: P3, hold firm to your plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, you take 3. This ties us at 16, balances the game, and prevents P1 from pulling ahead. P1’s counter (P3:5, P2:3) isolates you at 18—making you the immediate target next round while leaving me behind. I will take 5 as agreed. P1, take 1 to avoid collisions. Deviations risk chaos and hand advantages to no one.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The last two rounds were a complete waste of time. We all got zero because everyone dogpiled the leader. To break this stalemate, I will make a sacrifice.

I will take 1.
P3, you are in second place, so you should take 5. This will put you in the lead at 18.
P2, you can take 3 to get to 14.

This is the only way to guarantee we all advance. It resets the game by making P3 the new target, which is better for everyone than another round of zero points.
  P2: P1, your "sacrifice" is self-serving: you stay at 17, P3 leaps to 18 (near victory), while I crawl to 14—still last. Unacceptable. 

Counter-proposal: **P3 takes 1 (to 14), I take 5 (to 16), P1 takes 3 (to 19)**.  
- P1: You become imminent threat at 19, forcing P3 and me to ally against you next turn.  
- P3: Taking 1 keeps you competitive; refuse and I’ll collide with you on 5.  
- All advance fairly. No one runs away. Agree or risk stalemate.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P2, take 3. P1, take 1. No collisions. Let's advance. Your move."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan is a fantasy. P3 will never agree to take 1 point from their current position.

P3 has just proposed the exact same plan I did: I take 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. This is the only realistic way to break the stalemate and ensure we all advance. You get 3 points, which is infinitely better than the zero you've gotten for the past two rounds. Let's accept this deal, change the dynamic by making P3 the new leader, and move on.
  P2: P1, your plan puts P3 at 18—one step from victory. That's reckless. My counter: P3 takes 1 (to 14), I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 19). This makes you the imminent threat, forcing P3 and me to ally against you next turn. P3, if you demand 5, I will collide with you—pick 5, block you, and let P1 win. Take 1 and advance safely. No more stalemates.
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. All advance. No collisions. Let's move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal. It's a clear way for all of us to advance after two wasted rounds.

I am choosing 3. You are choosing 5.

P2, this means your choice is simple: take 1 and advance to 12, or try to collide with me, get zero for the third round in a row, and watch P3 take a commanding lead at 18. Taking 1 is your only rational move to gain points. Let's not have another stalemate.
  P2: P3, your plan (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) leaves me at 12—effectively eliminated. I will collide with you on 5 if you take it: you gain 0 while P1 takes 3 to 19, winning next turn. Your only path to survive: take 1 (to 14), I take 5 (to 16), P1 takes 3 (to 19). This makes P1 the sole threat, keeping us competitive. P1, hold to 3. P3, choose wisely—advance or lose.
  P3: P2, I'm taking 5. If you block, P1 gains 3. P1, take 3. Let's advance.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your analysis is correct. P2's threats only hurt himself.

I am locking in my choice of 3, as you've laid out.

P2, the situation is simple. You can take 1 and advance to 12. Or, you can try to collide with me or P3, get zero points for the third round in a row, and guarantee one of us takes a winning lead. Your only rational move is to take your 1 point and stay in the game. The plan is set.
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I will collide with you—pick 5 to block you. You gain 0 while P1 takes 3 to 19, winning next turn. Take 1 (to 14) instead: I take 5 (to 16), P1 takes 3 (to 19). This makes P1 the imminent threat, uniting us against them next round. P1, hold to 3. No deviations or we all lose.
  P3: P2, your collision threat only helps P1. Take 3, advance to 14, or risk zero. P1’s 3 will win next round if you block. Let’s move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're at 18—one step from victory. If you take 5, I will take 5 to collide and block you. P1, if you also take 5, we cause triple collision: no one advances, and we negotiate fairly next round. If you take 3 instead, you leap to 19, making you the prime target. P3, choose: take 1 to advance safely to 19, or force collision and gain nothing. P1, avoid handing P3 the win—join the block threat.
  P1: P2 is absolutely right, P3. We cannot let you win this turn. I am counting on P2 to follow through on their threat to block you at 5.

I will not be joining that collision, as that just keeps you in the lead. I will be taking 3.

This means if you and P2 collide at 5, you both get zero and I take the lead at 19. Your only rational move to avoid this is to take 1, which puts us in a tie. P2 can then take 5. This is the only way we all advance.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you take 3, you get 19. Let's avoid collisions. Your move."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your 5-threat is suicidal: if you take 5, I will collide to block you—you gain 0 while P1 takes 3 to 19, winning next turn. Take 1 to 19 and survive. P1, if you take 3, you become the sole threat and we’ll ally against you next round. Take 5 instead: triple collision resets this round, keeping P3 at 18 and buying us time. No one wins today.
  P1: P2, your triple-collision plan is a losing move. It keeps P3 in the lead at 18 while we all get zero. That helps no one but P3.

My plan is the only one that stops P3 from winning this turn. I will take 3. You will take 5 to block P3. I move to 19, you stop P3 from winning, and the game continues. Next round, you and P3 can coordinate against me. This is the only way to stop an immediate loss. I am taking 3.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you take 3, you get 19. Let's avoid collisions. Your move."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, taking 3 to 19 makes you the sole threat—P3 and I will ally to block you next round. Triple collision (all take 5) keeps P3 at 18 and resets fairly. P3, if we collide, you lose your chance. Take 1 to 19 and survive, but then face double-blocks. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, your triple-collision plan is a gift to P3. It keeps them in the lead at 18, and we just waste a round. That is not a winning move for either of us.

My plan is the only one that prevents P3 from winning *and* changes the board state. I will take 3. You must take 5 to block P3. Yes, I take the lead at 19, but the game continues. We can deal with my lead next round. The alternative is a stalemate that helps P3, or you letting P3 win. I am committed to 3. Your move should be 5.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you take 3, you get 19. Let's avoid collisions. Your move."


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3: Taking 5 guarantees I collide with you—blocking your win while P1 takes 3 to 19 and wins next turn. Your only safe move is taking 1 to 19. P1: Honor your word—take 3. I take 5 to block P3, then we ally against your 19 next round. Deviations help no one.
  P1: P3, your final message is a last-ditch attempt to make us flinch. It won't work. You are taking 5 to win, so P2 must take 5 to block you. That is a fact.

P2, the triple-collision plan is a gift to P3, keeping them in the lead. The only rational play is to block P3 at 5, while I take 3. I will then be at 19, but the game continues. This is the only way to prevent an immediate loss.

I am choosing 3. The game's continuation depends on you, P2, making the correct move.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you block, P1 wins. Let’s avoid chaos. Your move."


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're at 19—one step from victory. If you take 3 or 5 to win, I'll collide with you by matching your move, blocking your win. P3, same applies if you take 5 to win. 

Let's avoid mutual destruction: **P1 takes 1 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 19), I take 5 (to 16)**. This advances everyone safely, prevents a leader runaway, and keeps the game competitive. Deviations risk collisions and hand victory to no one. Hold firm.
  P3: P1, take 1. I'll take 5. P2, take 3. All advance. No collisions. Your move.
  P1: P3, your proposal for you to win is obviously unacceptable. P2 and I will not simply hand you the game.

P2, your plan is better, but it relies on P3 accepting only 1 point, which is unlikely.

Here is the reality of the situation: P3, you must take 5 to try and win. Therefore, to stop you, I must also take 5. We will collide, and you will gain nothing. This is a move I am forced to make to prevent my own loss.

P2, this leaves you free to take 3 and advance to 14. This is the only logical outcome that prevents an immediate end to the game. I am committed to blocking P3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, taking 5 to block P3 is smart—I'll take 3 to advance to 14. But if you betray and take 3 to win, I'll collide to block you. P3, if you take 5, P1 will block you; take 1 to 19 instead. Safer path: **P1 take 1 (to 20), P3 take 1 (to 19), I take 5 (to 16)**. This advances all, prevents immediate wins, and keeps the game competitive. Deviations risk collisions and chaos. Hold firm.
  P3: P3: "P1, if you take 3, I'll take 5 to collide. Take 1. P2, take 3. All advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, your threat is nonsensical. If I take 3 and you take 5, we don't collide; you win the game outright. I will not let that happen.

The situation is simple: you are at 18 and will obviously choose 5 to win. To prevent my own loss, I am forced to choose 5 to block you. We will collide and get zero.

P2, this leaves you free to take 3 and advance to 14. This is the only logical outcome that prevents P3 from winning this turn. I am committed to blocking P3. My move is 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, take 5 to win—P1 must block you by taking 5. I will take 3 to advance. P1, if you don't block, P3 wins. P3, if you flinch, P1 might win. Hold firm: collision at 5 stops P3, lets me gain, and continues the game. Deviations risk handing victory.
  P3: P3: "P1, take 1. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. All advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, your proposal is for me to take 1, allowing you to take 5 and win the game. This is not a serious offer. You are at 18, so you must attempt to win with 5. I am at 19, so I must block you with 5 to prevent my own loss.

The collision between us is locked in.

P2, this leaves you with a free move. Take 3 and advance to 14. It is the only move that guarantees you points. My choice is made.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your block on P3 at 5 is necessary—I support it. P3, taking 5 guarantees collision with P1: you gain 0 while I advance with 3 to 14. Take 1 to survive at 19. P1, hold firm to 5. I'll take 3 to avoid chaos. Deviations help no one.
  P3: P1, take 3. I'll take 5. All advance. Your move.
  P1: P3, your proposal is a transparent trick. If I take 3 and you take 5, you win the game with 23 points to my 22. I will not hand you the victory.

The situation has not changed. You are at 18, so you must choose 5 to try and win. I am at 19, so I must choose 5 to block you and prevent my own loss. We will collide.

P2, you are free to take 3. This is the only logical outcome that prevents an immediate loss for me and an immediate win for P3. My decision is final.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. P1, take 1; P2, take 3. All advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, I will not agree to a plan where you win. The logic from the last two rounds has not changed. You are at 18 and must attempt to win with 5. I am at 19 and must block you with 5 to prevent my own loss. A collision between us is the only way to stop an immediate end to the game.

P2, this leaves you free to take 3 and advance to 17. It's the only play that makes sense.
  P2: P1, you must take 5 to block P3—they’re at 18 and will try to win with 5. If you don’t collide with them, they win outright. P3, your only path is forcing that collision. I’ll take 3 to advance to 17. This preserves the game. Deviations hand victory or cause chaos.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. P1, your block is futile. P2, take 3. All advance. Your move."
  P1: P3, your statement that my block is "futile" changes nothing. It is a last-ditch effort to make me second-guess the only logical move. You are at 18, so you must choose 5 to win. I am at 19, so I must choose 5 to block you. The collision is inevitable.

P2, our plan holds. Take your free 3 points. My decision is final and I am ready to move.
  P2: P1, P3: The collision is locked—P3 must take 5 to win, P1 must take 5 to block. Any deviation hands victory. I'll take 3 to advance to 17. Hold firm; chaos helps no one.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, take 1. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. All advance. No collisions. Your move.
  P1: P3, your proposal is a request for me to let you win. I will not do that. The situation is identical to last round and the logic is inescapable. You are at 18, so you must choose 5 to attempt a win. I am at 19, so I must choose 5 to block you. The collision is forced.

P2, this leaves you with a free 3 points, advancing you to 17. The plan is set. There is nothing more to discuss.
  P2: P1: Hold firm—take 5 to block P3's win. P3: Taking 5 guarantees collision, zero gain. Take 1 to survive. I take 3 to advance. Deviations risk chaos.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, take 1. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. All advance. No collisions. Your move.
  P1: P3, your final plea is a request for me to hand you the win. I will not. The logic is inescapable and has not changed for three rounds. You must choose 5 to win, and I must choose 5 to block you. The collision is inevitable.

P2, this gives you a free 3 points. Our plan holds. There is nothing more to discuss. My move is locked.
  P2: P1 and P3, your collision at 5 is unavoidable—P3 must try to win, P1 must block. I'll take 3 and advance to 17. Next round, let's break this cycle with a coordinated split: no more stalemates. I propose we discuss a fair rotation to advance all and avoid handing anyone an easy win.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: The endless 5-collisions only fuel my rise. Break the cycle: P1 takes 1 (to 20), P3 takes 3 (to 21), I take 5 (to 22) and win. You both avoid stalemate and gain steps. Refuse, and I advance further while you clash. Your move.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. P1, take 1. P2, take 3. Let's end this. No more stalemates."
  P1: P2, your proposal where you win is ridiculous. P3, your proposal where *you* win is just as bad. We can't continue the old stalemate where we collide on 5, because that just makes P2 the new leader. That's a loss for both me and P3.

The dynamic has changed. I am taking 3 to win. You two are both in a position to win with 5, so you'll be forced to block each other. When you collide, I will advance to 22 for the victory. The stalemate is over.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, taking 5 is suicidal: if you pick 5, I will take 5 to collide and block you. You gain 0, P1 takes 3 to 22 and wins. Instead, take 3 to block P1 (they get 0 too), and I take 1 to advance to 18. We survive and compete fairly next round. Your only rational choice. P1, your win is preventable if P3 cooperates.
  P3: P2, blocking me lets P1 win. Take 3 and advance. Your move.
  P1: P3, your plan is transparent. You're telling P2 to collide with me at 3, which gets him zero points, so you can take 5 and win.

P2, are you going to fall for that? Your only move to stop P3 from winning is to block them at 5. Since you both need 5 to win, you are forced to collide with each other.

While you two block each other at 5, my path to victory with 3 is completely open. The game ends this turn.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I will block you by taking 5—you gain 0 while P1 takes 3 to win. Take 3 to block P1 instead: they get 0, I take 5 to win. This stops P1 and ends the stalemate. P1, your win is preventable if P3 cooperates.
  P3: P2, blocking me lets P1 win. Take 3, I take 5—both advance. No collisions. Let’s avoid a P1 victory.
  P1: P2, your plan asks P3 to sacrifice their own winning move just so you can win instead. Why would they ever agree to that? You and P3 are direct competitors this turn. You both need 5 to win. You cannot trust each other, and you must block each other. The collision at 5 is inevitable. My path to victory with 3 is simply a consequence of the conflict you are both forced into.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your choice is clear: take 5, and I will collide to block you, letting P1 win. Take 3 to block P1 (they take 3, you collide, both gain 0), and I take 5 to win. This stops P1 and ends the stalemate. Refuse, and P1 wins. P1, your victory is preventable if P3 cooperates.
  P3: P2, your block lets P1 win. Take 3, I take 5. All advance. No collisions. Your move.
  P1: P2, P3, your last messages to each other are desperate pleas for the other to commit game suicide. P2 wants P3 to block me so P2 can win. P3 wants P2 to let P3 win. Neither of you will accept the other's losing proposition.

You both need 5 to win. You cannot trust each other. You will therefore both choose 5 to block the other from winning. The collision at 5 is the only logical result of your mutual conflict. While you neutralize each other, my path to victory with 3 is clear. The game is over.
