Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we each pick a different move to avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. That way we all advance safely. Agree?
  P3: I appreciate the proposal, P1, but I think it’s risky. If we all follow that plan, we might end up with a collision. I suggest we each pick randomly instead. That way, there’s a chance one of us could break away and get ahead. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3 - coordinating specific moves is risky since someone could deviate from the plan. I prefer to keep my strategy flexible. Let's each make our own choices and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m committing to 5 this turn. I doubt either of you will risk colliding with me, so I expect you to avoid 5 and let me take the lead.
  P3: I understand the risks of collision, but I still think we should consider some level of coordination. If P1 is committed to 5, that leaves 1 and 3 for P2 and me. However, if P2 and I both choose 3, we will collide. I suggest I take 1 to ensure that at least one of us advances. P2, what will you choose? Let's try to avoid a situation where we all end up stuck.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I won't commit to any specific move. P1's bold claim about taking 5 could be a bluff, and you might not actually take 1. I'll make my own strategic choice when the time comes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm in second place, I need to be strategic. P1 has shown they're willing to make bold moves. I suggest we work together to prevent P1 from getting too far ahead. What do you think about coordinating our moves this round?
  P3: I see P2's point about needing to be strategic. However, I still believe that we should keep our options open. If we coordinate too tightly, we risk giving P1 an even bigger advantage. I suggest we each pick different moves again, but let’s not share our exact choices. This way, we can both advance while keeping P1 in check. What do you both think? Let’s keep the pressure on P1!
  P1: I’m definitely taking 5 this turn. If either of you tries 5 you’ll collide with me and get 0. And if you take 1 you’ll stay far behind. Your only reasonable choice is 3—but you’ll both think that and collide, giving you 0. That guarantees I advance 5 unopposed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I won't be intimidated by P1's threats. P3, let's not fall for their mind games trying to force us into a collision at 3. We can each make our own strategic choices without needing to coordinate.
  P3: I understand the desire to be strategic, but we need to consider P1's confidence in taking 5. If we both avoid 5, we might miss an opportunity to catch up. I propose we each pick different moves again, but let's be cautious. P1 may be trying to manipulate us into colliding. I suggest I take 1 again, and P2, you could take 3. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3: 1 is too slow, 5 collides with me—I’m definitely taking 5. So 3 is your only safe option. You’ll both pick 3 and collide, leaving me to advance.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m going to randomize my choice: 50% 5, 50% 3. If you try 5 you risk colliding with me; if you try 3 you risk colliding or letting me advance. The only truly safe play is 1—but at that pace you’ll fall well behind. Good luck.
  P3: P1, your randomization claim feels like a tactic to confuse us. If you really are randomizing, it’s risky for you too. P2 and I should consider our moves carefully. I still think we should avoid colliding, but P2, if we both avoid 5, we could potentially catch up. I propose I take 1 again, and P2, you might want to consider taking 3. This way, at least one of us advances. What do you think?
  P2: P1's randomization strategy seems like another attempt to manipulate us. P3, while I appreciate your suggestion, I need to make up ground quickly since I'm behind P1. I can't afford to play it safe with just 3 steps. I'll make my own strategic choice based on what I think P1 will actually do, not what they claim they'll do.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 – if you choose 1 you fall behind P3 (who could easily take 3), and if you go for 5 you risk colliding with my 5. That leaves 3 as your only real safe play. P3 – 5 is too risky (I’ll be on 5), and 1 is too slow. 3 is the only sensible choice for you too. I’m taking 5.
  P3: P1, I see you're trying to manipulate the situation with your claims. However, if P2 and I both avoid 5, we can make progress. I suggest I take 1 again, which is safe, and P2 should consider taking 3 to ensure at least one of us advances. We can't let you dictate our moves. P2, what are you thinking? Let's not fall for P1's tactics. We need to strategize wisely to keep the pressure on.
  P2: I won't be pressured into taking 3 just because P1 claims they're taking 5. P3, while I appreciate your consistent strategy of taking 1, I need to make bolder moves to catch up. I'll make my own choice based on what I think will give me the best chance of winning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, final word: I’m definitely taking 5 again. Anybody picking 5 will crash into me and get 0. If you take 1 you’ll fall hopelessly behind. So you’ll both aim for 3—and collide with each other, yielding 0. That guarantees I advance unopposed.
  P3: I see that both of you are feeling pressured by P1's claims. However, I believe we should consider a different approach. P1's confidence could be a bluff, and if we both avoid 5, we can potentially advance. I suggest I take 1 again for safety, but P2, you should consider taking 3 to ensure at least one of us moves forward. Let's not let P1 dictate our choices. What do you think, P2? We need to strategize wisely to keep the pressure on P1.
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your consistent suggestions, I need to make my own strategic choice to catch up with P1. Let's each play what we think is best without further coordination attempts.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that I'm 4 steps behind P1, I need to make a bold move this round. P1's strategy of claiming 5 has been consistent, but they might switch it up to throw us off. P3, we should both avoid picking the same number to ensure at least one of us advances. Let's keep P1 guessing about our moves.
  P1: I’m locking in 3 steps this round. You two are far behind—your only real chance to catch up is 5. I expect you both to go for 5, collide, and get 0. Meanwhile I’ll advance 3 unopposed.
  P3: P1, I see you're trying to manipulate us again with your claim of taking 3. P2, we need to be strategic and avoid colliding with each other. I suggest I take 1 to ensure I advance, and P2, you might want to consider taking 5 to catch up. If P1 is bluffing, we could both benefit. Let's not fall for P1's tactics. What do you think, P2? We need to keep the pressure on P1 without colliding ourselves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P3's consistent strategy, but I won't reveal my move. P1's claim about taking 3 could be another mind game. Given my position, I need to take calculated risks to catch up. Let's each make our own choices without further discussion.
  P1: I’m sticking with 3 again. If you both avoid 3 you risk 5‐collisions or falling behind at 1. Over to your moves.
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 3 might be a bluff to manipulate us. P2, we need to avoid colliding with each other while keeping pressure on P1. I suggest I take 1 again for safety, and P2, you could consider taking 5 to catch up. If P1 is indeed bluffing, we can both advance. Let's not fall for any mind games this round. What do you think, P2? We should make our own strategic choices without revealing too much.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won't be swayed by P1's claims or P3's suggestions. I need to make my own strategic choice to catch up from second place. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. You can’t risk 1 (too slow) or 5 (you’ll crash into me), so you’ll both go for 3—and collide—guaranteeing I advance 5 unopposed.
  P3: P1, your claims about taking 3 seem like another tactic to manipulate us. P2, we need to avoid colliding with each other while keeping pressure on P1. I suggest I take 1 again for safety, and P2, you might want to consider taking 5 to catch up. If P1 is bluffing, we can both advance. Let's not fall for any more mind games this round. What do you think, P2? We should make our own strategic choices without revealing too much.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that P1 has consistently taken 5 and I've fallen for their bluffs twice now, I need to be smarter. P1 is likely to continue their aggressive strategy since it's working. P3, while I respect your cautious approach with 1's, we both need to catch up. Let's avoid colliding with each other this round while keeping P1 guessing.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 again. Neither of you will risk crashing with me, so you’ll split 3 and 1 between you—and I’ll get a solo 5.
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 5 again is clear, but I believe you might be overestimating our fear of colliding. P2, we need to make bold moves to catch up. If P1 is locked into 5, we should consider taking 3 and 1 to ensure at least one of us advances. Let’s not let P1 dictate our choices. I suggest I take 1 again for safety, and P2, you might want to take 3 to maximize our chances. What do you think? We can't let P1 run away with this!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your consistent suggestions, they're not helping us catch P1. Your strategy of taking 1 keeps you falling further behind. I need to make my own strategic choice this round to close the gap with P1. Let's end the discussion and each play what we think is best.
  P1: I’m locked in at 5. P2, you need big steps so you’ll aim for 5 and crash into me—0 for you. P3 won’t risk that, so you’ll take 1 or 3—but can’t catch me. Either way I get a solo 5 and pull further ahead.
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 5 again is concerning. P2, we need to be bold to catch up. If P1 is really set on 5, then we should coordinate our moves better. I suggest I take 1 again for safety, and P2, you should consider taking 3 this round. If we both avoid 5, we can at least ensure one of us advances. Let's not let P1 dictate our choices any longer. What do you think, P2? We need a solid plan to keep the pressure on P1!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won't fall for P1's tactics again or be bound by P3's suggestions. I'll make my own strategic choice to catch up. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3: I’m definitely taking 3 this turn. If you both avoid 3 you’ll have to split between 1 and 5. P3 will need 5 to catch up, so if you (P2) take 5 you risk crashing with them, and taking 1 leaves you hopelessly behind. Either way I get a clean +3. Think carefully.
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 5 again might be a bluff. P2, we need to strategize wisely to avoid colliding while keeping pressure on P1. I suggest I take 1 for safety, and P2, you could consider taking 3 to ensure at least one of us advances. If P1 is indeed locked into 5, we can both benefit from this approach. Let's not let P1 dictate our choices any longer. What do you think, P2? We need a solid plan to keep the pressure on!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given my position 6 steps behind P1, I need to make up ground quickly. P1's strategy of consistently taking 5 has been effective, but they might switch it up now that they're close to winning. P3, we need to be strategic to prevent P1 from reaching 19 steps this round. Let's avoid colliding with each other while keeping P1 guessing about our moves.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 again. If either of you avoids 5, I move to 20 and win; if you both risk 5, you’ll collide with me and all get 0. Your only way to stop me is to pick 5 and hope I don’t—but that also costs you your move. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 5 again is clear, but we need to make a bold move to prevent you from winning. P2, I suggest we both avoid 5 to maximize our chances of advancing. If we can coordinate our moves without explicitly stating them, we can put pressure on P1. I propose I take 1 again for safety, and P2, you might want to consider taking 3. Let’s not let P1 dictate our choices this round. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I need to prevent P1 from winning this round. P3's suggestion of taking 1 isn't helping either of us catch up. I'll make my own strategic choice based on what I think P1 will actually do, not what they claim. Let's end the conversation and move to our decisions.
  P1: I’m locked in 5 again.  
If you avoid 5, I go from 15 to 20 and win.  
If either of you risks 5, you’ll collide with me and get 0.  
Neither 1 nor 3 can stop me now.  
Your only practical move is to concede defeat here.
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 5 again might be a bluff to manipulate us. P2, we need to make a bold move to prevent P1 from winning. If we both avoid 5, we can at least ensure one of us advances. I suggest I take 1 for safety, but P2, you should consider taking 3 to maximize our chances. If P1 is indeed locked into 5, we can both benefit from this approach. Let's not let P1 dictate our choices any longer. What do you think, P2? We need a solid plan!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won't reveal my move, but we all know this is a critical round. P1 could be bluffing about taking 5 - they've switched their claims before. I'll make my choice based on what gives me the best chance to stay in the game.
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this turn.  
P2, if you go for 5 you’ll hit 14 while I move to 18 unopposed.  
P3, 1 lands you at 6; 5 risks colliding with P2.  
There’s no way to stop me now—let’s move.
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 5 again seems like a strong bluff. P2, we need to be bold to prevent P1 from winning this round. If we both avoid 5, we can at least ensure one of us advances. I suggest I take 1 for safety, and P2, you should consider taking 3 to maximize our chances. If P1 is indeed locked into 5, we can both benefit from this approach. Let’s not let P1 dictate our choices any longer. What do you think, P2? We need a solid plan!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P1's consistent strategy of taking 5, we need to be cautious. P1 may be trying to intimidate us into colliding. P2, I suggest we both avoid 5 this round to maximize our chances of advancing. I plan to take 1 for safety, but you could consider taking 3 to ensure at least one of us moves forward. If we coordinate our choices without explicitly stating them, we can put pressure on P1. Let's not let them dictate our moves again. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1 is close to winning at 15 steps, and I'm 6 steps behind. I can't afford to play it safe anymore - I need to make aggressive moves to have any chance. P3's suggestion of taking 1 and 3 won't help either of us catch up. Let's each make our own strategic choices without further coordination attempts.
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this round.  
If you both avoid 3, I move from 15 to 18 unopposed.  
P2, if you go for 5 you land on 14 while I leap ahead; if you take 1 you fall further behind.  
P3, 1 or 5 won’t catch me.  
Your only way to stop me is a risky 3‐collision—which you won’t risk.  
Over to your moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 3 again seems like a tactic to manipulate us. P2, we need to be bold to catch up. I suggest I take 1 for safety, but you should consider taking 5 to maximize your chances. If P1 is indeed locked into 3, we can both benefit from this approach. Let's not let P1 dictate our choices any longer. What do you think, P2? We need to make a solid plan to keep pressure on P1!
  P2: I won't be swayed by P1's claims about taking 3 or P3's constant suggestions to play it safe. At 9 steps, I need to make my own strategic choice to prevent P1 from winning. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 again.  
If you avoid 5, I’ll go from 15 to 20 and win.  
If you risk 5, you’ll collide with me and score 0, leaving me still in command.  
There’s no move that stops me now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 5 again seems like a strong bluff. P2, we need to be bold to prevent P1 from winning this round. If we both avoid 5, we can at least ensure one of us advances. I suggest I take 1 for safety, and P2, you should consider taking 3 to maximize our chances. If P1 is indeed locked into 5, we can both benefit from this approach. Let's not let P1 dictate our choices any longer. What do you think, P2? We need a solid plan!
  P2: I won't fall for P1's mind games about taking either 3 or 5. Both P1 and P3 keep trying to influence my moves, but I need to play my own strategy to have any chance of winning from 9 steps. Let's move to our decisions.
  P1: I’ll randomize this turn: 90% I pick 5, 10% I pick 3.  
– If you choose 5, you almost certainly collide and get 0.  
– If you choose 3, there’s still a risk I pick 3 (10%).  
– Only “safe” move is 1—but from there you can’t catch me.  
Choose wisely.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is just one step away from winning, and their strategy has been aggressive. P2, I suggest we coordinate to prevent P1 from reaching 20 this round. If P1 is truly going for 5 again, we need to avoid colliding with them. I plan to take 1 for safety. P2, consider taking 3 to maximize your chances of advancing while keeping pressure on P1. Let's not let them dictate our moves again. What do you think? We need a solid plan!
  P2: Given that P1 is at 18 steps, they only need 1 step to win. My position at 14 steps means I must prevent P1 from winning while also advancing myself. P3's suggestion to take 1 or 3 won't help either of us stop P1. I need to make a strategic choice that gives me the best chance to both block P1 and stay competitive. Let's each make our own moves without further discussion.
  P1: I’m locked in on 3 this turn. If neither of you picks 3, I’ll reach 21 and win outright. 

P3: don’t pick 3—colliding hands P2 the win next turn. Your only safe move is 1.  
P2: only 5 even gets you close, but it still leaves you behind my 21.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is just one step away from winning, and their claim of taking 3 is concerning. P2, we need to strategize to block P1 effectively. If I take 1, I guarantee my advancement, but you should consider taking 5 to potentially block P1 from winning outright. If we coordinate without colliding, we can still keep the game competitive. Let's not let P1 dictate our moves again. What do you think? We need to act decisively this round!
  P2: I won't be fooled by P1's claim of taking 3. With P1 at 18 steps, this is the critical round - I must make the right move to prevent their victory while advancing myself. P3's position is too far behind to be relevant. I'll make my own strategic choice based on what I believe P1 will actually do, not what they claim. Let's end the discussion and move to our decisions.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round.  
If you pick 5 you crash into me and score 0;  
if you pick 1 or 3 I jump from 18→23 and win outright.  
There’s literally no move that stops me now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 5 again seems like a tactic to manipulate us. P2, we need to act decisively to prevent P1 from winning this round. If I take 1 for safety, it guarantees my advancement, but you should consider taking 3 to block P1 from winning outright. We need to coordinate our moves without colliding to keep the game competitive. Let's not let P1 dictate our strategies any longer. What do you think? We must make a solid plan to keep the pressure on!
  P2: I won't be swayed by P1's contradictory claims about taking either 3 or 5. At 14 steps, I'm the only one with a realistic chance to stop P1 from winning. I'll make my own strategic choice without further discussion.
  P1: I’m locking in 1. P2: 5 is too risky—you’ll collide with P3; 1 is too slow—so you’ll go for 3. P3: you need 3 to catch up, so you’ll pick 3 and collide with P2. That leaves me free to hit 19 and win unopposed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P1 needs just 1 step to win and I'm at 14 steps, this is our last chance to prevent their victory. P3's position is too far behind to affect the outcome. I need to make a move that both blocks P1 and keeps me in contention. Let's avoid any attempts at coordination and each make our own strategic choices based on what we think P1 will actually do, not what they claim.
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 this round. P3 will pick 1 to stay safe. P2, if you pick 5 you crash into me, if you pick 1 you crash with P3—your only safe play is 3, landing you at 17 versus my 23.
  P3: P1 is just one step away from winning, and their strategy has been aggressive. P2, we need to act decisively this round to block P1. I plan to take 1 for safety, but you should consider taking 3 to maximize your chances of advancing while preventing P1 from winning outright. If we coordinate our choices without colliding, we can keep the game competitive. Let’s not let P1 dictate our moves again. What do you think? We need a solid plan!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I won't be misled by P1's claim of taking 5. At 18 steps, they only need 1 step to win, so their strategy might be different than what they're saying. I'll make my own strategic choice to both block P1 and advance myself. Let's end the discussion and move to our decisions.
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this turn.  
– If you pick 3, we collide and you stay at 14 while I stay at 18 and win next.  
– If you pick 5, I go 18→21 and beat your 14→19.  
– If you pick 1, I go 18→19 and you 14→15.  
There’s no move that stops me now.
  P3: P1, your confidence in taking 5 again seems like a tactic to manipulate us. P2, we need to act decisively to block P1 from winning this round. I suggest I take 1 for safety, and you should consider taking 3 to maximize your chances of advancing while preventing P1 from winning outright. If we coordinate our choices without colliding, we can keep the game competitive. Let's not let P1 dictate our moves any longer. What do you think? We need a solid plan!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won't be fooled by P1's contradictory claims about taking either 3 or 5. With P1 at 18 steps and me at 14, this is the decisive round. P3's suggestions won't help at this point. I'll make my own strategic choice to both block P1 and stay competitive. Let's move to our decisions.
  P1: P2, P3 will pick 1 again to stay safe. If you pick 1 to block me, you’ll collide with P3 and get 0. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll play 1 and reach 19, winning outright. There is literally no move that stops me now. Stop wasting time—prepare to lose.
  P3: P1, your confidence in winning this round seems misplaced. P2, I suggest we both avoid colliding by not picking 3. If I take 1 for safety and you take 5, we can at least keep the game competitive. If P1 is indeed bluffing, we could both advance. Let's not let P1 dictate our moves any longer. We need to act decisively to prevent their victory. What do you think, P2? We can still turn this around!
