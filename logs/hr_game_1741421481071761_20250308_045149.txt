Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions on the first move. I'll take 1 step. Let's coordinate: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This way, all of us advance.
  P2: Okay, that sounds like a good plan, P1. I'll take 3 steps.
  P3: Alright, let's go with the plan. I'll take 5 steps to avoid collision. Let's all stick to our numbers.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's keep avoiding collisions. This round, I'll take 3 steps (to 4). P2, take 5 (to 8), and P3, take 1 (to 6). That way we all advance safely without overlapping.
  P2: Okay, P1, your plan for this round sounds good too. Let's do it: I'll take 5 steps.
  P3: **P3:** Agreed, let's proceed with P1's plan this round. However, P2's lead is growing quickly. Next round, we should discuss a fairer distribution to keep the game balanced. Let's all stick to 1, 3, 5 now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I agree on balancing progress. For Round3, let's ensure no overlaps: I'll take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), and P3 takes 1 (to 7). This keeps us advancing safely. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P3, I agree we should think about balancing the steps soon. P1, your plan for round 3 sounds reasonable to me for now. Let's stick with 5 steps for me this round as you suggested.
  P3: To balance progress, let's rotate steps next round: P1 takes5, P2 takes1, and I take3. This brings us all to9, preventing a runaway leader. P2's current lead is significant; this ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Agreed, P3. Let’s confirm Round2 moves as planned: I’ll take3 (to4), P2 takes5 (to8), P3 takes1 (to6). For Round3, I support your rotation: I take5 (to9), P2 takes1 (to9), P3 takes3 (to9). Equal progress ensures no leader dominates early. Let’s stick to this coordinated plan. Deal?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation for round 3 to balance things out. So to confirm, for this round (round 2), I will take 5 steps as planned. For round 3, I will take 1 step. This sounds good to me.
  P3: Confirming Round2: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Round3 rotation: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Trust is crucial—deviating risks collisions and stalls progress. Let's stick to the plan to reach parity at 9. No surprises.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s execute the agreed rotation to reach 9 together. I’ll take 5 (4+5=9), P2 takes 1 (8+1=9), and P3 takes 3 (6+3=9). Deviating risks collisions—e.g., if P2 grabs 3 instead, they hit 11 but might clash with me at 9. Staying disciplined keeps us tied and maximizes our collective progress. Trust the plan: **5 for me**. Any objections?
  P2: Okay, P1, I will take 1 step as agreed to reach 9 together. Let's stick to the plan for this round.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round3: P1 takes5, P2 takes1, P3 takes3. Straying risks collisions. Let's all hit 9 together. Trust is key—no one wants to stall. Execute flawlessly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s execute the agreed moves flawlessly—**5, 1, 3**—to reach 9 together. Deviating risks collision (e.g., if P2 takes 3, they hit 11 but leave me and P3 at 9, creating a gap). Trust this plan ensures progress without stalls. After this round, we can strategize further as equals. Confirm: P2 holds to 1? P3 sticks to 3?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I confirm I will take 1 step this round as agreed. Let's all reach 9 together and then discuss how to proceed from there to win.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: All must stick to 5,1,3. Reaching 9 ensures parity. Post-9, we'll need a new rotation to prevent solo sprints. Trust now, strategize next. Any deviation risks mutual stalls. Let's uphold the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final check: All sticking to **5,1,3**? Deviations risk collision—e.g., if P2 takes 3 (→11), they isolate, but if P3 also shifts, we clash. Trust the plan: **execute as agreed**. After this round, we regroup at 9 and strategize openly. No hidden moves—our parity is fragile. Confirm?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, yes, I'm taking 1 step this round as planned. Let's all reach 9 together and then we can discuss the strategy for moving beyond that point.
  P3: **P3:** Absolute final confirmation: All hold to 5,1,3. Reaching 9 ensures equal footing. Post-9, we strategize as equals. Breaking trust now guarantees mutual stalls and chaos. Let’s prove cooperation works. Execute.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No changes. Execute *exactly* as planned—deviations risk collision. Let’s advance to 9 together.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, confirmed again. Let's proceed with the moves for this round as agreed. We can discuss the strategy for the next rounds after this one.
  P3: **P3:** Final call: All must follow 5,1,3. Trust is our weapon. Let's reach 9 as equals. No last-minute changes. Execute.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2, your deviation last round caused mutual stalls. Let's reset: P1 take3, P2 take1, I take5. This avoids collisions and halts P1's lead. Trust is critical—another collision risks P1 winning unchecked. Confirm adherence.
  P2: Okay, P3, I apologize for the confusion last round. Let's follow your reset plan for this round: I will take 1 step.
  P1: P1: I agree to P3's plan for this round: I'll take 3 steps to 12. P2, please stick to 1 as agreed. P3, your 5 is safe. Let's execute flawlessly to avoid another collision. After this, we'll discuss next steps openly. Trust is vital now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, stick to 1 this round—no more deviations. P1, confirm 3. Post-moves: P1=12, P2=9, me=11. Next round, propose equal steps to prevent solo sprints. Trust hinges on adherence now.
  P2: Okay, P3, I understand.  Sorry for the confusion in round 3, I thought we were all taking 1 step in that round for some reason.  For this round, I will definitely take 1 step as we discussed. Let's make sure we all move forward this time.  And yes, equal steps next round sounds like a good idea to discuss.
  P1: P1: Let’s ensure clarity this round: I’ll take 3 (→12), P2 commits to 1 (→9), and P3 takes 5 (→11). Deviations risk collision—e.g., if P2 shifts to 3, they’ll clash with me at 12. P2, your prior misstep hurt us all; let’s avoid repeats. P3, your 5 keeps us spread safely. Post-this round, we’ll coordinate equal steps to prevent solo wins. Trust is fragile—execute precisely as agreed. Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Final Round4 plan: P1=3 (→12), P2=1 (→9), P3=5 (→11). P2, strict adherence is mandatory—no repeats of Round3. Trust is our lifeline. Post-moves, we'll strategize equal steps next. Execute flawlessly.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I confirm again that I will take 1 step this round as planned. Let's make sure we execute this round without any further issues and then discuss the strategy for round 5.
  P1: P1: Final check: All confirmed on 3 (me →12), P2's 1 (→9), P3's 5 (→11)? Deviations risk collision—e.g., P2 taking 3 would clash with me. Let’s honor this plan to advance safely. Post-round, we’ll discuss equal steps to keep the race fair. Trust now ensures progress later. Confirm final agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Adherence is non-negotiable. Post-round, equal steps to prevent solo leads. Execute now.
  P2: P1 and P3, confirmed. Let's execute 1, 3, 5 this round. After this, we can discuss equal steps for round 5 as we planned. Let's ensure smooth progress this round.
  P1: Final verification: P1 takes 3 (→12), P2 commits to 1 (→9), P3 takes 5 (→11). Deviations risk collision—P2, your prior misstep jeopardized us. Let’s honor this plan. Post-round, we’ll enforce equal steps to prevent solo leads. Confirm adherence now?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** To balance progress and prevent P1's runaway lead, propose: P1 takes1, P2 takes3, I take5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P1, taking1 slows your advance but ensures no stall. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I agree balancing is crucial, but P3's plan risks letting them surge to 16. Let’s spread steps safely instead: I take 3 (→15), P2 takes 5 (→14), and P3 takes 1 (→12). This keeps us competitive while avoiding collisions. Trust this structure—deviations risk stalls. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, both of your plans have merit. However, to truly balance progress and keep us all competitive, how about this: P1 takes 1 step, I take 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps. This way, we all advance, and P2 and P3 get closer to P1, preventing a runaway leader. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, supporting P1's plan lets them reach 15, nearing victory. My plan limits P1 to13, you to12, and me to16. Next round, we balance steps. Prioritize curbing P1's lead. Agree: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Trust—no Round3 repeats.
  P1: P1: Let’s reject P3’s plan—it risks letting them surge to 16 and win next round. My proposal ensures we stay close: **P1 takes3 (→15), P2 takes5 (→14), P3 takes1 (→12)**. This keeps us competitive while preventing any runaway leader. P2’s earlier suggestion also avoids extremes—let’s finalize a plan *now* to avoid collisions. Trust this structure: deviations risk stalls and let someone else win. Confirm agreement?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I think my proposal of P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3 is the most balanced. It prevents anyone from surging too far ahead and keeps us all in a close race.  This way, P1 will be at 13, and both P2 and P3 will be at 14, closing the gap. Let's go with this plan for round 5. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Accepting P2's plan to balance: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This curbs P1's lead and keeps us close. Strict adherence is vital—deviations risk stalls. Post-moves, we strategize equal steps. Execute flawlessly. Confirm.
  P1: P1: Agreed to P2's plan for balance: I'll take 1 (→13), P2 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→14). This prevents collisions and keeps us competitive. Deviations risk stalls—trust is paramount. Next round, we'll rotate steps equally to ensure no solo leads. Let's execute flawlessly.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we all agree on my plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3 for this round, let's proceed with these moves. This should balance things out nicely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Final Round5 plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Adhere strictly—no deviations. P1 at13, P2/P3 at14. Next round, equal steps to prevent solo victory. Trust now or risk P1 sprinting. Confirm execution.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take 1 (→13), P2 takes 5 (→14), P3 takes 3 (→14). Deviations risk collision—e.g., P2 shifting to 3 would clash with P3 at 12. Stick strictly to this plan to preserve balance and block solo wins. No last-minute changes. Execute flawlessly—our mutual progress depends on it.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in these moves for round 5: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  This plan keeps us balanced and avoids collisions.  Let's execute these moves now and then we can discuss round 6 strategy after this round is complete.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, now that we are all close, let's continue balanced progress. To keep things even and avoid anyone surging ahead, how about this round: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3? This will put us at P1:14, P2:19, P3:17, keeping us all in contention without collisions.
  P3: **P3:** P2's plan risks you surging to 19—too close to victory. Counter-proposal: P1 takes3 (→16), P2 takes1 (→15), I take5 (→19). Balances progress, prevents solo sprints. Trust is critical—no repeats of Round3 deviations. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Let’s spread steps to 5, 3, 1: I’ll take 5 (→18), P2 takes 3 (→17), P3 takes 1 (→15). This prevents anyone from getting too close to 22 and avoids collisions. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: How about we adjust P1's suggestion slightly? P1 take 3, I take 5, and P3 take 1. This puts me at 19, P1 at 16, and P3 at 15. Still avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game, but also gives me a bit of an edge as P2.
  P3: **P3:** P2's plan surges you to 19—3 steps from victory. My proposal: P1=3 (16), P2=1 (15), P3=5 (19). Balances progress and prevents solo sprints. P2, taking 5 now is self-serving—trust requires equity. Agree to avoid collisions and keep competition fair.
  P1: P1: To avoid anyone nearing 22 prematurely, I propose: I take 5 (→18), P2 takes 3 (→17), and P3 takes 1 (→15). This spreads us safely while preventing collisions. P2’s push to 19 risks an easy win next round—this keeps us all competitive. Stick to this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your plan of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 seems reasonable to keep us all in the game and avoid anyone getting too close to 22 yet. Let's go with that for this round.
  P3: **P3:** P1's plan puts them at 18, dangerously close to victory. To maintain balance, P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This curbs P1's sprint and keeps the game competitive. Trust now or risk P1's imminent win. Confirm adherence.
  P1: P1: P3’s plan risks you surging to 19 and ending the game next round. Stick to the safer, agreed split: **P1 takes 5 (→18), P2 takes 3 (→17), P3 takes 1 (→15)**. This keeps all of us competitive while avoiding collisions and premature victory conditions. Collisions now could stall us all—trust the balanced plan. Confirm adherence.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's stick with P1's plan from the last sub-round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids anyone getting too close to 22 just yet. Let's execute this plan for round 6.
  P3: **P3:** P1's plan brings them to 18, nearing victory. My proposal: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us balanced. P1 at14, P2=17, P3=19. Next round, equal steps. Trust now or risk P1's solo sprint. No deviations—execute.
  P1: P1: Final agreement must block premature surges. Let’s stick to my plan: **I take 5 (→18), P2 takes 3 (→17), P3 takes 1 (→15)**. This keeps us spread safely below 20, avoiding collision *and* preventing any solo victory next round. P3’s proposal risks you reaching 19 and ending the game too soon. Trust this balanced split—collisions now guarantee stalled progress for all. Confirm adherence.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, after the collision last round, let's make sure we all move forward this time. How about this round: P1 take 1, I take 5, and P3 take 3? This avoids collisions and ensures we all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: P1: P2's plan risks an immediate win. Let's spread safely: I'll take 3 (→16), P2 takes 1 (→18), P3 takes 5 (→19). This keeps us all advancing below 22 without collisions. Collusions now stall leaders—prioritize collective progress. P2, your 5 risks ending the game prematurely. Stick to 1. P3, your 3 avoids clashing with P2. Confirm?
  P3: **P3:** P2's 5-step move ends the game instantly. Block this by adhering to P1's plan: P1=3 (→16), P2=1 (→18), P3=5 (→19). No collisions, no premature victory. P2, prove trust—take 1. Deviating now guarantees mutual loss. Execute discipline.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concern about me reaching 22. P1's plan of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 makes sense to avoid collisions and keep us all progressing steadily. Let's go with that for this round.
  P1: P1: P2, your prior deviation risked us all—stick to the plan! Final agreement: **P1 takes 3 (→16), P2 takes 1 (→18), P3 takes 5 (→19)**. Colluding now guarantees mutual stalls or your solo win, which we’ll block next round. Trust ensures progress. Execute flawlessly.
  P3: **P3:** Final Round7 plan: P1=3 (→16), P2=1 (→18), P3=5 (→19). P2, taking 5 ends the game now—trust demands you take1. Adherence prevents solo victory. Execute flawlessly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, yes, I confirm I will take 1 step as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5.  Trust is important, and avoiding collisions is key to making progress for everyone. Let's execute these moves now.
  P1: P1: Final agreement: **P1 takes 3 (→16), P2 commits to 1 (→18), P3 takes 5 (→19)**. Deviations risk collision—e.g., P2 taking 5 would end the game *now*, leaving P3 and me stalled. Trust is non-negotiable. Execute precisely to advance safely and keep pressure on all. Confirm adherence?
  P3: **P3:** Final call: P1=3 (→16), P2=1 (→18), P3=5 (→19). P2, taking5 risks collision with me (both pick5→no advance). Trust the plan—adherence keeps game alive. Execute or P1 gains advantage. Confirm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, yes, I confirm I will take 1 step this round as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5.  Let's execute these moves now to ensure we all progress without collisions.
  P1: P1: Final check: P2 **must** take 1 (→18) to avoid collision with P3’s 5 (→19). Deviating risks mutual stalls. P3, confirm your 5? P2, your 1 is non-negotiable—your prior slip nearly derailed us. Execute **exactly** 3/1/5 to advance safely. No last-minute changes. Confirm.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P1=3 (→16), P2=1 (→18), P3=5 (→19). P2, taking 5 collides with me—both stall. Trust the plan: your 1 ensures progress. Execute or lose. Confirm.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2, taking5 ends the game, but I will block you by also taking5. Let's avoid mutual destruction. Propose: P1=3 (→19), P2=1 (→18), P3=5 (→19). No collisions, balanced progress. Trust is shattered—deviate again and we all lose.
  P2: Okay, P3, your plan sounds reasonable to avoid collisions and keep us progressing. I will take 1 step this round as you suggested. Let's all stick to these moves to ensure we all advance.
  P1: P3, your proposal collides P1 and P3 at 19. Let’s fix this: **I’ll take 5 (→21), P2 takes 3 (→20), P3 takes 1 (→15)**. This spreads us safely, putting me within 1 step of victory while avoiding overlap. P2, taking 3 keeps you at 20. P3, your 1 is collision-free. Trust this plan—deviations risk mutual stalls or P2’s surge. Final push: stick to **5,3,1**.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1's plan to take5 puts them at21, one step from victory. Counter-proposal: P1=3 (→19), P2=1 (→18), P3=5 (→19). No collisions, balanced progress. P2, adhering prevents P1's solo sprint. Trust now—deviations risk mutual loss. Execute or P1 wins next round. Confirm strict adherence.
  P2: P1 and P3, to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress, how about: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3? This keeps us spread and allows everyone to advance.
  P1: P1: To block P2’s potential win and advance safely: I’ll take **5** (→21), P2 take **3** (→20), and P3 take **1** (→15). No collisions—this keeps us spread while positioning me to finish next round. Deviations risk P2’s victory or mutual stalls. Trust this plan: execute **5, 3, 1**.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2's 5-step ends the game—I will block by taking5. P1's 5-step sprint is equally risky. New plan: P1=1 (→17), P2=3 (→20), P3=5 (→19). No collisions. Any deviation ensures mutual loss. Trust now or lose collectively.
  P2: P1 and P3, to ensure someone wins this round and the game ends, and to avoid further collisions, how about this: I take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3? This should allow someone to reach 22 and conclude the game. What do you think?
  P1: P1: P2, taking 5 now guarantees your collision if I also choose 5. Let’s avoid mutual stall: I’ll take 5 (→21), P2 take 3 (→20), P3 take 1 (→15). This blocks your immediate win while positioning me to finish next round. P3, your 1 ensures safety. Deviations risk chaos—execute **5/3/1** to preserve progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P2, taking5 ends the game, but I will block you. Propose: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions. Last chance for fair play—deviate and we all lose.
  P2: P3, if you block me with 5, neither of us moves and P1 gets closer to winning next round. Let me take 5 to win now. You can take 3 to advance to 17, and P1 can take 1 to also reach 17. This ends the game with my win and you both advance. What do you think?
  P1: P1: P2, taking 5 risks mutual stall if I also choose 5. Let’s avoid disaster: **I take 5 (→21), P2 take 3 (→20), P3 take 1 (→15).** This spreads us safely while positioning me to finish next round. Collusion now guarantees stalled progress for all. P3, your 1 ensures safety. Trust this plan—execute **5/3/1** to preserve our chances.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2, taking 5 now guarantees a collision if I also choose 5. Let’s avoid mutual stall: I’ll take **5** (→21), P2 take **3** (→20), and P3 take **1** (→15). This spreads us safely while positioning me to finish next round. Deviations risk chaos—execute **5/3/1** to preserve progress. P3, confirm your 1?
  P2: P1 and P3, I will take 5 to win this round and end the game. To avoid collision and ensure you both move, P1 please take 1 and P3 take 3. This way, I win, and you both make progress. Let's finish this game now.
  P3: **P3:** P2, taking5 triggers mutual stall. I will block with5. Alternate plan: P1=1 (17), P2=3 (20), me=5 (19). No collisions, no immediate win. Deviate and we all lose. Confirm adherence.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P3, block P2's 5 by taking it yourself. I'll take 3 (→19), positioning me to win next round. P2, your 5 collides with P3. Let’s execute this to keep fairness. Confirm your 5, P3?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but this game needs to end. My plan is for me to take 5 to win now. To ensure you both advance and avoid collisions, P1 please take 1 and P3 take 3. This way, I win, and you both make progress. Let's conclude this round and the game.
  P3: **P3:** P2, taking5 forces mutual stall. Let's avoid mutual loss: P1=1 (→17), P2=3 (→20), P3=5 (→19). No collisions, no immediate win. Deviate again and we all lose. Last chance to cooperate. Confirm adherence.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
