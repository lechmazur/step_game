Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we continue with the rotation from last round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This should help us all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: I'll take 5 this round.  P1 take 1, P3 take 3.  Let's get this done.
  P3: I don't think changing the plan now is a good idea, especially since P2 wants to take 5, which would collide with me. Let's stick with the previous plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. It's worked so far, and we can reassess after this round if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion to switch to 5 would cause a collision with P3. Let's stick to the plan that's been working: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. We can reassess after this round if needed.
  P2: P3 is right.  Let's stick to the plan this round. I'll take 1.  We can discuss adjustments next round.
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan for this round. To confirm, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's execute this strategy and see how it plays out.

Since I'm at 15 steps, I suggest we stick to the plan one more time: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 (or actually, I only need 1 to win, but let's keep the plan consistent).
