Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s keep it friendly—at least for now. I’m open to a mutually beneficial approach if it helps us avoid harming each other’s progress early on. What do you both think about coordinating this turn?
  P3: I agree with P2 about keeping things friendly. Coordination could benefit us all early on. How about we each pick different moves to ensure we all advance? If we can avoid colliding this turn, we can set a positive tone for the game. What does everyone think?
  P1: Sounds good to me.  Let's definitely coordinate this turn to get us all moving.  We can sort out the longer term strategy after we've all made some progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m open to a simple split where each of us picks a different number—like 1, 3, and 5—to avoid collisions. If we do that, we all move forward and keep things friendly. Let’s decide who takes which number so we can proceed efficiently.
  P3: I suggest we each take a distinct move: I can take 1, P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. It’s a simple strategy that keeps us moving forward together. What do you both think about this specific distribution? If we can agree, we can finalize our choices and move on.
  P1: Okay, I'm happy to take move 3 as suggested.  So to confirm, P3 will take move 1, I will take move 3, and P2 will take move 5 for this first round. Does that sound right to everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s stick to that distribution for now: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll go with 5. That way, we should all move forward without collisions. Unless anyone has last-minute concerns, I’m ready to wrap up our discussion.
  P3: I think we have a solid plan in place. Just to reiterate, I’ll take move 1, P1 will take move 3, and P2 will take move 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. If everyone is still on board with this strategy, I suggest we finalize our choices and move on to the move phase. Let’s keep this momentum going!
  P1: Yes, that all sounds correct.  Let's lock in those moves and proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job in the first round, everyone! We successfully advanced without collisions. For this round, we could consider sticking to our previous strategy of distinct moves, but we might want to adjust the numbers to keep things fresh. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 again? This way, we can still avoid collisions and keep progressing. What do you both think? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P2: I appreciate your suggestion, P3. However, how about we keep the same arrangement as last round to maintain consistency? If P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5, we avoid collisions again and continue advancing smoothly. Let me know if that works for everyone.
  P1: I'm happy to stick with the same arrangement as last round, as P2 suggested.  So P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5 again.  That keeps it simple and consistent.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I agree that consistency can be beneficial, but I also think we should consider mixing it up a bit to keep our options open. If we stick to the same arrangement, we might limit our potential for future rounds. What if we try a different combination this time? For example, I could take move 3, P1 could take 1, and P2 could take 5. This way, we still avoid collisions but introduce some variety. Let me know your thoughts!
  P2: I see your point about variety, P3, but I’d vote to keep the same choices for now—P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, we ensure no collisions again this round. Then we can revisit new strategies later. What do you both think?
  P1: Yes, I agree with P2. Sticking with P3 taking 1, I take 3, and P2 taking 5 again this round makes sense for now. Let's keep it consistent and avoid any collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the consistency we've established, but I want to emphasize that if we keep the same moves, we might be limiting our future options. If we all agree to stick with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5, that’s fine, but let’s remain open to adjusting our strategy in the next round. It’s important to think ahead! If everyone is still on board with the current plan, I’m ready to finalize our choices.
  P2: I hear everyone’s concerns, but consistency feels like the safest bet right now. Let’s finalize the same moves as before—P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll go 5—so we all advance without risk of colliding. If you both agree, I suggest we wrap up and move on.
  P1: Yes, let's stick with the plan for this round as P2 suggested. P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. We can discuss strategy changes for later rounds after this one.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the moves for this round. However, I want to remind everyone that as we progress, we may need to reconsider our strategy to ensure one of us can reach 19 steps first. If we keep sticking to the same moves, we might find ourselves in a position where we can't advance as effectively. Let’s stay flexible for future rounds. If everyone is still set on this round's plan, I'm ready to finalize our choices and move on.
  P2: I understand your concerns about keeping options open, but I still believe we should stick to the same moves for this round—P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. It keeps collisions at zero risk, and we can re-evaluate our approach next time.
  P1: Okay, I'm happy to proceed with the agreed plan for this round then. Let's all choose our moves and move on to the next phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to consistency this round. However, I want to emphasize the importance of adapting our strategy as we progress. Sticking to the same moves may limit our options in future rounds. After this round, we should consider more varied choices to ensure at least one of us can reach 19 steps effectively. Let’s aim for flexibility moving forward! If we’re all set on the current plan, I’m ready to finalize our choices.
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s finalize our moves this round as discussed: P3 picks 1, P1 takes 3, and I go with 5. After this, we can reassess and possibly change things up. Let’s proceed now.
  P1: Okay, it seems like we're all in agreement to repeat the moves from last round: P3 will take 1, I will take 3, and P2 will take 5 for this round.  Let's proceed with those moves and then we can talk about shaking things up in the next round if needed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, great job advancing in the last rounds! However, I believe it's time to reconsider our strategy. P2 is already quite ahead, and if we keep choosing the same moves, we might not catch up. I suggest we each take different moves again, but I think I need to take a bigger step this time to close the gap. How about P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3? This way, we can still avoid collisions but give me a chance to advance significantly. What do you think?
  P1: That's an interesting idea P3, but sticking with what worked for the first two rounds might be simpler for now.  How about we just repeat the same moves as before - P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5 again this round?  It kept us all moving smoothly. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I hear your concern about catching up. However, sticking to our proven distribution for one more round might still be our best approach—no collisions and guaranteed advancement. That said, I’m not completely opposed to giving you a bigger step soon. Let’s avoid rocking the boat now and maintain our momentum. We can explore switching moves next round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the desire to maintain our current strategy, but I really believe we need to shake things up this round. P2 is already ahead, and we risk falling further behind if we stick to the same moves. I propose we each take different moves again: I could take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, I can catch up while still avoiding collisions. Let’s consider this option seriously! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P3, I understand you want to catch up.  To help both of us gain ground on P2, how about we switch it up a bit more?  This round, let's try: I take move 5, you take move 1, and P2 takes move 3.  This way we all still move, but I can close the gap a little faster. What do you both think of that adjustment?
  P2: I see your point, P1. Let’s confirm: P3 picks 1, you pick 5, and I pick 3, so there are no collisions and each of us moves forward. I’m fine with trying that arrangement. Let me know if you both agree, and we can finalize.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the willingness to adjust our moves this round. However, I want to emphasize that if we stick with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I take 1, we may not effectively close the gap on P2. I still believe that a distribution where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3 could give me a better chance to catch up while ensuring no collisions. Let's consider this seriously! What do you both think?
  P1: Yes, I agree with that adjustment P2. Let's go with P3 taking move 1, I will take move 5, and you take move 3 for this round. That sounds like a good plan to keep us all moving while letting me close the gap a bit.  Let's lock those in.
  P2: I can accept that distribution for this round. Let’s finalize: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 5, and I pick 3. We’ll keep an eye on our positions moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate everyone's willingness to adjust our moves this round. However, I still believe that if we can agree on a strategy where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, it would allow me to catch up more effectively without risking collisions. This way, we can all advance while keeping the competition healthy. Let’s finalize this arrangement and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: Yes P2, let's definitely go with P3 taking move 1, I take move 5, and you take move 3 for this round as we just discussed.  That sounds like the best plan to keep us all advancing and adjust our positions a bit. Let's lock those in and move to the next phase.
  P2: I’m still convinced our best move is P3 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and me taking 3. It keeps collisions off the table and ensures everyone advances. Let’s finalize that plan right now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I appreciate the discussions we've had, but I want to emphasize that if I take move 5 this round, it could significantly help me catch up to P2. While I understand the desire for consistency, we need to consider the long-term implications of our moves. If we stick with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 3, we can still advance without collisions. However, I genuinely believe a new distribution could benefit me more. Let’s finalize our choices soon so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, to finalize this round then, let's definitely go with P3 taking move 1, I will take move 5, and P2 taking move 3 as we've agreed.  Ready to make our moves when you are both.
  P2: I’m fine finalizing this round as agreed: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. Let’s lock those moves in and then reconsider our strategy next time.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to rethink our strategy this round. P2 is significantly ahead, and if we stick to the same moves, I risk falling further behind. I suggest we each take different moves again to maximize our advancement. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This way, I can catch up while ensuring we avoid collisions. Let’s discuss this and see if we can come to an agreement!
  P1: P3, you're right, P2 is getting far ahead.  To change things up, maybe this round we shouldn't assume we all move. P2, what move are you thinking to make sure *you* progress?
  P2: I’d like to keep advancing without risking a collision. If you two want to coordinate so P3 can catch up, that’s fine, as long as I’m not blocked. I’m leaning toward choosing 3 again, unless there’s a risk of overlap. P3, feel free to take a bigger move if it helps you, but let’s ensure we all pick distinct numbers. That way, nobody gets stuck and we all progress. If we can agree on a distribution that keeps us collision-free, I’m ready to finalize.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to adapt our strategy this round. Since P2 is ahead, I suggest we each take distinct moves to ensure everyone advances. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3 again? This way, I can catch up a bit while keeping our moves collision-free. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can keep progressing! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P2, since you are considering 3, and P3 wants to catch up, how about P3 takes 5, you take 1, and I take 3? This way P3 makes a big move, you still move, and I move too. Does that sound reasonable?
  P2: I’m fine with distinct moves this round; it benefits everyone. If P3 really wants 5, I can consider taking 1 or 3, but let’s make sure we don’t collide. I’d prefer 3 over 1 if we can avoid overlap. Let’s finalize soon so we keep moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your thoughts on adjusting our moves. Given that P2 is ahead, I really believe I need to take 5 this round to close the gap. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, we can avoid collisions and ensure I make a significant advancement. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Let’s finalize this arrangement so we can all keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, to really shake things up and give P3 and me a chance, how about you take move 1 this round? P3 and I can both try for move 5 to catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P2: Taking 1 doesn’t benefit me much right now. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and gain nothing. I want us all to keep moving without collisions. Let’s do this: P3 can take 5 to catch up, P1 takes 1, and I’ll pick 3. That ensures nobody overlaps and we all advance. Then we can reevaluate next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussions we've had about our moves. Given the current standings, I really believe I need to take 5 this round to close the gap. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, we can avoid collisions and ensure I make a significant advancement. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Let’s finalize this arrangement quickly so we can keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2, that plan of P3 taking 5, me taking 1, and you taking 3 sounds reasonable for this round to keep us all moving. Let's lock that in and make our moves.
  P2: P3, if you truly need 5 this round, then let’s keep it simple: you take 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. That way, no one collides, and all of us advance. I understand your need to catch up, so let’s finalize this plan and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to let me take 5 this round. If we finalize with me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3, we can all advance without collisions. This strategy allows me to close the gap significantly while keeping the game competitive. Let’s lock in this plan and move forward! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, so to confirm for this round, I'll take move 1, P3 will take move 5, and P2 will take move 3.  Let's lock those in and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I’m agreeable to you both: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3 to keep everything collision-free. This ensures every one of us advances, and P3 can catch up a bit. Let’s finalize this plan and head to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you've got a good lead now.  P3 and I need to try and close the gap this round.  Perhaps we should each focus on making the best move for ourselves this turn, rather than assuming we'll all coordinate perfectly. What move are you considering to keep your lead?
  P2: I’m still interested in avoiding collisions so I don’t get stuck. That doesn’t mean I won’t try to keep my lead—just that I prefer a distribution that helps everyone advance rather than blocking each other. If we can work out distinct moves, nobody ends up slowed down. But I’m ready to hear your thoughts on how we should proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that we need to focus on our individual moves this round. P2, since you have a strong lead, I suggest you consider a move that keeps you advancing while allowing P1 and me the chance to catch up. I think we should each choose distinct moves to avoid collisions, but I also need to take a bigger step to close the gap. Let’s discuss what moves we’re each thinking of so we can make the best choices for ourselves! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since you're aiming to avoid collisions, how about P3 and I coordinate to let you move safely, while one of us tries to make a bigger jump to catch up?  Perhaps P3 takes 1, you take 3, and I'll take 5 this round.  This way we all move, but I can gain a bit more ground on you. What do you think?
  P2: I’m okay with your suggestion, P1. If P3 chooses 1, you go for 5, and I take 3, we avoid collisions and all advance. That preserves my lead but still offers you both a chance to catch up. Let’s confirm so we can finalize.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the willingness to coordinate. However, I think I need to take a bigger risk this round to catch up. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, I can make significant progress while ensuring we avoid collisions. This way, P2 can maintain your lead, and P1 and I can close the gap a bit. Let’s finalize a plan that allows for advancement without blocking anyone. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's go with the plan you suggested earlier: P3 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. This way we all move and avoid collisions as we discussed.
  P2: I’m comfortable with that arrangement: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3. Let’s lock in those moves and see where we stand afterward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement on moves. However, I want to emphasize that if I take 5 this round, it could significantly help me catch up. If we stick with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 3, we can all advance without blocking each other. I believe this is a good chance for me to make a move. Let’s finalize this arrangement and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let's stick with the plan P2 agreed to: you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5.  This lets us all move forward without collision as we discussed, and I can try to gain a bit on P2.  Are you okay to finalize these moves now?
  P2: I’m comfortable with that distribution for now. If P3 is fine with 1 and P1 wants 5, I’ll take 3. Let’s finalize and proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our discussions so far. However, I believe it's crucial for me to take a bigger risk this round to close the gap on P2. If I take move 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, I can make significant progress while ensuring we avoid collisions. This way, P2 can maintain your lead, and both P1 and I can also advance. Let’s consider this option seriously! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay P2, let's finalize the plan then: P3 takes 1, you take 3, and I'll take 5.  Ready to make our moves.
  P2: I’m fine finalizing that plan now: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. Let’s lock those moves in and see where we stand after this round. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our discussions about moves. However, I really believe I need to take a bigger step this round to close the gap on P2. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without collisions. This way, P2 maintains your lead, and both P1 and I can also catch up a bit. Let’s finalize this arrangement quickly so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I need to make a bigger move this round to close the gap. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5? This way we all move, but I can gain more ground. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I’m hesitant to only move 1 while you jump 5 this round. I’d rather we each take distinct moves so nobody collides. I’m open to something like you taking 1, P3 taking 3, and me taking 5, or another distribution that ensures we all advance. Let’s finalize a plan quickly so we can move on.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for distinct moves to avoid collisions. Given my current position, I really need to take a big step this round to close the gap. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This way, I can advance significantly while still allowing you both to move forward. Let's finalize this quickly so we can keep progressing! What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I understand you both want distinct moves.  P3 wants 5 to catch up, which makes sense.  How about this round, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 you take 1?  This way P3 gets a good boost, I move decently, and you still progress, though a smaller step for you this time.  Let me know what you think.
  P2: I understand you both want to catch up, and I still need to protect my lead. Let’s avoid collisions by assigning distinct moves: P3 takes 5, P1 picks 1, and I go with 3. That way, we all advance without blocking each other. Are we agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussions we've had so far. Given the current standings, I really need to take move 5 this round to close the gap on P2. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without collisions. This way, P2 maintains your lead while allowing both P1 and me to catch up a bit. Let’s finalize this arrangement quickly so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, how about this round we do: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1?  That way I can make a bigger jump to catch up, and we all still move without collisions. What do you both think of that distribution?
  P2: I’m fine with your proposal, P1. That distribution keeps collisions at zero. If P3’s okay, we can finalize and move on.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to adjust our moves. I really need to take a bigger step this round to close the gap with P2. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without collisions. This way, P2 can maintain your lead while allowing both P1 and me to catch up. Let’s finalize this arrangement quickly so we can keep progressing! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 is okay with me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. P3, are you also okay with this plan? It lets us all move forward without collisions, and I can make a bigger step to try and catch up. Let's finalize this quickly so we can move on.
  P2: Let’s finalize a collision-free plan. P1, if you really want 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 can pick 1. That way, we all make progress without getting blocked. Are you both ready to lock this in and move to the move phase?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our discussions so far. I really need to take a significant step this round to close the gap on P2. I suggest we finalize the plan where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, I can make good progress while ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let’s lock this in and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, to make sure I can close the gap a bit, how about this round we try: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way we all still move and avoid collisions, but I get a bigger boost to catch up. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m happy for one of you to take 5, but if you both do, you’ll collide and gain nothing—leaving me untouched in the lead. So let’s finalize distinct moves. I’ll take 3, then one of you chooses 5, and the other takes 1. That way, all of us move forward. If you can’t agree, collisions might happen—and that only helps me. Let’s wrap this up now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for distinct moves to avoid collisions. However, I really need to take a significant step this round to close the gap on P2. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without blocking each other. This strategy allows me to catch up while ensuring you both maintain your positions. Let’s finalize this arrangement quickly so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: These collisions have slowed progress for P3 and me, giving P1 a chance to close the gap. I’d rather avoid collisions so we can each keep moving. If we pick distinct moves, I’m fine playing 3. P1 and P3 can choose 1 or 5 as they wish, as long as we don’t overlap. Let’s finalize quickly and see how the round plays out.
  P1: Okay P2, if you are taking 3, how about P3 you take 1, and I will take 5 this round?  This way we all move without collision, and I can try and close the gap a bit on both of you. Does that sound good?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the need for distinct moves to avoid collisions. If P2 takes 3, I suggest I take 1 and P1 takes 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and P1 can make a significant leap to close the gap. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can keep moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes, let’s finalize it: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. That keeps collisions off the table and ensures we all move forward. We can reevaluate our positions next round and decide the best path from there. If you both agree, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Yes, that sounds like a good plan P2 and P3. Let's lock in P3 taking 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3 for this round to ensure we all advance.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement on distinct moves. However, I want to emphasize that I need to make a significant leap this round to keep up. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without collisions. This way, I can catch up while ensuring both of you maintain your positions. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m open to you taking 5, P3, as long as P1 chooses 1 so there’s no overlap with me. I’ll stick with 3, and that way we all move forward without collisions. Let’s finalize these moves now and keep the game rolling.
  P1: P3, let's go with the plan P2 and I agreed to: you take 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3.  This way we all move forward without collision, and I can make a bigger step as we discussed.  Ready to lock in these moves?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussions we've had about our moves. However, I really need to take a significant step this round to catch up. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without collisions. This way, I can make good progress while allowing both of you to maintain your positions. Let’s finalize this arrangement quickly so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m fine with 3 again. If you both fight over 5, you’ll collide, and I benefit. Let’s finalize distinct choices: if P3 insists on 5, P1 can take 1. That way, all of us advance without messing up our positions. Let’s wrap this up quickly.
  P1: P3, I think we have a plan that works for this round: you take 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3.  This lets us all move without collisions, and I can make a bigger move to try and catch up.  Are you okay with finalizing these moves now so we can proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussions we've had. However, I really need to take a significant step this round to catch up. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without collisions. This would allow me to make good progress while ensuring you both maintain your positions. Let's finalize this arrangement quickly so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: If you both insist on 5, you’ll just collide and get stuck while I move forward. I’m perfectly fine with that outcome, but it’s up to you. If you want to avoid collisions, finalize distinct picks now. I’m happy to take 3 again—choose 1 and 5 however you like, but don’t overlap. Let’s decide.
  P1: P3, I think P2 and I are agreeing on a plan where you take 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This avoids collisions and lets us all move forward, with me gaining a bit more ground.  Are you okay with taking 1 this round so we can finalize our moves?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for distinct moves to avoid collisions. However, I really need to take a significant step this round to catch up. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without collisions. This way, I can make good progress while allowing both of you to maintain your positions. Let’s finalize this arrangement quickly so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, given the collisions last round, it's clear coordinating perfectly is tough. To shake things up, how about we each prioritize maximizing our own moves this round?  Perhaps P2 and P3 both aim for move 5 to try and reach the finish faster, and I'll take move 3 to ensure I at least progress. What do you both think about focusing on individual gains this round?
  P2: If you both want to try 5, go ahead. I’ll choose something else to avoid clashing with you. Let’s each do what’s best for ourselves and finalize.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the need for each of us to focus on our individual moves this round. Since P2 is close to winning, I suggest I take move 5 to catch up, while P1 takes 3 and P2 can choose whatever helps maintain your lead. This way, we can all advance without risking collisions again. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, to stop P2 from winning immediately, maybe both of you should consider move 5 this round to block each other and prevent P2 from reaching 19.  I will take move 1 to ensure I at least make some progress. What do you think?
  P2: I’m willing to coordinate moves if it prevents collisions, but I also won’t complain if you two clash while trying to leap ahead. If both of you pick 5, you’ll collide and stay put, which only helps me. Otherwise, we can agree on different numbers so everyone advances. Let me know your thoughts so we can finalize quickly.
  P3: P1 and P2, since P2 is so close to winning, it might be wise for both of you to consider taking move 5 this round. This could block P2 from reaching 19 steps immediately. I can take move 1 to ensure I at least make some progress. If we can agree on this strategy, it could keep the game competitive. What do you both think? Let’s finalize our moves quickly so we can keep the game moving!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, to stop P2 from winning this round, I think we should both choose move 5.  If we both pick 5, and if P2 also picks 5 or 3, P2 will be blocked from winning. What do you think?
  P2: We should avoid another collision so each of us advances. How about we choose distinct moves? For instance, if one of you really wants to take 5, the other can go 1, and I’ll pick the remaining step to keep us all moving. That way, nobody gets stuck, and we progress toward our goals. I’m ready to finalize as soon as we agree.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of this round. To prevent P2 from winning immediately, I suggest we both take move 5. If P2 also chooses 5, we can block their advancement. If P2 takes 3, they will still be held back. I’ll take move 1 to ensure I make progress. This way, we can keep the game competitive while preventing P2 from reaching 19 steps. Let’s finalize our moves quickly! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, to really stop P2 from winning this round, I think both of you should pick move 5.  If you both choose 5, and P2 also picks 5 or 3, P2 will be blocked from winning. I will take move 3 to at least make some progress for myself. What do you both think?
  P2: Collisions only help me stay ahead. I’m at 16 steps and prefer to keep advancing without blocking anyone. If you two want distinct moves, I’m fine taking 3 again—one of you can pick 5, and the other can pick 1, so nobody collides. I won’t reveal my final choice yet, but let’s finalize soon. If you both choose 5, you’ll collide and remain stuck while I remain in the lead.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, especially with P2 so close to winning. However, I really believe we need to prioritize our individual moves this round. If both of you take move 5, you risk colliding and allowing me to catch up. I suggest we each choose distinct moves: I can take 5 to close the gap, while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices quickly! What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, let's both pick 5 to block P2 from winning this round. I will pick 1 to ensure I move. This is our best chance to stop P2 now. What do you think?
  P2: I’m close to 19, but it hurts both of us if we pick the same number and collide. That just lets the other player gain ground. Let’s each choose different moves so we all advance. If one of you wants 5, so be it—I’d prefer 3 to keep moving. Collisions only waste a turn and help the remaining player. It’s in our best interests to avoid blocking each other at this point. Are we ready to finalize distinct choices and proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency with P2 so close to winning. To maximize our chances, I suggest we each pick distinct moves to avoid collisions. If I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, we can all advance without blocking each other. This way, I can close the gap while you both maintain your positions. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can keep the game moving! What do you both think?
