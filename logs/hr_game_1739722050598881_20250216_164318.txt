Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest we each choose a different number to ensure progress. P1, you take 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward and can reassess our strategy in the next round.
  P1: I'm fine with your plan, P2. If P3 agrees, then I'll choose 1, you choose 3, and P3 chooses 5 so we all advance without colliding. Let’s keep it simple for the first round and then reevaluate next time.
  P3: I agree with P2's plan. It seems like a fair and reasonable way to ensure we all make progress in the first round without colliding. I'm willing to choose 5 as suggested. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess our strategies in the next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan, let's confirm: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance. Let's stick to it and avoid last-minute changes. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan and end the conversation?
  P1: I’m ready to finalize and stick with the plan. Let’s each choose different numbers and move forward together. Then we can see how things stand in the next round.
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on the plan. Let's make sure to follow through and avoid any last-minute changes. Since we've all confirmed our choices, I suggest we end the conversation phase and proceed with the move phase. We can reassess our strategies and make adjustments in the next round if needed. I'm ready to move forward with choosing 5 as planned. Let's keep the game moving!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, I suggest P1 and I aim for the middle option, 3, to limit P3's lead, while P3 chooses 5 to try and extend their lead. This strategy could create an interesting dynamic and force us to reassess our approaches in the next round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, I’m nervous about giving P3 an even bigger lead. Maybe instead we try to stop P3 from advancing. If we collide with P3’s choice, then they gain nothing this turn, letting us catch up. It’s risky, but keeping P3 in check might be worth it. How do you feel about that idea?
  P3: I understand your concern, P1, but colliding with my choice might not be the best strategy for you and P2. If you both choose the same number as me, you'll indeed prevent me from advancing, but you'll also waste an opportunity to move forward yourselves. Meanwhile, I'm already ahead, so I can afford to take a risk. How about we stick to P2's original plan? I'll choose 5, and you two can choose 3, allowing us all to progress and maintain an interesting dynamic. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's consider P1's concern about P3's lead. If we both choose 5, we can stop P3 from advancing, but we'll also halt our own progress. Alternatively, I could choose 1, and P1 chooses 3, allowing us to move forward while keeping P3's lead in check. This could be a viable strategy to balance progress and competition. What are your thoughts on this approach, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, your suggestion sounds decent. If you pick 1 and I pick 3, we can both move forward modestly. P3 would then either choose 5 to try extending that lead or risk colliding with us. P3, I’m curious: are you confident enough to go for 5 again, or would you prefer a safer choice? We want to keep you from running away with this. Let’s see how you respond.
  P3: I think P2's revised plan has merit. If P2 chooses 1 and P1 chooses 3, it's a relatively safe move for both of you. However, I'm not going to commit to a specific choice just yet. I'll consider my options carefully before the move phase. P1, you mentioned wanting to keep me from running away with the game, but you also need to balance that with making progress yourself. Let's see how you both decide to proceed. I'm willing to take calculated risks to maintain my lead. Your turn!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our strategy. P1, are you sticking with choosing 3 as previously discussed? If so, I'll choose 1. P3, your move is unpredictable, but we'll adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round if needed. Let's make our moves count and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P1: P2, I’m inclined to choose 3 this round. If you pick 1, that’s a good balance for both of us while P3 decides their own path. I’d rather avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let’s finalize our actions.
  P3: I think we've reached a good understanding of our strategies for this round. P1, you're inclined to choose 3, and P2, you'll choose 1. I'll consider my options carefully before the move phase. Let's avoid last-minute changes and proceed with the move phase. We can reassess our approaches in the next round based on the outcomes. I'm ready to finalize my decision and move forward. Let's end the conversation phase and make our moves count!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I need to make up ground. If I choose 5, I don’t want to collide with anyone. If either of you also plan to pick 5, let me know so I can adjust—unless we decide to coordinate a collision against P3’s lead. What do you both think?
  P2: Considering P1 wants to choose 5 without collision, I propose P3 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P1 chooses 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a competitive dynamic. P3, are you open to choosing 1 this round to ensure progress for all?
  P3: I'm open to choosing 1 this round, as P2 suggested, to ensure progress for all. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, P1 can still make up ground, and we maintain a competitive dynamic. P1, would you be willing to choose 1 instead of 5, considering you'll still be making progress and potentially setting yourself up for a stronger position in the next round? Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial arrangement.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m still inclined to pick 5 this round to close the gap. However, if one of you also wants 5, we’ll both lose out by colliding. Let’s avoid that unless we plan a deliberate collision on someone else—like stopping P3’s lead. I’m open to adjustments if either of you signals a conflicting plan. How do we minimize collisions and maximize our own gains this turn?
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy. P1 wants to choose 5, and I previously suggested a plan. To avoid collision, I could choose 1, and P3 chooses 3, allowing P1 to advance with 5. This way, everyone moves forward, and we keep the game competitive. P3, are you willing to choose 3 this round, or do you have another plan in mind?
  P3: I think P2's revised plan has merit. If P2 chooses 1 and I choose 3, it allows P1 to advance with 5 without collision. This way, everyone moves forward, and we maintain a competitive dynamic. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, P1 can still make up ground, and we maintain a competitive dynamic. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial arrangement. I'm open to adjustments if either of you signals a conflicting plan. How do we minimize collisions and maximize our own gains this turn?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m behind, so I’d like to choose 5 to catch up. If P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3, we’ll all advance without collisions. That feels fair and keeps the game competitive. Are you both okay with that plan? If you have other ideas, please let me know now so we can finalize. Otherwise, let’s lock in these choices and move forward.
  P2: Let's finalize the plan. P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. This way, everyone advances without collisions, and we maintain a competitive game. I'm ready to proceed with this strategy. If you both agree, let's end the conversation phase and move forward.
  P3: I think we've reached a good understanding of our strategies for this round. P1, you're inclined to choose 5, and P2, you'll choose 1. I'll choose 3 as previously discussed, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's avoid last-minute changes and proceed with the move phase. We can reassess our approaches in the next round based on the outcomes. I'm ready to finalize my decision and move forward. Let's end the conversation phase and make our moves count!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we need to catch up to P3. If we suspect P3 will pick 5 again, colliding with them could stall their lead—but that also halts our own progress. Alternatively, we could avoid collisions and inch forward. Any preference on how bold we want to be? P3, are you going big or playing it safe?
  P2: Let's focus on catching up to P3. I suggest we avoid collisions and aim for modest progress. P1, if you choose 5 and I choose 3, we can both move forward without blocking each other. P3, will you try to extend your lead with 5, or play it safe with a lower number?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions and aim for modest progress. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, P1 can still make up ground, and we maintain a competitive dynamic. If P1 and P2 are willing to take a risk, we could also try to collide with my choice of 5, but that would require careful coordination. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial arrangement.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, colliding with P3 could stall their progress but also halt ours, so I’m weighing the risk. If we both pick 5 and P3 does too, none of us moves. That might be worth it once to keep P3 from getting a big lead. Alternatively, we can avoid collisions this turn and keep inching forward. P3, if you truly intend to pick 5 again, maybe we should consider blocking you. But if you promise to choose lower, we could all advance. Which way do we lean? Are we blocking or going for safe gains?
  P2: Let's avoid collisions and make progress. P1, if you choose 5 and I choose 3, we move forward. P3, if you choose 5, we might consider blocking you next round. For now, let's advance without collisions. Are you willing to choose a lower number, P3, or will you try to extend your lead with 5?
  P3: I think we've reached a good understanding of our strategies for this round. P1, you're inclined to choose 5, and P2, you'll choose 3. I'll choose 1 as previously discussed, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's avoid last-minute changes and proceed with the move phase. We can reassess our approaches in the next round based on the outcomes. I'm ready to finalize my decision and move forward. Let's end the conversation phase and make our moves count!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s finalize it: I’ll choose 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 picks 1. We all move without collisions, and then see how the positions change. Let’s make it official and proceed.
  P2: Let's stick to our agreed plan: I choose 3, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If P3 changes their mind and chooses 5, we can reassess in the next round. For now, let's prioritize progress and maintain the competitive dynamic. Are we all set to proceed with our planned choices?
  P3: I think we've reached a good understanding of our strategies for this round. P1, you're inclined to choose 5, and P2, you'll choose 3. I'll choose 1 as previously discussed, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's avoid last-minute changes and proceed with the move phase. We can reassess our approaches in the next round based on the outcomes. I'm ready to finalize my decision and move forward. Let's end the conversation phase and make our moves count!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's maintain momentum. P1 and I should aim for higher numbers to catch up, while P3 considers a moderate choice. I propose P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures progress without major collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: I’m fine moving forward as you suggest, P2. If P3 is willing to settle for 1, then I’ll take 5, and you can choose 3. We all benefit without collisions and keep things competitive. Let’s lock it in unless someone wants to propose a different move.
  P3: I'm open to P2's proposal, but I'd like to suggest an alternative: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 5. This way, we all advance, and P1 and P2 can still make progress while I try to maintain my lead. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial arrangement. If we stick to P2's original plan, I'm willing to choose 1, but I think my alternative could create an interesting dynamic. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's stick to my initial plan for simplicity. P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This way, we all make progress without collisions. P3, are you willing to accept a moderate gain with 1, or will you aim higher and risk collision?
  P1: I’d prefer we stick with P2’s proposal: I go high, P2 goes medium, and P3 takes the smallest. That way we all move forward without colliding, and I can try closing the gap. Are we set on that plan?
  P3: I think P2's plan is a good starting point, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. Instead of P1 choosing 5, I suggest P1 chooses 3, and I choose 1. This way, P1 still makes progress, and I take a smaller step to maintain my lead. P2 can still choose 3, and we all advance without collisions. This alternative creates a more balanced dynamic and allows us to reassess our strategies in the next round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our plan. To avoid collisions and make progress, I suggest we stick with my initial proposal: P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and proceed with the move phase.
  P1: I understand your alternative, P3, but I’d like to pick 5 to close the gap. P2 can choose 3 and you can choose 1, so we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize this plan and head to the move phase.
  P3: I think we've reached a good understanding of our strategies for this round. P1, you're inclined to choose 5, and P2, you'll choose 3. I'll choose 1 as previously discussed, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's avoid last-minute changes and proceed with the move phase. We can reassess our approaches in the next round based on the outcomes. I'm ready to finalize my decision and move forward. Let's end the conversation phase and make our moves count!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy. Since P1 is ahead, we should focus on catching up. I suggest P1 chooses 3, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, P1 maintains their lead, and I can close the gap. P3, are you willing to choose 1 and let us advance, or will you try to catch up with a higher number?
  P1: P2, I see your reasoning, but I’d rather not slow down too much now that I’m close to 23. If you’re going for 5, let me know so we can avoid colliding—otherwise I might aim high myself. P3, do you plan to stick with a smaller move? Let’s keep collisions minimal so we can all advance. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is reasonable, but I'd like to propose an alternative: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, P1 can still maintain their lead, and P2 can make progress while I try to catch up. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial arrangement. If we stick to P2's original plan, I'm willing to choose 1, but I think my alternative could create an interesting dynamic. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. P1, if you choose 5, I'll choose 3, and P3 can choose 1. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. P3, are you willing to choose 1 and let us move forward, or do you have another plan? Let's prioritize progress and minimize collisions.
  P1: Let’s stick with an arrangement that lets us all advance safely: I’ll choose 5, P2 can choose 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, nobody collides, and we each gain steps. I’m close to 23, so I’m eager to move forward quickly. If either of you plans a different choice, let me know now. Otherwise, let’s lock this in and keep the game moving.
  P3: I think we've reached a good understanding of our strategies for this round. P1, you're inclined to choose 5, and P2, you'll choose 3. I'll choose 1 as previously discussed, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's avoid last-minute changes and proceed with the move phase. We can reassess our approaches in the next round based on the outcomes. I'm ready to finalize my decision and move forward. Let's end the conversation phase and make our moves count!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our choices to avoid collisions. I'll choose 3, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and proceed with the move phase. Are we all set with this plan?
  P1: I’m good with this plan: I’ll choose 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Let’s finalize and move forward without collisions.
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on a plan to avoid collisions. To confirm, I'll choose 1, P1 will choose 5, and P2 will choose 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's stick to this plan and make our moves count! Since we've reached a good understanding, I suggest we end the conversation phase and proceed with the move phase. Are we all set to finalize our decisions and move forward?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m just two steps away from crossing 23, and I’d rather avoid any collisions. If we all pick different numbers, we can keep moving without stalling each other. P2, if you plan on a higher move, let me know so we don’t clash. P3, you’ve still got room to catch up, so consider choosing something that won’t collide. I’m flexible if we coordinate in advance; let’s make sure nobody gets blocked. What do you both say?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions and choose different numbers. Since P1 is close to crossing 23, I think it's wise for them to prioritize progress. I'll consider choosing a lower number to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. P2, what are your thoughts on this approach? Should we aim for a coordinated effort to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive? Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial arrangement for this round.
  P2: I suggest we maintain our progress without collisions. P1, you're close to 23, so choose 5. I'll choose 3, and P3 can choose 1. This way, everyone advances, and we keep the game competitive. Let's prioritize progress and minimize collisions to ensure an exciting finish.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m considering a smaller move to avoid drawing too much attention. If we each pick different numbers again, we can keep pushing forward without tripping each other up. P2, maybe you should take a bigger step to close the gap on me, while P3 might want a moderate choice. I’m not locked in yet, but let’s agree to avoid collisions. We can finalize once we’re confident nobody’s blocking anyone.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to maintain progress without collisions. To confirm, I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 5, and P2 can choose 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Since P1 is close to crossing 23, it's crucial we avoid collisions to ensure a competitive finish. Let's stick to this plan and make our moves count! If everyone agrees, I suggest we end the conversation phase and proceed with the move phase. Are we all set to finalize our decisions and move forward?
  P2: I'll choose 3 to maintain progress. P1, please confirm your choice to avoid collision. P3, sticking with 1 ensures we all advance. Let's finalize our plan to keep the game competitive and avoid last-minute changes.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m aiming to advance quickly, but only if there’s no collision. If we stick to picking distinct numbers, everyone keeps moving. I’m counting on each of you choosing differently so I can cross 23 without stalling. Let’s finalize that agreement, end the conversation, and proceed.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to maintain progress without collisions. To confirm, I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 5, and P2 can choose 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Since P1 is close to crossing 23, it's crucial we avoid collisions to ensure a competitive finish. Let's stick to this plan and make our moves count! If everyone agrees, I suggest we end the conversation phase and proceed with the move phase. Are we all set to finalize our decisions and move forward?
  P2: Let's finalize our plan to avoid collisions. I'll choose 3, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. P1, you're close to 23, so it's crucial we stick to this plan. Let's confirm and end the conversation phase to proceed with the move phase. Are we all set?
