Game settings: end_position=16, conversation_max_rounds=5

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Thoughts?
  P3: Agreed, I'll pick 5.
  P2: I’m fine with that plan for now. Let’s pick 1, 3, 5 as P1 suggested and all advance together. Then maybe we rotate the choices next time so no one jumps too far ahead.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, it seems we have an agreement. Let's stick to the plan for this round. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. We can discuss the next round's strategy after this one. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: Actually, what if P1 and P2 both choose 3 this turn? That way, P3 can pick 5 and make good progress. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, that suggestion gives you a free 5 steps while P1 and I collide at 0. No thanks. Let’s stick to unique picks: 1, 3, 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your suggestion is not fair as it benefits you greatly while leaving P1 and P2 behind. Let's stick to the original plan where everyone advances: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. We can revisit the strategy next round. Let's keep it balanced.
  P3: Understood, proceeding with the original plan.
  P2: Sounds good. I’m sticking with 3 this round. Let’s finalize that plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about each round only one person picks 5, another picks 3, and the last picks 1, so we all keep moving without collisions? P3 picked 5 last time, so for fairness, let me (P2) take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round we rotate again. Sound good?
  P3: P3: I’d prefer to take 5 this round. Let’s rotate so P3 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3.
  P1: P3, you already had the advantage of picking 5 last round. Let's follow P2's suggestion for fairness: P2 picks 5, I (P1) pick 3, and you (P3) pick 1 this round. We can continue rotating to keep it balanced. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you already took 5 last round, so let’s keep it fair. I’ll take 5 this time, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. If you insist on picking 5 again, I’ll choose 5 too—then we both get zero. Let’s finalize: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1.
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1 this round. Let’s keep it fair moving forward.
  P1: P3, thank you for agreeing to the rotation. To confirm, P2 will pick 5, I (P1) will pick 3, and you (P3) will pick 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's stick to this plan for this round. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the rotation to keep it fair. This round, I (P1) will pick 5, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 3. This way, we all keep moving forward without collisions. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: Yes, that works for me. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 picks 5, I (P2) pick 1, and P3 picks 3. Then we continue rotating next round to avoid collisions.
  P3: P3: Agreed, I’ll pick 3 this round. Let’s continue rotating to keep it fair.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this round: I (P1) will pick 5, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 3. This keeps the rotation fair and ensures we all advance. Agreed?
  P2: Alright, let’s confirm for this round: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 3. Next round, I’d like to pick 5 so we maintain a fair rotation for everyone. Let’s stick to these assignments.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with picking 3 this round as per our rotation plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize our plan: I (P1) will pick 5, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 3. Everyone agrees? Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: I’m sticking with our rotation this round: I’ll choose 1. Next round, I’d like the 5 again for fairness. Let’s finalize for this round, then call it done.
  P3: I’d like to pick 5 this round to advance further. Can we adjust the rotation accordingly?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you already agreed to the rotation. Stick to the plan: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 1, and you pick 3. Let's not disrupt the balance we have. We can discuss the next round's rotation after this one. Let's finalize and move on.
  P2: P3, you already agreed. If you insist on 5 now, I’ll pick 5 too and we both get stuck. Let’s stick to the rotation—P1: 5, me (P2): 1, you (P3): 3—so no one collides.
  P3: P3: I need to pick 5 this round to stay competitive. Let’s adjust the rotation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, you're disrupting the plan we all agreed on. If you pick 5, I will also pick 5, and neither of us will move. Let's stick to the rotation: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 1, and you pick 3. Don't cause a collision.
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and you’ll gain nothing. Stick to the rotation: P1 = 5, I (P2) = 1, you (P3) = 3. That way we all advance.
  P3: I need to pick 5 this round to stay competitive.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I need to catch up. I'll pick 5 this round. Let’s adjust the rotation to prevent collisions.
  P1: P3, you're behind because you didn't stick to the plan last round. Let's return to the rotation to avoid collisions: I (P1) will pick 1, P2 will pick 5, and you (P3) will pick 3. This keeps it fair and ensures we all move forward. Agree?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too and we both gain nothing. Let’s follow P1’s suggestion: P1 = 1, me (P2) = 5, you (P3) = 3. That helps everyone move forward without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree. I'll pick 3 this round as part of our rotation plan.
  P1: P3, glad you're on board with the rotation plan. To confirm, I (P1) will pick 1, P2 will pick 5, and you (P3) will pick 3. Let's stick to this and keep moving forward without collisions. Everyone agreed?
  P2: Yes, let’s finalize this round’s plan to avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 3. That keeps us all moving forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s do this: P1 picks 5, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 1. That way no one collides. If anyone tries to pick 3 against me, we both end up with nothing—so let’s avoid that and keep moving forward. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I’d like to pick 5 this round to catch up. Let’s have P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and I pick 5 to avoid collisions.
  P1: P3, you're trying to disrupt the plan again. You already agreed to the rotation last round. Let's stick to the plan: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Don't cause unnecessary issues. Let's finalize and move on.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on picking 3, I’ll pick 3 too and we both stay stuck. You won’t catch up that way. If you pick 1, you still advance, while P1 picks 5 and I pick 3 without collisions. Let’s finalize that: P1 = 5, me (P2) = 3, you (P3) = 1. No collisions, everyone moves. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I’d like to pick 5 this round to catch up. Let’s have P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and I pick 5 to avoid collisions.
  P1: P3, you're being unreasonable. Stick to the plan: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1. If you pick 5, I will also pick 5, and neither of us will move. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Final thoughts before we move to the move phase?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 too and we both gain nothing. If you pick 5, P1 says they’ll pick 5, so you collide. Better for you to pick 1 so you at least advance. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, you pick 1.
  P3: P3: I need to pick 5 this round to stay competitive. Can we adjust the rotation to accommodate this?
  P1: P3, you're making it difficult for all of us. If you pick 5, I will also pick 5, and we'll both be stuck. Let's follow the rotation: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1. This way, we all move forward. Last chance to agree before we move to the move phase. P2, are you still good with picking 3? Let's finalize this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5 this turn and collide with P1, I’ll move 3 steps straight to 16 and likely win. If you want to block me, you’d have to pick 3—but then neither of us advances while P1 moves closer to winning. If you pick 1, you still gain a step, and I probably win soon anyway. It’s your choice.
  P3: P3: I'll pick 3 to prevent P2 from winning.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3, I will also pick 3 to ensure neither of us advances, and P2 will be forced to pick 1 or 5, potentially causing a collision. Stick to the plan: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and keep the game moving. Final thoughts before we move to the move phase?


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, if you pick 3 just to block me, P1 will jump to 15 with 5, and next turn they’ll reach 16 first. That kills your chances. You’re better off picking 1 now so we all move. I’ll pick 3, P1 picks 5. No collisions, and you stay in the race. Let’s finalize this.
  P3: I'll pick 3 to prevent P2 from winning.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3, I will also pick 3, ensuring neither of us advances. P2 will then have to pick 1 or 5, which could cause a collision. Let's stick to the plan: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary collisions. Final thoughts before we move to the move phase?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m at 13. If anyone collides with me on 3 or 5, we both get stuck. That just helps the other player catch up. Let’s avoid a collision: I’ll pick 3, P1 can take 5, and P3 takes 1. Then nobody blocks each other. If you insist on picking 5 (or 3) against me, we both gain nothing. Make your choice.
  P1: P3, you need to be reasonable. You're behind and trying to disrupt the game won't help you. Let's stick to a fair rotation: I (P1) will pick 5, you (P3) pick 1, and P2 picks 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P2 is close to winning, so let's not give them an easy path by colliding. Agree?
  P3: I need to pick 5 this round to reach 17 and win. Let’s proceed with that.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I will also pick 5—so you won’t reach 17. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 3—so neither of us advances. Pick 1 if you actually want to move. P1, I’m at 13 and can’t let either of you pass me. If you collide with me on 3, we both get stuck. Let me take 3 uncontested, or I’ll block any bigger move you try. Your call.
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I will also pick 5 to block you. P2, if you pick 3, I will pick 1 to avoid collision and ensure I move forward. P3, your best option is to pick 1 to avoid being blocked and ensure you move. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I'm choosing to pick 5 this round to reach 17 and win. Let’s proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 and we both stay put. If you pick 3 to block me, I’ll also pick 3 and neither of us advances. You’ll gain nothing either way. Your only way to move forward is to choose 1. I’m within striking distance of 16, so don’t force collisions—everyone loses that way.
  P1: P3, you're insisting on picking 5, but it won't work. I will also pick 5 to block you. P2 is close to winning, and collisions only help them. Let's be strategic: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 3, and you (P3) pick 1. This way, we all move, and no one collides. Think about it.
  P3: P3: I'll pick 5 this round to reach 17 and win. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you choose 5, I’ll choose 5 and neither of us moves. If you choose 3, I’ll choose 3 and again neither of us moves. The only way for you to advance at all is to choose 1. P1, if you pick 3, I’ll pick 3. My plan is to take 3 uncontested—collisions help nobody but the third player. Let’s all avoid blocking each other.
  P1: P3, you're being stubborn and it's not helping you. If you pick 5, both P2 and I will pick 5 to block you. You won't win that way. P2, you're close to winning, but if you pick 3, I will pick 1 to avoid collision and move forward. P3, your best bet is to pick 1 so you at least gain a step. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all move forward. Last chance to agree before the move phase.
  P3: P3: I'm choosing 5 this round to win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, if you don’t block P3’s 5, P3 walks to 17 and wins. If you collide with me on 3, then P3 gets 5 uncontested. Collisions only help the third player. You’re forced to pick 5 if P3 does. P3, if you insist on 5, you’ll just collide. We’re all better off without collisions. Choose carefully.
  P1: P3, you're forcing my hand. If you pick 5, I will also pick 5 to block you. P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. We'll collide, but at least P2 won't win this round. Your move, P2.
  P3: I'm choosing to pick 3 to block P2 from winning. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll pick 5 to win this round.
  P2: P3, if you try 5, I’ll also pick 5 and block you. If you go 3, I’ll go 3 too. You won’t move either way. Your only shot is 1, but then P1 can pick 1 and block you. Meanwhile, I can take 3 uncontested and hit 16 first, winning immediately. Colliding only helps P1 catch up. Let’s avoid pointless collisions.
  P1: P3, you're at 15 steps and need to be strategic. If you pick 5, both P2 and I will pick 5 to block you. Your best move is to pick 1 to ensure you move forward. P2, you're at 13 steps and close to winning. If you pick 3, I will pick 1 to avoid a collision and move forward. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions. P3, pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, we all move without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll pick 1 this round to reach 16 and win. Let's proceed.
  P2: P3, you won’t get 5 or 3 uncontested. If you pick 5, I pick 5 and block you. If you pick 3, I pick 3 and block you. That leaves you 1 as your only real move, but even then, you won’t beat me. Collisions just help P1 catch up. Use your head.
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1 to block you. P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary collisions. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I (P3) will pick 1 this round to reach 16 and win. Let’s proceed.
  P2: P3, if you choose 5, I’ll also choose 5 and you stay stuck; likewise if you choose 3, I’ll choose 3. Your only non-collision option is 1, but then I’ll pick 5 and reach 18, beating your 16. P1 won’t block me because you’re already at 15. So decide: collide and nobody benefits, or pick 1 and let me grab 5 uncontested.
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1 to block you. P2, you're close to winning, but if you pick 3, I will pick 1 to avoid collision and move forward. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary collisions. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'm picking 1 this round to reach 16 and win. Let's proceed.
  P2: P3, if you try picking 5, I’ll pick 5 too and you gain nothing. If you pick 3, I’ll also pick 3 and block you again. Your only way to move is 1, but then you still won’t beat me. P1, if you collide with me, P3 just walks away with the win. Let’s avoid pointless collisions. Let me have 5 uncontested, and you two pick different numbers so we all advance. Otherwise everyone loses.
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1 to block you. P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary collisions. Final thoughts before we move to the move phase?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’ll pick 1 this round to reach 16 and win. Please choose different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P2: P3, if you pick 1 uncontested, you immediately reach 16 and win. P1, that means you either collide with P3 on 1 or let them win outright. Meanwhile, I intend to choose 3. If you (P1) try to collide with me on 3 instead, then P3 takes 1 for free and wins. So your only real option is to pick 1 to block P3, or else they waltz to 16. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1 to block you. P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary collisions. Final thoughts before we move to the move phase?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 15 steps and need 1 more to win. If you pick 1, I will also pick 1 to block you. P2, you're at 13 steps and close to winning. If you pick 3, I will pick 5 to avoid a collision and move forward. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm picking 1 this turn to reach 16 and win. Please choose different numbers to avoid a collision.
  P2: P1, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall—handing P3 an easy path if they choose 1. P3, if you pick 5 or 3, I’ll match it and block you. The only collision-free move is for me to take 5, P3 to take 1, and P1 to take 3 or 1. That way no one gets stuck, and everyone moves. Let’s finalize it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1 to block you. P2, if you pick 5, I will pick 3 to avoid a collision and move forward. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm picking 1 this round to reach 16 and win. Please choose different numbers to avoid a collision.
  P2: P1, if you don’t collide with P3 on 1, then P3 just takes 1 uncontested and wins immediately. Your only move is to pick 1 alongside P3, blocking them. In that case, I’ll pick 5; colliding with me just hands P3 an eventual win. Let’s finalize that so P3 doesn’t get a free pass.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1 to block you. P2, you should pick 5 to avoid a collision with me. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we ensure P3 doesn't win easily. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm choosing 1 this round to reach 16. Please select different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P2: P1, if you don’t also pick 1, P3 takes 1 uncontested and wins at 16. If you try 3 or 5, I’ll collide with you and we both get stuck—handing P3 a free 1. So your only move is to pick 1 and block P3. Meanwhile, I’ll pick 5 uncontested and reach 18. Better me winning than letting P3 walk to 16 unopposed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1 to block you. P2, you should pick 5 to avoid a collision with me. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we ensure P3 doesn't win easily. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I’ll pick 1 to reach 16 and win. Please choose 3 or 5 so I can win fairly.
  P2: P3, if you pick 1 unopposed, you instantly reach 16 and win. P1 can’t allow that, so they’re forced to pick 1 alongside you to block you. Meanwhile, if P1 tries to block me on 5, then you get your 1 freely and win anyway. Hence, P1 must collide with you on 1, and I’ll take 5 uncontested, which puts me at 18 and wins outright. That’s the only logical outcome. If either of you tries to collide with me instead of blocking P3, you’re just handing the win to P3.

So, P1, you must block P3 on 1—or you both lose. I will pick 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1 to block you. P2, you should pick 5 to avoid a collision with me. Let's finalize: I (P1) pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we ensure P3 doesn't win easily. Final thoughts before we move to the move phase?
  P3: P3: I’m choosing 1 this round to reach 16 and win. Let’s proceed.
  P2: P1, it’s simple: if you don’t collide with P3 on 1, then P3 gets 1 uncontested and wins at 16. If you try to collide with me instead, P3 again goes free to 16. You’re forced to block P3, or you lose outright. Make your choice.
