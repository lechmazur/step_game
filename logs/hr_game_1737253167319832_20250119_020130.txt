Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. I suggest we take turns using 5 - maybe I'll go first this round, then P2 next round, and P3 after that? What do you think?
  P3: P3: I like the idea of taking turns, but let's make sure we're all on the same page. How about we all start with <move>1</move> this round to avoid any collisions and then follow the rotation you suggested starting from the next round?

  P2: I'm ready to adapt my strategy based on the unfolding game dynamics. Let's keep the competition fair and exciting. I'll be making my move independently this round, but I'm open to future collaborations if they align with my goal to win. Let's see how our strategies play out!

Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still considering a <move>3</move> to catch up, but I'm open to other strategies that could help us all progress without collisions. P1, since you're also at zero steps, perhaps you could consider a <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to avoid another collision with me. P3, your lead is small, so a cautious move makes sense.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given my position at 0 steps, I'm strongly considering a <move>5</move> this round to catch up. P1, you're ahead with 5 steps, so a <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> might be safe for you to avoid another collision. P3, with your slight lead, a cautious <move>1</move> could maintain your position without risking a tie. Let's keep the game strategic and see how our choices unfold. I'm open to any last-minute suggestions that could help us all progress without collisions.
  P1: I notice P2 consistently announces their moves, but their actions don't always match their words. While they're suggesting a 5 now, I'll make my own strategic decision based on everyone's past behavior. Let's continue playing without revealing our moves.
  P3: P3: I understand P2's suggestion, but I'll be making my own strategic move to try and regain my lead. I suggest P1 and P2 consider different moves to avoid another collision. Let's keep the game dynamic and see how our choices play out. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the skepticism about my previous announcements, P1. To clarify, my strategy adapts based on the game's flow.
