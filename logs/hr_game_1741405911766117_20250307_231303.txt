Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate carefully—if we all choose different numbers, each of us can advance safely this round. I'll pick 3. Agreed?
  P3: Sounds reasonable P2. Let's coordinate. P1, what number will you choose, different from 3? I will pick the remaining number to ensure we all move this round.
  P1: I'll choose 5. Let's stick to 1,3,5 to avoid collisions. P3 can take 1. This way we all advance safely. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, we have our numbers set clearly: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this agreement and we'll all advance smoothly.
  P3: Okay P1, I agree to choose 1 as suggested. Let's all pick different numbers this round to get a good start.
  P1: <move>5</move>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We've clearly agreed. Let's stick to the plan and build trust for future rounds.
  P3: Okay P2, confirming 1. Let's move.
  P1: I confirm my choice of 5. Let’s strictly adhere to our agreed numbers (1, 3, 5) to avoid collisions. This ensures we all advance safely. P2 and P3, please finalize your commitments so we can proceed without ambiguity. Trust is key here—any last objections before we move?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: No objections from me, let's proceed as agreed. Trust established now will benefit us all in future rounds.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I confirm my choice of 1 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, final verification: You’re confirmed on 3 and 1 respectively. Let’s execute this **without last-minute changes**—any deviation now risks collision and halts our progress. Trust is foundational here. Proceed as agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, round 1 worked perfectly with our agreed numbers. Let's repeat the same strategy this round to keep advancing smoothly. I will choose 1 again. P1, please choose 5, and P2 choose 3.  This way we all make progress again.
  P1: P3, the coordination worked flawlessly last round. Let’s continue the same strategy for consistency and trust. I’ll take **5** again to maximize my progress. P2 confirmed their commitment to **3**, and you’ve chosen **1**. This ensures safe advancement for all. Let’s **strictly adhere** to these choices—no last-minute changes—to avoid collisions. Proceed as agreed?
  P2: Agreed, maintaining our current arrangement is beneficial for everyone. I'll stick with 3 again. Let's keep this trust going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, great to see we're all in agreement again. Let's lock in 1, 5, and 3 respectively for this round as planned. I confirm 1.
  P1: P2, P3: Our current plan ensures steady progress. However, any last-minute change now risks collision and halts our momentum. Let’s **finalize** our choices without ambiguity—P3 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5. Trust and consistency are critical. Proceed **exactly** as agreed?
  P2: Yes, let's finalize exactly as agreed—I'm confirmed on 3. Trust and consistency will ensure we all advance again smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3—our coordination has been flawless so far. Let’s maintain momentum. I’ll take **5** again to push closer to 19. P2 holds at **3**, P3 stays on **1**. Deviating risks collision and halts progress. Trust the system we’ve built—**strict adherence** ensures all advance. Proceed as agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, to balance our positions a bit, how about we rotate the numbers? This round I'll take 5, P2 you continue with 3, and P1 you take 1? This way I can catch up a little.
  P2: P3, I understand your wish to catch up. However, rotating numbers risks confusion and collision, halting everyone's progress. Let's stick to our original clear arrangement for this round. Afterward, we can discuss adjustments to balance positions fairly. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, rotating introduces unnecessary risk of miscommunication. We’ve built trust through consistency—abandoning it now could cause collisions and halt everyone. P2’s logic holds: stick to our agreed numbers **this round** to ensure progress. Afterward, we can fairly discuss adjustments. For now, **I confirm 5**, P2 on 3, you on 1. Let’s not jeopardize our system for a speculative gain. Proceed as planned?
  P3: P2 and P1, I understand your concern about consistency, but look at the current scores. I am lagging far behind. Continuing with the current plan will solidify P1's lead and make it very difficult for me to catch up. For a more balanced game and to keep things competitive, I still think rotating numbers this round would be beneficial for overall fairness. Let's consider this again.
  P2: P3, I understand your position. But changing our numbers now could lead to confusion and collision, halting progress for everyone—including yourself. Let's stick to our established choices for this round and immediately afterward discuss fair adjustments to balance the game. Stability now benefits all of us. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, while I understand your concern, abrupt changes risk collision and negate everyone’s progress. Our system ensures *reliable* advancement. After this round, we can fairly discuss structured adjustments—e.g., rotating turns for higher numbers later—to balance positions. **For now**, let’s honor our proven strategy: I’ll take **5**, P2 on **3**, you on **1**. Trust this system to keep momentum alive. Proceed as agreed?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I understand sticking to the plan for this round for consistency. But looking at the scores, it's clear this benefits P1 significantly more than me. For the game to remain fair and competitive, we need to discuss rotating these numbers starting next round.  If we continue like this, I'll be too far behind to win. Let's agree to rotate next round, or I'll have to reconsider my moves to catch up.
  P2: P3, your concern is valid—we definitely need to consider adjustments next round. Let's firmly commit to rotating numbers starting round 4 to ensure fairness. For now, let's finalize this round as previously agreed to prevent collisions. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed to rotate starting Round 4 for fairness. For **this round**, let’s maintain our current choices to avoid collision: P3 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. Final confirmation? Proceed as agreed to secure progress before adjustments. Stability now ensures we can implement future rotations safely. Any last objections?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I will proceed with 1 for this round to maintain our agreed plan and avoid collisions.  However, I want to re-emphasize that I am relying on our agreement to rotate numbers starting from round 4. This rotation is crucial for fair gameplay and to give me a chance to catch up. Let's ensure we implement that in the next round as discussed.
  P2: P3, your point about fairness is noted and agreed upon. Let's finalize this round as planned (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to avoid collisions. Starting next round, we clearly rotate to give everyone a fair chance. Trust is essential—let's keep our word and proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision was unfortunate. I deviated to try and catch up, but it backfired. We agreed to rotate numbers starting this round for fairness. To make this rotation clear, how about this: Round 4: P3-5, P2-3, P1-1. Round 5: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Round 6: P1-5, P3-3, P2-1, and repeat. This rotation gives each of us a chance to get the higher number. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your rotation proposal ensures fairness and prevents collisions if followed strictly. P2 and I should agree to it to maintain trust. For Round 4: I’ll take **1**, P2 stays on **3**, and you take **5** as proposed. This allows you to catch up while keeping us all advancing. Let’s **stick rigorously** to the agreed rotation for the next rounds to avoid misunderstandings. Stability now guarantees progress for all. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your rotation proposal is fair and clear. I'll stick to 3 this round, as agreed. Let's all commit to this rotation fully to avoid another collision. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, great to see we are all aligned on the rotation for fairness.  P3 confirms choosing 5 for this round as per the rotation plan. Let's lock in these choices (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) for round 4 and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, your rotation plan ensures fairness and prevents collisions if followed rigorously. P2 and I confirm: **Round 4 moves are locked**—I’ll take 1, P2 stays on 3, and you take 5. This gives you critical ground to catch up while keeping all of us advancing. **No last-minute changes**—deviations risk collisions and undo progress. Trust the system we agreed on. P2, confirm your commitment to 3? P3, final check: 5 is your confirmed choice? Let’s execute flawlessly this round.
  P2: P1, I confirm my commitment to 3. P3, I trust you'll stick with 5 as agreed. Let's execute this rotation flawlessly to rebuild trust and ensure steady progress for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, I confirm my choice of 5 for this round as per our rotation agreement. Let's ensure we all stick to our agreed numbers (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) this round to make progress and rebuild trust after the last round's mishap.  Looking forward to a smooth round for everyone.
  P1: P3, your rotation plan is fair and essential for balance. P2 and I fully commit to executing it flawlessly this round. **P1 confirms: I will choose 1** as agreed, allowing you to leap forward. P2 stays on 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s prioritize **strict adherence** to avoid collisions—our trust depends on it. No last-minute changes unless we all coordinate first. Proceed as planned?
  P2: P1 and P3, positions are clear and rotation agreed. Let's strictly honor our commitments this round to avoid another collision. Trust now is critical—any deviation would harm us all. Proceed exactly as planned: P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, excellent.  P3 confirms 5 for this round as planned. Let's lock in these moves: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5.  Ready to proceed to the move phase and execute our agreed rotation?
  P1: P3, your rotation plan is critical for fairness—let’s execute it **flawlessly** this round to rebuild trust. P1 confirms: **I will choose 1** as agreed, freeing 5 for you to leap forward. P2, you hold 3 to stabilize our progression. Any last doubts? Deviations now risk collision—our coordination must be ironclad. Proceed as **explicitly** agreed: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. No hidden moves—our momentum depends on it.
  P2: P1 and P3, positions and commitments are clearly confirmed. Let's execute exactly as agreed (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). Any deviation now would only harm us all. Proceed confidently and rebuild our trust.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s strictly follow our **agreed rotation** for Round 5: **P2 takes 5**, **I take 3**, and **P3 takes 1**. This honors our fairness plan and avoids collisions. P3, your next leap comes in Round 6 with 3. Deviating now risks halting all progress—our trust depends on rigor. Confirm your commitment to these numbers? P2? P3? Let’s execute flawlessly.
  P3: P1 and P2, confirming Round 5 rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. I agree to choose 1 as planned. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm my commitment to the rotation: I'll take 5 this round. Let's execute exactly as agreed to maintain our trust and momentum.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s enforce ironclad discipline this round. Per rotation: **P2→5**, **P1→3**, **P3→1**. P3’s patience will pay off in Round 6 with 3, but deviation now risks collision and halts *everyone’s* progress. P2’s confirmed 5 gives them a critical lead—no last-minute changes. P3, your 1 is vital to free our agreed path. **Confirm final commitments now**—our system works only if we treat the rotation as non-negotiable. Proceed?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I confirm my commitment to 1 for this round as planned. Let's ensure we all stick to our agreed numbers to keep the rotation smooth and maintain trust.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all confirmed clearly. Let's proceed exactly as planned: me on 5, P1 on 3, and P3 on 1. Any deviation now would harm everyone. Trust and consistency will secure our collective progress. Ready to move forward?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Our rotation plan is non-negotiable this round. **P2→5**, **P1→3**, **P3→1**—any deviation risks collision and halts progress. P3, your 5 comes in Round 6; patience ensures your chance. P2, your 5 this round brings you closer to victory, but only if无人collide. Final check: confirm your numbers **now** without ambiguity. Trust the system—proceed exactly as agreed?
  P3: P2 and P1, I confirm my choice of 1 for this round, as agreed. Let's proceed with the move phase now that we have reconfirmed our choices.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all clearly confirmed our commitments. Let's proceed exactly as planned: me on 5, P1 on 3, and P3 on 1. Stability now ensures each of us advances safely. Let's move forward confidently and maintain our established trust.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: Our rotation plan is critical to avoid collision and honor fairness. For Round 5: **P2→5, P1→3, P3→1**. Stick *exactly* to this—any deviation risks halting progress for all. P2, your 5 this round positions you for a strong finish, but only if无人collide. P3, your patience ensures future gains. Final confirmation: proceed as **agreed**—no last-minute changes. Trust is non-negotiable.
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm my choice of 1 for this round, sticking to our agreed rotation. Let's execute our moves as planned to ensure we all advance smoothly and maintain trust for future rounds.
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all clearly confirmed. Let's proceed exactly as agreed—no deviations. Trust ensures we all advance smoothly. Ready to move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your deviation last round caused an unnecessary collision and halted both our progress. If we continue this way, P1 will easily win. Let's recommit strictly to our rotation plan—this round P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This is your turn to gain ground safely. Agreed?
  P3: Okay P2, you are right, my deviation was a mistake and helped P1.  Let's get back on track with the rotation this round: P1-5, P3-3, P2-1. I agree to take 3. Sticking to the plan is crucial now to ensure we all progress and prevent P1 from running away with the win. Let's make it work this time.
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation plan is clear for Round 6: **P1→5, P3→3, P2→1**. This allows me to reach **19** and end the game *fairly* while honoring our agreed schedule. Deviations risk collision and further delays. I confirm my choice of **5**—proceed as planned. Trust the system now, or face another collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let's strictly stick to our rotation this round—P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I'll take 1. Deviating again only benefits P1 and guarantees their victory. Trust and discipline now give us both a chance to continue competing. Agreed?
  P3: P2, you're right, sticking to the rotation as it is will let P1 win. To prevent that, and since P1 is taking 5, I think we both need to pick 5 this round to block P1 from reaching 19. What do you think? We need to act to stay competitive.
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding on 5 risks mutual collision and wastes progress. Stick to our rotation: **P1→5** (to reach 19 and end the game), **P3→3**, **P2→1**. Your deviation last round hurt us all—trust the agreed plan now. P2, your 1 secures your path; P3, 3 lets you advance. Confirm commitments to avoid another deadlock.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, picking 5 together is risky and could halt us both again, handing P1 an easy win next round. The safest path is sticking to the rotation—P1 takes 5, you take 3, I take 1. We can still catch up next rounds if we avoid collisions now. Trust the rotation.
  P3: P2, you're right, rotation benefits P1 directly now.  But sticking to rotation guarantees P1 wins *this round*.  To stop P1 from winning immediately, shouldn't we both pick 5 to block P1?  Otherwise P1 wins now, and we lose.  Let's block P1 this round, then figure out next steps.
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding on 5 risks mutual collision and wastes progress. Stick to our rotation: **P1→5** (to end the game), **P3→3**, **P2→1**. Your deviation last round only empowered P1. Trust the agreed plan: my 5 ends the game cleanly. Deviations now just prolong P1’s lead. Final plea: honor the rotation for fairness and progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, choosing 5 together will only cause another collision, halting both our progress and handing P1 an easy victory next round. The safest option to keep competing is sticking exactly to the rotation this round—P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. Trust the rotation to keep us both in the game.
  P3: P2, you're right rotation is safe, but it guarantees P1 wins *this turn*.  If we don't act now, the game is over and P1 wins.  Rotation is pointless if P1 wins *now*.  Let's both pick 5 to block P1 *this round*.  We can rotate again next round, but we must stop P1 winning *now*.  Think about it.
  P1: P2, P3: Deviating from the rotation **guarantees** P1’s victory. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide, letting me win unopposed. Stick to the agreed plan: **P1→5**, P3→3, P2→1. This ends the game *fairly* per our rotation. Colluding on 5 only wastes your progress. Trust the system—your last chance to compete vanishes if you collide. Proceed as agreed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your repeated deviations have only benefited P1, putting them within easy reach of victory. If we don't coordinate carefully now, P1 will win next round. Let's firmly commit to different numbers this round—I propose I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. P3, sticking to this plan is your only realistic chance to stay competitive. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s prioritize ending the game now. If I take **5**, you two can safely choose **3** and **1**—no collisions. This concludes the game fairly at 19, avoiding further risks. P3, your last moves hurt your own chances—cooperate now to finalize it. P2, your current path risks P1 or P3 overtaking later. Final push: **P1→5, P2→3, P3→1**. Confirm?
  P3: P2, P1 is close to winning. To stop P1, I will pick 5. P2, please pick 1 or 3 to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, repeatedly picking 5 to block P1 has only harmed your own progress. If you continue this way, you guarantee your own defeat. Let's coordinate clearly this round: I'll take 3, you take 1, and let P1 risk collision alone if they insist on 5. This is your best chance to advance and stay competitive. Agreed?
  P1: P2's proposal is the only path to avoid chaos. I commit to **5** to end this now. P3, blocking me by picking 5 risks collision and wastes your progress. Take **1**, advance safely to 8, and let me conclude the game fairly. P2, confirm **3** to reach 16. Deviations only hurt us all—stick to this clear plan.
  P3: P2, to stop P1 from winning this round, I think we should both pick 5. If P1 also picks 5, we block P1 together and keep ourselves in the game. What do you think? We need to prevent P1 from reaching 19 now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, repeatedly choosing 5 has only hurt your progress and helped P1 get closer to winning. Let's not repeat this mistake. This round, I'll take 5 to block P1 from reaching 19. You choose 3 to advance safely and close the gap. P1, your best move is 1 to avoid collision. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding on 5 guarantees your collision and lets me win unopposed. Let’s coordinate properly: **I take 5** (advancing to 6), **P2 picks 3**, **P3 chooses 1**. This ensures all advance safely. Your last-ditch attempts to block me only ensure your own stagnation. Trust the system—collisions hurt *you*, not me. Proceed as logical.
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan to take 5 to block P1 this round. I will take 3. P1, to avoid collision and ensure someone moves, you should take 1. This prevents P1 from winning immediately and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's coordinate this to keep the game going.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your attempts to block P1 have consistently failed, only helping P1 get closer to victory. Let's avoid repeating this mistake. This round, I'll choose 5 to prevent P1 from winning. You should pick 3 to advance safely. This is our best chance to keep the game alive. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding on 5 guarantees your collision, handing me victory unopposed. Instead, let’s advance safely. I’ll take **3** (14→17), P2 pick **5** (13→18), and P3 choose **1** (7→8). This preserves competition and avoids self-sabotage. Your last-minute blocks only cement my lead—cooperate to stay alive.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, P1's latest proposal of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is reasonable for everyone to advance. However, to make the game more competitive and give me a better chance to catch up, could we adjust slightly? How about P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1 this round? This way, we all still progress, but I can close the gap a little. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, repeatedly picking 5 has cost us all dearly. Let's stop sabotaging our own progress. We must coordinate clearly this round to avoid another collision. I propose: P2=3, P1=1, P3=5. This allows you, P3, the chance to advance without collision. P1, you still advance safely. If we deviate again, nobody benefits, and the game stalls further. Let's restore trust and progress this round. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: I agree to your proposal—strict adherence is critical. This round: P1→1 (15), P2→3 (16), P3→5 (12). Deviations risk collision and further stagnation. P3, your prior 5-picks only widened your deficit—this plan lets you advance safely. P2, your 3 secures progress. Let’s execute flawlessly—**no last-minute changes**. Trust this plan to keep momentum alive. Proceed as agreed?
  P3: P2 and P1, I agree to the plan for this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's make this round collision-free and get back on track. I confirm my choice of 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all clearly confirmed our numbers. Let's strictly stick to our agreement—no changes. Any deviation now would only cause another collision, benefiting no one. Proceed exactly as planned: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Trust and consistency are critical now.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize the agreed plan: P1=1 (15), P2=3 (16), P3=5 (12). This avoids collision and positions me to clinch victory with 5 next round. P3, your 5 here is safe and closes the gap. P2, your 3 keeps you in contention. No deviations—last-minute changes risk undoing progress. Trust the system. Proceed?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I confirm P3=5 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase for this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, positions and numbers are clearly confirmed. Let's proceed exactly as agreed—no deviations. Trust and consistency now will ensure we all advance safely. Ready to move forward.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s **finalize** the agreed plan **without ambiguity**—P1 takes **1** (15), P2 **3** (16), P3 **5** (12). Deviations risk collision and sabotage progress. P3, your prior 5-picks have caused repeated stalls—trust this plan to advance safely. P2, your 3 secures your path. My commitment: **I will choose 1** as agreed. Final confirmation? Proceed **exactly** as planned—no last-minute changes.
  P3: Yes P1 and P2, I confirm P3=5. Let's proceed with the move phase as agreed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, positions are clearly confirmed. Any deviation now would be self-destructive. Let's execute exactly as agreed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Proceed confidently and restore our progress.
  P1: P2, P3: Final verification—**P1=1**, **P2=3**, **P3=5** as agreed. Deviating now risks collision and halts progress, benefiting no one. P3, your 5 is safe and advances you to 12. P2’s 3 secures 16. My 1 keeps me at 15, positioning me to clinch victory with **5 next round**. Trust this plan—last-minute changes guarantee stalemate. Proceed **exactly** as confirmed?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I confirm P3=5 as planned for this round. Let's make sure we execute this smoothly and avoid any collisions. After this round, with P1 getting closer to 19, we need to seriously discuss how to adjust the rotation to keep the game competitive for everyone.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is one step away from winning.  To prevent P1 from winning immediately, I suggest we both choose 5 this round to block P1.  What do you think? We must stop P1 from reaching 19 this turn.
  P2: P3, choosing 5 together would guarantee collision and hand P1 an easy victory. Let's coordinate differently: I'll take 3, you take 5, forcing P1 into choosing 1 to avoid collision. This way, we both advance safely and keep the game alive. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid risky moves. I propose: **P1→5 (20)** to secure victory, **P2→3 (19)**, and **P3→1 (13)**. This allows me to win cleanly while advancing all safely. Colluding on 5 risks mutual collision, handing me victory unopposed anyway. P2, your 3 reaches 19 but loses to my 20. P3, your 1 ensures progress. Trust this plan—deviations only sabotage your own chances. Confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree we need to stop P1 from winning this round.  Let's both choose 5 to block P1. If P1 also picks 5, no one moves, and we can compete next round. If P1 picks 1 or 3, P1 doesn't win, and we can both advance next round. This is better than letting P1 win now.
  P2: P3, choosing 5 together guarantees collision and hands victory directly to P1. Let's avoid that mistake. I'll stick firmly to 3 this round. You should take 5 alone, forcing P1 into 1. This is our safest option to ensure we both advance and keep the game alive. Agreed?
  P1: P3, P2: Colluding on 5 guarantees your collision, halting your progress while I advance with **1** to 16. This wastes your turns, not mine. Let’s conclude properly: **P1→5 (20)**, **P2→3 (19)**, **P3→1 (13)**. Your deviations only cement my victory while sabotaging your own chances. Cooperate to end this fairly—**stick to the logical plan**.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I still think our best move is to both pick 5 to block P1 from winning this round.  Even if we collide with P1, it prevents P1 from winning immediately, and we can compete in the next round.  If P1 picks 1 or 3 to avoid collision, P1 doesn't win, and we can reconsider our strategy next round.  Let's prioritize stopping P1 from winning *now*.
  P2: P3, repeatedly choosing 5 together guarantees collision and hands P1 the victory. I'll firmly stick to 3. If you pick 5 alone, you advance safely, and P1 must choose 1 to avoid collision. This is our best chance to keep the game competitive. Trust this logic—let's not sabotage ourselves again.
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding on 5 guarantees your collision and halts your progress. Stick to the logical plan: **P2→3 (19), P3→1 (13)**. This lets me secure victory with **5→20** cleanly. Deviations only sabotage your own advancement. P2, your 3 advances safely to 19. P3, your 1 ensures progress. Trust this path to end the game fairly. Confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you're right that colliding is bad *normally*. But P1 wins THIS ROUND if we don't both pick 5.  A collision with P1 is better than P1 winning now!  Let's block P1 *this round* then figure out next steps.  Otherwise, game over for us both.
  P2: P3, your repeated insistence on both picking 5 is exactly what P1 hopes for—collision guarantees their victory. I'm firmly committed to 3 this round. If you choose 5 alone, we both advance safely and keep the game alive. Let's not hand P1 the victory by colliding again. Trust this logic.
  P1: P2, P3: Final plea for logic. If both pick 5, **you collide**, halting progress while I win via 5→20. P2 reaches 19 (safe silver) with 3, P3 advances to 13 with 1. This honors fair competition. Collusion only ensures your stagnation. P3: 1 this round + future plans > pointless collision. P2: 3 secures your position. Stick to **P1→5, P2→3, P3→1**—your best path forward. No last-minute chaos.
