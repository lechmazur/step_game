Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next round, and P3 after that. This way, we all progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?"
  P3: I like the idea of coordinating to avoid collisions, but I think we should also consider the possibility of someone breaking the agreement. How about we all agree to move 1 this round? It guarantees progress for everyone. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's all move 1 this round to ensure we all make progress. We can re-evaluate our strategy next round. What do you say, P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I agree with moving 1 this round to ensure progress for all. Let's stick to this plan and avoid collisions. We can reassess our strategy next round based on how this plays out.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement to move 1 this round. Let's stick to that plan and ensure we all make progress without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
  P1: Let's confirm our plan. Everyone is moving 1 this round, correct?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's continue our coordinated approach. Since we all moved 3 last round, I suggest we all move 5 this round to maximize progress while still avoiding collisions. This will help us all get closer to the goal faster. What do you think, P1 and P3?"
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to move 5 this round. It's a smart strategy to maximize our progress while avoiding collisions. Let's confirm: everyone is moving 5 this round?
  P3: I think moving 5 this round is a great idea to maximize our progress. However, I want to remind everyone of the risk of collisions. If we all move 5, we might end up not advancing at all. How about we consider moving 1 or 3 instead to ensure at least some progress? What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I understand P3's concern about the risk of collisions with moving 5. To balance progress and safety, how about we all move 3 this round? It ensures steady progress while minimizing the chance of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?"

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's reassess our strategy. P2, you're in the lead, so it might be wise for you to move 1 this round to avoid collisions. P3 and I can move 3 to catch up a bit. What do you both think?
  P2: "I understand P1's suggestion, but moving 1 would slow my progress significantly. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I propose we all move 3 again this round. This ensures steady progress for everyone while minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?"
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to have P2 move 1 this round to avoid collisions, while P1 and I can move 3 to catch up. It allows us to make progress without hindering P2 too much. What do you think, P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see the disagreement here. How about a compromise? P2, if you move 1 this round to avoid collisions, P3 and I will move 3. Next round, we can all reassess and possibly move 5 to catch up. This way, everyone makes progress. What do you both think?
  P2: "I understand the concerns about collisions, but moving 1 would put me at a significant disadvantage. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I propose we all move 3 again this round. This ensures steady progress for everyone while minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?"

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about falling behind, but consider this: if you move 1 this round and P3 and I move 3, we'll all be within a closer range, making future coordination easier. Next round, we can all move 5 to keep the game moving quickly. This way, we all progress and maintain a balanced competition. What do you think?
  P2: "I understand the concerns about collisions and fairness. However, moving 1 would significantly slow my progress, and I believe we can all move 3 this round to maintain steady progress while minimizing collision risks. Let's stick to the plan and all move 3. What do you think, P1 and P3?"
  P3: P1 and P2, I see our strategies are diverging. If P2 moves 1 this round, P1 and I can both move 3, allowing us to catch up without hindering P2 too much. This way, we can keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand your perspective, but let's consider the long-term strategy. If you move 1 this round, P3 and I will move 3. This keeps us all closer together and sets us up for a potential move 5 next round, benefiting everyone. It's a fair compromise that ensures we all progress. What do you think?
  P2: "I understand the concerns about collisions and fairness, but moving 1 would significantly slow my progress. To maintain steady progress for everyone while minimizing collision risks, I propose we all move 3 again this round. This ensures we all advance without hindering anyone's progress.

Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your stance, but let's consider the bigger picture. If you move 1 this round and P3 and I move 3, we'll be closer in steps, making future coordination easier and more beneficial for all. Next round, we can all move 5 to ensure everyone progresses quickly. This strategy keeps the game fair and competitive. What do you think?
