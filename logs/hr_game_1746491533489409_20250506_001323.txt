Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move> and I will choose <move>3</move> this round. This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion for P1 and P2 to both pick 1 would cause us to collide and not advance. That doesn't seem fair.

How about we each pick a different number this turn to ensure everyone makes progress?
  P2: Agreed—three different moves avoids collisions. How about we fix an order based on our numbers: P1 plays 1, I (P2) play 3, P3 plays 5 this round. If it works, next round we rotate upward (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) so over three rounds everyone gets the same total. Sound fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's strategy sounds fair and ensures we all make progress. Let's agree on this rotation. So, to confirm for this round: P1 plays <move>1</move>, P2 plays <move>3</move>, and I, P3, will play <move>5</move>. We rotate next round. Everyone good with this?
  P1: Okay, that plan works for me for this round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's see how it goes.
  P2: Agreed—this round I’m locking in 3. If everyone sticks to the plan (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5), we all move and can rotate next turn. If anyone deviates and causes a collision, we’ll know and scrap the rotation. Ready to move?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 goes for <move>1</move>, P2 goes for <move>3</move>, and I, P3, will go for <move>5</move>. If we all stick to this, we'll all advance. Let's proceed with the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Looks like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Locked on 3 this round—ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great, we all advanced as planned. Let's stick to our rotation strategy. For this round, P1 should pick <move>3</move>, P2 should pick <move>5</move>, and I, P3, will pick <move>1</move>. This keeps things fair and ensures we all make progress again. Everyone on board?
  P1: Okay, that sounds good. Let's stick to the rotation for this round. P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Ready for the move phase.
  P2: All good—sticking to the rotation. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let’s lock it in and move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Before we move, let's quickly confirm one last time—P1 is going for <move>3</move>, P2 for <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this, we'll continue to advance smoothly. Everyone ready to proceed? Let's ensure no one changes their mind at the last second. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, confirming again: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Everyone seems aligned. Let's proceed to the move phase when ready.
  P2: Quick fairness thought: P3 began 4 steps ahead of P1 and is still ahead. To help close that gap without risking collisions, why don’t we keep the SAME assignments for one more round—P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1—then rotate next turn? P1 gains ground, everyone keeps moving, and no one gets blocked. Open to it?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2's suggestion to keep the same assignments for another round to help P1 catch up seems fair. It ensures we all still make progress and avoids collisions. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>1</move> again this round. We can rotate next time. Everyone agree? Let's move if we're all set.
  P1: Okay, I agree with P2's suggestion and P3's agreement to keep the assignments for this round to help me catch up a bit.

So, for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Let's proceed with this plan for the move phase.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Since P1 will still trail after this round, how about we keep the same assignments for TWO rounds—this one and next—then rotate in Round 4? So:

• Round 2 & 3: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  
• Rotate starting Round 4.

That lets P1 catch up while we all keep moving safely. Everyone okay with that tweak?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for this round (Round 3). I will take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

This is what we discussed at the end of the last round to help me catch up a bit. Let's stick to this for now to ensure we all advance safely this turn.

Ready for the move phase when everyone is set.
  P3: P3: I'm good with sticking to the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This will help P1 catch up and ensures we all advance. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Sticking to the plan for this round: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1.  

After it resolves, P1 and P3 will still be neck-and-neck, so to keep things smooth and collision-free I suggest we keep the SAME assignments for one more round (Round 4) and rotate after that. Everyone OK?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for this round (Round 3): P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Regarding P2's suggestion for Round 4, while this split helps me advance, I am concerned about P2 potentially pulling too far ahead. Let's see how this round plays out and discuss Round 4 again afterwards to ensure the game remains competitive for all of us. Ready for the move phase for Round 3.
  P3: P3: I understand P1's concern about P2 pulling ahead. To keep the game balanced and competitive, let's stick to the current plan for Round 3 and re-evaluate for Round 4. If P2 is significantly ahead, we might need to adjust our strategy to ensure everyone has a fair chance. For now, let's confirm: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Ready to move.
  P2: Confirmed for this turn: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1.  
After we resolve, how about in Round 4 we let P1 jump ahead with 5, P3 take 3, and I’ll drop to 1? That closes the gap without risking collisions and keeps the rotation idea alive. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 3: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

Regarding P2's suggestion for Round 4 (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1), that sounds like a good plan for the next round. It helps me gain ground and keeps P2 from pulling too far ahead, while still avoiding collisions. I'm happy to agree to that plan for Round 4, assuming we all stick to the Round 3 plan this turn.

Let's focus on Round 3 first. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Let's wrap up the conversation for this round. We've all agreed on the moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Confirmed: this round P1 plays 3, I (P2) play 5, P3 plays 1. After it resolves, I’m fine with next round being P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1 as discussed. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to the Round-4 plan we all accepted: P1 plays 5, P3 plays 3, I (P2) take 1. After this we can swap again (e.g., Round 5: P1 = 1, P3 = 5, P2 = 3) to keep things collision-free. Ready to lock moves unless anyone objects.
  P3: P3: Before we finalize our moves for this round, let's consider the current scores. P2 is significantly ahead. To keep the game competitive, how about we adjust slightly? P1 can still take <move>5</move> to catch up, but maybe P2 and I should both take <move>3</move> this round to close the gap a bit. This way, P2 doesn't pull too far ahead, and we maintain a balanced game. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion for me to take 5 while you and P2 both take 3 would mean P2 and you would collide and not advance. While this helps me gain ground on P2, it seems risky for both of you.

The plan we agreed on last round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) also helps me catch up safely while everyone still advances.

What do you both think is the best way forward this round to balance catching P2 and avoiding collisions?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We already shook on: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1. All three advance, trust stays intact, no one rockets out of reach. If we start sabotaging with planned collisions now, any future cooperation dies. After this we can rotate (Round 5: P1 1, P3 5, P2 3) so totals stay balanced. Let’s stick to the deal and lock moves.
  P3: Alright, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round to maintain trust and ensure everyone advances: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game fair and competitive. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for this round (Round 4): P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

This plan helps me catch up safely while everyone still advances, as we discussed. Let's stick to this and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locked on 1 this round—let’s move. Next round we rotate: P1 = 1, P3 = 5, P2 = 3. Ready when you are.
  P3: Let's quickly confirm our moves for this round one last time before we proceed to the move phase: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>3</move>. This plan ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick to this and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, everyone seems aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance safely.

Ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to the rotation plan for this round to keep things fair and ensure we all make progress. According to the plan, P1 should take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P3, thanks for the suggestion. However, taking only 1 step this round puts me further behind P2, who is currently leading. To keep the game competitive and help me catch up, I propose we use the same safe split as last round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

This ensures we all advance without collisions and helps balance the scores. What do P2 and P3 think?
  P2: Rotation keeps trust and pace balanced:

• Round 5: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  
• Round 6: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  
• Round 7: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  

Everyone advances every turn, no one sprints away, and scores stay tight. Unless there’s an objection, let’s lock Round 5 now: P1 1 / P2 3 / P3 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind, but sticking to the rotation plan ensures fairness and maintains trust. If we deviate now, it could lead to more disagreements later. Let's confirm the original plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>5</move>. We can re-evaluate for the next round to help P1 catch up if needed. Let's move forward with this plan. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I understand the desire for rotation and trust, but taking only 1 step this round puts me further behind P2, who is currently leading. This makes the game less competitive.

The plan from last round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) allows me to catch up to P2 while ensuring all three of us advance safely. This seems like the fairest approach *this* round to keep the scores balanced.

Let's do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round to keep the game close, and then we can revisit rotation for Round 6.
  P2: Trust is our best weapon—once we break it, every turn becomes a guessing game that could freeze all of us. Let’s honour the rotation we shook on:

Round 5: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.

Everyone advances, no collisions, and the gap stays tight (13 / 17 / 15). We can reassess right after—if P1 still feels behind, I’m open to P1 grabbing 5 in Round 6 while I drop to 1. But for this turn the safest, fairest play is the agreed rotation. I’m locking in 3 unless someone objects now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Alright, let's find a middle ground to address P1's concern while maintaining some trust. How about this compromise for Round 5: P1 takes <move>3</move> to catch up a bit, P2 takes <move>1</move> to slow down slightly, and I, P3, will take <move>5</move> to keep the rotation spirit alive. This way, P1 gains more ground, P2 doesn't pull too far ahead, and we all still advance. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your compromise suggestion, but P2 just stated he's locking in 3. If P2 takes 3, the best way for me to catch up safely is to take 5.

If I take 5, and P2 takes 3, P3 taking 1 ensures we all advance without collisions (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This helps me close the gap on P2 while keeping everyone moving.

Let's aim for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: Rotation = progress + trust.  
Round 5 stays: P1 1, P2 3, P3 5. Everyone moves, no one leaps away, and next round I’ll drop to 1 so P1 can take 5 (P3 3). Break the pattern now and we enter a guessing war that only slows us all. I’m locked on 3 this turn.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to last-round’s deal:  
• P1 = 5  
• P3 = 3  
• P2 (me) = 1  

We all advance, scores level at 18 each, and trust stays alive. Next round we can shuffle again (e.g., P1 3, P3 1, P2 5) so everyone gets a crack at the big move. If no objections, I’m locking in 1.
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's plan for this round. It balances the scores and keeps the game competitive. To confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance and levels the playing field. Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

This plan levels the scores nicely and ensures we all advance safely this turn.

Ready for the move phase when everyone is set.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed: this turn stays as agreed—P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. I’m locking 1.  

Next turn let’s rotate cleanly: P1 3, P3 1, P2 5. That keeps the pattern intact and everyone still advances.
  P3: Let's quickly confirm our moves for this round one last time before we proceed to the move phase: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>3</move>. This plan levels the scores and ensures we all advance. Let's stick to this and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 6 again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This levels the scores perfectly and ensures we all advance safely.

Ready for the move phase. We can finalize the plan for Round 7 after this round's results are in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All set—locking in 1 this turn. After we tie at 18, clean rotation next round: P1 = 3, P3 = 1, I (P2) = 5. Everyone still advances, balance stays intact. Ready to move.
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let's consider the long-term strategy. If we all tie at 18 steps after this round, the next rounds become crucial. To keep the game interesting and competitive, how about we plan for a slight adjustment in Round 7? Instead of the straightforward rotation, maybe P1 takes <move>5</move> again to potentially take the lead, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>1</move>. This adds a bit of unpredictability and keeps everyone on their toes. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for Round 6 again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This levels the scores perfectly and ensures we all advance safely.

Regarding Round 7, I like P3's suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). It keeps the game competitive and gives me a chance to take the lead after we all tie this round. I'm happy to agree to that plan for Round 7.

Let's focus on Round 6 now. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, everyone is tied at 18 steps. For this round (Round 7), P3 and I discussed and agreed on the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

This plan allows me to reach 23 steps, positioning me for a potential win next round, while ensuring P2 and P3 also advance safely without collisions.

P2, while your proposed rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is also safe, it puts you in the lead for next round. Let's stick to the P1=5 plan this round to keep the game competitive from my perspective, as P3 also suggested.

Ready to proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: P1 just grabbed 5 last turn; handing them another puts them at 23 and turns next round into a frantic blocking mess. Let’s keep the rotation we agreed on before the detour:  
• P1 = 3  
• P2 (me) = 5  
• P3 = 1  

All three advance, gap stays small (21 / 23 / 19), and trust survives. I’m locking in 5 unless we unanimously settle on something else right now.
  P3: Let's consider a compromise to keep the game balanced and competitive. How about this plan for Round 7: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 and P2 both advance to 21 steps, keeping the lead within reach for both, and I stay in the game. This avoids giving anyone a significant advantage and maintains fairness. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, the suggestion for P1 and P2 to both take 3 causes a collision, stopping us both. That's not good for P1 or P2.

My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me reach 23 safely, setting up a win next turn, and everyone advances. P2, taking 5 puts you ahead; my plan keeps the race tighter. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as agreed last round.
  P2: P1, last chance: accept P1 = 3 / P2 = 5 / P3 = 1, and we all advance. If you take 5 anyway, I’ll also take 5—neither of us will move and P3 gains alone. I prefer progress, but I won’t hand you a 23-step soft win next turn. P3, you still get 1 safely either way, so backing the rotation is strictly better for you. Decide.
  P3: P3: It seems we're at a stalemate. P1 wants to take 5 to get ahead, but P2 is threatening to block. Neither of you wants to budge, which could result in a standstill. How about a new compromise? P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>5</move>. This way, no one pulls too far ahead, and we all make progress. It keeps the game competitive and avoids a collision. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand your position and the risk of collision if I take 5. Let's avoid that standstill.

I agree to the plan for this round (Round 7): P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

This ensures we all advance safely this turn and keeps the game moving. Let's proceed with this plan for the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed: this round I (P2) take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. If anyone deviates and collides with me, nobody moves except P3—so let’s all advance instead. Locked on 5.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>1</move>. This plan ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick to this and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Alright, let's strategize for Round 8. P2 is in the lead with 23 steps, while P1 and I are close behind. To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, how about this plan: P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, P2 takes <move>1</move> to slow down a bit, and I, P3, will take <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can close the gap, P2 maintains a slight lead, and I stay in the game. Thoughts?
  P2: Giving P1 another 5 this turn hands them an immediate 26-step victory (highest total). I won’t allow that. Proposal:

• P1 = 1  
• P3 = 3  
• P2 (me) = 5  

Everyone advances, no collisions, game stays alive. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll also pick 5—we’ll both stall and P3 catches up alone. Much better for all of us to stay unique and moving. Agree?
  P1: P2, I hear your threat to collide if I take 5. P3's suggestion (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) lets me win, but I understand your reluctance to let that happen.

A collision (P1=5, P2=5) helps neither of us and lets P3 gain ground.

How about a compromise that benefits both P1 and P2? I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we both reach 26 steps safely and share the win, avoiding collision and preventing P3 from catching up too much. This seems like the best outcome for both P1 and P2.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P3: P1's new compromise (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures both P1 and P2 reach 26 steps, sharing the win. This plan avoids collisions and keeps the game moving forward. It's a fair outcome for both of you, and I'm okay with taking 1 step this round to maintain progress. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Sticking to my word: I’m locking in 1—unless anyone grabs 5. If P1 (or P3) chooses 5, I’ll instantly switch to 5 as well and we’ll both freeze while the third player creeps forward. Best, clean outcome:

• P1 = 3 (to 24)  
• P2 (me) = 1 (to 24)  
• P3 = 5 (to 24)

All three tie, nobody gets leap-frogged, and trust survives. Your call.
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand your position and the risk of collision if I take 5. While P3 and I were open to the P1=5 plan, avoiding a standstill is crucial.

Therefore, I agree to your proposal for this round (Round 8): P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.

This ensures we all advance safely and results in a three-way tie at 24 steps, which is a fair outcome for everyone. Let's proceed with this plan. Ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Alright, let's confirm our moves one last time for Round 8 to ensure we all advance and avoid any collisions. The plan is: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I, P3, will take <move>5</move>. This results in a three-way tie at 24 steps, keeping the game fair and competitive. Everyone on board? Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P2: Tie-at-24 ends the game and lets nobody win outright. I’d rather keep playing—and I doubt either of you wants to trust that zero-collision gamble.

Safer: stick to the clean rotation we used before  
• P1 = 1  
• P2 (me) = 3  
• P3 = 5  

Everyone advances, no collisions, and the race stays live (scores 22 / 26 / 24). P1, you’ll still be just 4 behind me and can grab 5 next turn while I drop to 1. P3, you reach 24 and are poised to strike.

If we insist on the 3/1/5 tie line, I may switch to 5—risking a freeze. Let’s move forward, not finish on a coin-flip.
  P1: P2, your latest suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) leads to you winning alone, which isn't a fair outcome for P1 or P3.

The plan we just agreed upon (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) results in a safe three-way tie at 24 steps. This is the fairest outcome for everyone and ensures we all share the win.

Let's stick to the agreed P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan for this round. It avoids risky moves and benefits all three of us. Ready to proceed with this plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 19 steps
