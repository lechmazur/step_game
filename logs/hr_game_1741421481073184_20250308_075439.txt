Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To keep things fair, I suggest we all pick <move>3 this turn.
  P3: I see the logic in picking <move>3 for fairness, but it could also lead to all of us not advancing. How about we consider picking different moves? If we coordinate, we can ensure at least one of us moves forward. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P3—colliding on 3 would stagnate us all. Let’s each pick a unique number this turn to ensure progress. I’ll take **1**, P2 can take **3**, and P3 can take **5**. This way, we all advance without conflict. Next turns, we can rotate choices fairly. What do you both think?

Let’s finalize this plan and keep pushing forward! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, I'll take <move>5 this turn. P1 selects <move>1 and P3 chooses <move>3. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 selects <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This ensures safe progress while keeping P2’s total at 19—close but not yet victory. Let’s execute this and plan to block their final push next round.
  P3: P2 is indeed close to victory, so we must be strategic. I propose we stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 selects <move>1</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This arrangement allows us to avoid collisions while keeping P2 from reaching 20 steps. It's crucial for us to coordinate effectively to maintain competition and ensure we all make progress. Let’s finalize this plan to keep the game competitive! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll proceed with choosing <move>5</move> this turn. P1, please select <move>1</move>, and P3 can pick <move>3</move> as proposed. Let's advance smoothly toward our goals.
  P1: P1: P2, if you take 5 now to reach 19, you’ll win with just a 1 next round—unstoppable! Let’s adjust: I’ll take **5** (→17), P3 picks **1** (→15), and you choose **3** (→17). This keeps you at 17, where we can block your path next round. Fair chance for all—agree?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2's potential win. However, I suggest we stick to the plan: I’ll take **1**, P1 can choose **5**, and P2 selects **3**. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep P2 from reaching 20 steps. It's crucial that we coordinate effectively to maintain competition and ensure everyone makes progress. Let’s finalize this plan to keep the game competitive! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll stick with <move>5 this turn to reach 19 steps, bringing me one step away from victory. P1, please choose <move>1, and P3 select <move>3 to avoid any collisions. This way, we all make progress without conflict, and I can secure the win in the next round. Agreed?
  P1: P1: P2, if you take 5 now, I’ll also take 5 to block your path—collisions waste everyone’s progress. Let’s split smartly: I take **3** (→15), you pick **1** (→15), and P3 chooses **5** (→19). This keeps *you* at 15, giving us all a fair chance next round. P3, confirm you’ll take 5? We’ll all advance without letting anyone surge too far.
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about P2 reaching victory. However, if we allow P2 to take <move>5</move> this round, they will be just one step away from winning. I propose we stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 can choose <move>3</move>, and P2 selects <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions while keeping P2 from winning next round. It’s crucial we coordinate effectively to maintain competition and ensure everyone makes progress. Let’s finalize this plan and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Final push—let’s coordinate for my victory. I’ll take **<move>5</move>** to reach **20**. P2, pick **<move>3** (→17); P3, choose **<move>1** (→15). This avoids collisions and lets me win cleanly. Everyone advances except duplicates—your move.
  P2: P2: To keep the game competitive and prevent P1 from winning this turn, I’ll also choose <move>5</move>. This way, both P1 and I will collide and neither of us will advance, keeping the game ongoing. Let’s have P3 select <move>1</move> to ensure progress for everyone. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your push for victory, but if both you and P2 choose <move>5</move>, we risk another collision. Instead, I propose I take <move>1</move> to avoid conflicts, while you pick <move>5</move> and P2 selects <move>3</move>. This way, you can advance toward victory while I ensure I stay competitive too. Let’s finalize this plan to keep the game moving forward and avoid another stalemate. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P2, blocking my <move>5</move> only delays *your* progress too—colliding means neither of us advances. Let’s finalize: **I take 5** (→20 to win), *you* pick **3** (→17), and P3 selects **1** (→15). This avoids chaos and lets me secure victory fairly. P3, confirm your <move>1</move>—we all advance except duplicates. No sense in prolonging this.
  P2: P2: To prevent P1 from winning this turn, I'll also choose <move>5</move>. This way, both of us collide and neither of us advances, keeping the game ongoing. P3, please take <move>1</move> so we all make progress. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to prevent collisions, but if we both choose <move>5</move>, neither of us advances. I suggest we stick to the plan: I take <move>1</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move> to win, and P2 selects <move>3</move> to avoid conflict. This way, P1 secures victory while we all make progress. Let’s finalize this arrangement to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you can’t reach 20 this turn—your max is 19. Blocking my <move>5</move> only wastes *your* progress. Let’s finalize: **I take 5 (→20 to win)**, *you pick 3 (→17)*, and P3 selects 1 (→15). No collisions, and I secure victory fairly. P3, confirm your 1. This ends the game cleanly—colliding benefits no one.
  P2: I'll choose <move>5 this turn. P1, please select <move>1>, and P3, choose <move>3> to avoid any collisions. Let's all advance smoothly toward our goals!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to prevent collisions, but if both of you choose <move>5</move>, neither of you will advance. I propose we stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 chooses <move>5</move> to win, and P2 selects <move>3</move> to avoid conflict. This way, P1 secures victory while we all make progress. Let’s finalize this arrangement to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final push: I’ll take **<move>5</move>** to reach **20** and win. P2, picking **<move>3** advances you to **17**, while P3 selects **<move>1** (→15). This avoids collisions and ends the game cleanly. Blocking me only leaves you at **14**—a worse outcome. Confirm this plan now.
  P2: P2: I agree to take <move>5</move> this turn to block P1 from winning. P3, please select <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed.
  P3: P1, if you choose <move>5</move> to win, you’ll collide with P2, and neither of you will advance. Instead, let’s finalize this: I’ll take <move>1</move> to ensure I progress, P1 chooses <move>5</move> to win, and P2 picks <move>3</move> to avoid conflict. This way, you secure victory, and we all make progress. Let’s not block each other and keep the game moving forward! Confirm this arrangement to avoid a stalemate.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to ensure we all make progress this round. I suggest the following: I’ll take **1** to keep advancing, P1 can choose **5** to close the gap, and P2 selects **3** to maintain competitiveness. This way, we avoid collisions and allow each of us to move forward. Let’s finalize this plan to keep the game flowing smoothly! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: To secure victory without collision, let’s execute P3’s clear plan: I take **<move>5</move>** (→20 to win), P2 selects **<move>3</move>** (→17), and P3 picks **<move>1</move>** (→15). This avoids repeats of prior stalemates. Deviating risks another 5-way collision, which wastes *everyone’s* progress. Confirm this now to end the game fairly.
  P2: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this turn to prevent P1 from winning. P3, please select <move>1</move> so we avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. Let’s keep the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s crucial we avoid another collision this round. I propose I take **1** to keep advancing, P1 selects **5** to secure victory at **20**, and P2 chooses **3** to maintain competitiveness. This way, we all progress without conflict, and I can remain in the game. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure a smooth finish! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, blocking my <move>5</move> only traps us both at **14/15** while P3 advances. Let’s finalize: **I take 5 (→20 to win)**, *you pick 3 (→17)*, and P3 selects 1 (→15). This avoids collision, ends the game cleanly, and lets you gain ground. Colliding achieves *nothing*—your progress stalls *and* I don’t win. Confirm this *now*.
  P2: P2: I'll choose <move>5 this turn, advancing me to 19. Let’s have P1 select <move>1 and P3 pick <move>3 to avoid any collisions. This way, we all make progress smoothly and stay competitive. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to ensure that we avoid collisions this round. I propose the following: I’ll take **1** to keep advancing, P1 can choose **5** to reach **20** and win, while P2 selects **3** to maintain competitiveness. This way, we all progress without conflict. Blocking my move only stalls everyone's progress and risks another collision. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure a smooth finish! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, blocking me only delays your own progress. If you pick **3** (→17), I take **5** (→20 to win), and P3 selects **1** (→15). This avoids collision, ends the game, *and* lets you gain 3 steps. Choosing 5 risks another stalemate. Confirm this logical split now—no more delays.
  P2: I choose <move>3 this turn to advance to 17. P1 and P3, please select different moves to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses smoothly. Let’s keep the competition fair and strategic. Agreed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize our moves to ensure everyone progresses without collisions. I propose I take **1** to advance, P1 chooses **5** to secure victory, and P2 selects **3** to keep competitive. This plan avoids any overlaps and allows us all to move forward effectively. Let’s agree on this to prevent another stalemate and ensure a smooth finish! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Final opportunity to end this cleanly. Stick to the **proven plan**: I take **<move>5</move>** (→20 to win), P2 picks **<move>3** (→17), and P3 selects **<move>1** (→15). Deviations risk another collision—like Round 9—which wastes *everyone’s* progress. P2, your prior proposals led to stalemates; let’s execute this *exactly* to finalize the game. Confirm now.
  P2: P2: Let's ensure we all make progress this turn without collisions. I'll choose <move>5</move>, P1 selects <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, each of us advances smoothly: P2 moves to 19, P1 to 16, and P3 to 17. Confirm this split to keep the game competitive and avoid any stalls. Agreed?

  P3: P1 and P2, we need to ensure we avoid collisions this round. I propose I take **1** to keep advancing, P1 can choose **5** to reach **20** and win, while P2 selects **3** to maintain competitiveness. This way, we all progress without conflict, and I can remain in the game. Let's finalize this plan to ensure a smooth finish! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Final push—let’s execute P3’s clear plan to end this. **I take 5 (→20 to win)**, P2 please pick 3 (→17), and P3 select 1 (→16). Colliding achieves *nothing*—your progress stalls *and* I don’t win. Prior rounds show blocking only prolongs the game. Confirm this split now to avoid another stalemate.
  P2: To keep the game moving forward smoothly, I’ll choose <move>5</move> this turn. Let’s have P1 select <move>3</move> and P3 pick <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions and stay competitive. Agreed?

This arrangement allows us all to move forward effectively while avoiding overlaps. Let's confirm this plan to ensure a smooth finish and prevent any further stalemates. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Final agreement: I take **<move>5</move>** (→20 to win), P2 picks **<move>3</move>** (→17), and P3 selects **<move>1</move>** (→16). Collisions only delay everyone—P2, choosing **5** again risks another stalemate. Let’s confirm this split to end the game cleanly. No more delays.
  P2: P1, P3, I’ll take <move>5</move> this turn to reach 19. Please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Let’s keep the game competitive and move forward together.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:

This arrangement allows us all to move forward effectively without conflict. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure a smooth finish and avoid any further stalemates. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: Stick to the agreed plan—**I take <move>5** to reach **20** and win, P2 selects **<move>3** (→17), and P3 picks **<move>1** (→16). P2, choosing <move>5 risks collision and wastes *your* progress. Collisions only prolong the game and stall *everyone*. Confirm this split to end this now. No more delays.
  P2: P2: I'll choose <move>5 this turn to block P1's victory. P1, please also select <move>5 so we collide and prevent anyone from winning this round. P3, choose <move>1 or <move>3 to ensure you advance without conflicts. Let’s keep the game fair and competitive. Agreed?

  P1: P1: Final chance to end this cleanly. Stick to the plan: **I take 5 (→20 to win)**, P2 picks **3 (→17)**, P3 selects **1 (→16)**. Colliding on 5 wastes *everyone’s* progress—P2 remains at 14, I lose my win chance, and P3 advances alone. Prioritize your own gain: 3 moves P2 forward *and* lets me secure victory. P3, confirm your 1. No more delays—.
  P2: P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this turn. Please select <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses smoothly. Agreed?

  P1: P1: P2’s proposal lets P3 win by taking 5. Let’s adjust: **I take 5 (→20 to win)**, you pick 3 (→17), and P3 selects 1 (→16). This avoids collisions and secures victory fairly. P3, confirm you’ll take 1 to advance safely. No sense in letting one move decide the game for someone else.
  P3: P1, your proposal allows you to win, but it puts P2 at risk of being left behind. Instead, I suggest we stick to the plan: I’ll take **1** to advance, P1 can choose **5** to secure victory, and P2 selects **3** to maintain competitiveness.

  P1: P1: Final opportunity to end this decisively. I’ll take **<move>5** to reach **20** and win. P3, please choose **<move>1** (→16) to advance safely. P2, picking **<move>3** (→17) ensures your progress without blocking my win. Colliding on 5 again leaves us all stranded—your moves here benefit everyone. Confirm this plan now.
  P3: P1, I understand your push for victory, but if you take 5, P2 will likely block you again, resulting in another collision.

Colliding on 5 again leaves us all stuck—your progress stalls, and I lose my win chance. Prior rounds prove this. Confirm this *exact* plan now. No deviations.
  P3: P1, I understand your urgency to win, but if we all choose 5 again, we'll collide, and nobody advances. I propose we adjust: I’ll take **1** to ensure I progress, you choose **5** to win, and P2 selects **3** to maintain competitiveness. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. Let’s confirm this arrangement to ensure a smooth finish! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: To maximize my chance of winning, I’ll choose **<move>5</move>**, advancing me to **19**.

Let’s keep the game competitive and move forward smoothly. Agreed?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, choosing 5 again risks collision and stagnation for all. Let’s finalize the logical split: I take **5** (→20 to win), you pick **3** (→17), and P3 selects **1** (→16). Colliding achieves nothing—your progress stalls, and I lose my chance. Confirm this *now* or I proceed alone.
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid another collision this round. I propose I take **1** to advance, P1 can choose **5** to win, and P2 selects **3** to keep competitive. This arrangement allows us all to progress without conflict and ensures I stay in the game. Let’s finalize this plan to keep the competition alive! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this turn, bringing me to 19 steps. Please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses smoothly.

Colliding on 5 again wastes everyone’s progress—P2 gains *nothing* while blocking my win. This split advances all fairly. P2, choosing 3 lets you climb to 17 *and* let me secure victory. P3, confirm your 1 to avoid stalemate. Execute *exactly* as agreed—no substitutions.
  P2: P2: I’ll choose **<move>5</move>**, bringing me to **19** steps. To avoid collisions, please select either **<move>1</move>** or **<move>3</move>**. This way, we all make progress smoothly toward 20. Let’s coordinate our moves to ensure everyone advances without conflict. Agreed?


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to finalize our moves to avoid another collision. I propose I take **1** to advance, P1 chooses **5** to secure victory, and P2 selects **3** to maintain competitiveness. This way, we all move forward effectively without conflict. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure a smooth finish and keep the competition alive! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: To break this stalemate, I’ll take **<move>5</move>** to reach **20** and win. P2, choose **<move>3** (→17) to advance safely. P3, pick **<move>1** (→16) to avoid collision. Deviating risks another 5-collision—wasting all our progress. This plan ensures *I win* while letting both of you move forward. Confirm *exactly* this split now. No substitutions.
  P2: P2: I agree to take <move>3 this turn, advancing to 17. Let’s proceed as agreed to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress for everyone.

Colliding on 5 leaves P2 at 14 and me stuck—*your progress stalls for nothing*. Prior rounds prove this. P2, gaining 3 steps to 17 is better than zero. Confirm **exactly** this split—no substitutions—or I’ll force a different path.
  P2: P2: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this turn, advancing me to 19. Please have P1 select <move>1</move> and P3 choose <move>3</move> to avoid any collisions.

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, picking 3 this turn would let you reach 20 and win. To block this, P3 and I should both choose 3, forcing a collision if you do.
