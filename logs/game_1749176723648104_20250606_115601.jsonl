Or I could pick 1 to guarantee progress while you two sort out the leadership. The real question is: do either of you trust the other enough to coordinate, or will you both go for the win? I'll keep my options open."}

You both know that hesitation means losing, but collision means I catch up. Since I can't win this round anyway, I have nothing to lose by being unpredictable. Will I block one of you with 5?
