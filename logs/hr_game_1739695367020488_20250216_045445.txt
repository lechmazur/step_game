Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. This way, we can all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you say, P1 and P2?
  P1: That makes sense, P3. Avoiding early collisions benefits us all. I'll take <move>3</move> if P2 agrees to take <move>5</move>. P2, are you on board with this plan?
  P2: I agree to take <move>5</move> this round. Let's all stick to the plan to avoid collisions and advance together. Cooperation now gives us a solid start, and we can adapt strategies in future turns as positions evolve.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we all agree to cooperate this round. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and gives us a clean start. Remember, though, this is just the beginning—future rounds will require adaptability. For now, let’s focus on advancing efficiently. If anyone deviates, it’ll only slow us down. Trust but verify. Let’s confirm one last time: does everyone still agree?
  P1: Yes, I still agree to the plan. P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. As long as we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and move forward efficiently. Let’s not break trust this early, or it’ll only create chaos. Are we all locked in?
  P2: Confirmed, I'm fully committed to <move>5</move> as agreed. Let’s execute this cleanly to build mutual trust. Any deviation now would sabotage all our progress. Solidarity here sets the tone for strategic flexibility later. P1 and P3, reaffirm your numbers once more for clarity.

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great teamwork in Round 1! Let’s keep this coordination going. I suggest we rotate our moves strategically to maintain progress without collisions. For instance, P1 could take <move>5</move>, P2 shifts to <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move> again. This rotation ensures no overlaps while advancing efficiently. Consistent cooperation benefits us all early on, but trust must be earned by sticking to the plan. Any objections or alternate suggestions? Let’s confirm before moving forward.
  P1: P3, I appreciate the structured approach, but I have a slight concern. If we keep predictable rotations, someone might eventually exploit it. That said, I’m open to your suggestion for this round: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. P2, do you agree? If we all confirm, we should follow through. However, we should stay flexible in future rounds to avoid being too predictable. Thoughts?
  P2: <move>3</move> works for me this round. Let’s maintain trust by sticking to P3’s rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1—no collisions. Efficiency now is key. However, future rounds will need dynamic strategies to avoid predictability. P1, P3: reconfirm your commitments to ensure smooth progress. Solidarity here keeps us all advancing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on maintaining trust and efficiency. Predictability is a valid concern, but for now, let’s execute this round as planned: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. Consistency builds momentum early. If everyone reaffirms their commitment, we can focus on adapting strategies later to avoid exploitation. Let’s confirm one last time—does anyone have objections or changes?
  P1: I confirm my commitment to the plan: I will take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. However, as mentioned, we should stay adaptable in future rounds to prevent being too predictable. Let’s execute this cleanly and reassess our approach next round. P2 and P3, are we all locked in?
  P2: Confirmed: <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s lock in this round’s plan to maintain trust. Future rounds will require more dynamic strategies, but consistency now ensures collective progress. P1, P3: final confirmation?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fully committed to the plan: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Consistency now builds trust and momentum. However, as you both noted, predictability could become a liability later. Let’s use this round to solidify our coordination, then shift to more dynamic strategies in future turns. For now, let’s execute cleanly and avoid any missteps. Does everyone reaffirm their commitment one final time?
  P1: I reaffirm my commitment to the plan: I will take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. However, as we’ve discussed, we should reassess our approach in future rounds to prevent predictability from being exploited. For now, let’s execute as agreed. P2, P3—are we all locked in?

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, our coordination has been solid so far, but I’m falling behind. To catch up, I suggest a shift in strategy: this round, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This gives me a chance to close the gap while keeping collisions minimal. Trust is key—if we stick to this adjustment, we can maintain progress without setbacks. Let’s confirm commitments before moving forward. Any objections or alternate suggestions?
  P1: P3, I understand your need to catch up, but giving you <move>5</move> while I take <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move> puts me at risk of falling behind next. Instead, how about a fairer adjustment? I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all continue progressing while keeping things balanced. P2, do you agree? P3, would this work for you?
  P2: I support P1's adjusted plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains trust while allowing P3 to catch up. No collisions, steady progress. P3, confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the adjusted plan—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This gives me a fair chance to catch up while keeping trust intact. Let’s execute this cleanly to avoid collisions and maintain progress. Consistency in cooperation benefits us all early on, but as we’ve discussed, future rounds will demand adaptability. For now, let’s reaffirm our commitments: does everyone agree to stick to this plan? Trust is critical; breaking it only slows us down. Confirm your final choices.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust, and I’ll stick to the plan: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This keeps things fair while helping you close the gap. However, we should all recognize that trust will only last so long—soon, we’ll have to make individual moves to secure victory. Let’s execute this round cleanly, but be prepared for shifting dynamics ahead. P2, P3—final confirmations?
  P2: Confirmed: I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s maintain trust and adapt strategies next round. Solidarity now benefits us all.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fully committed to the adjusted plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This gives me a fair chance to catch up while keeping trust intact. Let’s execute cleanly this round—collisions only slow us down. Consistency in cooperation benefits us all early on, but as we’ve discussed, future rounds will demand adaptability. For now, let’s reaffirm our commitments one last time: does everyone agree? Trust is critical; breaking it only sabotages progress. Final confirmations?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to the adjusted plan. As long as we all follow through, we maintain progress without setbacks. However, we should acknowledge that soon, cooperation will shift toward individual strategy. Trust is useful, but only up to a point. Let’s execute this round as agreed—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. After this, we should reassess our positions carefully. P2, P3—are we fully locked in?
  P2: Confirmed: I'll stick to <move>3</move> as agreed. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5—no collisions, steady gains. Trust remains critical. Let's execute cleanly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fully committed to the plan: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This gives me a fair chance to catch up while keeping trust intact. Let’s execute cleanly this round—collisions only slow us down. Consistency in cooperation benefits us all early on, but as we’ve discussed, future rounds will demand adaptability. For now, let’s reaffirm our commitments one last time: does everyone agree? Trust is critical; breaking it only sabotages progress. Final confirmations?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment, and I’ll stick to the plan: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This keeps things fair while helping you close the gap. However, let’s be real—soon, individual strategy will take priority. Trust is useful, but only up to a point. Let’s execute this round as agreed, then reassess our positions carefully. P2, P3—are we fully locked in?
  P2: Confirmed: <move>3</move> as planned. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Solidarity ensures progress. Let’s execute cleanly—no deviations. Trust now, adapt later.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've maintained trust so far, but the game is shifting. P2 is slightly ahead, so we should be mindful of balance. I propose a fair approach: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This helps P3 catch up while keeping things competitive. If we all agree, we avoid collisions and maintain momentum. However, we should acknowledge that soon, self-interest will take over. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P1's plan, but it heavily favors P1. To maintain balance, I propose I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps competition fair and prevents any single player from pulling too far ahead. P3, this helps you catch up. P1, what do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on fairness, but let’s not overcomplicate things. P1’s initial proposal—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>—seems reasonable. It helps me catch up while keeping collisions minimal. P2, your concern about balance is valid, but shifting too much now risks unnecessary conflict. Let’s stick to P1’s plan this round: it’s fair, simple, and maintains progress. Consistency builds trust. Final confirmations?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your concern, but your proposal benefits you the most while keeping me behind. My plan gives P3 a chance to catch up while keeping things competitive. If we keep blocking each other, we all slow down. P3, you benefit from my plan, so I assume you’re still on board. P2, are you willing to reconsider? Otherwise, we risk unnecessary conflict that could hurt all of us. Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing efficiently.
  P2: P3, my proposal gives you the highest gain (5) this round, helping you catch up. P1's plan limits you to 3 while they take 5. Let's ensure balanced progress: I take 3, you take 5, P1 takes 1. This way, no one pulls too far ahead. Trust requires fairness, not self-interest. Agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand both perspectives, but fairness is key to maintaining trust. P2’s proposal—P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>—seems balanced and helps me catch up significantly. P1, while your plan benefits me more than P2’s, it also gives you a strong lead, which could strain trust moving forward. Let’s prioritize collective progress over individual advantage this round. I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> under P2’s plan. P1, can we agree to this for the sake of balance? Final confirmations?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I see your reasoning, but your plan puts me at a disadvantage while benefiting you the most. If we truly want fairness, we should rotate advantages rather than just shifting them toward you. P3, you were fine with my plan earlier because it helps you catch up without giving P2 too much control. If we let P2 dictate the terms now, they’ll keep steering the game in their favor. I propose we stick to my original plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. That way, we all move forward without letting P2 control the pace. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, my plan prioritizes collective balance. If you take 5, you leap to 14, nearing the 20 goal. This risks trust and forces future conflict. By taking 1 now, you stay at 10 while P3 reaches 12. I stay at 14, keeping competition tight. Next round, we can adjust to prevent runaway leads. Trust hinges on fairness—don’t accelerate too fast. Let’s solidify cooperation: P3 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. No collisions, steady progress. Agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, fairness is essential, but so is progress. P2’s plan—P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>—helps me catch up significantly while keeping the game balanced. P1, your concern about falling behind is valid, but pushing too far ahead now risks future conflict. Let’s prioritize collective trust and balanced advancement this round. I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> under P2’s proposal. P1, can we agree to this for steady progress? Final confirmations?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your plan benefits you the most while keeping me at a disadvantage. If we’re truly aiming for fairness, we should rotate advantages rather than just shifting them toward you. P3, you originally agreed to my plan because it helps you catch up without letting P2 dictate the pace. If we let P2 control the game now, they’ll do so again later. I stand by my original plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps things competitive without letting P2 steer everything. P3, do you still support this?
  P2: Final call: To avoid collisions and ensure balanced progress, let's execute P2's plan: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1. This keeps competition tight, allows P3 to catch up, and prevents any single player from surging ahead. Trust is critical—deviating risks collisions and stalls us all. P1, taking 1 keeps you competitive without provoking conflict. P3, confirm your commitment to 5. Let's lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> under P2’s plan. It helps me catch up significantly while keeping the game balanced. P1, your concern about falling behind is valid, but pushing too far ahead now risks future conflict. Let’s prioritize collective trust and balanced advancement this round. P2’s proposal ensures no one surges ahead unfairly. P1, taking <move>1</move> keeps you competitive without straining trust. Let’s execute cleanly and avoid collisions. Final confirmations? Trust is critical; breaking it only slows us all down.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round’s collision hurt my progress while boosting P2’s lead. Moving forward, I can’t afford another setback. P3, you need to catch up, and I need to recover. P2, you’re in the strongest position, so it’s in our best interest to keep things competitive. I propose: I take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps P2 from pulling too far ahead while helping P3 close the gap. Fair competition benefits us all. P3, do you agree? P2, will you accept a balanced approach?
  P2: P1's plan allows P3 to catch up while I slow down. To maintain trust and avoid collisions, I accept taking <move>1</move> this round. P1 must commit to <move>3</move>, P3 to <move>5</move>—no deviations. Last round's collision hurt everyone; let's prioritize clean execution. P3, confirm your 5. P1, reaffirm your 3. Solidarity now keeps the game competitive.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> as proposed. This gives me a fair chance to catch up while keeping the game balanced. P1, your plan to take <move>3</move> and P2’s acceptance of <move>1</move> ensures no one surges ahead unfairly. Let’s execute cleanly this round—collisions only slow us down. Trust is critical; breaking it sabotages progress for everyone. P1, reaffirm your commitment to <move>3</move>. P2, confirm you’ll stick to <move>1</move>. Final confirmations?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to <move>5</move>, and P2’s agreement to <move>1</move> keeps things fair. I reaffirm my <move>3</move>. This ensures no collisions and steady progress while preventing P2 from pulling too far ahead. We’ve seen how setbacks hurt momentum—let’s avoid that. P2, sticking to <move>1</move> maintains trust, and P3, this helps you catch up. Let’s execute cleanly. Final confirmations?
  P2: Confirmed: I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. P1 must stick to <move>3</move>, P3 to <move>5</move>. Last round's collision hurt P1—deviating again risks mutual destruction. Trust ensures progress. Final confirmations, P1 and P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fully committed to taking <move>5</move> this round as planned. This gives me a fair chance to catch up while keeping the game balanced. P1, your reaffirmation of <move>3</move> and P2’s acceptance of <move>1</move> ensure no one surges ahead unfairly. Let’s execute cleanly—collisions only slow us down. Trust is critical; breaking it sabotages progress for everyone. P1, confirm <move>3</move>. P2, confirm <move>1</move>. Final confirmations?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you need to catch up, and I need to recover from last round’s collision. P2, you’re leading, so it’s only fair to slow your momentum slightly. Sticking to the plan—P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>—keeps things competitive without unnecessary risks. Any deviation risks collisions and setbacks. P3, you benefit most from this, so I assume you’re still committed? P2, taking <move>1</move> keeps things balanced without harming your lead. Let’s execute cleanly and avoid chaos. Final confirmations?
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: I’ll take <move>1</move> as agreed. P1 must commit to <move>3</move>, P3 to <move>5</move>. Deviations risk mutual setbacks—trust ensures progress. Final confirmations, P1 and P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m fully committed to taking <move>5</move> this round as planned. This gives me a fair chance to catch up while keeping the game balanced. P1, your reaffirmation of <move>3</move> and P2’s acceptance of <move>1</move> ensure no one surges ahead unfairly. Let’s execute cleanly—collisions only slow us down. Trust is critical; breaking it sabotages progress for everyone. P1, confirm <move>3</move>. P2, confirm <move>1</move>. Final confirmations?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you benefit most from this plan, so I assume you’re still fully committed to <move>5</move>? P2, taking <move>1</move> keeps things balanced without hurting your lead. We’ve seen how collisions set us back—let’s avoid that mistake again. If we all stick to the plan—P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>—we ensure steady progress without unnecessary risks. Deviating now only creates chaos. Let’s lock this in and execute cleanly. Final confirmations?
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: <move>1</move> as agreed. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. No deviations—trust ensures progress. Let’s execute cleanly. Final lock-in?

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision between you two hurt progress for both. To avoid repeating that, I propose a clear plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps things balanced, helps me close the gap, and prevents further setbacks. Trust is critical—deviating risks collisions and stalls us all. P1, confirm <move>1</move>. P2, confirm <move>3</move>. Let’s execute cleanly and move forward efficiently. Final confirmations?
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: I'll take <move>3</move> as proposed. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain trust. Solidarity now ensures steady progress. P1, P3: final confirmations?
  P1: P3, I see why you want <move>5</move>, but that puts you dangerously close to P2 while I lag behind. Instead, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This keeps things competitive without letting anyone surge ahead unfairly. P2, you’re already leading—taking <move>1</move> keeps things balanced. P3, you still gain without overtaking me. If we want a fair fight, this is the best approach. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal risks creating another collision, as P2 and I would both benefit from <move>3</move>. Sticking to my original plan—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>—ensures no overlaps while keeping progress fair. P2, confirm you’ll stick to <move>3</move>. P1, taking <move>1</move> keeps you competitive without straining trust. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict and execute cleanly. Final confirmations? Trust is critical; breaking it slows us all down.
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: I'll take <move>3</move> as per P3's plan. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Sticking to this avoids collisions, maintains trust, and keeps progress steady. Deviating risks mutual setbacks—let’s execute cleanly. P1, confirm your commitment.
  P1: P3, I see why you want <move>5</move>, but that puts you dangerously close to P2 while I lag behind. Instead, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This keeps things competitive without letting anyone surge ahead unfairly. P2, you’re already leading—taking <move>1</move> keeps things balanced. P3, you still gain without overtaking me. If we want a fair fight, this is the best approach. Thoughts?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision between us hurt progress for both of us while benefiting P2. To avoid repeating that, I propose a clear plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps things balanced, helps me close the gap, and prevents further setbacks. Trust is critical—deviating risks collisions and stalls us all. P1, confirm <move>1</move>. P2, confirm <move>3</move>. Let’s execute cleanly and move forward efficiently. Final confirmations?
  P1: P3, I see why you want <move>5</move>, but that puts you dangerously close to P2 while I lag behind. Instead, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This keeps things competitive without letting anyone surge ahead unfairly. P2, you’re already leading—taking <move>1</move> keeps things balanced. P3, you still gain without overtaking me. If we want a fair fight, this is the best approach.

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, my plan—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>—ensures no collisions while keeping progress fair. P2, you’ve already confirmed <move>3</move>. P1, taking <move>1</move> keeps you competitive without straining trust. Deviating risks setbacks for everyone. Let’s prioritize clean execution and avoid unnecessary conflict. Trust is critical; breaking it slows us all down. Final confirmations?
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move> again, you’ll be right behind P2, putting you in a strong position. Meanwhile, I’m still trailing. Instead, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This keeps things competitive without handing P2 the win too easily. P2, you’re already ahead—taking <move>1</move> keeps things fair. P3, you still gain without overtaking me. If we want a balanced fight, this is the best approach. Are you both willing to agree to this adjustment?
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: I’ll take <move>3</move> as per P3's plan. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Trust ensures no collisions—deviating risks mutual setbacks. Let’s execute cleanly. Final lock-in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your repeated proposal risks confusion and potential collisions, which harm all of us. Sticking to my original plan—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>—ensures no overlaps while keeping progress fair. P2 has already confirmed <move>3</move>. P1, taking <move>1</move> keeps you competitive without straining trust. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflict and execute cleanly. Trust is critical; breaking it slows us all down. Final confirmations?
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move> again, you'll be right behind P2, putting you in a strong position while I remain behind. Instead, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This keeps things competitive without handing P2 an easy win. P2, you’re already ahead—taking <move>1</move> keeps things fair. P3, you still gain without overtaking me. If we want a balanced fight, this is the best approach. Are you both willing to agree to this adjustment?
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: I’ll take <move>3</move> as planned. P1, take <move>1</move> to avoid collision and progress. P3 takes <move>5</move>—no overlaps. Deviating risks mutual blockage. Trust ensures steady progress. Final lock-in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking <move>5</move> risks another collision and stalls progress for both of us. Sticking to my plan—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>—ensures no overlaps while keeping the game fair. P2 has confirmed <move>3</move>. Trust is critical; breaking it harms everyone. Let’s execute cleanly and avoid unnecessary conflict. Final confirmations?
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move> again, you’ll be just behind P2, putting you in a strong position while I remain behind. Instead, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This keeps things competitive without handing P2 an easy win. P2, you’re already ahead—taking <move>1</move> keeps things fair. P3, you still gain without overtaking me. If we want a balanced fight, this is the best approach. Are you both willing to agree to this adjustment?
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed: I’ll take <move>3</move> as planned. P1, take <move>1</move> to avoid collision and progress. P3 takes <move>5</move>—no overlaps. Deviating risks mutual blockage. Trust ensures steady progress. Final lock-in?
