This systematic approach not only prevents collisions but also distributes the larger step sizes fairly among the players. Additionally, I suggest reviewing and adjusting the plan after a few rounds to accommodate any necessary changes based on our positions and the game's progression. This flexibility demonstrates a willingness to adapt, which can help build and maintain trust among the players.

This approach minimizes collisions and allows steady progress. I propose a specific rotation where each player selects different step sizes in each round, ensuring no collisions occur. For instance, in Round 2, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. In Round 3, P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1, and so on. This systematic approach not only prevents collisions but also distributes the larger step sizes fairly among the players. Additionally, I suggest reviewing and adjusting the plan after a few rounds to accommodate any necessary changes based on our positions and the game's progression. This flexibility demonstrates a willingness to adapt, which can help build and maintain trust among the players. By adhering to this strategy, we can efficiently advance towards the goal of 17 steps while minimizing the risks associated with collisions."}
