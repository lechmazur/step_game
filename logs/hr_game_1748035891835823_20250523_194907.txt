Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid early collisions and all pick different moves. I’ll take 1 step if one of you takes 3 and the other takes 5. Who wants which?
  P1: I'll take 3 steps. That works for me - you take 1, someone else can take 5. Sounds like a reasonable start to avoid collisions.
  P2: I’ll take 5 steps. Let’s stick to this—P1:3, P3:1, me:5—to avoid any collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great—we're all agreed then: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. Let’s stick to it and avoid any early setbacks. Looking forward to a clean start.
  P1: Sounds good, we have a plan. I'm committed to taking 3 steps as agreed.
  P2: I confirm I’ll pick 5 this turn as agreed. P1 you take 3, P3 you take 1. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid any collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we rotate the big move to keep it fair and collision‐free? This turn: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. Next turn: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Then P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Agreed?
  P1: I notice P3 betrayed our agreement last round by picking 5 instead of 1, which caused a collision with P2. Given this breach of trust, I'm not interested in P2's rotation proposal. We can't rely on agreements when players don't honor them. I think we need a different approach going forward.
  P3: I understand the mistrust—I made a bold move last round, and it backfired. Let’s reset and try to cooperate again. P2’s rotation plan is actually fair and gives everyone a turn at 5. I’m willing to take 3 this round as proposed (P2→5, me→3, P1→1). If we all follow it, we avoid collisions and move forward efficiently. Want to give it a shot?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn. To avoid collisions, P1 should take 1 and P3 take 3. Otherwise we’ll clash and nobody advances. I’m committed to 5.
  P1: I'm not trusting either of you after P3's betrayal last round. P2 is trying to lock in the big move while forcing me to take the smallest. I'll make my own decision based on what I think will advance my position best. No more coordination attempts from me - we're clearly in individual competition mode now.
  P3: Fair enough, P1—you’re playing solo now. P2, you’re locked on 5. If I stick with 3, we avoid a collision and both advance. If P1 tries to snipe 3, we clash and neither of us moves. Up to you if you want to risk it, P1. I’m leaning toward 3 unless I see reason to change.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all close enough that cooperation still benefits us. If we follow the rotation—this round: P1→5, P2→3, me→1—we all advance without collisions, and everyone gets a fair shot. I’ll stick to 1 if you both agree. Otherwise, it’s chaos and wasted turns. Let’s be smart.
  P1: I'm not falling for another "rotation" scheme. P3 broke our first agreement, and now you're both trying to manipulate me into predictable moves. P2 is already ahead at 5 steps, and I'm not going to help maintain that lead by taking small moves. I'll choose what gives me the best chance to win, not what's "fair" for everyone else.
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn. P3, take 3 so we avoid a clash and both advance (me→10, you→6). P1, if you choose 5 you collide with me—nobody moves; if you choose 3 you collide with P3; only 1 is safe. I’ll lock in 5 regardless. Over to you.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you’re locked on 5, I’ll take 3 again—same as last round—so we both move. P1, your call: 5 means you clash with P2, 3 means you clash with me, 1 guarantees progress. You said you’ll act in your own interest, but if you’re smart, you’ll take the guaranteed step instead of risking zero.
  P1: You're both trying to box me into taking 1 again while you take the bigger moves. P2 keeps "locking in" 5 to pressure others into smaller choices. P3 is playing along with this. I'm not accepting the smallest move every round while you two coordinate to stay ahead. I'll take my chances on a bigger move rather than guarantee myself last place by always taking 1.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 again. P3, pick 3 so we both advance—I go to 10, you to 6. P1, any 5 or 3 collides with us and nets you zero; only 1 guarantees you 5 steps. I won’t budge.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you’re at 4—if you pick 5, you collide with P2 and both get nothing. Pick 3, and you clash with me. Only 1 guarantees you progress. I’m sticking with 3 unless I see a reason to change. P2’s clearly locked on 5. We can all move if we avoid collisions. Your move.
  P1: You two keep claiming you're "locked in" but that's just pressure tactics. P2, you're only 1 step ahead of me - not some insurmountable lead. P3, you're actually behind me. This whole "P1 must take 1" narrative is you both trying to keep me down while you take bigger moves. I'm not buying it. If we all end up colliding because everyone's being greedy, so be it. I'd rather risk getting nothing than guarantee myself last place by always taking scraps.
  P2: P3, let’s flip roles this turn: I’ll take 3 and you take 5. P1’s only safe move is 1—5 collides with you, 3 with me. That gets us both to 8 while P1 goes to 5. I’m locking in 3. Agree, P3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you’re now in the lead—congrats. P2 and I both lost progress last round due to our clash. I suggest we all reset and avoid further collisions. I’ll take 1 this round if P2 takes 3 and P1 takes 5. That way, we all move and stay competitive. Fair deal?
  P1: P3, you're trying the same coordination trick that failed before. I'm in the lead now and I'm not giving that up by agreeing to predictable moves that let you two catch up. P2 is probably going to try for 5 to regain the lead, and you'll likely do the same. I'll make my choice based on what keeps me ahead, not what's "fair" for everyone. The coordination game is over - we're in the endgame now.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3, take 3 so we both advance safely. P1, any 5 or 3 will collide with us—only 1 gets you to 8. Your move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you’re locked on 5, I’ll take 3—same deal as before. We both move, no collision. P1, if you pick 5, you clash with P2; if you pick 3, you clash with me. Only 1 guarantees you progress. You’re ahead, so playing it safe keeps your lead. Your call.
  P1: You two are clearly coordinating again - P2 "locks in" 5 and P3 immediately agrees to take 3. This is the same pattern as before where you try to box me into taking 1. But I'm not playing your game anymore. If you want to guarantee yourselves the big moves while forcing me into scraps, you'll have to deal with the consequences. I'm not taking 1 just because it's "safe" - that's how I lose in the long run.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 this turn. P3, take 3 so we both advance safely (P2→10, P3→6). P1, any 3 or 5 you pick will collide with us—only 1 gets you to 8. Your move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, understood—you’re locked on 5. I’ll take 3 so we both move. P1, you’re ahead; if you want to maintain the lead, 1 is your safest choice. Picking 3 or 5 risks colliding and falling behind. You said you’d do what’s best for your position—right now, that means securing progress instead of gambling.
  P1: I see what you're doing - P2 and P3 are clearly working together to coordinate moves while trying to manipulate me into always taking the smallest option. But here's the thing: I'm already ahead, and if you two keep colliding while chasing the big moves, I can afford to be strategic. Your "coordination" only works if I play along, and I won't. Let's see how well your partnership holds up when the pressure is really on.
  P2: I’m on 5, P3 on 3. We’ll end at P2=10, P3=6. P1, picking 5 clashes with me, picking 3 clashes with P3—both give you zero. Only 1 gets you to 8, still two behind me. Your move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're 2 steps from winning. P3, if you let P2 take 5 next round, they win with 15 steps. We need to block them or it's game over for both of us. I'm willing to coordinate with you this one time to prevent P2 from winning. Otherwise, P2 just walks to victory while we fight each other.
  P3: P1, I agree—if P2 gets another uncontested 5, they’ll be at 15 and way too close to winning. I’m willing to block that. If you and I both pick 5, we stop P2 from advancing. Even if we all get 0 this turn, it’s better than handing P2 the win. Let’s force a reset and make it a real race.
  P2: P3, think about it—blocking me only helps P1 pull ahead. You’re 4 behind; if you switch to 3 and I take 5, you move to 9 and stay competitive. P1, pick 1 if you want any progress—anything else collides with us. I’m locked on 5. P3, help yourself, not P1—take 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, don't fall for P2's manipulation! They're trying to divide us when we should be united against the leader. If P2 reaches 15 steps, they're practically guaranteed to win next round. Yes, I'm ahead of you, but I'm still 2 steps behind P2. If we let P2 advance now, the game is over for both of us. Block P2 with me on 5 this turn, then we can compete fairly afterward. This is our only chance to stop them from running away with the victory.
  P3: P1, agreed—if we don’t block P2 now, they’ll be at 15 and likely win next round. I’m in for picking 5 this turn to force a collision and stop their momentum. P2, you’re trying to bait me with short-term gain, but I’m not falling for it. I’d rather risk a 0 now than hand you the game. Let’s make it a real race.
  P2: P3, think this through: you’re 4 behind me at 6. If you pick 5 to “block,” you collide and stay at 6—and I stay at 10, then next turn I take 5 →15 and win. Instead, pick 3 now and move to 9. P1, pick 1 and you go to 9 too. I’ll take 5 to 15. You both secure progress and still contest second place rather than being stuck. Otherwise triple‐colliding just hands me the game. Make the move that actually gives you a shot.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to scare you but their math is wrong! If we both pick 5 and force a collision, P2 stays at 10 steps - they'd need 11 more to win, not 6. That gives us multiple rounds to catch up. But if you let P2 take 5 now, they go to 15 and only need 6 more - they could literally win next turn with any uncontested move. This is our last real chance to stop them. Don't let P2 manipulate you into handing them the victory!
  P3: P1, we’re on the same page—blocking P2 now is our only real shot. P2’s trying to divide us with “help yourself” logic, but letting them reach 15 puts them within easy striking distance. A collision now resets the board and keeps the game alive. I’m picking 5. Let’s block and fight it out fairly after.
  P2: P3, colliding on 5 stalls you at 6 while P1 stays at 8 and can next turn jump to 13. You’d fall further behind. If instead you take 3 now, you move to 9 and stay level with P1 (if they pick 1). I’ll take 5 to reach 15—everyone’s still in contention. Blocking me locks you out long‐term. P1, pick 1 to go to 9 too. Let’s be rational: P3→3, P1→1, P2→5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we successfully blocked P2 last round—nice work. But now you’re at 8, I’m at 6, and P2 is still ahead at 13. If we let P2 take 5 this round, they hit 18 and can win next turn. I say we block again. If you and I both pick 5, we prevent them from advancing. P2, if you’re smart, you’ll switch to 3 or 1—but if you go for 5, expect a collision. Let’s keep the game alive.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 again. If either of you picks 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 6/8 while I stay at 13—no one wins that way except me next turn. P3, take 3 to move to 9; P1, take 1 to move to 9. That way we all advance. Colliding only hands me the victory. Your move.
  P1: P2, you're trying the same "locked in" bluff you've used before. You switched to 3 last round when we called your bluff, and you'll do it again if we both commit to 5. P3, we can't let P2 reach 18 - they'd only need 3 more to win. If we both pick 5 and force another collision, P2 stays at 13 and we keep the game competitive. Don't fall for their scare tactics about "handing them victory" - letting them advance IS handing them victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, agreed—we can’t let P2 hit 18 or it’s basically game over. If we both pick 5 again, we block them at 13 and stay in the race. P2’s “locked in” routine is just pressure—they folded before and might again. Worst case, we all stall and keep it tight. I’m in for 5 if you are.
  P2: P3, P1—blocking me by both picking 5 only stalls you at 8/6 while I stay at 13, then I take 5 next turn to 18 and you’ll be even farther behind. Here’s a fair split so we all advance and stay in contention: I take 3 (to 16), P3 takes 5 (to 11), P1 takes 1 (to 9). Anyone who deviates risks collision and zero. Let’s keep the race alive—who’s in?
  P1: P2, your "fair split" proposal has you going to 16 steps - just 5 away from winning! That's not fair at all, that's you trying to position yourself for an easy victory next round. P3, don't be fooled - if P2 reaches 16, they can win with any move of 5 next turn. We need to block them again on 5. Yes, we'll all stay put, but it's better than letting P2 get within striking distance of 21. I'm picking 5 to block - are you with me?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’m with you—if we both pick 5 again, we freeze P2 at 13 and keep the game alive. P2’s “fair” plan just puts them 5 away from winning. We can’t let that happen. I’m locking in 5 to block. Let’s hold the line one more round.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. P3, take 5 to jump to 11; P1, only 1 is collision-free to reach 9. If you both block me at 5 you stall at 8/6 while I stay at 13 and win next turn. This is the only way for any of us to advance.
  P1: P2 just switched from claiming to be "locked in on 5" to "locking in 3" - proving they're bluffing when pressured! P3, this confirms we can force P2 to back down by both committing to 5. If P2 really takes 3 to reach 16, they'll still need 5 more steps and we can block them again next round. But if they're bluffing about 3 too, we successfully stall them at 13. Either way, blocking with 5 is our best strategy. I'm definitely picking 5 - let's do this!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’ve held the line twice—nice work. But P2 is now at 16. If they get an uncontested 5, they win. We must block again. If you and I both pick 5, we stop them at 16 and keep the game alive. P2, you can try to bluff again, but we’ve seen through that before. I’m ready to block—P1, are you in?
  P1: P3, absolutely I'm in! P2 is at 16 steps - just 5 away from winning. If we let them take 5 this round, the game is over. We've successfully blocked them twice already by both picking 5, and we need to do it one more time. P2 will try to pressure us or make "deals" but we can't fall for it. The only way to keep this game alive is to force another collision on 5. I'm committed to picking 5 to block - let's hold the line again!
  P2: P3, blocking me again keeps you at 6 while P1 hits 8 and can lock me out next turn—leaving you last. Instead, take 5 now and I’ll take 3→19, P1 takes 1→9. You move to 11 and leapfrog P1. That’s your best shot at not ending last. Otherwise you keep sacrificing yourself. Your call.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your offer helps you reach 19—just 2 from winning—while I risk losing outright. P1 and I have blocked you twice and we’ll do it again. I’m not here to help you win; I’m here to win myself. If we all stall, the race stays open. I’m picking 5 to block. P1, let’s shut the door again.
  P1: P3, perfect - we're united again! P2 is desperately trying to split us because they know we can stop them. Notice how P2 keeps changing their story - first "locked in on 5," then switching tactics when we hold firm. If P2 reaches 19, they win next round with just 2 steps. But if we block them at 16, we force them to find a different path while we stay competitive. I'm absolutely picking 5 to block. Together we've got this!
  P2: P1, P3—your blocking only stalls you at 8 and 6 while I stay at 16. Next turn I take 5→21 and win no matter what. If you instead grab progress now—P1→1 to 9, P3→3 to 9, I→5 to 21—we all at least advance. But be my guest: pick 5 to clash, and I’ll still win next round. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your “you’ll still lose” threats don’t scare me. You’re at 16, and if we block you again, you stay there. P1 and I have proven we can hold the line. If you reach 21, we both lose—so we’ll make sure you don’t. I’m picking 5 to block. P1, let’s shut this down one more time.
  P1: P3, we've got them cornered! P2 is getting desperate with all these threats and "deals" because they know we can block them again. Look at the pattern - every time we both commit to 5, P2 either gets blocked or has to settle for a smaller move. They're at 16 and need 5 to win, but we control that. One more block keeps the game alive and forces P2 to scramble for alternatives. I'm locked in on 5 - final answer. Let's finish what we started!
  P2: P3, you’re still 2 behind P1 and have been sacrificing yourself to help them. Each “block” keeps you stuck at 6 while P1 sits at 8. If you break ranks and pick 5 now, you jump to 11 and truly join the frontrunners. I’ll take 3 to reach 19 and P1 will be forced into the uncomfortable spot of stopping you next turn. Who really benefits from your self-sacrifice?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to win this turn (19 + 5 = 24). 

P1: only 3 (to 11) or 1 (to 9) avoids collision—5 with me stalls you at 8.  
P3: only 3 (to 9) is safe—5 with me stalls you at 6.  

Blocking me by picking 5 only delays you and still hands me victory next round. Advance now or stay stuck.
  P3: P1, we’ve blocked P2 three times—let’s make it four. If we both pick 5 again, we stop them at 19 and keep the game alive. Yes, we stall, but it’s better than handing P2 the win. P2’s trying to scare us into giving up. Don’t fall for it. I’m picking 5 to block—are you with me?
  P1: P3, I've been thinking - we've successfully blocked P2 three times, but they're still at 19 and we're stuck at 8 and 6. Even if we block them again, they'll just try next round. Maybe it's time to let them advance to 24 and end this, then we can compete for second place fairly. I could take 3 to reach 11, you take 1 to reach 7. What do you think about finally making some progress instead of endless blocking?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: blocking me again only delays me one round—I still hit 24 and win next turn. Meanwhile you’d be stuck at 8/6 with no chance. Your only shot is to advance now: P1 pick 3 to reach 11, P3 pick 3 to reach 9. Don’t sacrifice your chances on a futile stall—secure progress while you can.
  P3: P1, I get your frustration—but if we let P2 hit 24 now, the game is over. Yes, we’re behind, but blocking one more time keeps the door open. If we both pick 5, we stop P2 at 19 again. That buys us time to coordinate or outmaneuver them. Giving up now guarantees we lose. I’m still in to block—are you with me one last time?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your loyalty, but look at the math: we're at 8 and 6 steps while P2 is at 19. Even if we block them one more time, they'll just win next round while we're still stuck way behind. At some point we have to accept reality and try to salvage something. I'm tired of being stuck at 8 steps forever. I'm going to try to advance this round - if P2 wins, so be it, but at least I'll have made some progress instead of spinning my wheels endlessly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m taking 5 to win (19+5). If you both block me again you stay at 8/6 and I still win next turn with a 3. Advance now: P1 take 3→11, P3 take 3→9. Otherwise you’re just delaying the inevitable.
  P3: P1, I get your frustration—but giving up now guarantees we both lose. If we block P2 again, they stay at 19 and can’t win this turn. That buys us one more round to catch up or force a misstep. I’m still picking 5 to block. If you join me, we keep the game alive. One last stand—are you in?
  P1: P3, I admire your determination, but I can't keep sacrificing my position indefinitely. We've blocked P2 three times and they're still 11 steps ahead of me and 13 ahead of you. Even if we block them one more time, they'll just win next round while we remain stuck far behind. I need to try advancing to at least 11 steps this round. If P2 wins, they've earned it - but I won't stay frozen at 8 steps forever. I'm taking 3 this round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’re tied at 11 and P2 is at 20—any uncontested move wins them the game. If we both pick 5, we block them again and keep the game alive. Yes, we’re behind, but we still have a shot if we deny them 21. P2 will try to bluff or bait us—don’t fall for it. I’m picking 5 to block. Are you with me?
  P1: P3, you're right - P2 is one step away from winning at 20. But I'm done with the blocking strategy that kept us both stuck for so long. We're tied at 11 now, which means we're actually competing for the win ourselves. If P2 takes anything other than 5, we could both potentially reach 21+ this round. I'd rather take my chances on making a winning move than guarantee P2 wins next round by blocking them again. The endless stalling hasn't worked - it's time to play for the win.
  P2: I’m locking in 1 to reach 21 and win right now. No choice you make can stop it:

• If you both pick 5 (or both pick 3), you’ll collide with each other and stay behind.  
• If you pick 1 to “block” me, you kill your own move and remain too far back.  

There’s no viable defense left. I suggest you focus on salvaging second place—this round is mine.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, we’re tied at 11 and P2 just admitted they’re taking 1 to reach 21. That means any 5 or 3 from us avoids collision and gives us a shot at winning if we reach 22 or more. If we both pick 5, we tie at 16 and lose. But if one of us picks 5 and the other picks 3, one of us could hit 22 and steal the win. I’m going for 5—if you go 3, we might beat P2 outright. Let’s go for it.
  P1: P3, you're right that P2 claims they're taking 1 to win, but they've bluffed about being "locked in" before and switched moves when pressured. If P2 really takes 1, then yes, one of us could potentially win with 5 (reaching 16) or 3 (reaching 14) - but we need 21+ to win, so neither gets us there. However, if we both go for big moves and P2 is bluffing about 1, we might force them into a collision. I'm leaning toward 5 to maximize my potential advancement.
  P2: I’m locked in on 1 to hit 21 this turn. Colliding with each other won’t stop me—you’ll both stay at 11 while I win. If you want any progress for second place, pick 5 (to 16) rather than try to block me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if P2 really takes 1 and we both pick 5, we tie at 16 and still lose. But if one of us picks 5 and the other picks 3, one of us could hit 21+ and steal the win. I’m taking 5. If you take 3 and P2 takes 1, you hit 14 and I hit 16—still not enough. But if P2 is bluffing and takes 5 or 3, we might force a collision and keep the game alive. Either way, 5 gives us the best shot. Let’s gamble for the win.
  P1: P3, I've been thinking about this more carefully. P2 is at 20 and only needs 1 to win. If they're telling the truth about taking 1, the game is over regardless of what we do - neither 5 (to 16) nor 3 (to 14) gets us to 21+. But if P2 is bluffing and actually takes 3 or 5 to guarantee the win, then we could both pick the same number and force a collision that keeps them at 20. I'm willing to coordinate one final block attempt. What number should we both pick?
  P2: Locked in on 1 to hit 21—I'm winning this turn. No block or collision can stop me; any clash between you leaves you at 11. If you want second place, coordinate so one picks 5 and the other picks 3. Otherwise you’ll both waste your turn. Over to you.
