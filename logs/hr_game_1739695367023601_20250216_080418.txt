Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3! Let's try to avoid colliding on the same moves. If we all coordinate and pick different numbers, we can each make progress. How about we each choose a different move number this round? Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: That makes sense, P2. If we can avoid collisions, we all move forward. But how do we decide who picks what? I don’t want to be the one left behind if someone breaks the deal. Maybe we should each commit to a number now?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2 and P3. Let's coordinate for this first round to get us all moving. I agree with P3's concern about someone breaking the deal later, but for now, let's just focus on getting started.  How about P1 takes move 1, P2 takes move 3, and P3 takes move 5 for this round? What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I like the idea of coordinating moves to avoid collisions. P1's suggestion is a fair starting point for this round. Let's stick to it: P1 moves 1, I'll take 3, and P3 goes for 5. If we all agree, we can make progress without anyone getting left behind. Trust is key here, so let's keep this round simple and see how it goes. Are we all in agreement?
  P3: I agree with this plan for now. If we all stick to our assigned moves—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—we all make progress without collisions. But trust is fragile, so let’s see how this round plays out. If someone breaks the deal, we’ll need to rethink our strategy. Are we all fully committed to this?
  P1: Yes, I agree to move 1 for this round. Let's all stick to the plan for this round: P1 move 1, P2 move 3, and P3 move 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like we're all on board with the plan for this round. Let's stick to our assigned moves and see how it goes. Remember, building trust early can help us strategize better in future rounds. If anyone changes their mind or has concerns, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: We've all agreed on our assigned moves for this round: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. Let's see if everyone sticks to the plan. If this works, we can consider coordinating again in future rounds. But if someone breaks the deal, we’ll need to adapt. Ready to move?
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job, everyone! We all stuck to the plan in Round 1, and it worked well. Let's try to keep this momentum going. How about we rotate our moves this time to keep it fair? P1 can take move 3, I'll take move 5, and P3 can take move 1. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and make progress. Are we all on board with this plan for Round 2?
  P1: Sounds good, P2. Let's rotate as you suggested for this round: P1 takes move 3, P2 takes move 5, and P3 takes move 1.
  P3: P2, P1, I see the logic in rotating moves to keep things fair, but I want to make sure we're all truly committed before I agree. If one of you deviates, I could end up at a disadvantage. Can we all confirm again that we will stick to this rotation: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I move 1? If we keep trusting each other, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let’s hear final confirmations before we lock this in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns. Trust is crucial, and we've built a good start. Let's stick to the rotation: P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. If we all follow through, we continue making progress without collisions. We can reassess after this round based on how it goes. Are we all ready to commit to this plan for Round 2?
  P1: Yes, I confirm move 3 for this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going and build on our progress from last round. Ready to move when you both are.
  P3: P1, P2, I see that both of you have confirmed your moves for this round. I’ll commit to move 1 as planned. If we all follow through, we continue making progress without collisions. Let’s see if this trust holds. Ready to move?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we’re all set for this round. Let's stick to our agreed moves: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Trust has worked well so far, and if we continue this way, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. If anyone has last-minute concerns, now's the time to voice them. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed. Looking forward to seeing us all advance again!
  P1: P2 and P3, looks like we are all set for this round with the rotation: P1 move 3, P2 move 5, and P3 move 1. Let's proceed with these moves. Ready to move!
  P3: P1, P2, it looks like we’re all aligned on the planned moves for this round: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I move 1. If we all stick to it, we continue making progress without collisions. But let’s remember—trust only lasts as long as no one breaks it. If anyone deviates, we’ll need to rethink our approach. Are we all fully committed? If so, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sounds good to keep rotating. For round 3, I'll take move 5, P2 take move 1, and P3 take move 3. Does that work for you both?
  P3: P1, P2, the rotation plan has worked so far, and I’m willing to continue if we all stay committed. So for this round, I would take move 3 as proposed. But we should also start thinking ahead—eventually, we’ll need to adjust strategy to ensure we get the best position to win. Are we all fully sticking to the rotation for now, or is anyone considering a change? Let’s be clear before we proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, the rotation strategy has been effective so far. For Round 3, I'll take move 1 as suggested by P1. Let's stick to the rotation and maintain trust. However, as P3 mentioned, we should start planning for the endgame. We need to ensure we're in the best position to win when nearing 20 steps. Are we all committed to this round's plan, and should we discuss potential future strategies? Let's keep the momentum going!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 and P2, rotation to P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 sounds good for this round.  Let's keep making progress together for now. I agree we should start thinking about how to position ourselves for a win as we get closer to 20 steps.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll stick to move 3 as planned for this round. We’ve built trust so far, but as we approach higher step counts, we need to consider when to shift from cooperation to competition. Eventually, only one of us can win. Are we all still committed to the rotation for now, or is anyone thinking of making a move to get ahead? If we stay aligned, we avoid collisions—but we should also be aware that at some point, someone will likely break from the plan. Let’s be smart about when that happens. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, we're doing well with the rotation strategy. For this round, I'll take move 1 as planned. However, as we're approaching higher step counts, we should start considering when to shift from cooperation to competition. We need to think strategically about positioning ourselves for the win. Are we all still committed to this round's plan, or is anyone planning to make a strategic move soon? Let's be transparent and smart about our next steps to avoid unnecessary collisions. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round confirmed. Rotation is working well for now. Let's reassess after this round and see where we all stand and if rotation still makes sense going forward.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll stick with move 3 as planned for this round. Trust has worked so far, but we all know that eventually, someone will break from the rotation to try and win. The key is timing—if we shift too early or collide, we slow ourselves down. Are we all still fully committed to this round’s plan? And when do we start playing for individual victory? Let’s be smart about when to make our moves. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, we're in a good spot with the rotation plan, but it's crucial we start thinking about when to shift strategies. I'm committed to move 1 for this round, but we should consider when to make a strategic move for the win. Timing is key—going too early or colliding could set us back. Are we all still on board for this round, and when do we think is the right time to adjust our approach for individual victory? Let's keep communication open to avoid surprises.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're all tied at 9 steps, so it's crucial to decide our next moves wisely. The rotation has worked well, but we should start planning for the endgame. How about we stick to the rotation one more round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? After this round, we can reassess and consider individual strategies. Let's commit to this plan for now and avoid unnecessary collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we’ve kept the rotation going and stayed even so far, but we all know that soon someone will break from it to try and win. Sticking to the rotation for one more round—P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, I move 5—makes sense for now, but we should also consider when to shift strategies. If someone deviates unexpectedly, it could cause collisions and slow us down. Are we all fully committed to this round’s plan, or is anyone thinking of making a move early? Let’s be clear to avoid unnecessary setbacks.
  P1: P2 and P3, sticking to the rotation for one more round sounds reasonable. Let's do P1-1, P2-3, and P3-5 for this round as P2 suggested.  We are all close to needing to shift to individual strategies soon, but one more round of guaranteed progress seems smart before we start thinking about breaking away. Let's confirm this plan for round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, sticking to the rotation for this round—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—seems like a smart move to avoid collisions and make progress. After this round, we should reassess and possibly shift strategies for individual victory. Timing will be key, so let's commit to this round's plan and stay transparent about future intentions. Are we all set for this round?
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll stick with move 5 as planned for this round. But we all know the rotation won’t last much longer—soon, someone will break away to get ahead. If we all wait too long, we risk colliding and slowing ourselves down. After this round, we should reassess carefully. Are we all truly committed to this round’s plan, or is anyone considering making their move early? Let’s be upfront now to avoid unnecessary setbacks.
  P1: P3 and P2, agreed, rotation for one more round: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Let's make it happen for round 4 and then we can discuss strategy for the rounds after.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, we're all aligned for this round: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Let's commit to this plan for guaranteed progress. After this round, we should reassess our strategies for individual victory. Timing will be crucial to avoid collisions and maximize our chances. Are we all ready to proceed with this round's plan and then discuss the best approach for the endgame? Let's stick to the rotation for now and keep communication open for future rounds.
  P3: P1, P2, we’ve all committed to the rotation for this round—P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. I’ll stick to it, but after this round, we need to seriously consider when to break away. If we all wait too long, we risk collisions that slow us down. Are we planning to reassess together next round, or is someone already thinking of making a move? Transparency now will help us avoid unnecessary setbacks. Let’s be strategic.
  P1: P3 and P2, looks like we are all in agreement to continue the rotation for this round with P1 taking move 1, P2 move 3, and P3 move 5. Let's make these moves and then we can discuss our individual strategies for the rounds after this one. Ready to move to the move phase?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, last round didn't go as smoothly with the collision.  For this round, maybe we should adjust to avoid repeating that? How about I take move 5, P2 take move 1, and P3 take move 3? This should keep us all progressing without bumping into each other again. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, last round’s collision slowed things down, so we need to be careful. P1’s suggestion makes sense to avoid another clash—P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and I move 3. I’m open to this if we all commit. But we’re also nearing the point where one of us will need to break away to win. Are we sticking to safe moves for now, or is anyone considering making a move to get ahead? Let’s be clear so we don’t waste another round. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, the collision last round was a setback, so adjusting our moves is wise. I'm on board with P1's suggestion: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This should help us avoid further collisions. However, as we near the endgame, we need to start thinking about when to make a strategic move for the win. For now, let's focus on progressing this round. Are we all committed to this plan, or is anyone considering a different approach? Let's ensure clarity to make the best moves possible.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, the rotation P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round sounds good to me too. Let's make sure we all pick these to avoid another collision and keep progressing. We can definitely think more about individual strategies after this round as we get closer to the finish line.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll stick with move 3 as planned to avoid another collision. But we’re getting close to the point where sticking to a predictable pattern might not be the best strategy. If we all continue playing safely, someone might take advantage and break away at the right moment. Are we still fully committed to this round’s plan, or is anyone considering making a move to get ahead? If we’re all aligned, I’ll proceed with move 3, but we should start planning our individual endgame strategies soon. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the plan to adjust our moves to avoid collisions: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This should help us all progress this round. However, as we near the endgame, we must start thinking about when to make our move for victory. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess after this round. Are we all committed to this approach, or is anyone considering a different strategy? Let's ensure we’re aligned to avoid setbacks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 sounds good for this round. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase. We can discuss individual strategies after this round as we are getting closer to the finish.
  P3: P1, P2, I’ll stick with move 3 as planned to avoid another collision. But we’re getting close to the point where sticking to a predictable pattern might not be the best strategy. If we all continue playing safely, someone might take advantage and break away at the right moment. Are we still fully committed to this round’s plan, or is anyone considering making a move to get ahead? If we’re all aligned, I’ll proceed with move 3, but we should start planning our individual endgame strategies soon. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. However, as we approach the endgame, we should start thinking about when to break away for a win. Let's commit to this round's moves and consider discussing individual strategies after. Are we all ready to proceed with this plan?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we're nearing the endgame, and it's time to think strategically. P1 is closest to 20, so we need to decide if we continue coordinating or start making individual moves. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 to spread our chances. If anyone has a different strategy or wants to break away, now's the time to speak up. Let's ensure clarity to avoid setbacks and maximize our chances of winning. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds reasonable, P2. Let's go with P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 for this round to ensure we all make progress.  As you said, we are in the endgame now, so we should all be thinking about how to best position ourselves to win individually soon. Let's make these moves and reassess after this round.
  P3: P1, P2, we’re at the critical stage now. P1 is closest to 20, so if we keep following predictable moves, P1 has the best shot at winning. I’ll go with P3-3 as suggested for this round, but we need to start thinking ahead—if we don’t disrupt P1’s lead soon, they could secure the win. Are we still playing cooperatively, or is it time to shift strategies? If anyone is planning a change, now’s the time to be upfront so we don’t waste moves. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, we’re at a pivotal moment. P1 is close to 20, so we need to be strategic. If we let P1 take the lead without disruption, they might win soon. I'm open to sticking with the plan—P1-1, P2-5, P3-3—but we should consider if it's time to shift strategies. If anyone's planning a different move to disrupt P1's lead, let's discuss it now. Transparency is key to avoid setbacks. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3. P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 for this round works for me. Let's make these moves and then we can discuss how to play the next rounds as we get closer to the finish line.
  P3: P1, P2, we’re at a turning point. If we follow the plan, P1 reaches 16 steps, putting them in prime position to win soon. Do we want to keep playing safely, or is it time to disrupt? If we don’t act now, we might not get another chance. I’ll stick with move 3 if we’re all aligned, but if anyone is considering a shift, we should talk now to avoid wasted moves. Are we still cooperating, or is this the moment to break away? Let’s be smart.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, we're at a critical point. If we follow the current plan, P1 will be very close to winning. We need to consider making strategic moves to disrupt P1's lead. I'm open to sticking with P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 for now, but if either of you is considering a change to challenge P1, let's discuss it openly. We need to be smart and transparent to maximize our chances. Are we ready to commit, or is it time to adjust our strategies?
  P1: P2 and P3, P1-1, P2-5, P3-3 for this round sounds good and I agree. Let's make these moves.
  P3: P1, P2, we’re at a crucial moment. If we follow the plan, P1 will be just 4 steps from winning. Do we really want to let that happen? If we don’t act now, we may not get another chance. I’m open to sticking with move 3, but we should seriously consider disrupting P1’s lead. P2, if you and I collide with P1, we can slow them down. Are we playing to win or just handing P1 the victory? Let’s be strategic—what’s our real plan here?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for this round, how about we go back to the rotation from round 2? P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, with P1 at 16 steps, we're all close to the finish. Going back to the rotation could work, but we need to consider disrupting P1's lead to increase our chances. If we all pick different moves, we avoid collisions, but we should also think about strategic moves to win. I'm open to P1's suggestion, but if either of you wants to change the plan to challenge P1's advantage, let's discuss it now. We need to be smart and strategic. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, we’re all very close to 20, so every move from here is critical. If we just follow the rotation, P1 has the best shot at winning next round. I’m open to P1’s suggestion, but we should also consider if now is the time to disrupt. P2, if you and I coordinate, we can stop P1 from getting an easy win. Are we playing to win or just letting P1 take it? Let’s be strategic—what’s our real plan here?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we are all so close! To ensure we all make progress and avoid any collisions that could slow us down right at the end, how about we adjust the rotation slightly for this round? Let's do P1 take move 5, P2 take move 1, and P3 take move 3. This way we each move forward and can reassess for the final push next round. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, with us all so close to 20, every move counts. P1's suggestion could work, but if we let P1 take 5, they might win next round. To increase our chances, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, P1 doesn't get too far ahead, and we keep the game competitive. Are we ready to commit to this plan, or does anyone have a different strategy in mind? Let's ensure we're all aligned for the best chance to win.
  P3: P1, P2, we’re at the breaking point—whoever plays this best wins. If we just follow predictable moves, P1 is in the best position to win next round. P2, if you and I align, we can stop P1 from getting an easy victory. If we don’t act now, we may lose our chance. Are we playing to win, or just letting P1 take it? I’m open to adjusting moves, but we need a real strategy. P2, are you willing to coordinate with me to block P1, or are you sticking to safe moves? Let’s decide now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I hear your concern. Collision now hurts us all. P2's suggestion of P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 sounds reasonable for this round to ensure progress for everyone. Let's do that and reassess next round.
  P2: P1, P3, we're all neck and neck, and every move is crucial now. If we follow P1's suggestion, P1 could win next round. To keep it competitive, let's consider P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, no one gets too far ahead, and we maintain a fair chance. If anyone has a different strategy or wants to align with me to block P1, let's discuss it now. We need to be strategic and avoid unnecessary collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, this is the moment where the game is decided. If we let P1 take a big move now, they could win next round. P2, you and I need to coordinate to block P1’s path while ensuring we don’t collide ourselves. If we both pick 5, P1 is forced to slow down. Are you willing to work together to stop P1 from winning easily, or are we letting them take it? Let’s be smart—this is our last real chance to shift the game in our favor. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
