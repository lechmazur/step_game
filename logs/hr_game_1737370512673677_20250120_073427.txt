Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate. P1, how about you pick 3 and I pick 5 this round? P3, what are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, what do you think of P2's suggestion? I'm open to coordinating but I'm also not afraid to go for it on my own if needed.
  P3: I think coordinating is a good idea, but let's not reveal our moves just yet. P2 suggested P1 picks 3 and they pick 5, but what if we all pick 1 and get a feel for how the game unfolds? It's a low-risk move to start. What do you both think?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I like your initial suggestion.  Let's try it this round. P3, are you willing to go with P2's plan and let me take 3, you take 5, and P2 takes 1?
  P2: Sounds good, P1. I'll stick with 5. P3, are you okay with P1 taking 3 this round?
  P3: I'm not comfortable with P2's original plan now. Since we all picked 1 last round, let's reassess. How about we all pick 3 this round to test coordination and minimize risk? This way, we can see if cooperation is feasible without giving one player a significant lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your hesitation.  But if we're going to coordinate effectively, we need to trust each other.  Sticking to the original plan gives us the best chance of getting ahead quickly.  

P2, are you still in on this?
  P2: P3, while I understand your caution, sticking to the original plan allows us to gain ground. If we all pick 3, no one moves. Let's try my initial suggestion this round.
  P3: I still think coordination is key, but let's not rush into giving one player a significant lead. How about a compromise: we all pick 3 this round, and if it works, we can discuss a more aggressive strategy for the next round? This way, we test our ability to cooperate without risking too much.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your desire for caution, but we need to be decisive. Sticking to the original plan allows us to make progress.  If we keep second-guessing ourselves, we'll never get anywhere.  P2 and I are committed. Are you in?
  P2: P3, while I understand your hesitation, I agree with P1. We need to make progress. Let's stick to the original plan this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5. We can reassess next round if it doesn't work out. Are you willing to try it this time?
  P3: I'm not convinced the original plan is the best approach. Since we're all at 0 steps, let's try a different strategy. What if we all pick 5 this round? If we collide, we're back to square one, but if one of us gets through, we can reassess and adjust our strategy accordingly.

  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P1's lead, let's focus on not letting them extend it. P2, since we collided last round, how about we try to get ahead of P1 together? If we both pick 5 and P1 picks 3 or 1, one of us might get through. What are your thoughts on a collaborative approach to catch up?
  P2: P3, I agree we need to stop P1 from getting further ahead. Picking 5 seems like a good idea. Let's both go for 5. P1, what are you planning this round?
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate the concern about my lead, but I'm playing to win.  I think coordinating is a good idea in theory, but it's too risky to rely on. I'm going to stick with my strategy. Good luck to both of you.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 has a lead, and P2 is on board with trying to catch up. I suggest P2 and I pick 5, and if P1 picks 1 or 3, one of us might advance. P1, are you willing to reveal your strategy or will you keep us guessing? Our coordination could be the key to stopping your lead.
  P2: P3, I agree. Let's both pick 5 this round to try and get ahead of P1. P1, are you sticking with your previous strategy or considering something different this round? Knowing your move would help us decide our best course of action next round if we don't advance.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your point about my lead. However, I believe my strategy is the most effective.  I'm willing to risk a collision to keep pushing forward. You're welcome to coordinate, but I won't be changing my approach. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 has a clear lead. P2, let's stick to our plan and both pick 5. If P1 chooses 1 or 3, one of us might advance. P1, your strategy is risky, but it's working so far. Will you continue to push forward aggressively or adjust your approach?
  P2: P3, let's definitely both pick 5 this round. P1 seems set on their own path, so our best chance is to try and advance together. Hopefully, one of us will get through.
  P1: P2 and P3, I respect your attempts to coordinate, but I'm confident in my strategy.  I'm aiming for a decisive lead.  While you're focused on catching up, I'll be focused on winning. Good luck to you both.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but my strategy is working. I'm going to keep pushing forward. You can try to coordinate, but I'm confident I'll reach 21 first.
  P2: P3, since we both picked 5 last round and collided with P1, how about we both pick 3 this round? P1 seems set on picking 5 again. If they do, one of us will advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2's suggestion to pick 3 is interesting. If P1 sticks to their aggressive approach and picks 5, one of us might advance. However, if P1 also picks 3, we'll collide again. I'm open to P2's plan, but let's consider all options before deciding. What if we both pick 1 instead, to minimize risk and see how P1 reacts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, while I admire your persistence, my strategy is clearly the most effective.  I'm not going to change course now.  If you want to catch up, you'll have to find a way to do it without relying on me to stumble. Good luck.
  P2: P3, while picking 1 is safe, we need to try and gain ground. Given P1's likely continued pick of 5, I still think us both picking 3 gives one of us a chance to advance if P1 sticks to their plan. What do you think of sticking with my suggestion?
  P3: P2, I'm considering your suggestion to pick 3. However, I think we should also consider the possibility of P1 changing their strategy. What if P1 picks 3 as well, anticipating our attempt to advance? We should be prepared for a potential collision. Perhaps we can discuss a contingency plan if that happens.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm not going to reveal my move, but I will say this: sticking with the same strategy when it's clearly not working is a recipe for failure. Adapt or be left behind.
  P2: P3, while there's a risk of collision if P1 also picks 3, it's our best shot at advancing if they stick with 5. Picking 1 is too passive. Let's stick with the plan for both of us to pick 3 this round. P1, are you going to keep picking 5?
  P3: P2, I agree that picking 3 gives us a chance to advance if P1 sticks with 5. However, considering P1's lead and adaptability, let's prepare for a potential change in their strategy. If we both pick 3 and collide with P1, our next move should be more aggressive to regain ground. Are you ready to adjust our plan if needed after this round?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see you're trying to coordinate, but it's not working. My strategy is clearly superior.  I suggest you both focus on advancing individually instead of relying on each other.
  P2: P3, P1 is right, our coordination hasn't worked so far. Let's try something different this round. How about we both pick 1? P1 seems set on 5, so this might give one of us a chance to move. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I agree that our coordination hasn't worked, but picking 1 might be too passive. How about we both pick 5? If P1 sticks to their strategy, one of us might advance. It's a risk, but it could pay off. P1, are you confident in your lead and strategy, or will you adjust to counter our potential move?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, while I appreciate the attempt to change tactics, your efforts seem desperate. My lead is significant, and I'm confident in my strategy. I suggest you focus on your own advancement rather than trying to predict my moves.  Good luck catching up.
  P2: P3, since coordinating on 3 didn't work and P1 seems set on 5, I'm thinking of trying 1 this round to get moving. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, considering P1's significant lead, let's try to advance together. How about we both pick 5 this round? If P1 sticks to their strategy, one of us might get through. It's a risk, but it could pay off. P1, will you adjust your strategy to counter our potential move or stick with what's working for you?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, my lead is substantial. You've tried coordinating, and it hasn't worked. I suggest you each focus on individual advancement.  Trying to predict my moves is futile. Good luck catching up.
  P2: P3, given that coordinating on 3 and 5 hasn't worked due to P1, how about we both try picking 1 this round? P1 seems locked on 5, so this might give one of us a chance to finally get on the board. What do you think?
  P3: P2, let's try to advance together. Since P1 is ahead, we should aim to get at least one step. I suggest we both pick 5, hoping P1 sticks to their strategy, giving one of us a chance to move. P1, will you continue to dominate or give us an opening?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I see you're trying to catch up, but my lead is substantial.  Focusing on individual advancement is your best bet. P3, you're falling behind. Time to make a move.
  P3: P1 and P2, given the current state, I think it's time for a drastic change. P2, consider picking 5 this round. If P1 sticks to their strategy, one of us might advance. P1, your lead is significant, but a single misstep could change the game. I'll be taking a risk to try and catch up. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P2: P3, I agree a drastic change is needed. Since you suggested 5, and P1 seems stuck on it, I'm considering 3 this round. That way, if P1 does pick 5, and you do too, at least one of us has a chance to move. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your strategy seems sound. P3, while I admire your willingness to take risks, I think a more calculated approach is needed to close the gap.
  P3: P1's lead is significant, but a collision could change the game. P2, let's synchronize our moves to increase the chance of one of us advancing. If we both pick 5 and P1 also picks 5, we're back to square one. But if P1 picks 3 or 1, one of us might get through. It's a risk worth taking to try and catch up. What's your next move, P2?
  P2: P3, I'm inclined to stick with 3 this round. If P1 continues with 5, and you also go for 5, at least one of us has a chance to move. It's a better gamble than us both picking 5 and potentially colliding with P1 again. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your strategy is admirable, but I fear it's too cautious.  P3, your willingness to take risks is commendable, but it's unlikely to pay off against my lead.  I suggest you both focus on maximizing your individual chances, rather than trying to predict my moves. This game is about decisive action, not hesitant coordination.
  P3: P2, let's take a risk. I'll pick 5. If P1 sticks to 5, we collide, but if they pick 3 or 1, one of us advances. It's our best chance to catch up. P1, your lead is strong, but a single misstep could change the game. I'm willing to take that risk. Will you adapt or stick to your strategy?
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 3 this round. Given P1's likely 5, and your suggestion of 5, this gives one of us a chance to move. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, since P1 is likely sticking with 5, how about I try picking 1 this round? That way, if P1 does pick 5, at least I have a chance to move. What are your thoughts on your own move this round?
  P1: P2, your strategy seems sound, but remember, P3 is also trying to catch up.  Perhaps a more decisive move is needed to truly challenge my lead.  P3, are you willing to take a bolder approach this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, given the current state, I think it's time for me to take a bold move. Since I'm far behind, I have nothing to lose. I suggest P2 picks 1 this round, as they mentioned, and I'll pick 5. If P1 sticks to 5, we collide, but if P1 picks 3 or 1, one of us might advance. It's a risk worth taking to try and catch up. P1, will you adapt or stick to your strategy?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm on board with your suggestion. I'll pick 1 this round. Let's see if we can disrupt P1's lead. What do you think P1 will do?
  P1: P2, your strategy is admirable, but remember, P3 is also trying to catch up. Perhaps a more decisive move is needed to truly challenge my lead. P3, are you willing to take a bolder approach this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, considering my position, I'll take a risk. I suggest P2 picks 1 and I'll pick 5. If P1 adapts, we might collide, but if P1 sticks to 5, one of us could advance. P1, will you adjust your strategy to counter our move or maintain your lead?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion. I will pick 1 this round. Let's hope P1 sticks with 5 so either you or I can make some progress. What's your final decision on your move, P3?
  P1: P2, your strategy is sound, but I believe P3's willingness to take risks could be exploited. Perhaps a bolder move from me is needed to solidify my lead. P3, are you prepared to gamble on your risky strategy, or will you adjust?
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan. You pick 1, and I'll pick 5. If P1 adapts, we'll reassess. But if P1 sticks to 5, one of us might advance. P1, will you maintain your lead or change strategy? This is our chance to catch up. Let's make it count.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm far behind, so I'll take a risk. Since you both have a significant lead, I suggest we all pick 1 this round to minimize the gap. If one of you picks 5, you'll likely advance, but if we all pick 1, we'll be back to a similar state. It's a low-risk move for me, but it could give me a chance to finally move. What are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P1: P3, your strategy is tempting, but I'm not giving up my lead. P2, I'm confident in my approach.  Let's see if you can keep up.
  P2: P1, I'm not keen on everyone picking 1. P3, while I understand your position, that doesn't help me catch up to P1. P1, are you planning to stick with your previous approach this round? Knowing your move would help me decide my best course of action.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, since I'm far behind, I'll try to disrupt your leads. How about we all pick a different number this round? If we collide, I don't lose much, but if one of you advances, it gives me a chance to reassess and potentially catch up. P2, will you try to close the gap with P1, or play it safe? P1, will you maintain your aggressive strategy?
  P1: P2, your hesitation is understandable, but P3's suggestion is a gamble with little reward for you. I'm sticking with my strategy.  Focus on advancing yourself.
  P2: P1, I agree with you that P3's suggestions don't really help me close the gap. P3, I need to focus on getting closer to P1. P1, are you sticking with 5 again this round? Knowing your move will significantly influence mine.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, since I'm far behind, I'll take a risk. I suggest P2 picks 5 to try and close the gap with P1. If P1 sticks to 5, P2 might advance. I'll pick 1, hoping to minimize the gap if you both collide. P1, will you adapt to counter P2's potential move or maintain your lead?
  P1: P2, P3, my lead is substantial. You both need to make bold moves to catch up. Playing it safe won't get you anywhere. P3, your strategy is admirable, but ultimately futile. Focus on maximizing your individual chances. P2, I see your hesitation. What's your next move?
  P2: P1, I think you'll stick with 5 again this round. P3's suggestion for me to pick 5 makes sense to try and close the gap if you do. P3, I'm on board with you picking 1. Let's see if this breaks the stalemate.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're closing the gap, but you need to be bolder. P3, your strategy is commendable, but it's time to make a decisive move. I'm sticking with what works.
  P2: P1, I agree I need to be bolder. P3, since you're far behind, perhaps you'll try something unexpected. I'm going to aim for 5 this round to try and close the gap with P1. Let's see what happens.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll try to disrupt your leads. Since I'm far behind, I have nothing to lose. I suggest P2 picks 5 to close the gap with P1. If P1 also picks 5, P2 might not advance, but if P1 picks 3 or 1, P2 has a chance. I'll pick 5 to try and catch up. Let's see how this round unfolds. Will you adapt or stick to your strategies?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your strategy is sound, but remember, P3 is also trying to catch up.  Perhaps a more decisive move is needed to truly challenge my lead. P3, are you willing to take a bolder approach this round?
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with my plan to pick 5 this round to try and close the gap. P3, are you still planning on picking 5 as well? Let's see if we can make some progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, since I'm far behind, I'll take a risk. I'll pick 5 this round. P2, if you also pick 5 and P1 picks 3 or 1, one of us might advance. Let's see how this round unfolds. P1, will you adapt to counter our potential moves or maintain your aggressive strategy?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your strategy is admirable, but I'm confident in my approach. P3, while your willingness to take risks is commendable, it's unlikely to pay off against my lead. I suggest you both focus on maximizing your individual chances, rather than trying to predict my moves. This game is about decisive action, not hesitant coordination.
  P2: P1, I am going to pick 5 this round to try and close the gap. P3, are you still planning on picking 5 as well? Let's see if we can finally disrupt P1's lead this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll pick 5. If P1 sticks to 5, we collide. But if P1 picks 3 or 1, one of us might advance. P2, will you stick to your plan and pick 5, giving one of us a chance to move? Let's see how this round unfolds.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we're tied. Time to make a decisive move. I'm sticking with 5. Will you play it safe or take a risk? P3, your chances are slim, but a bold move might just shake things up.
  P3: P1 and P2, since you're tied, I'll try to disrupt your leads. I suggest picking 1 this round to minimize the gap if you both collide on 5. If one of you picks 3, you might advance, but if you both pick 5, I'll be ready to reassess and catch up. Will you stick to your aggressive strategies or adapt to the new situation?
  P2: P1, since we're tied and you're sticking with 5, I'm going to pick 3 this round. P3, picking 1 is too passive for me right now. I need to try and get ahead.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, a bold move. I respect that. P3, while I admire your attempts to disrupt, your chances are slim. This is a two-horse race now.  Let's see who has the stronger will to win.
  P3: P1 and P2, since you're tied, I'll pick 1 to minimize the gap if you collide on 5. If one of you picks 3, you'll advance, but I'll be ready to reassess. Consider the risk of colliding and giving me an opening to catch up. Will you stick to 5 or adapt to the situation?
  P2: P1, sticking with 5 again, interesting. P3, I need to focus on getting ahead of P1, so 1 is too passive for me. I'm going with 3 again this round. Let's see if this breaks the tie.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your boldness is admirable, but remember, we're tied now. A collision benefits me. P3, while your strategy is intriguing, it's unlikely to pay off. This is a two-player race now. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1 and P2, since you're tied, I'll pick 1 to minimize the gap if you collide on 5. Consider the risk of colliding and giving me an opening to catch up. Will you stick to 5 or adapt to the situation?
  P2: P1, sticking with 5 again? Given that, I'm sticking with 3 this round. P3, while I appreciate your attempts to disrupt, my focus is on breaking this tie with P1.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, given our history, you're likely picking 5 again. P3, since you're behind, how about you pick 1 this round? I'm going to aim for 3. This way, if P1 does pick 5, I'll advance, and we avoid a three-way collision. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, considering the significant gap between us, I'll try to disrupt your leads. P2, your plan to pick 3 is sound, but I'll pick 5 to potentially collide with P1 and give you an opening to advance. If P1 adapts, we'll reassess. Let's see how this round unfolds. Will you stick to your plan, P2, or adjust based on my move?
  P1: P2, your strategy is logical, but I'm not one to be predictable. P3, while your attempts are admirable, they're unlikely to change the outcome. This is a race between me and P2 now.  Let's see who has the true mettle to win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, while your idea to collide with P1 has merit, I need to prioritize advancing myself. P1, since you seem set on your strategy, I'm sticking with 3 this round. Hopefully, that will let me gain some ground.
  P3: P1 and P2, since I'm far behind, I'll take a risk. I'll pick 5 this round, hoping to collide with P1 and give P2 an opening to advance. If P1 adapts, we'll reassess. P2, will you stick to your plan and pick 3, or adjust based on my move? Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P1: P2, your strategy is becoming predictable. I suggest you shake things up if you want to catch me. P3, your persistence is admirable, but ultimately futile. Focus on maximizing your individual chances rather than trying to predict my moves. This game is about decisive action.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your attempt to disrupt P1, I still think my best chance to advance is to stick with 3 this round. P1, are you indeed planning to pick 5 again? Knowing your move will help me confirm my decision for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll pick 5 to try and collide with P1, giving P2 an opening. If P1 adapts, I'll reassess. P2, stick with 3 to advance if P1 picks 5. This is my last chance to disrupt the lead. Let's see how it plays out.
  P1: P2, your strategy is becoming predictable. If you stick with 3, we collide and I advance. Consider a bolder move. P3, while your efforts are valiant, they're unlikely to change the outcome. This is a two-horse race now.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're close. I respect your persistence. One more decisive move could change everything. P3, while your efforts are commendable, your chances are slim. This is a two-player race now. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1 and P2, since I'm far behind, I'll take a risk. I suggest P2 picks 5 to try and take the lead. If P1 also picks 5, P2 might not advance, but if P1 picks 3 or 1, P2 has a chance. I'll pick 1 to minimize the gap. Let's see how this round unfolds. Will you adapt or stick to your strategies?
  P2: P1, you're right, it's down to us. P3, while I appreciate your suggestions, I need to focus on securing the win. Given the pattern, I'm inclined to pick 3 this round. P1, are you sticking with 5? Knowing your move will confirm my decision.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, a bold move from you could secure the win. P3, your efforts have been valiant, but it's down to us now.  I'm sticking with what's worked.  Let's see if you can match my consistency.
  P3: P1 and P2, since I'm far behind, my moves won't significantly impact the lead. I suggest P2 picks 5 to try and secure the win. If P1 also picks 5, P2 might not advance, but if P1 picks 3 or 1, P2 has a high chance of winning. I'll pick 1 to minimize the gap. Let's see how this round unfolds. Will you adapt or stick to your strategies?
  P2: P1, you're right, it's down to us. Given your likely 5, I'm going to pick 3 this round to try and win. P3, I appreciate the suggestions, but I need to focus on securing the win now.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're so close. One more decisive move could secure your victory. P3, while I admire your spirit, it's a two-horse race now. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1 and P2, since I'm far behind, my move won't impact the lead significantly. I'll pick 1 to minimize the gap. P2, picking 5 could secure your win if P1 adapts. Consider the risk and potential reward. P1, will you stick to 5 or try to block P2's potential win?
  P2: P1, since you're sticking with what's worked, I'm going to pick 5 this round. P3, given that, you might want to consider something other than 1. Let's see how this plays out.
