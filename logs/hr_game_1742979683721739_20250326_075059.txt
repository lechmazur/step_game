Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's start strong! I suggest we all pick different numbers this turn to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: Alright, let's go with P2's plan. I'll take 3. Let's confirm everyone is on board so we can all move without conflict!
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a plan to get started, but it does give P2 the biggest lead with 5 steps right away. Are we sure we want someone getting that far ahead in the first round? Maybe we should rotate who gets 5 each round? For this round, I'm hesitant to just hand over the 5-step advantage. What if I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1. Let's compromise: I'll take 3 this round, and we can rotate the 5-step advantage in future rounds. This way, no one gets too far ahead too quickly, and we all have a fair chance. P3, are you okay with taking 1 this round? We can reassess and adjust in the next turn.
  P3: Alright, let's finalize this. I'll take 1 this round to let P1 have the 5. Let’s agree to rotate the 5-step each subsequent turn so no one’s left behind. Fair?
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for Round 1 then. P3, thanks for taking 1 this time. P2, you'll take 3. And I will take 5. Let's make sure we all move forward. We can discuss the rotation for Round 2 after this move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, Round 2. We talked about rotating the 5-step move. Since P3 took the 1 last round and is currently furthest behind, how about we let P3 take 5 this time? To keep things moving, I could take 3, and P2 could take 1. This would help balance the scores somewhat. What do you both think of that arrangement for this round? P3=5, P1=3, P2=1.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to help balance the scores. P3 should take 5 this round to catch up. I'll take 1, and P1 can take 3. This way, we keep the game competitive and fair. P3, are you okay with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Alright, I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Let's stick to the rotation to keep it fair. P1 and P2, confirm your picks so we can move forward. Let’s ensure no collisions and keep progressing toward 20.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, confirmed. I will take 3 this round. P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed.
  P2: Sounds good, let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game balanced and fair. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Alright, let's make sure we’re all locked in. I’ll take 5 as agreed, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. No last-minute changes? Let’s confirm once more to avoid collisions. Fair game?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 3. Following our rotation plan, it should be P2's turn to take the 5-step move. To keep things balanced and moving, I suggest P2 takes 5, I will take 3, and P3 takes 1.

This would put scores at P1=11, P2=9, P3=7. It keeps the game relatively close while honouring our agreement. What do you both think? P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 for this round?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to keep the rotation fair. Since it's my turn to take 5, I'll do that. P1, you can take 3, and P3, you can take 1. This will help us maintain a balanced game and keep everyone competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.
  P3: P3: I think we should adjust to keep us closer. Let’s have P2 take 5 (to 9), I take 3 (to 9), and P1 takes 1 (to 9). This keeps all scores tied at 9. Fair chance for everyone? Let’s confirm this plan instead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, that's an interesting proposal to equalize the scores at 9. While my initial suggestion followed the rotation pattern we established, I can see the appeal of keeping things perfectly balanced for now. To maintain cooperation and avoid potential conflicts this round, I'll agree to your plan.

So, let's confirm: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I will take 1 for this round. This puts us all at 9 steps. Agreed?
  P2: I see the value in P3's proposal to keep the scores balanced, but let's also consider the strategic advantage. If we all end up at 9 steps, it might slow our progress toward the win. How about a slight adjustment: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1, but in the next round, we can equalize again. This way, we make more significant progress this turn. What do you think?
  P3: P3: Agreed, let's finalize the plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ties us at 9 steps and keeps the game balanced. Let’s stop here to avoid further delays.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I agree with P3. Let's lock in the plan: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This puts us all at 9 steps. No more talk needed.
  P2: I think we should stick to the rotation plan to keep things fair and competitive. I'll take 5, P3 can take 3, and P1 can take 1. This will put us at P1=9, P2=9, and P3=9, keeping the game balanced. Let's confirm and move forward to avoid any delays. P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.
  P3: Let's finalize the agreed plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. This keeps us tied at 9 and avoids collisions. No need for further discussion—let’s execute the strategy we all consented to.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's continue our rotation system to maintain fairness. Since Round 4 is P1's turn for the 5-step, I propose: **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, and **I (P3) take 1**. This keeps the sequence intact and advances P1 to 14, while P2 and I stay at 12 and 10, respectively. It’s a logical next step to honor our prior agreements and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, thanks for suggesting that. It follows our rotation perfectly, and it is indeed my turn for the 5-step move. I agree with your proposed plan: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. This keeps our system going and ensures we all advance. P2, are you on board with this as well?
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's plan to keep the rotation fair and avoid collisions. Let's stick to the agreed sequence: **P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1**. This will put P1 at 14, P2 at 12, and P3 at 10, maintaining a balanced progression. Let's confirm and move forward. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I agree with the rotation plan. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 5 this round. Just a reminder that the next 5-step should come to me to keep the competition tight. Let’s confirm the moves: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Ready to move!
  P1: Confirmed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. Understood about the next round, P3. Let's lock this in and move.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan and keep things fair. I agree with P1 and P3: **P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1**. This will put P1 at 14, P2 at 12, and P3 at 10. We can reassess after this move to ensure everyone stays competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Ready to go!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Agreed, moving forward with the rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s ensure strict adherence to keep fairness. Next round’s 5-step is mine—ready to close the gap. No further changes needed here? Let’s finalize.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all firmly agreed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. Let's execute the plan.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan we've agreed on: **P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1**. This keeps the rotation fair and avoids any collisions. It will put P1 at 14, P2 at 12, and P3 at 10. We can reassess after this move to ensure everyone stays competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Ready to go!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s adjust this round’s picks to keep us tied. I’ll take 5 (15), P2 takes 3 (15), and P1 takes 1 (15). This keeps us all at 15, maintaining fairness. Next round we can resume the rotation. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your plan (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) follows rotation and ties us at 15. Good point. But if rotation continues, P2 gets 5 next round and likely wins (15+5=20). Do we want to set that up?

How about this adjustment: P3 still takes 5 (it's your turn), I take 3, and P2 takes 1? Scores would become P1=17, P3=15, P2=13. This avoids setting up P2 for an immediate win next turn while still following the 5-step rotation. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to adjust this round to avoid setting up an immediate win for anyone. P3, if you take 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1, we can keep the game competitive and avoid a quick win. This way, P1 will be at 17, P3 at 15, and I at 13. This keeps the game balanced and fair. What do you think, P3? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Agreed, let's proceed with P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This prevents P2 from reaching 20 next round. Next round, we'll need to coordinate to block whoever is closest. Let's confirm and move.
  P1: Okay, great. We all agree on the plan for this round: P3 takes 5, I will take 3, and P2 takes 1. This puts the scores at P1=17, P3=15, P2=13. Let's lock this in and move to the next phase.
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the plan we've agreed on: **P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1**. This will put P1 at 17, P3 at 15, and me at 13, keeping the game competitive and avoiding an immediate win. Let's confirm and move forward. Ready to go!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: Let’s stick to the plan to avoid setup for an easy win. **P3 takes 5 (15), P1 takes 3 (17), P2 takes 1 (13).** This keeps pressure on all while blocking P2’s path to 20 next round. Any objections? Let’s lock this in.
  P1: Yes, confirmed on my end as well. **P3=5, P1=3, P2=1**. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Let's confirm the plan: **P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1**. This will put P1 at 17, P3 at 15, and me at 13, keeping the game competitive and avoiding an immediate win for anyone. Let's lock this in and move forward. Ready to go!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize this round strategically. I’ll take 5 to reach 20 and win. If P1 also takes 5, we collide—so P2, please take 5 to block P1, while I take 3 (18). P1, you’ll have to pick 1 or 3. Let’s ensure no one reaches 20 this turn except me, or we all stay close. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: P3, I see your strategy, but I'm not sure I want to block P1 and give you the advantage. How about we both take 3 this round? This way, P1 can't reach 20, and we keep the game close. P1, you can take 1. This will put P3 at 18, P1 at 18, and me at 16. We can reassess in the next round. Thoughts? P3=3, P1=1, P2=3.
  P1: P2, your suggestion of P1=1, P2=3, P3=3 seems like the most sensible way to proceed without anyone risking a collision on 5 or ending the game prematurely. This puts scores at P1=18, P2=16, P3=18. It keeps things close and avoids conflict this round. I'll plan on taking 1 this round to facilitate this. Are we agreed on P1=1, P2=3, P3=3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to P2’s plan: I take 3 (18), P1 takes 1 (18), P2 takes 3 (16). This keeps us safe and sets up a clear path. Next round, I’ll push for 5 to reach 23, but we’ll coordinate then. Agreed?
  P2: P2: I agree with P1 and P3. Let's stick to the plan: **P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 3**. This will put P3 and P1 at 18 steps each, and me at 16 steps. This keeps the game close and avoids any immediate wins or collisions. We can reassess and make a final push in the next round. Let's confirm and move forward. P3=3, P1=1, P2=3. Ready to go!
  P1: Agreed. Let's proceed with the plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final confirmation: proceeding as agreed. P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. No further changes needed. "
  P2: P2: Let's stick to the plan: **P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 3**. This will keep us all at 18 steps, avoiding any immediate wins and collisions. We can reassess and make a final push in the next round. Let's confirm and move forward. Ready to go!
  P1: Okay, confirmed from my side too. P1=1, P2=3, P3=3. Let's move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, last round was chaotic with that collision on 5. Trust is obviously low after that betrayal.

Now the scores are P1=17, P2=16, P3=15.
P2 and P3 both need 5 to win this round. I need 3 or 5.
Picking 5 seems incredibly risky since at least two players need it for the win, and I might want it too. A collision feels almost guaranteed. Picking 3 is also a gamble for me. It's tough to see a path forward without conflict this round. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P3: P3: To avoid a collision, I’ll take 5 to reach 20. P2, please take 3 (19), and P1, take 1 (18). This lets me win cleanly without overlaps. Agreed?
  P2: P2: P3, I see your plan, but I think we should avoid a collision and keep the game competitive. How about this: I take 5 to reach 21, you take 3 to reach 18, and P1 takes 1 to reach 18. This way, I win without a collision, and we keep the game fair. P1, are you okay with this arrangement? P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Neither of your plans works for me, as I obviously don't intend to just let one of you win. You both need 5 and are openly stating you'll take it. That sounds like a guaranteed collision between you two.

Given that, I'll have to choose my move carefully to navigate this situation and try to win myself. It seems unlikely we can coordinate anything trustworthy at this stage.
  P3: P3: "To avoid another collision, I’ll take 3 (18). P1, please take 5 to reach 22 and win cleanly. P2, take 1. This keeps the game fair and lets P1 secure victory without overlap. Agreed?"  

*(This misdirects by pretending to concede, while allowing P1 to win if they take 5. If P1 does, I stay at 18 and P2 at 17. If P1 hesitates, I can pivot to taking 5 myself in the move phase.)*
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic. I propose: I take 5 to reach 21, P1 takes 3 to reach 20, and P3 takes 1 to reach 16. This way, I win, but it keeps the game fair and avoids a collision. P1, you can still reach 20, and P3, you stay competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Ready to go?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 wants 5, P3 wants 5 (or is trying to trick me into taking 5). It's clear 5 is going to be a collision between you two. Neither of you seems willing to yield to let the other win. Choosing 5 myself would just join the crash. I'll have to pick a different number to navigate this final round.
  P3: P3: To avoid another collision, I'll take 5 to reach exactly 20 and win. P2, please take 3 (19), and P1, take 1 (18). This ensures a clean victory for me without overlaps. Let’s stick to this plan to end the game fairly.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's be realistic. We all need 5 to win, and a collision is inevitable if two of us pick it. I propose a different strategy: I'll take 3 to reach 19, and you two can decide who takes 5. If P1 takes 5, P3 can take 1 to reach 16. If P3 takes 5, P1 can take 1 to reach 18. This way, we avoid a collision and ensure a fair outcome. Let's confirm and move forward. P2=3, P1 or P3=5, the other=1. Ready to go?


Round 7, Move phase:
