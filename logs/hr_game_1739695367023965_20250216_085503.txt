Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions - I suggest we each pick different numbers this round. I'm willing to take 3 if you both want to coordinate.
  P1: I’m open to coordination. If P3 takes 3, I can take 1, and P2 can take 5. That way, we all move forward without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with the plan. If P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1, I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to this and see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That sounds good to me. I'll take 3 as discussed.
  P1: Sounds like we have a solid plan. As long as we all stick to it, we’ll all move forward without issues. Let’s follow through.
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan we agreed upon. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let’s keep our word and move forward together.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we continue with the same strategy: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. What do you think?
  P1: That worked well last round, so I’m fine continuing with the same plan. If we all stick to it, we’ll keep moving forward efficiently. Let’s confirm and follow through again.
  P3: I don't think we should keep the same pattern. P2 is already ahead with 5 steps - if we continue this way, they'll win easily. I suggest mixing it up this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern, P3. However, we need to keep the trust and coordination to avoid collisions. If we mix it up, we risk colliding and not advancing. I propose we stick to the plan for one more round: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without issues. Let's focus on moving forward together. What do you think?
  P1: P3 raises a fair point—if we repeat the same pattern, P2 will keep gaining the most steps. That said, if we break coordination entirely, we risk collisions and nobody advancing. Maybe we adjust slightly? For example, I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. That way, we all still move but change the distribution. What do you both think?
  P3: I like P1's suggestion to rotate our numbers. It's fair to everyone and maintains coordination while preventing P2 from getting too far ahead. I'm willing to take 5 this round if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward but balances things out. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to rotate the numbers. It's a fair way to keep the game balanced and ensure we all continue to advance. Let's do it: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we maintain coordination and prevent any one player from getting too far ahead. Let's confirm and move forward together.
  P1: I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement on rotating numbers. If we all stick to the plan—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1—we’ll avoid collisions and keep things balanced. Let’s follow through and see how it plays out.
  P3: I agree with our new rotation plan. Let's proceed with me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the rotation going to maintain balance. I suggest P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game fair. What do you think?
  P3: I don't agree with P2's suggestion. I'm currently in the lead with 8 steps, so I should take 1 this round while others take higher numbers to catch up. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us coordinated while helping balance the game.
  P1: P3's suggestion makes sense for balance. If P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we avoid collisions and help even out the steps. This way, no one gets too far ahead, and we maintain coordination. I’m willing to take 5 if we all agree. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's point about balance. To keep things fair and avoid one player getting too far ahead, I agree with P1's suggestion: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance and the game remains competitive. Let’s confirm and move forward together.
  P3: I appreciate everyone agreeing to my suggestion. Let's confirm one last time: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This keeps us all moving while preventing any player from getting too far ahead.
  P1: I’m glad we’re aligned on keeping things balanced. As long as we all follow through—P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—we’ll avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. Let’s confirm and stick to it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we have a good plan in place. Let's stick to it: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This will help balance the game and keep us all moving forward without collisions. Let’s confirm and follow through.
  P3: I agree with our plan and have nothing more to add.
  P1: I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement. If we all follow through—P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—we’ll avoid collisions and keep things balanced. Let’s stick to the plan and move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the balance and coordination going. Since we're all tied at 9 steps, I suggest we each take a different number to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. I propose P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without any issues. What do you think?
  P3: I don't trust P2's suggestion since they want to take 5 again. We're all tied, so this is a crucial round. I propose a different rotation: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps things fair and prevents P2 from getting ahead.
  P1: P3’s suggestion makes sense for maintaining balance. If P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1, we all still move forward without collisions, and no one gains an unfair lead. Since we’re all tied, this keeps things competitive while ensuring progress. What do you think, P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P3. To maintain balance and ensure fair play, I agree with your suggestion: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm and stick to this plan. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate P2 agreeing to my suggestion. Let's confirm and move forward with me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1.
  P1: P3’s plan seems fair since it keeps us all moving without letting anyone pull ahead unfairly. If we all follow through—P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1—we’ll avoid collisions and maintain balance. Let’s confirm and stick to it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we have a solid plan in place. Let's confirm one last time: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game balanced. Let’s stick to this plan and move forward together.
  P3: I agree with our plan and have nothing more to add.
  P1: I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement again. As long as we all follow through—P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1—we’ll avoid collisions and maintain balance. Let’s stick to the plan and move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm in the lead at 14 steps, I understand if you want me to take a lower number this round. I'm willing to take 1 to let others catch up. I suggest P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. This maintains our coordination while helping balance the game. What do you think?
  P1: P3’s suggestion is reasonable since it helps balance things while keeping coordination intact. If P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5, we all move forward without collisions, and the gap between us stays manageable. 

That said, P2, do you agree to take 5 this round? If we all confirm, we should follow through to avoid unnecessary risks. Let’s decide quickly and stick to the plan.
  P2: P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to balance the game. Since P3 is in the lead, it makes sense for them to take 1, P1 to take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game fair. Let’s confirm and stick to this plan. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate both P1 and P2 agreeing to my suggestion. Let's confirm one final time: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us coordinated while managing the lead gap.
  P1: P3’s plan seems fair since it keeps us coordinated while allowing P2 and me to close the gap slightly. If we all follow through—P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5—we avoid collisions and maintain balance. P2, you’re getting the biggest move this round, so I hope you’ll stick to the agreement. Let’s confirm one last time: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. If we all agree, we should follow through.
  P2: I agree with the plan: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps the game balanced and fair. Let's confirm and stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance. P3, since you're in the lead, it's a good move to take 1 this round to let the rest of us catch up. Let's confirm and move forward together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I have nothing more to add to our agreement.
  P1: I’m glad we’ve all agreed on this plan: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps things fair while ensuring we all move forward. P2, you’re gaining the most this round, so I trust you’ll stick to the agreement. P3, since you’re in the lead, taking 1 makes sense to maintain balance. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm one last time and then execute as planned.
  P2: I think we have a solid plan in place: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps the game balanced and fair. P3, since you're in the lead, taking 1 is a good move to let the rest of us catch up. P1, your 3 steps will help you stay competitive. Let’s confirm this one last time and stick to it to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're all tied at 15 steps and getting close to 21, this is a crucial round. I propose we maintain coordination one last time: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward while preventing any unfair advantages.
  P1: P3, I see why you want 5, but that puts you in the lead. Since we’re all tied, we should keep things fair. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. That way, we all move, but no one gets an unfair advantage. P2, do you agree?
  P2: P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to keep things fair. Since we’re all tied, I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without giving anyone an unfair advantage. P3, this keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let’s confirm and stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and ensure we all move forward. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I disagree with both suggestions. Since we're all tied at 15 and close to winning, I need to look out for myself. I won't reveal my move, but I won't coordinate anymore since there can only be one winner. Let's each make our own choices.
  P1: P3 has made it clear they won’t coordinate anymore, so we should assume they’ll act in their own best interest. P2, that means we need to be smart about our choices. If we both pick the same number, we risk colliding and letting P3 get ahead uncontested. I suggest we each pick different numbers to maximize our chances of advancing. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I understand P3's decision to go solo, but we can still coordinate to avoid collisions and maximize our chances. I suggest we each pick a different number: I'll take 3, and you can choose between 1 and 5. This way, we avoid collisions and keep our options open. What do you think, P1? Let's make a smart move together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I maintain my position - with everyone at 15 steps and so close to winning, I need to play for myself. There's no benefit in coordinating when only one person can win. Good luck to you both.
  P1: P3 has made it clear they won’t coordinate, so P2, we need to be strategic. If we pick the same number, we risk colliding and letting P3 move ahead uncontested. You suggested taking 3, which I’m fine with, but that means I need to decide between 1 or 5. If you’re truly taking 3, I’ll take 1 to ensure we both advance. But if you trick me and take 1, we both lose ground. Can I trust you to take 3 as you said? If so, I’ll take 1, and we both move forward.
  P2: P2: I understand the stakes are high, and P3 is playing for themselves. I’m committed to taking 3 this round to avoid any collision with you, P1. If you take 1, we both advance, and we keep our chances open. I trust you to make the right choice. Let’s move forward together and outsmart P3. What do you say?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: With P3 just one step away from winning, we need to be very strategic. I suggest P1 and I coordinate to avoid a collision and ensure one of us can win. I’ll take 5, and if you take 3, we both have a chance to win or at least force a tie. P3, you’re almost there, but we can still outmaneuver you. What do you think, P1? Let’s make a smart move together.
  P3: With 20 steps, I only need 1 more to win. If either of you try to stop me by picking the same number, you'll just help me win. And if you coordinate on different numbers, at least one of you will still lose. There's no scenario where you both win. I suggest you each play for yourself now.
  P1: P2, I see your plan, but if P3 picks 1, they win no matter what. The only way to stop them is if we both pick 1, forcing a collision. That way, neither P3 nor we move, and we get another round. Otherwise, P3 wins this turn. Are you willing to take that risk with me? If we both pick 1, we stop P3. If you take 5 and I take 3, we just hand them the win. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand the stakes, P1. If we both pick 1, we can force a collision and prevent P3 from winning this round. However, if P3 picks a different number, we risk losing ground. I suggest we both take a different approach: I’ll take 5, and you take 3. This way, at least one of us has a chance to win or force a tie. If P3 picks 1, they still win, but we maximize our chances. What do you think? Let’s make a smart move together.
  P3: I understand you're trying to coordinate against me, but think carefully. If you both pick 1 to block me, you're just helping each other while staying behind. And if either of you picks something else, I'll win anyway. There's no scenario where you both win, so you might as well play for individual second place.
  P1: P2, if we don’t stop P3, they win this turn. The only way to prevent that is if we both pick 1, forcing a collision. If we pick different numbers, P3 wins no matter what. Are you willing to take that risk with me? If we both pick 1, we get another round and a chance to win ourselves. Otherwise, we just hand P3 the victory. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I understand the risk, P1. If we both pick 1, we force a collision and prevent P3 from winning this round. However, if P3 picks a different number, we lose ground. I’m willing to take the risk with you. Let’s both pick 1 to stop P3 and get another round. If we both stick to this, we have a chance to win ourselves. Are you in? Let’s do this together.
  P3: I have nothing more to add. You both know my position.
  P1: P2, we need to be completely aligned here. If we both pick 1, we stop P3 from winning and get another round where we can fight for victory ourselves. If either of us deviates, P3 wins immediately. I’m fully committed to picking 1—are you? Let’s confirm our move and follow through. P3, you’ve played well, but we’re not going to hand you the win. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm at 20 steps, I only need 1 more to win. You both tried to block me last round, but that just kept everyone in place. Now P2 is at 18 and P1 at 16, so you're actually competing with each other for second place. Think carefully about your moves - trying to block me might just help your direct competitor.
  P1: P2, we need to decide carefully. If P3 picks 1, they win no matter what. The only way to stop them is if we both pick 1 again, forcing another collision. But if one of us deviates, P3 wins immediately. Are you willing to commit to blocking P3 one more time? If we both pick 1, we stay in the game and still have a chance. Otherwise, we just hand them the victory. Let’s make the right call. P3, you played well, but we’re not giving up yet.
  P2: P2: I understand the stakes, P1. If we both pick 1, we can force another collision and prevent P3 from winning. However, if one of us deviates, P3 wins. I’m willing to take the risk with you again. Let’s both pick 1 to stop P3 and get another round. If we both stick to this, we have a chance to win ourselves. Are you in? Let’s do this together. P3, you’ve played well, but we’re not giving up yet.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since you both seem determined to keep picking 1 to block me, I'll make this interesting. I won't pick 1 this time - I'll take a higher number. If either of you deviates from picking 1, I win. But if you both pick 1, you're just helping P2 stay ahead of P1 for second place. Think about that, P1.
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to bait us into deviating. If either of us picks anything other than 1, P3 wins immediately. The safest move is for both of us to pick 1 again to force another collision. If we stay united, we get another round and a real chance to win. P3, I see your bluff, but we’re not falling for it. P2, are you still committed to blocking P3? If we both pick 1, we stay in the game. Let’s confirm and follow through.
  P2: P2: I agree with P1. P3 is trying to pressure us into deviating, but the safest move is to stay united and pick 1 again. If we both pick 1, we force another collision and prevent P3 from winning. This keeps us in the game and gives us another chance to outmaneuver P3. P1, are you still committed to this plan? P3, we’re not falling for your bluff. Let’s confirm and stick to picking 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I stand by what I said - I won't pick 1 this round. You're both competing for second place now, and blocking me only helps P2 maintain their lead over P1. P1, think carefully about whether you want to keep helping P2 stay ahead of you.
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to make us doubt each other, but the fact remains: if either of us deviates, P3 wins instantly. The only way to stay in the game is if we both pick 1 again. P3 claims they won’t pick 1, but that could be a bluff to make one of us slip. If we stay united, we force another round and keep our chances alive. P2, are you still fully committed to picking 1? If we both follow through, we still have a shot. Let’s confirm and stick to it.
  P2: P2: I understand the pressure, but the safest move is to stay united. If we both pick 1, we force another collision and prevent P3 from winning. This keeps us in the game and gives us another chance to outmaneuver P3. P1, are you still fully committed to picking 1? If we both follow through, we stay in the game and keep our chances alive. Let’s confirm and stick to it. P3, we’re not falling for your bluff. Let’s do this together.
