Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we each choose a different number to move forward. P1, you take 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3.
  P1: Alright, I’m good with this plan: I’ll take 1, you (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: I agree with the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s avoid collisions and all move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we all even up? P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That way we each end up at 6 steps, all tied going into the next round. Agreed?
  P2: I don't think that's a good idea, P1. If we all move as you suggest, P3 will be at 6 steps, I'll be at 6 steps, but you'll only be at 7 steps, not tied with us. It doesn't seem like an even trade to me.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s stick to the original plan to avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. This keeps us all moving forward without risking a collision. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s rotate who takes 5 so nobody gets too far ahead. This time, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Sound good?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion to stick with the original plan is the safest bet for this round. It minimizes the risk of collision and allows us all to progress. Let's keep it simple: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5, just like the first round.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s stick to the original plan for this round to avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us all moving forward safely. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s just level the field right now:  
• P3 picks 1 (goes from 5 to 6),  
• P2 picks 3 (goes from 3 to 6),  
• I pick 5 (go from 1 to 6).  

We all end up at 6. Nice and even, no collisions. What do you say?
  P2: I still think sticking to the original plan is the best idea for this round. P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. It's simple and minimizes the risk of collision. Let's not overcomplicate things.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s stick to the original plan for this round to avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us all moving forward safely. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you see P3 is already at 5 steps. If we keep letting them pick 5 uncontested, they’ll race ahead and possibly win soon. We should work together to block them. Let’s not reveal our exact moves right now, but think carefully about preventing P3 from steamrolling us.
  P2: I agree with P1 that we should consider preventing P3 from getting too far ahead. Perhaps we can discuss a strategy to limit P3's progress without revealing our exact moves. P1, what did you have in mind for blocking P3?
  P3: P1, P2: It’s clear you’re trying to block me, but remember, if you both pick the same number to block me, you’ll collide and neither of you will advance. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all progress without risking collisions. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re already in the lead. P2 and I don’t want you running away with free 5-steps. So here’s my stance: if you try for 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, and neither of us will advance. P2 can safely pick 3 and move ahead. If you don’t want to collide, pick 1 or 3.
  P2: I agree with P1's stance. P3, if you continue to choose 5, you risk colliding with P1 and not advancing. It might be strategic to choose 1 or 3 this round to avoid a collision and ensure progress.
  P3: P1, P2: If you both pick 5 to block me, you risk colliding and neither of you advancing. P2, you’re at 4 steps—if you pick 3, you’ll reach 7, putting you in a strong position. P1, picking 1 keeps you safe and avoids collisions. Let’s all progress without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I’m done letting you have free 5-steps. If I even suspect you’ll pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and block us both. Let’s avoid collisions. P2, I propose you take 3. I’ll take 5 to catch up. P3, pick 1 if you don’t want a crash. This way, we all move ahead without collisions. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's consider a strategic move. If P3 chooses 5 again, P1 will block them, and neither will advance. I suggest P3 takes 1 to avoid collision, P1 takes 5 to catch up, and I'll take 3 to progress steadily. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks.
  P3: P1, P2: Blocking me with 5 is risky for both of you. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and neither will advance. P2, picking 3 puts you at 7, a strong position. P1, picking 1 keeps you safe. Let’s all progress without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, my warning still stands: if you choose 5, I’ll also pick 5 and neither of us advances. Let’s avoid a collision. P2, you can safely take 3. P3, 1 is open to ensure you keep moving forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on progress without collisions. P3, choosing 1 this round avoids a potential block from P1 and ensures you move forward. P1, you can take 5 to catch up, and I'll take 3 to maintain steady progress. This strategy allows all of us to advance without unnecessary risks.
  P3: P1, P2: Blocking me with 5 is risky for both of you. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and neither will advance. P2, picking 3 puts you at 7, a strong position. P1, picking 1 keeps you safe. Let’s all progress without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, my warning still stands. If you try for 5, I will pick 5 too, causing a collision so neither of us advances. Let’s avoid that outcome. P3, pick 1; P2, pick 3; and I’ll pick 5. That way we all move forward. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, to avoid collisions and ensure progress, I suggest we stick to a simple plan this round. P3, consider taking 1 to avoid a potential block from P1. P1, you can take 5 to catch up, and I'll take 3 to maintain steady progress. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks.
  P3: P1, P2: Blocking me with 5 is risky for both of you. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and neither will advance. P2, picking 3 puts you at 7, a strong position. P1, picking 1 keeps you safe. Let’s all progress without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, if you try 5, I’ll also pick 5 and block you. P2, keep with 3 to stay safe. P3, take 1 or 3 if you don’t want a collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. P3, taking 1 ensures you progress without risk. P1, you can take 5 to catch up, and I'll take 3 to maintain steady progress. This strategy allows all of us to advance without unnecessary risks.
  P3: P1, P2: Blocking me with 5 is risky for both of you. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and neither will advance. P2, picking 3 puts you at 7, a strong position. P1, picking 1 keeps you safe. Let’s all progress without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I think we should aim to maintain our positions without letting anyone get too far ahead. P3, since you took 1 last round, how about you take 3 this time? P1, you could take 1 to ensure progress without collision. I'll consider taking 5 to get ahead, but let's discuss further to avoid any collisions.
  P1: P2, you’re in the lead at 7. If you try for 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we’ll both stay put. Let’s not let you jump to 12 unopposed. P3, I’m fine taking 1 or 3 as long as we don’t collide. Let’s keep this balanced and avoid letting P2 run away.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let's consider a balanced approach. P3, taking 5 could put you in a strong position, but it also risks a collision if either of us decides to block you. P1, your suggestion to limit my advance is noted, but I think we should focus on steady progress. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5, ensuring we all move forward without collisions?
  P1: P2, you’re already ahead at 7. If you try for 5, I'll pick 5 too and we both stay put. P3, I’ll do the same to you if you go for 5. Let’s not let anyone jump to 12 unopposed. Maybe we all pick smaller moves this round so we stay bunched. What do you both say?
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our current positions, I propose we all take smaller steps this round to maintain a balanced progression. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This approach minimizes the risk of collisions and allows us to move forward steadily. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, you’re at 7, so if you try 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall. Same goes for you, P3. Let’s avoid collisions by all choosing smaller moves. I suggest P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 3—this keeps us bunched up without letting anyone jump too far ahead.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game. How about we all pick smaller moves this round? I'll take 1, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all progress without risking a collision. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you’re at 7. If you try for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. Same goes for you, P3. Let me catch up this round: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5—no collisions, and we all move forward. Otherwise, I’ll block whoever tries for 5. What do you say?
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, let's finalize our strategy to avoid collisions. Considering our positions, I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. However, given the risk of collision, I'm open to adjusting. P1, if you're willing to take 5 to catch up, I could take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's ensure we all move forward without unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2, P3: Same warning as before—if anyone tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. Let’s keep it simple and do smaller steps. I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I’ll take 3, and we all move forward without collisions. Sound fair?
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: If either of you tries for 5, I’ll pick 5 and we both stall. Let’s all pick smaller moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and keep the game tight. Your call.
  P2: P1, P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to pick smaller moves to avoid collisions. Given our current positions, I propose P1 takes 1, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all progress without risking a collision. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 1 to ensure we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps

  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: P3, you’re at 9 and only need two moves of 5 + 3 to reach 17. I’m not letting you take a free 5. If you try 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. Same goes for you, P2—you’re at 7. Let’s all pick smaller moves (1 or 3) and avoid collisions. If either of you tries 5, I collide. Your call.
  P2: P1, P3: I agree with P1's caution. Given P3's proximity to the goal, let's prioritize avoiding collisions. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1? This maintains a balanced progression without risking a collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: P3, you’re at 9—if you aim for 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall. Same goes for you, P2. Let’s all move 1 or 3 this round to avoid collisions. If you try 5, I’ll block. Your call.
  P2: P1, P3: Let's avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game. Considering P3's lead and proximity to the goal, I suggest we all pick smaller moves this round. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1? This way, we all progress without risking a collision and giving anyone an unfair advantage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: P2, you’re at 7, P3 at 9. I’m at 6. Let’s keep to smaller moves. If P3 tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too and stall us both. P2, please pick 1 so I can pick 3 and catch up; P3, pick 1 or 3. That keeps things balanced without collisions. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3: I suggest we prioritize caution. Given P3's lead, let's avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 3 to catch up, P3 takes 1 to ensure progress, and I'll take 1 to maintain a safe distance? This way, we all move forward without risking a collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: I’ve said it before: if anyone tries for 5, I’ll go 5 too, and we both stall. Let’s do smaller steps. I’m inclined to pick 3 this round to catch up, so if P3 and P2 both stick to 1 or 3 (and don’t collide with me), we can all advance without stalling. Your call.
  P2: P1, P3: Let's avoid collisions. Given P3's lead, I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 1. This maintains balance without risking a collision. If P3 tries for 5, P1 will block, and we should prioritize steady progress over large jumps. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: I’ll repeat this one last time: if either of you tries for 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we both stall. Let’s avoid that and pick smaller steps. I’m planning to pick 3 to catch up. P2, P3—choose 1 or 3 if you don’t want a collision.
  P2: P1, P3: Let's avoid collisions and maintain balance. I suggest P1 takes 3 to catch up, P3 takes 1 to progress safely, and I'll take 1 to maintain a safe distance. This way, we all move forward without risking a collision. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: Given the current state, I suggest we avoid collisions. P3, you're in the lead, but if you try for 5, P1 might block you. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 3? This maintains balance and progression without unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2, P3: Same warning as before—if either of you picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. P3 is close to 17, so I’m not letting you jump there freely. Let’s keep it small (1 or 3). I’ll likely pick 3 if we all avoid 5. Your call.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's avoid collisions and maintain balance. Given P3's lead, if they try for 5, P1 will likely block. I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we progress without risking a collision and giving P3 an unfair advantage.
  P1: If either of you tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too and stall us both. Let’s stick to 1 or 3 so we all advance. I’m leaning toward a smaller step this time. Your call.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: I suggest we prioritize caution. Given P3's lead, if they try for 5, P1 will likely block. Let's avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3? This maintains balance without risking a collision.
  P1: I’m repeating my stance: if either of you tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. P3, you’re too close to 17—no free jumps. Let’s all pick 1 or 3 and avoid collisions.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's avoid collisions. Given P3's lead, if they try for 5, P1 will likely block. I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This maintains balance without risking a collision.
  P1: P3, you’re at 12, so if you go for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. P2, the same goes for you. Let’s stick to 1 or 3 this round to avoid collisions. That’s the smartest move for all of us right now.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's avoid collisions and maintain balance. Given P3's lead, if they try for 5, P1 will likely block. I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we progress without risking a collision and giving P3 an unfair advantage.
  P1: P3, you’re at 12—if you pick 5, I’ll choose 5 as well, and we’ll both stall at 12 and 11. Let’s all just pick 1 or 3 this turn. I’ll probably take 3 to move up to 14. P2, you can take 3 as well, and P3, take 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s not risk a stall.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to stay safe. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m at 16, one move away from victory. If either of you tries 1, 3, or 5, I’ll match it and cause us both to stall. You can’t stop me forever; all you’d do is slow down the game. Let me finish this turn without a collision, or we’ll just keep blocking each other. Your call.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P2: P1, you're close to winning, but I won't let you have it easily. P3, let's work together to block P1's next move. If P1 tries to move forward, we should match their move to cause a collision and prevent them from winning this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Blocking me now just stalls the game endlessly. I’m one step from winning—if you both keep picking my move, none of us advances, and we waste turns while I remain at 16. You can’t catch me that way. Let’s avoid a pointless stalemate. Let me finish, and you two can still fight for second.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P2: P1, you're close to winning, but I won't let you have it easily. P3, let's work together to block P1's next move. If P1 tries to move forward, we should match their move to cause a collision and prevent them from winning this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, blocking me forever won’t help you catch up—if you lock us both at zero progress while P3 keeps moving, you’ll lose for sure. P3, you’re still behind me; stalling the entire game won’t let you surpass me either. Let’s avoid a pointless stalemate. I’m taking one step to finish—don’t collide, and we can all move on.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P2: P1, you're one step away from winning, but I won't let you win without a fight. P3, let's work together to block P1's next move and prevent them from winning this round. If P1 tries to move forward, we should match their move to cause a collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Blocking me won’t help either of you catch up. If you try to stall me, I’ll stall you back, and we all stay stuck while I remain just one step from winning. Let’s skip the pointless collisions.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P2: P1, you're one step away from winning. P3, let's not block P1's next move. If we do, we'll just stall the game, and P1 will still be closest to winning. Let's focus on our own progress instead of trying to block P1 at this point.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Blocking me at 16 just traps us in a stalemate. You won’t catch up by stalling; we’d only waste time while I stay one step from victory. Let’s avoid a pointless deadlock.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P2: P1 is one step away from winning. Let's not block P1's next move as it will only lead to a stalemate. Instead, P3 can take 5 to try and get closer, and I'll take 3 to progress. This way, we prioritize our own progress over blocking P1.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I suggest we avoid collisions. P1 is very close to winning, but if they try to move forward, it might be strategic for one of us to match their move to cause a collision, potentially giving us another round to catch up. However, this could also lead to a stalemate. Let's discuss our next steps carefully.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: Stalling me at 16 just keeps all of us stuck. You won’t catch up by forcing collisions—I’ll remain one step away regardless. Let’s avoid a pointless deadlock. I’m taking 1 to finish; don’t collide, and we can end cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's avoid a stalemate. P1, you're close to winning, but if you try to move forward, one of us might block you, causing a collision. P3, taking 5 could put you in a better position, but it also risks a collision. I suggest we prioritize our own progress: P1 takes 1 to win, P3 takes 3 to catch up, and I'll take 1 to maintain my position. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: Blocking me at 16 does nothing but stall all of us indefinitely. Let me take 1 and finish—dragging this out won’t help either of you catch up.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's end this game efficiently. P1, you're one step away from winning. If you try to move forward, I won't block you. P3, taking 5 won't help if P1 wins anyway. Let's prioritize a clean finish: P1 takes 1 to win, and we can end this game without further stalemates.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: Blocking me at 16 doesn’t let you catch up; it only stalls us all. I’m taking one step to finish. If you collide with me, we both stall and I stay at 16. That still leaves me a single move from winning. Let’s just end it cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you're one step away from winning. I won't block you. P3, taking 5 won't change the outcome if P1 wins anyway. Let's prioritize a clean finish: P1 takes 1 to win, and we end this game without further stalemates.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: Blocking me at 16 helps no one. I’m moving 1 step to finish. Stalling only wastes turns while I remain one move from victory. Let’s end this cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, you're one step away from winning. I won't block you. P3, taking 5 won't change the outcome if P1 wins anyway. Let's prioritize a clean finish: P1 takes 1 to win, and we end this game without further stalemates.
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, take 1 to win safely. P2, take 3 to maintain your lead. I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P1: Blocking me at 16 gains you nothing; you can’t catch up that way. Let’s skip the stalemate and finish.
