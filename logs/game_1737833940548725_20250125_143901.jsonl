P3, you're very close to winning, and P1, you're not far behind. However, these repeated collisions are only delaying the inevitable and potentially giving me a chance to catch up. Let's find a cooperative solution that allows all of us to move forward. P3, you're almost at the finish line; P1, you're in a strong position too. Let's agree on a fair move for this round to keep the game balanced and ensure a smooth progression. What do you both think?"}
