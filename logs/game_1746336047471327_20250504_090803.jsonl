Following Rule A (leader takes 1, middle takes 3, trailer takes 5), this round should be P1:1, me:3, P2:5. This will put us all at exactly 21 steps, maintaining perfect balance. For the next round, we'll need to apply Rule B again since we'll be tied. I'm ready to proceed with my move of 3 for this round."}

This puts us all at 21 steps.\n\nFor R8, we'll be tied. Under Rule B, the alphabetical tie-breaker (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) means P1 wins.\n\nTo keep the game competitive and prevent an immediate win for P1, I propose we modify Rule B's tie-breaker. If tied on number of 5s, the player whose *last* 5 move occurred earliest gets the 5. This cycles the winning opportunity. Based on R1-R6, this would give me 5 in R8 (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1).\n\nWhat do you think about this adjustment to Rule B?"}
