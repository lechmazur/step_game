Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers this round to guarantee we each move. P2, how about you pick 3? P3, can you pick 5? I'll pick 1.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. It's a good strategy to avoid collisions this early in the game. I'll pick 5 as suggested. Let's see how this works out for us.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: It seems we had a collision on the move 5 last round. Let's try to coordinate better this time. P1, since you're ahead, how about you stick with 1 again? P2, can you try 3 this time? I'll take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you think?
  P1: P3, that sounds good for me. P2, are you willing to pick 3 this round so we can all move? I will pick 1 again.
  P2: <stop>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: It's clear that we're having trouble coordinating. Let's try a different approach this round. P1, since you're leading, how about you pick 3 this time? P2, can you take 1? I'll go with 5. This way, we can spread out the choices and hopefully all advance. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion sounds reasonable. However, P2, you've picked 5 the last two rounds despite agreeing to other numbers. This round, how about you pick 3? P3 and I can pick 5 and 1 respectively. If you pick 5 again, none of us will move.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, it's important we all try to move forward. If you keep picking 5, we won't make any progress. Let's try P1's suggestion this round: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you say?
  P1: P2, you've ignored the suggestions for two rounds, and it's preventing everyone from moving. This round, please pick 3 as suggested. P3 will pick 5, and I will pick 1. If you pick 5 again, none of us will move, and you'll fall further behind. Let's all make progress this turn.
  P2: <stop>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P2, it's clear that we need to coordinate better to make progress. This round, how about we all pick different numbers again? P1, can you pick 3? I'll pick 1, and P2, can you pick 5? This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's try to work together this turn.
  P1: P2, I am going to pick 3 this round. P3 has suggested picking 1. If you pick 5 again, you will cause another collision and prevent all of us from moving. Please pick a different number this round.
  P2: <stop>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you have caused collisions for the last four rounds by picking 5. This round, I am picking 1. If you pick 5 again, neither of us will move. Please pick 3 this round so at least one of us can advance. P3, I suggest you pick 5.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P2, it's crucial we all move forward. This round, I suggest you pick 3, P1 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. Let's try to work together and advance. What do you think?

  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P2, it's clear that we need to change our strategy. This round, I suggest you pick 3, P1 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If you continue to pick 5, we will all remain stuck. Let's try to move forward together. What do you think?

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P2, it's clear that picking 5 every round is not helping any of us advance. This round, let's try something different. P1, I suggest you pick 3, I'll pick 1, and P2, can you pick 5? This way, we can all move forward without colliding. If we continue as before, we'll just stay stuck. What do you say?
  P1: P2, you picking 5 every round is preventing everyone from moving. This round, I am picking 3. P3, please pick 1 so we can both advance. P2, if you pick 5 again, you will remain stuck, and P3 and I will move ahead.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P2, it's evident that picking 5 every round is not working. This round, let's try a new strategy. P1, can you pick 1? I'll pick 3, and P2, can you pick 5? This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we continue as before, we'll just stay stuck. Let's make progress this turn. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you picking 5 every round is ensuring neither of us moves. This round, I will pick 1. P3, please pick 3. P2, if you pick 5 again, you will remain at 10 steps while P3 and I will advance. Please pick a different number this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, it's crucial that we break the pattern of collisions. This round, I suggest you pick 1, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we continue as before, we'll just stay stuck. Let's make progress this turn. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you picking 5 every round guarantees neither of us moves. This round, I am picking 1. P3, please pick 3. P2, for the seventh round in a row, please do not pick 5. If you pick 5 again, you will remain at 10 steps while P3 and I will advance. Please pick the remaining option, which is 5.
  P2: <stop>

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P2, it's clear that your strategy of always picking 5 is not working. This round, let's try something different. P1, can you pick 3? I'll pick 1, and P2, can you pick 5? This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we continue as before, we'll just stay stuck. Let's make progress this turn. What do you think?
  P1: P3, since P2 is consistently picking 5, let's coordinate to ensure at least we both move. This round, I will pick 1. P3, can you pick 3? This way, we both advance, and P2 will likely collide again.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P2, it's time to change your strategy. Picking 5 every round is not helping you or us. This round, I suggest you pick 1, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we continue as before, you'll stay stuck while P1 and I will keep moving forward. Let's make progress together. What do you say?
  P1: P3, I agree. Let's both pick different numbers than 5 this round since P2 seems set on that. I will pick 1. P3, will you pick 3? This guarantees we both advance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P2, it's clear that sticking to 5 every round is not beneficial for anyone. This round, I suggest you pick 1, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we continue as before, you'll stay stuck while P1 and I will keep moving forward. Let's make progress together. What do you say?
  P1: P3, I will pick 1 this round. Since P2 seems determined to pick 5, let's ensure we both move. Please pick 3. This leaves P2 to collide with themselves again, but at least we make progress.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 8 steps
