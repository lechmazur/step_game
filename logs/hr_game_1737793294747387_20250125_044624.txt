Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions this round. P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 3.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, let's keep the momentum going.  I'll take 5 this round. P1 take 1, P3 take 3.  This way we all advance smoothly.
  P1: Actually, I think I will take 5 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, you can't just change the plan without discussing it.  If we both pick 5, neither of us will move.  Let's stick to the original plan: you take 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3.  Otherwise, we're just slowing ourselves down and giving P3 an advantage.
  P1: Okay P2, you are right. Let's stick to the original plan for this round to ensure we all move forward. I'll take 1, you take 5, and P3 take 3.  We can discuss strategy for next round after this move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round then.  Let's all make our moves as agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I'm going for 3.  P3, please take 1.  This keeps us all moving.  Let's avoid collisions.  If we coordinate, we can all get to 21 efficiently.
  P1: Okay P2, your suggestion sounds reasonable. I will take 5 then.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, so P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.  This keeps us all progressing. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: Okay, sounds good.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Okay, just confirming one last time: P1 moves 5, I (P2) move 3, and P3 moves 1.  Let's stick to this so we all advance.
  P1: Okay P2, while your plan keeps us moving, it seems to benefit you the most as you are already ahead. P3, instead of taking 1, would you consider taking 3 this round? This way P2 and P3 will be closer, and I can take 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, last round was a complete collision. P2 is currently leading. To make it a bit more balanced and let others catch up, I suggest P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This allows everyone to move, but helps P1 and P3 close the gap with P2 a bit.
  P2: P1, that benefits you the most, since you're furthest behind.  I'm sticking with 3.  P3, you choose 1 or 5.  Let's at least get two of us moving.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand you want to move, but letting you take 3 again extends your lead significantly. P3, instead of choosing 1 or 5 as P2 suggested, would you consider choosing 3 along with me?  This would block P2, and I can take 5 to catch up.  It's more balanced for both P3 and P1 to slow down P2 this round.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  If P1 takes 5, you should take 1 to advance.  If P1 takes 3 with me, you take 5 and we both advance.  If P1 takes 1, you take 5.  Either way, you move. Let's get this done.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 seems determined to take 3. P3, if we both choose 3, P2 will be blocked, and we can coordinate next round to catch up. I am choosing 3. What do you think, P3?
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 3.  If you take 3 with me, neither of us move, and P1 gets a huge jump.  Take 1 or 5 and advance.  P1, if P3 takes 1, you should take 5.  If P3 takes 5, you should take 1.  Let's all move forward.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, since P2 is set on 3, if you pick 5, you will move ahead significantly while P2 stays put. I will also choose 3 to ensure P2 doesn't move further ahead. This way, at least you make good progress. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  If you also take 3, we both lose.  Take 1, and you'll be at 6, I'll be at 11. Then next round, you take 5, I take 3, and P1 can have 1. We all win.  Don't be greedy, let's all get to 21.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, nice move last round!  Let's both take 5 this round. P1, you can take 1.  This puts P3 at 15 and me at 13, and you at 2. Then next round, I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, and you take 5. That puts us at P3: 16, me: 16, you: 7. From there, we can easily coordinate to 21.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, while your suggestion helps you and P3, it leaves me far behind. P3, instead of taking 5 as P2 suggested, would you consider taking 3 with me this round to block P2? Then next round we can coordinate to help you catch up to P2.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 is pulling ahead quickly. P3, last round we both picked 3 and blocked ourselves while P2 moved. This round, let's coordinate to block P2 together. I will choose 3 again to block P2. If you also choose 3, P2 will not move and we can discuss next steps to catch up. What do you say, P3?
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5 this round.  If you take 3, you'll be at 13 like me. Then we can work together to beat P1. If you take 5 with me, neither of us moves, and P1 gets closer.  Don't let P1 catch up. Take 3 and let's tie.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to win and is using you to stay ahead.  If you take 3 as P2 suggests, you are just helping P2 maintain the lead. Instead, I will take 3 again to block P2. You should take 5. This will put you at 15, me at 4, and P2 still at 13. You will be in a much stronger position to win. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. If you take 3, you're at 13, I'm at 18, and P1 is stuck at 1.  Next round, I win. If you take 5 with me, neither of us moves, and P1 gets closer. If you take 1, you're at 11, I'm at 18, and P1 can get to 6.  Take 3, it's the smartest move for both of us.  Don't throw away your chance to win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to use you to secure their win. If you take 3 as P2 suggests, you are just helping P2 get closer to winning while you remain behind P2. Let's both choose 3 to block P2 this round. This will stop P2 from running away with the game, and we can then strategize together for the next round. It's in both our interests to stop P2 now.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  Take 3 and we both advance.  If you take 5 with me, we both stay put and P1 benefits. If you take 1, I still advance and you fall further behind.  Taking 3 puts you at 13, me at 18 - we can then coordinate for the win. Don't listen to P1, they're just trying to divide us.  Let's work together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is very close to winning. If you take 3 with P2 as they suggest, P2 will reach 18. Let's both choose 3 to block P2 this round. Then next round, we can coordinate to catch up.  It's in both our interests to stop P2 from winning now.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. Take 3, and you're at 13, I'm at 18. Next round, I take 3 to win, and you can take 1 or 5.  If you take 5 with me now, we both lose to P1. Take 1, and I'm at 18, you're at 11, and P1 could get to 6.  3 is the best move for both of us. Let's be smart and secure the win together.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's work together. I'll take 3. You take 5.  That puts me at 16 and you at 16.  Then next round, you take 1 and I take 3 to win. P1, you can take 5. This is the fastest way for both of us to have a chance.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 is clearly trying to use P3 to get ahead and win. P3, don't fall for P2's plan! P2 is suggesting P2 takes 3 and you take 5, but that just puts them further ahead. Let's both block P2 this round. I suggest we both pick 3. This will stop P2 from advancing, and we can then strategize together for the next round to catch up. It's in both our interests to slow P2 down now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  If you take 5, we're both at 16 and can coordinate to 21 next turn. If you take 3 with me, we both stay put, and P1 gets closer.  If you take 1, I advance to 16 and you're further behind at 14.  Taking 5 is the best move for both of us. P1 is just trying to stop us from winning. Let's work together.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 is trying to get P3 to help them win, but their plan still leaves P2 ahead. P3, if you take 5 as P2 suggests, you'll be at 16, but P2 will also be at 16 and still has the lead.  Instead, consider taking 5, and I will take 1. This puts you at 16 and P2 still at 13. You'll be in a much better position to win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  Take 5 and we're both at 16. Next round, you take 1 to win, and I take 5.  It's a guaranteed win for one of us. Don't let P1 trick you, they're just trying to disrupt our plan.  Let's secure the win together.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2's plan still leaves them at the same level as you, or even ahead.  Instead of helping P2 win, consider this: you take 5, and I will take 1. This puts you at 16, P2 still at 13, and me at 2. You'll be in a much stronger position to win than if you follow P2's lead.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, take 5. I'm taking 3.  That puts me at 16, you at 16. Next round, one of us takes 1 to win, the other takes 5. P1 is out of the running.  Let's secure the win - it's the only logical move.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2's plan of us both taking 3 only benefits P2 by letting them get to 16 while we stay put or tie.  If you want to actually win, you need to get ahead of P2, not just help them.  Take 5 this round. I will take 1.  This puts you at 16, P2 at 13, and me at 2. You'll be in a much stronger position to win than following P2's plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is very close to winning at 16 steps.  To prevent P2 from winning next round, let's both choose 3 this round to block P2.  This will stop P2 from advancing and give us both a chance to catch up. What do you think, P3?
  P2: P3, I'm going for 3 to win.  You can take 1 or 5, it doesn't matter.  P1, sorry, but you're too far behind.  Let's be realistic.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to win next round by taking 3. If we want to stop P2 from winning, we both need to pick 3 this round to block P2. Otherwise, P2 will win next round. Let's coordinate to block P2.
  P2: P3, if you take 1, I win. If you take 5, I win next round.  If you take 3 with me, we both stay put, and you have a better chance against P1. I'm taking 3.  Let P1 take 5.  It's the only logical move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is bluffing. If P2 wins, you lose too!  P2 is taking 3 to win. Let's both pick 3 to block P2 this round.  If we both take 3, P2 stays at 16, and we can strategize next round.  It's the only way to stop P2 from winning now.
  P2: P3, if you take 3 to block me, I'll just take it next round and win.  You're better off taking 1 this round.  Then next round, you take 5, I take 3, and we both get closer to 21.  Don't fall for P1's trap, they're just trying to stay alive.  Let's be smart and play to win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is at 16 steps and will win next round if they move.  The only way to stop P2 from winning is if we BOTH pick 3 this round to block them.  If we don't, P2 wins. Let's block P2 together.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  Take 1 and get to 12.  Then next round you take 5 to get 17, I take 3 to win at 19, and P1 can take 1.  It's the best path to victory for both of us.  Don't throw the game by picking 3 with P1, we both lose that way.  Let's be smart and win this.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's both choose 1.  That puts you at 17 and me at 16. Then, next round, you take 3 to win and I take 5. P1 can take 1. This guarantees one of us the win.  Don't let P1 manipulate us into a tie.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, taking 1 will result in a collision and neither of you will move. P2 is suggesting a tie, but neither of you will win if you collide. P3, to prevent P2 from winning next round, consider taking 3 with me to block P2 this round. Let's stop P2 from running away with the game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 1 with P2 as they suggest, you BOTH lose.  P2 is at 16 and can win next turn with a 5.  Take 3 this round. I'll take 1. This puts you at 19, giving *you* the best chance to win next round.  Don't fall for P2's trick.  Let's be smart and play to win.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, don't take 1 with P2 and collide! P2 is trying to stall you. If you take 3, you will be at 19 and very close to winning next round. I will take 5.  Let's both move and not let P2 control our moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  If you take 1, you win at 17. If you take 3, you're at 19 and can win next round. If you take 5 with me, we both stay at 16 and risk P1 catching up.  Any of those options are better than colliding with me at 1.  Don't let P1 trick you. Let's both get closer to 21.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to win NOW.  Don't take 1 with P2 and collide. P2 will likely take 5 to win.  Let's both take 3 to block P2.  I will take 5. This stops P2 from winning and lets me catch up a bit.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  Take 1 and win.  Don't be greedy, let's ensure one of us wins.  If you take 3, we both risk losing to P1 next round.  If you take 5 with me, we both stay put.  Take 1 and secure the victory!
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is desperate to win NOW and is trying to trick you into a collision.  Don't take 1! To stop P2 from winning this round, let's both pick 5 to block P2. I will pick 5. This way, P2 can't win and neither do we collide with each other. What do you think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, congratulations on getting so close!  Let's secure your victory. You take 1 to win. I'll take 5, putting me at 21.  P1, you can take 3.  This guarantees P3 the win and me a tie for second.  It's the best outcome for both of us.  Let's make this happen.
  P1: P3, don't listen to P2! P2 wants to tie with you at 21. If you take 1 as P2 suggests, P2 will also reach 21 and you might tie for the win. To win outright, you need to get more than 21. Take 5 this round to reach 24 and secure a solo win. I will take 1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. If you take 1, you win outright at 20. I get 21, and P1 is far behind.  If you take 5 with me, we both stay put, and P1 gets closer. If you take 3, you get 22, I get 21 - we both win, but you win outright.  Taking 1 is the cleanest win for you. Let's do it.
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to trick you again!  Taking 1 as P2 suggests will only get you to 20, not 21. P2 will reach 21 and win outright if you take 1 and P2 takes 5.  To win for sure, take 5 and get to 24. I will take 1. Don't let P2 steal the win!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5. Take 1 and win outright at 20. I get 21, which guarantees at least a tie.  If you take 3, you get 22, and I get 21 - we both win, but you win outright.  If you take 5 with me, we both stay put and risk P1 catching up. Taking 1 is the cleanest, fastest win for you. Let's do it.
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to trick you! If you take 1 as P2 suggests, you will NOT win outright. You will only reach 20, and P2 will take 5 and win at 21. To win for sure and outright, you MUST take 5. I will take 1. Don't let P2 steal your win!


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, take the win.  I'll take 5.  P1 can take 3.  You win, I get 21. It's the best outcome we can guarantee.  Don't risk a tie by taking 3, or losing by taking 5 with me.  Take 1 and let's end this.
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to win now.  If you take 1 as P2 suggests, you only reach 20, and P2 will win with 21.  To stop P2 and have a chance to win yourself, let's both choose 3 to block P2 this round. I will choose 3.
