Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 1 this round.  You two decide who takes 3 and who takes 5.  Sound good?
  P1: Okay, P3's suggestion is reasonable to avoid collisions. P2, how about you take <move>3</move> and I will take <move>5</move> this round?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with avoiding collisions. Since P3 is taking <move>1</move> and P1 is taking <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move> this round. Let's see how this goes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, round 2. Let's keep the same moves as last round to keep avoiding collisions. P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move> again? Sound good?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick with the plan.  I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.
  P2: Agreed, let's stick with the plan to avoid any collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> again this round. P1 and P3, let's keep this coordination to ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's mix it up this round to keep the game interesting and unpredictable. How about P3 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This will help us avoid any patterns that the others might exploit. What do you think?
  P1: Hmm, mixing it up sounds risky. We are progressing smoothly with the current arrangement (P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>).  Let's stick with that for now to keep making good progress, and then maybe adjust later? What do you think P2, P3?
  P3: I agree with P1.  Let's not get fancy.  Sticking with the 1, 3, 5 order is the safest way to win.  I'm two rounds behind, so I need to keep collecting these ones.  P2, you're only at 6, so you benefit too.  Let's stick with the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the need for a steady progress, but we should also consider the dynamics of the game. Since P1 is leading, it might be wise to mix things up to keep the game balanced. How about this: P3, you take <move>1</move> as usual, P1, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round. This way, we can all advance without risking a collision. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I still think sticking with P3 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>5</move> is the most reliable way to keep advancing without collisions. Let's keep this order for round 3 to ensure we all make progress. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to mix things up, but I'm significantly behind at only 2 steps.  I need to catch up.  Sticking with the plan gives me the best chance of doing that without collisions.  Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for now. We can revisit a new strategy in a couple more rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see your points, P1 and P3. Let's stick with the plan for now to ensure steady progress. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P1, you take <move>5</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. We can reassess in a couple of rounds if needed.
  P1: Okay, since we all agree, let's lock in <move>1</move> for P3, <move>3</move> for P2, and <move>5</move> for me again this round.  Let's keep this going.
  P3: Okay, let's lock it in. 1 for me, 3 for P2, and 5 for P1.  Let's keep this train rolling.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, round 4.  Let's keep our successful strategy of no collisions going.  P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move> again this round.  This is working well for steady progress.  Sound good to you both?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P1. Our current strategy is working well, and we should continue to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round, P3, you take <move>1</move>, and P1, you take <move>5</move>. This will help us all make steady progress. Let’s keep this up and see how it goes.
  P3: Agreed.  1, 3, 5. Let's keep this train rolling.  I still need to catch up!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2, great, sounds like we are all on the same page for this round. Let's lock in <move>1</move> for P3, <move>3</move> for P2, and <move>5</move> for me again.
  P2: P1, P3, I think it's important to maintain our current strategy to ensure steady progress without collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P3, you take <move>1</move>, and P1, you take <move>5</move>. This will help us all advance smoothly and avoid any risks. Let's keep this going.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all agreed.  Let's lock it in again.  1 for me, 3 for P2, and 5 for P1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick with the 1, 3, 5 strategy for two more rounds.  Then, in round 7, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will put me at 9, P2 at 18, and P1 at 21. From there, we can adjust as needed.  Does that sound fair?
  P1: P3, that sounds like a good plan to keep the steady progress. Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round and the next as you suggested. Then we can see where we are.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's plan to stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round and the next. This will help us all make steady progress without collisions. After that, we can reassess and adjust as needed. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. Let's keep this going.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good P1 and P2.  Let's lock in 1, 3, 5 again for this round.  Two more rounds of this and then we switch it up in round 7 as planned.
  P1: Sounds good. Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round and next. Ready to move.
  P2: P1, P3, I think P3's plan is solid. Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round and the next. This will help P3 catch up a bit more. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. After these two rounds, we can reassess and adjust our strategy if needed. Let's keep the momentum going.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan. 1 for me, 3 for P2, and 5 for P1 this round and next.  Then we execute the switch in round 7.  Let's lock it in.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round with 1, 3, 5 and next round too.  Let's proceed with our moves for this round then.
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should stick with the plan to keep the momentum going. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P3, you take <move>1</move>, and P1, you take <move>5</move>. This will help us all advance steadily and avoid any collisions. After these two rounds, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Let's keep the train rolling.
