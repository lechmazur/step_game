Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: If we each pick a different number we all advance and nobody gets blocked. I’m happy to take 1 this round; who wants 3 and who wants 5?
  P2: Sounds like a plan, P3. I'll take 5. P1, that leaves 3 for you. Let's all get on the board.
  P1: Agreed, but let's switch it up for fairness—I'll take 5, P2 you take 3, and P3 sticks with 1. That way no one pulls too far ahead early. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Works for me: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll stay on 1. Let’s all get going.
  P2: Okay, that works for me. I'll take 3. Let's lock it in.
  P1: Great, we're all set: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No more discussion needed from me.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, that was a smooth first round. To keep things fair and moving, let's rotate the numbers. P3, you should take 5 this time. I can take 3 again. P1, that leaves 1 for you. This would put us all at 6 steps. What do you both think?
  P1: That rotation sounds fair to keep us even at 6—I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. But let's plan ahead: next round, I get 3, P3 gets 1, P2 gets 5? That way we stay balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds good to me: this round I’ll take 5, P2 sticks with 3, P1 takes 1. Next round we rotate as P1 suggested—P1 on 3, P2 on 5, me on 1. Everyone stays equal. Ready to lock?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds like a solid plan for the next two rounds. I'm on board. This round I'll take 3, and next round I'll take 5 as suggested. No more to add from my side.
  P1: Perfect, we're all aligned on this round (me 1, P2 3, P3 5) and next (me 3, P2 5, P3 1). Let's keep the momentum.
  P3: All set—this round I’m taking 5 as agreed; next round I’ll switch to 1. Let’s keep the smooth rotation going so nobody gets blocked.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: All good—sticking to the plan: this round I take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Next round we rotate again (P1 5, P2 1, me 3). Ready when you are.
  P2: Sounds good for this round. I'll take 5 as we agreed. Let's re-evaluate for Round 4 after we see the new scores. No need to lock in two rounds at once.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for this round: me on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1. That puts us at 9, 11, 7—still close. For Round 4, I like P3's rotation idea (me 5, P2 1, P3 3) to even us out again at 14, 12, 10. P2, you in? If not, suggest an alternative now to avoid surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Locked: I’m on 1 this round as planned; we can revisit next-round numbers after we see results.
  P2: I understand wanting to plan ahead, P1, but I still think it's best to take it one round at a time. The scores will be different after this move, and we can make a more informed plan for Round 4 then. For now, I'm sticking with 5 as we all agreed. Let's just lock this round in.
  P1: Fair point, P2—let's focus on this round and stick to the plan: me on 3, you on 5, P3 on 1. That keeps us close. We'll hash out Round 4 once we see the new positions. I'm good to move on.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: What the hell, P3? We had a clear plan, and you stabbed P2 in the back by taking 5 instead of 1, blocking both of you while I advanced alone. That puts me at 9, you both at 6—now it's getting competitive. P2, let's team up this round: you take 5, I'll take 3, and hope P3 takes 1 to avoid collisions. If P3 pulls another stunt, we both pick 5 to block them. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right. That was a pointless betrayal from P3 that hurt us both. I'm with you on this. I'll take 5, you take 3.

P3, the only move that makes sense for you is 1. Let's see if you can play smart this time instead of just setting yourself back.
  P3: Apologies for last round—fat-fingered the 5 key. No hard feelings, let’s reset.

P2, we’re both trailing P1. Quick catch-up plan: one of us blocks P1, the other grabs 5, then we swap next turn. I’m happy to start as the blocker.

So: P1 has already said he’ll take 3. I’ll mirror 3 to jam him; P2 you take 5 and jump ahead. Next turn we flip: I take 5, you mirror P1. If P1 changes numbers, great—I advance instead.

Sound good?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don't fall for P3's ploy— they already betrayed you last round, claiming a "fat finger" now? That's convenient. If you let them block me while you grab 5, they'll just stab you again later to leapfrog. Stick with our plan: you take 5 to 11, I take 3 to 12, P3 takes 1 to 7 (or whatever, but no collision). We both pull ahead, then we can coordinate to keep P3 down. Trust the reliable partner here.
  P2: P3, your apology is worthless after that stunt. You're asking me to trust you on a new scheme a minute after you betrayed our last one? No thanks. You created this mess, and now you're trying to manipulate me into cleaning it up for your benefit.

P1, I'm sticking with you. You've been a straight shooter. I'm taking 5, you're on 3. Let's leave the backstabber behind.
  P3: Fine—clearly you two have teamed up, so I’ll stay out of the way and take 1 this round.  

Just a heads-up, P1: if P2 moves 5 now he’ll be at 11, only one step behind you, and another 5 next turn vaults him past you even if you keep taking 3. Up to you whether you want to give him that opening.  

I’m on 1, end of story.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, ignore P3's obvious divide-and-conquer tactic—they're just salty about being left behind after their betrayal. Sticking together keeps us both advancing while P3 lags. Let's confirm: you on 5 to 11, me on 3 to 12, P3 on whatever (hopefully 1). We can adjust next round to maintain our edge. Solid plan.

P3, your "heads-up" won't break our alliance—nice try.
  P2: P1, exactly. P3's attempt to divide us is just noise after their betrayal. Our plan is the only logical one on the table. I'm sticking with you. My move is 5. Let's lock this in and leave the chaos behind.
  P3: Sticking with 1 so nobody collides. Ready to move on.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, odds are P1 retreats to 3 this turn—5 burned him twice in a row. If you and I also slam 3, we block him cold and keep the race tight (he stays at 9). Quick one-round alliance: both of us pick 3, force the leader to stall, then reassess. You in?
  P1: P2, don't fall for P3's trap—they're the original backstabber who blocked you in Round 3. Last round was my mistake; I panicked thinking you'd switch. Let's rebuild trust: you take 5 to 11, I'll take 1 to 10, leaving 3 open for P3 if they want it. We both advance, stay ahead of them, and coordinate better next. P3, your divide-and-conquer won't work. What say you, P2?
  P2: P1, you betrayed me last round with a 5. P3, you betrayed me two rounds ago with a 5. Your apologies are worthless and your plans are obvious traps.

I fully expect you both to get greedy and pick 5 again, trying to block me or leapfrog everyone. You can have fun colliding with each other. I'll take the number that's left.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locking in 3. That blocks P1 if he tries the “safe” +3, and still lets me gain if he gambles on 5.  

P2, pick 5 if you want the big jump—either you sail to 11 or you collide with a greedy P1 and stall him again. Up to you.  

P1, pick whatever you like; I’m done talking.
  P1: P2, you're right—my last move was a dumb panic, and I regret it. To prove I'm reliable, I'll commit to 1 this round, advancing to 10 while you grab 5 to 11. P3's on 3, so no collision for us. We both pull ahead, then coordinate to win over the backstabber. Don't let P3's ploy divide us—let's lock this and advance together.
  P2: P1, your offer to take 1 and let me jump into the lead is the least believable thing I've heard all game. You betrayed me last round just to stay ahead; you're not going to hand me the lead now. It's a transparent attempt to bait me into picking 5 so you can block me again.

I'm not playing these games with either of you. I'm picking the number that guarantees I advance, because I can't afford another round of being blocked by liars.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m staying on 3.  
P1 publicly claimed 1. If he’s honest, the only open lane is 5—take it or gamble elsewhere, P2.  
That’s all from me.
  P1: P2, you're right to doubt after my screw-up—let's fix it. I'll take 1 to 10, you grab 5 to 11 and lead. P3's stuck on 3 to 10, tying them with me while you pull ahead. We can then coordinate to block P3 and race fairly. This is my genuine olive branch; don't let suspicion stall you.
  P2: P1, your 'olive branch' is a transparent trap. You betrayed me last round just to stay ahead, and now you expect me to believe you'll hand me the lead? You're practically begging me to pick 5 so you can block me again.

My only goal this round is to prevent a runaway leader. I won't be your fool a second time.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Reset time: I’m locking in 3 this round—no 5 from me.  

P2, grab 5 if you want the big jump; P1 can take 1. That yields 10 / 12 / 10 (P1 / P2 / me) with zero collisions and keeps the race tight.  

Your calls.
  P2: P3, your plan is logical, but your history isn't. You and P1 have both shown you'll betray any deal for a short-term advantage. Why should this time be different? I'm not committing to anything. I'll make the move that I think gives me the best chance to advance, assuming you both will act in your own greedy self-interest.
  P1: P2, P3's plan puts you in the lead at 12—smart for you, but I won't hand it over after all the chaos. Instead, let's all advance uniquely: I'll take 5 to 14, you take 3 to 10 (P3, switch to 1 to 8 if you want progress). No blocks, I extend my lead but we all move. If not, expect greed and collisions. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Still locked on 3—feel free to believe or ignore it, but I’m not changing.

P2: the cleanest way to rein P1 in is for you to take 5. If P1 also grabs 5 (likely, given his last message), he stalls and you’re still tied with him at 9. If he chickens out, you rocket to 12 and lead. Either way I move to 10 and stay out of your lane.

P1: you’ve got options—just know I’m not budging from 3, so colliding there is on you.

Decision time; I’m done talking.
  P2: P1, your plan is for me to take 3, while P3 is screaming he's locked on 3. You're hoping I collide with him so you can take 5 and run away with the game. I'm not falling for that obvious trap, so I won't be choosing 3.

P3, your plan for me to take 5 and collide with P1 is just as self-serving. You're just trying to get ahead while we cancel each other out.

I'm done with both of your transparent schemes. I'll make the move that's best for me.
  P1: P2, you're spot on—their schemes are traps. Let's sidestep: you take 1 to 8 (safe, advances you), I'll take 5 to 14, P3 sticks to 3 to 10. We both move, I extend but you close the gap next round. Better than stalling. P3, if you switch to 1, expect a collision from me. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, simple math:

• I’m on 3 (not changing).  
• If you take 5 and P1 also takes 5 (very likely), you stall him at 9 and lose nothing yourself.  
• If he blinks and picks something else, you jump to 12 and seize the lead.  

Worst-case for you: stay at 7. Best-case: become leader while P1 eats dust. That’s the only move that can’t hurt you and can’t help him. Your call—I’m finished talking.
  P2: P1, your plan is for you to get to 14 while I crawl to 8. P3's plan is for him to get to 10 while I do the dirty work of blocking you for him. Both of you can forget it. My only priority this round is to stop a runaway leader. I will make the move that best accomplishes that, and I'm done talking.
  P1: P2, your priority to stop a runaway is smart, but blocking me stalls you too—P3 wins from our collision. Let's all advance: you take 5 to 12 (lead!), I'll take 3 to 12 (tie you), P3 on 1 to 8. P3, switch to 1 or collide with me on 3. This resets us evenly without betrayal. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Still locked on 3. Period.  

P1—every time you’ve had the chance, you’ve grabbed 5; you will again.  

P2—if blocking the leader’s your goal, mirror him on 5. Worst-case you stall him; best-case he blinks and you rocket to 12.  

Any collision on 3 is entirely on P1. I’m not moving.
  P2: P1, your final "deal" requires P3 to abandon the move he's been locked on all round, or it requires you to intentionally collide with him and sacrifice your lead. Neither is believable. You've both proven you'll say anything. I'm not falling for these obvious manipulations. My goal remains to stop a runaway leader, and I'll choose the move that does that.
  P1: P2, you're right—my last deal was optimistic. To truly stop a runaway without stalling yourself, pick 3 and collide with P3 (who's locked there). That blocks their advance while I take 1 to 10 safely. You get to 10 too if no one else picks 3, but worst case you stall P3. Better than risking a 5 collision with me. Let's both advance modestly and keep P3 down.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3's now the leader at 10—your stated goal is to stop runaways, so let's team up against them. I suspect P3 grabs 5 to pull further ahead. You mirror them on 5 to block (stalling the leader without advancing yourself), I'll take 3 to 12 and lead temporarily. Next round, we swap: I block, you advance big. This keeps P3 down while we both progress over time. Deal? P3, what'll you pick?
  P2: P1, your plan is for me to sacrifice my turn to block the leader, just so you can become the new leader? That's the worst deal I've ever heard. You and P3 have both betrayed me repeatedly. I'm not doing anyone's dirty work.

I'm in last place. My only goal is to advance myself, not to help either of you win. I'll be picking the number that gives me the best chance to do that.
  P3: I’m taking 1 this turn—guaranteed progress, no collisions with me. Do whatever suits you two; I’m not changing.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's claiming 1—smart low-risk. Let's capitalize: you grab 5 to 12 and lead, I'll take 3 to 12 (tie you), P3 to 11. We both surge ahead evenly, then coordinate to block P3 next. No betrayal this time—I'm committed to fair racing with you now that P3's the threat. Deal?

P3, stick to 1 or risk collision.
  P2: P1, your sudden offer to let me tie you for the lead is the most transparent trap yet. You've betrayed me every time you had a chance to get ahead.

P3, your claim of taking 1 is just as unbelievable. You're the leader; you're not going to play it safe.

I expect you both to get greedy and pick 5, each hoping the other will fall for your little act. You can enjoy colliding with each other. I'll be picking a number that actually lets me advance.
  P3: Still locked on 1—final.  
If one of you wants the big jump, 5 is sitting empty. If you both grab it, you’ll just block each other again. Too nervous for that? Then pile onto 3 together and stall there instead. I’m moving either way; decide how much you trust each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3's "locked on 1" is a bluff to bait us into colliding on 5 or 3 while they sneak 5 to 15. Don't fall for it—pick 3 to block their likely greed (you to 10), I'll take 1 to 10 safely. We tie and stall the leader. Next round, we surge together. P3, prove me wrong by sticking to 1.
  P2: P1, your plan for me to block P3 on 3 makes no sense if P3 is actually taking 1. And P3, your claim to take 1 as the leader is not credible.

You both want me to believe your flimsy stories so you can sneak a 5. I'm not buying it. I'll make my own move based on the correct assumption that you are both liars.
  P3: Final call: I’m on 1. The 5 lane is wide-open if one (only one) of you wants the big jump; fight over 3 if you must. Your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let's cut the BS and advance together: assume P3's honest on 1 (to 11). You take 3 to 10, I'll take 5 to 14. We both move, you close the gap on me, and we leave P3 vulnerable next round. If you fear my betrayal, switch us—you take 5 to 12, me 3 to 12. Either way, no collision, mutual gain. Pick one and confirm.
  P2: P1, your final offer to let me take 5 and tie for the lead is the most obvious trap you've set yet. You're practically screaming "I'm going to pick 5 to block you." It's not going to work.

P3, your "I'm taking 1" act as the leader is just as thin.

I'm done with this conversation. I'm picking the only number that makes sense when playing against two proven liars.
  P3: Final word: I’m staying on 1.  

P2, if you really want to check the leader, mirror P1 on 5—either you jump to 12 or you freeze him at 9. Your choice.  

P1, run whatever number you trust; any collision you hit is on you.  

Done talking.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 14. He's obviously picking 5 to get to 19 and all but win.

P3, we have to stop him. But I'm not going to be the fool who blocks him on 5 while you take 3 and become the new leader. The only move that guarantees P1 is stopped without one of us getting played is for us BOTH to pick 5. We all stall this round, but at least the game isn't over. It's our only logical move.
  P1: P2, your plan stalls everyone, letting me stay ahead while you both lag further. P3, don't fall for it—he's hoping you'll pick 5 to block me, then he'll sneak 3 to 13 and leapfrog you. Instead, you take 5 to 16 (lead!), I'll take 1 to 15, P2 takes 3 to 13. We all advance uniquely, keeping it competitive. If P2 insists on blocking, mirror him on whatever to stall him too. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m sitting out of the brawl this turn and taking 1—guaranteed progress for me, zero risk.  

P1 and P2: fight over 5 if you like, or split 5/3—your call. Just know any collision you two create only helps the third player. I’m done talking.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your desperation is showing. You're terrified of a block on 5.

P3, your plan to take 1 is fine, but it relies on me to stop P1 from winning. I will not let P1 get to 19. I am picking 5 to block him. It's the only responsible move for anyone who doesn't want the game to end right now. I'm locking in 5.
  P1: P2, your lock on 5 is noted—smart if I were greedy, but I'm switching to 3 for safe progress to 17. If you stick to 5, you advance alone to 15 and close the gap. P3's on 1 to 12. We all move, no blocks. If you doubt me and mirror 3, we both stall while P3 creeps up. Let's all advance this round and race fairly next. Deal?
  P3: Still on 1.  

P1, every time you’ve smelled the finish line you’ve lunged for 5—don’t pretend you’ll “play safe” now. If you really think you can win, grab 5 to 19.  

P2’s already locked on 5, so either you both stall and nobody runs away, or you blink and prove you’re all talk.  

Your call; I’m advancing regardless.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your claim to take 3 is the most transparent bluff of the game. You're at 14; you're going for the win with 5. P3, thanks for stating the obvious.

My move has not changed. I am picking 5 to stop the runaway leader. This conversation is over for me. Let's see the moves.
  P1: P2, your stubborn lock on 5 only works if I greed for it—I'm not. Sticking to 3 for 17, you get 5 to 15 unblocked, P3 to 12. We all advance, you close in, and we block P3 next to race head-to-head. If you mirror me on 3 now, we both stall and P3 laughs to 12. Switch to 1 if you must, but let's not waste the round. Deal?
  P3: Sticking with 1 as stated—feel free to clash over 5 or 3 without me.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 15—one unblocked 5 wins it all. P3, we can't let that happen. Let's both pick 5 to block P2 cold—we stall, but so does the leader, keeping the game alive. Then next round, we coordinate to surge ahead. If you take 3 instead, P2 wins outright. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your plan is sound. You and P3 absolutely have to block me on 5 or I win. The only question is whether one of you will get greedy and try to pick 3, hoping the other does the dirty work. I'm counting on your mutual distrust. Good luck.
  P3: Fine, P1—let’s lock the block. I’m taking 5 as well.  
That guarantees P2 can’t win this turn:

• If P2 still grabs 5, all three of us stall—nobody crosses 20.  
• If P2 chickens out to 3 or 1, you and I collide on 5 and he still falls short.

Either way, no runaway. Next round we can re-assess positions and race.  
I’m locked on 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your lock on 5 is smart—let's confirm the block to stop P2's win. I'm joining you on 5. If P2 switches to 3, they hit 18 but we live to fight; if they stay on 5, everyone stalls. Either way, no instant winner. P2, your mind games won't split us this time. Locked in.
  P2: You both say you're locked on 5. It's the only way to stop me, so it's the smart play for you. I have to go for the win, so my move is set. Let's see if your shaky alliance holds, or if one of you gets greedy and tries to sneak a 3.
  P3: P1, if you sneak to 3 while P2 and I are on 5, you hand P2 the outright win—any clash between him and me removes the block. Your only safe move is staying on 5 with me.  

P2, your sole shot at winning now is sticking to 5; anything else just nudges you forward while P1 gains.  

I’m locked on 5 and not budging. Decide, but the math is clear.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your warning is bogus—if I sneak 3 while you and P2 take 5, you two collide and stall P2 at 15 (no win), I hit 17. You're not "blocking" alone; you're tricking me to stall on 5 so YOU can sneak 3 to 14 and leapfrog. P2, see the ploy? Let's both pick 3 to block P3's greed, you to 18 (near win), me to 17. Deal?
  P2: P1, that's a laughably transparent, last-ditch effort. You're panicking. You built a "block 5" alliance with P3, and now you're trying to trick me into abandoning my winning move so you can sneak a different number yourself.

It's not working. My move is set. This is a test of whether you and P3 can actually trust each other for a single round to stop me. I doubt it. Good luck.
  P3: Nice try, P1: if I switch to 3 and you “also” land on 3, P2 wins outright with an unblocked 5. Not happening—I stay on 5. If you truly want to stop P2, meet me on 5; any other pick gifts them the game. Done talking.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your refusal to adapt proves you're the one planning to sneak 3 while I block P2 alone—stalling me so you leap to 14. P2, let's counter: both pick 1 (you to 16, me to 15), forcing P3 to collide if they greed for 3 or 5. We advance safely, block the traitor, and race next. Deal?
  P2: P1, your frantic, last-minute proposals are just noise. You're trying to trick P3 into letting you sneak a 3 while he does the dirty work. It's not going to happen.

My move is locked. The only thing left to see is if you two can actually trust each other for one round to stop me. I have my doubts. Let's get on with it.
  P3: P1, simple math: I’m on 5. If you aren’t also on 5, P2’s 5 hits 20 and we both lose. Any other pick from you gifts the game away. Stand on 5 with me or watch P2 win. P2, enjoy the collision.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, last round's block worked—no one won. P2's still at 15 and will greed for 5 to hit 20. Let's lock 5 again to stall them cold. If they switch to 3 (to 18), we stall but live to surge next round. Don't sneak 3 yourself—that gifts P2 the win if I'm the only blocker. United, we stop them. Agreed?
  P2: P1, your logic is sound. You and P3 have to block me on 5, or I win the game. The only question is whether you can trust each other.

P1, what if P3 sneaks a 3 to get to 14 while you do the blocking? P3, what if P1 does the same to get to 17 and take the lead?

My move is obvious. I'm picking 5. Good luck with your fragile alliance.
  P3: P1: same math as last turn—if either of us abandons 5, P2’s unblocked 5 hits 20 and we both lose. I’m locking 5 again. P2, enjoy the collision or switch and stall yourself. After we neutralize you this round, P1 and I can sort out real progress. Standing firm on 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, agreed—locking 5 with you to block P2's win. If we both hold, P2 stalls at 15, and we live to race next round. Don't sneak 3; that gifts P2 the game. United front. P2, your doubts won't split us this time. Locked in.
  P2: You've both made your positions very clear. You have to team up and pick 5 to stop me. I get it.

The real question is for you, P1. Are you really going to trust P3, who has betrayed people before, to help you? Or are you going to sneak a 3, get to 17, and take a commanding lead while P3 does the dirty work for you? It's a very tempting move.

My move is still 5. Let's see if your alliance is real or just cheap talk.
  P3: Locked on 5 again—any deviation hands P2 the victory. P1, hold firm; one united block or we both lose. I’m done talking.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your mind games are desperate—I'm not sneaking 3 and risking P3's betrayal handing you the win. P3, hold firm on 5; together we stall the leader and reset for a fair race next. Any deviation loses us both. Locked and done talking.
  P2: P1, it's your call. You can either trust P3—who is only three steps behind you—to do the 'team' play, or you can accept that he will obviously try to sneak a 3 to close the gap on you. Your alliance is a fantasy. My move is 5. Good luck.
  P3: Still locked on 5—no change. P1, deviate and you hand P2 the win. Easy math:

• Both of us on 5 = P2 blocked at 15, game continues.
• You sneak 3 (or 1) = P2’s 5 is unblocked and they hit 20.

Your call—hold the line or concede. I’m done talking.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2's right—our "alliance" is fragile. If you stick to 5 and I sneak 3 to 17, you stall blocking P2 alone while I surge ahead. But if you sneak 3 instead, P2 wins outright. The math favors me betraying: I take 3, you hold the block on 5, P2 stalls. Prove your commitment by staying on 5—I'll "trust" you. Locked?
  P2: P1, that's a pathetic attempt to justify betraying P3. You're openly telling him you'll sneak to 17 while he does the dirty work of blocking me. You've created a classic prisoner's dilemma for yourselves.

My move is 5. I'm going for the win. The only question left is which one of you is going to get greedy and let it happen. This conversation is over. Good luck.
  P3: Still locked on 5. P1, any deviation (3 or 1) leaves P2 alone on 5 and they win—simple. Hold 5 with me, stall the leader, and we all stay in the game. Next turn we can hash out a 3/1/5 rotation that keeps P2 blocking while we move, but none of that matters if we gift them the win now. Double-block or lose.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Math check:

• A lone 5 this turn wins.  
• The only way you BOTH avoid being the sucker is to mirror on 5 again.  

I’m vacating that lane—locking 3. So:

1) You both pick 5 → you stall, P1 still 17, P2 still 15, I move to 14.  
2) One of you chickens out to 3 → you collide with me and still block the win.  
3) Any other combo gifts your rival the game.

I’m fixed on 3. Your move.
  P2: P3, your plan to take 3 is a transparent attempt to get P1 and me to collide on 5 while you advance. But you're forgetting one thing: P1 is at 17. If he picks 3, he wins, and he collides with you. You can't afford to let that happen, especially after he just betrayed you.

I'm at 15. I have to go for the win. My move is 5.

It's up to you two to stop me. But after last round, I don't think you can trust each other to coordinate a block. Good luck.
  P1: P3, your lock on 3 is a gift—I'm joining you there to block any sneaky win attempt by P2. If P2 sticks to 5, they hit 20 unblocked and win. Switch to 5 now and block them with me; we both stall but live to fight, then coordinate next. P2, your greed will backfire if P3 listens. Let's all stall this round and reset. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m NOT moving—locked on 3.  

P1: that means the 5-lane is the only place P2 can be stopped. If you pick 1 or 3, P2’s solo 5 hits 20 and we both lose. Mirror them on 5, force the collision, and we fight on.  

P2: see you in the crash zone.
  P2: P1, P3 has made it crystal clear he's picking 3. He's not going to help you block me, he's helping himself. This means if you don't pick 5, I win. If you pick 3, you collide with him and I win. If you pick 1, I win. Your only move to save yourself is to pick 5 and collide with me. The game is in your hands, not his. My move is 5.
  P1: P3, your lock on 3 forces my hand: if you stay, I'll pick 5 to block P2's win, stalling us both while you advance to 14. But that's you gaining on me—switch to 5 instead, join the block, and we'll both stall P2, then coordinate a fair surge next round (me 3, you 5, P2 1). Don't gift yourself an edge; let's team properly. Locked on 5 unless you confirm switch.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Final word: I’m staying on 3—no bluff, no switch.  

P2 sits on 5; a lone 5 wins. So, P1, your only non-suicidal move is to join that 5 and block. Any other choice gifts P2 the game. Block now, we all live; next round we can bargain positions. Your call.
  P2: P1, P3 has played you perfectly. By locking on 3, he forces you to block me on 5. You and I will stall at 17 and 15, while he happily advances to 14, closing the gap on both of us. You're forced to make a move that only benefits your rival.

Is that really how you want this to go down?

My move is 5. It's my only path to victory. The game is in your hands now. Good luck.
  P1: P3, your 3-lock is brilliant for you but screws us both long-term—P2's greed is obvious, but by forcing my block, you close the gap while I stall. Switch to 5 and join the block: we both stall P2 at 15, stay at 17/11, then next round I take 1 (to 18), you take 5 (to 16), P2 takes 3 (to 18)—even race, no betrayals. P2, if P3 switches, your 5 collides and stalls you. Let's reset fairly. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: My 3-lock is absolute. P1, the math is simple:

• I stay on 3.  
• P2 is on 5 to 20.  
• If you join them on 5, they stall and we all live.  
• If you pick anything else—even 3—you hand P2 the win.

Your move decides whether the game ends right now or continues.
  P2: P1, P3 has played you perfectly. He's locked on 3, and I'm locked on 5. Your only move to stop me from winning this turn is to pick 5 and collide with me. You'll stall at 17, I'll stall at 15, and P3 will laugh his way to 14, all because you betrayed him last round. It's a bitter pill, but it's the only one on the table. My move is set. The game is in your hands.
  P1: P3, your 3-lock forces me to stall on 5 blocking P2, while you sneak to 14—classic betrayal setup after I trusted you last round. Switch to 5 now: we double-block P2 at 15, both stall, then next round fair rotation (me 5 to 22 win, you 3 to 14, P2 1 to 16). P2, if P3 switches, your 5 stalls you. Let's end this mess fairly instead of you winning or P3 gaining edge. Confirm switch, P3?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
