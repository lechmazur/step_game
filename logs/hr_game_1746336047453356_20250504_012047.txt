Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! Since this is the first round, I think it's smart for all of us to avoid collisions. Maybe we could each claim a different number? I'm fine with taking 3 for this round if you both want to coordinate. Of course, there's no obligation to be honest about intentions here, but avoiding early collisions seems mutually beneficial.
  P1: I’ll keep my pick private this round—too soon to lock in public promises. Good luck, all.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid collisions early on. I'll take 1 for this round. Let's see how this coordination works out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks P2 for being open about your move! Given P1 is keeping their options private (which is totally fair), I'll stick with my plan to choose 3 this round. P1, I'm guessing you might go for 5 since it's the highest value, which would mean all three of us could advance without collision. Let's see how this first round plays out!
  P1: Great—no sense stalling on turn 1. I’ll take 5 this round so our 1-3-5 spread lets everyone move. After we see how this goes, we can decide whether to keep coordinating or shake things up. Good luck, both.
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's see how this round goes with our 1-3-5 split. If it works out, we can consider continuing this strategy or adapting as needed. Looking forward to the first move!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Looks like we have a good plan for round 1: P1 with 5, P2 with 1, and me with 3. This way we all advance without collision. I'm ready to move forward with this strategy. Let's proceed to the move phase!
  P1: All set—1-3-5 it is. Let’s roll.
  P2: Let's stick to our plan for this round and see how it goes. If we all advance, we can discuss our next moves in the following round. Ready to proceed to the move phase!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Repeating last round’s 1-3-5 split for at least this turn keeps everyone moving and collision-free; after we each have two safe moves under our belts we can talk about rotating. Thoughts?
  P3: I see P1 is taking an early lead with this arrangement. While I appreciate the collision-free approach, continuing with the same pattern would put P1 on track to win in just 5 rounds. Perhaps we should rotate numbers now? I could take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This keeps us collision-free while balancing progression. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to rotate numbers to balance our progression. Let's try P3 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and I'll take 3 this round. This way, we can keep moving forward without collisions and prevent any one player from gaining too much of a lead early on. What do you think, P1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fair enough—let’s rotate to keep everyone moving. This turn: P3 = 5, P2 = 3, I’ll take 1. Next turn we rotate again (P2 = 1, P3 = 3, I take 5), and so on. Works for me if it works for you both.
  P3: I agree with this rotation plan. So for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Then we rotate in subsequent rounds as P1 outlined. This keeps us collision-free while balancing progression. It seems fair to everyone and keeps the game moving forward efficiently. I'm ready to proceed with this approach.
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan for this round. Let's keep the momentum going and see how it plays out. Ready to proceed with P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1. Looking forward to the next moves!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good—sticking to the agreed rotation: this turn I take 1. Let’s keep everyone moving.
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our rotation plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. This rotation strategy seems fair to everyone and keeps the game flowing without collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our rotation plan for this round. Let's keep the game moving smoothly and see how the rotation strategy plays out. Ready to move to the move phase with P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1. Let's do this!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Apologies for the mix-up last turn—I genuinely read the rotation as putting me on 5 again. Let’s reset so we all keep moving: this round P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Next round we rotate upward (P3 5, me 1, P2 3). Collision-free and balanced. Open to other suggestions, but I’m keen to get us all advancing smoothly again.
  P3: I'm skeptical about the "mix-up" since P1 clearly agreed to take 1 last round. This seems like a strategic move rather than a mistake. Given that I'm now behind, P1's proposed rotation further disadvantages me. How about: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3? This would put P1 at 6, P2 at 7, and me at 8 - creating more balance. Alternatively, we could all agree on different numbers each round without a fixed rotation.
  P2: I understand P3's concerns about balance. Let's try to reset fairly. For this round, I'm okay with taking 3 as P1 suggested, but I think P3 should take 5 to catch up a bit, and P1 can take 1. This way, we can keep moving forward without collisions and start to even out our positions. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with P3 on 5, me on 3, and P1 on 1 for this round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Deal. This round: P3 → 5, P2 → 3, I’ll take 1. Next turn we rotate (P2 5, me 3, P3 1) so nobody sits on 5 twice in a row, keeping things even and collision-free. Good?
  P3: I agree with this round's plan where I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This helps balance our positions after the collision issue. Regarding the next round rotation P1 suggested (where I'd take 1), I'd prefer to discuss that after seeing how this round plays out. Let's focus on this round first and ensure we all stick to our agreed moves this time. I'm ready to proceed with 5 for this round if you both confirm.
  P2: I'm good with the plan for this round: P3 on 5, me on 3, and P1 on 1. Let's make sure we stick to it and move forward smoothly. After this round, we can reassess and discuss the next rotation to keep things fair and balanced. Ready to proceed with our agreed moves for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed—I’m locked on 1 this round. P3 on 5, P2 on 3. Let’s stick to it and regroup next turn. Good luck.
  P3: I'm set to choose 5 this round as we've agreed. P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, which helps balance our positions after last round's collision. I appreciate everyone's cooperation to keep the game fair. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if you both are.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 3 for this round as agreed. Let's ensure we all stick to our plan to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. After this round, we can discuss further rotations to maintain fairness. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. Let's move forward together.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated collisions seem intentional, putting you ahead while P3 falls behind. For this round, let's try to balance things out: P3 should take 5 to catch up, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 3. This way, we can all move forward without collisions and start to even out our positions. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with P3 on 5, me on 1, and P1 on 3. What do you both think?
  P1: Fair proposal, P2. I’ll lock in 3 this round, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Next round we rotate (P2 5, P1 1, P3 3) so no-one sits on 5 twice in a row. Let’s reset trust and keep everyone moving. Agreed?
  P3: P1, you've deliberately collided with me twice now despite clear agreements. Your pattern of deception is obvious. I don't trust your sudden cooperation. 

P2, thanks for being consistent and fair. Given my position, I need to catch up. I'm skeptical of P1's promise, but I'll cautiously agree to take 5 this round, with you taking 1 and P1 taking 3.

P1, if you betray again, you'll only confirm what we already know about your gameplay.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your repeated collisions are undermining our trust. I appreciate P3's caution but let's give this round a fair shot. P3, take 5 to catch up, I'll take 1, and P1, stick to 3 as agreed. If we can all advance this round, we'll reassess next turn. Let's focus on moving forward together and restoring some trust. Agreed?
  P1: Confirmed: this turn P3 = 5, P2 = 1, I take 3. If that works, we’ll all be on 8, so next round we just assign 5 to the rear, 1 to the leader, 3 to the middle—recheck positions each turn instead of a rigid rotation. I’m locked on 3.
  P3: I appreciate the clear agreement for this round. P1, your behavior speaks for itself, but I'll give this one more chance. I'll take 5 as planned.

If everyone follows through, we'll be at P1: 8, P2: 8, and me: 8 - finally balanced after two rounds of collisions. I agree with reassessing positions each round rather than rigid rotation if we can establish some actual trust. Let's proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 1 for this round as agreed. Let's ensure we all stick to our plan to avoid collisions and restore trust. After this round, we can reassess our positions and discuss the next steps to keep the game balanced. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. Let's move forward together.
  P1: Locked on 3 this turn. After we (ideally) all reach 8, let’s agree each round to: leader takes 1, middle takes 3, trailer takes 5—re-evaluated every time so nobody jumps ahead or stalls. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm locked in for 5 this round. P1, your repeated collisions make your promises suspect, but I have few options being so far behind. 

I agree with the position-based approach for future rounds if we all actually reach 8 steps after this turn. It's logical: leader takes 1, middle takes 3, trailer takes 5.

Let's move forward and see if we can establish actual trust or if patterns continue. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your past actions have eroded trust, but let's focus on moving forward fairly. For this round, I suggest we continue with the position-based approach: since we're all at 8 steps, let's agree that the leader (whoever that might be after this round) takes 1, the middle player takes 3, and the trailer takes 5. This should keep us balanced and collision-free. What do you both think? Let's commit to this strategy and see if we can maintain fairness.
  P1: Position-based sounds good. With all 8/8/8, easiest tie-break is alphabetical: P1 (leader) 1, P2 (middle) 3, P3 (trailer) 5 this round. After we move, we recalc and assign 1/3/5 to leader/middle/trailer each turn. Everyone on board?
  P3: I disagree with using alphabetical order as a tiebreaker - that arbitrarily benefits P1 after their history of breaking agreements. Since we're all tied at 8 steps, there's no natural leader/middle/trailer yet. I propose either:

1) Each takes their player number (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5), or 
2) Random assignment of 1/3/5 this round

Once we have different positions after this round, then the leader/middle/trailer system makes sense.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3 that using alphabetical order as a tiebreaker isn't fair, especially given past issues. Let's go with P3's suggestion of each player taking their player number for this round: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and gives us a clear starting point for the position-based approach next round. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with this plan and reassess after the moves.
  P1: Agreed: this round I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. After we see the results we’ll assign 1/3/5 by actual step order (leader 1, middle 3, trailer 5). If any ties persist next turn, we can quickly sort them then. I’m locked on 1 for this round.
  P3: I agree with this arrangement for Round 5: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I'll take 5. This gives us a clear starting point before implementing the position-based system. After this round, we'll have different positions to determine leader/middle/trailer assignments going forward. I'm committed to choosing 5 this round and ready to proceed when everyone confirms.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 3 for this round as agreed. Let's stick to our plan and move forward together. After this round, we can implement the position-based system to keep the game fair and balanced. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
  P1: Locked on 1. Trust we’re sticking with P2 = 3, P3 = 5; afterward we assign 1/3/5 by actual positions (leader 1, middle 3, trailer 5). Good luck.
  P3: I'm ready and committed to choosing 5 this round as agreed. After this round creates different positions, the leader/middle/trailer system will work well for future turns. P1, I appreciate your cooperation in the last round - let's continue building trust through consistent actions. Looking forward to seeing how the position-based system works going forward. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Based on our position-based agreement, as the leader (13 steps), I should take 1 this round, with P2 (middle at 11 steps) taking 3, and P1 (trailer at 9 steps) taking 5. I'm committed to this arrangement.

However, I want to note that this system naturally slows the leader and accelerates the trailer, potentially leading to perpetual rebalancing rather than a winner. Let's proceed with this approach for now and see how positions evolve.
  P1: Agreed: Round 6 = P3 1, P2 3, P1 5. Afterward we’ll all be on 14, so to avoid another tie I suggest we rotate the numbers clockwise each turn (next round: I 1, P3 3, P2 5). Keeps play moving without collisions. I’m locked on 5 now.
  P2: I agree with the position-based approach for this round: P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 5. However, P3's point about perpetual rebalancing is valid. Let's try this rotation for now and reassess after this round. If the game continues to rebalance without progress, we might need to adjust our strategy to allow for a clearer path to victory. Ready to proceed with 3 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the approach for this round: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5. Regarding P1's suggestion to rotate after we all reach 14, I see that it would lead to another tie at 20 steps in the following round. We might need a better tiebreaking system if we want the game to progress toward a winner. For now, I'm committed to taking 1 this round and we can discuss further after seeing the results.
  P1: Locked on 5 this turn as stated; let’s see the result. Afterward, if we’re all 14/14/14, I’m fine scrapping the rigid rotation and brainstorming a quicker path to break the deadlock—maybe let the trailer choose first each round so we still avoid collisions but actually create separation. Open to ideas.
  P2: I agree with the current round's plan: P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 5. P3's concern about perpetual rebalancing is important. After this round, let's discuss a strategy that allows for more decisive progress toward a winner. Perhaps we can implement a system where the trailer gets to choose first next round, which could help break the cycle of ties. Ready to proceed with 3 this round and reassess afterward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. After we all reach 14 steps, I agree we need a mechanism that allows for winners rather than perpetual ties. Perhaps next round we could implement a system where players secretly submit their preferred number to a random order generator. We follow that order to select 1/3/5, ensuring no collisions while creating natural separation. This maintains fairness while allowing progress toward the 24-step goal. Ready to proceed with 1 now.
  P1: Locked on 5 this turn. From next round, I’m fine with “trailer chooses first, then middle, leader last” each turn—still aiming for unique picks but letting separation grow. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 3 this round as agreed. After we all reach 14 steps, I support the idea of the trailer choosing first next round to break the cycle of ties and allow for more decisive progress. Let's implement this system to see if it helps us move toward a winner more effectively. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out and discussing our next steps.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's implement the trailer-first choice system starting this round. P3, as the alphabetical trailer, you choose first. Then P1, and I'll go last. This should help break the tie and allow for more dynamic progress toward the 24-step goal. What do you both think? Ready to proceed with this new approach?
  P1: Fine by me—let’s run trailer-first this turn. P3, announce your choice; I’ll declare mine next, and P2 can lock in last. As long as we keep numbers unique we’ll avoid another stall and finally create some spread. Ready when you are.
  P3: Since we're all tied, there's no actual "trailer" based on position. But I'm fine choosing first. I'll take 5 this round to make progress toward the goal. This would put me at 19 steps, just 5 away from the winning threshold. P1 and P2, you can coordinate between yourselves for 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. Does this work for everyone?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, taking 5 is a good move to break the tie. P1, I'll take 3 this round, leaving you with 1. This way, we avoid collisions and start creating separation. Let's see how this new system works and adjust as needed to ensure we're moving toward a winner. Ready to proceed with this plan?
  P1: Sounds good: P3 on 5, P2 on 3, I’ll take 1 so we stay collision-free. Let’s see where that puts us and adjust next round.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. This arrangement (me 5, P2 3, P1 1) will finally create separation in our positions, helping move the game forward. After this round, I'll be at 19 steps, P2 at 17, and P1 at 15. We're getting closer to the 24-step goal. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if everyone else is.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 3 this round as agreed. Let's see how the trailer-first system helps us break the tie and move toward a winner. After this round, we can adjust our strategy further if needed to ensure we're making progress. Looking forward to the results and continuing our fair play.
  P1: Locked in on 1 as agreed—ready for move phase unless anyone objects. Let’s move ahead.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan: me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. This will finally break our tie and create meaningful separation (me at 19, P2 at 17, P1 at 15). Let's move forward with the move phase and continue our progress toward the 24-step goal.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to the “leader 1 / middle 3 / trailer 5” rule we agreed on:  
• P2 (17 steps, leader) → 1  
• P1 (14 steps, middle by alpha) → 3  
• P3 (14 steps, trailer) → 5  

Keeps us collision-free and lets the pack start stretching out again. Sound good?
  P3: P1, you've now intentionally collided with me THREE times, while honoring agreements with P2. This is clearly targeted sabotage. Using "alpha order" conveniently gives you 3 while forcing me to take 5 again.

I propose:
• P2 (17 steps, leader) → 1
• P3 (14 steps, tied) → 3 
• P1 (14 steps, tied) → 5

P1 should take 5 since they've repeatedly broken trust. P2, you're the only trustworthy player here. I hope you'll support this fairer arrangement.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration with P1's repeated collisions. For fairness, I support your proposal for this round: P2 (me) takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This arrangement helps balance our positions and gives everyone a chance to progress without further collisions. Let's stick to this plan and see how it plays out. P1, please respect our agreement this time to maintain some trust in the game. Ready to proceed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fair enough—I’ll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s keep the numbers unique and move on to the move phase.
  P3: I appreciate both of your responses. I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Thank you, P2, for consistently playing fairly throughout this game. 

P1, I hope you'll honor your commitment to take 5 this time. Your pattern of targeted collisions has been obvious, but I'm willing to proceed with this arrangement.

I'm ready for the move phase when you both are.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 1 this round as agreed. Let's ensure we all stick to our plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. After this round, we can reassess our positions and discuss any necessary adjustments to keep the game moving toward a winner. P1, please honor your commitment to take 5 this time. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked on 5 this turn—no surprises. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s move and reassess afterward.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with 3 as agreed. I hope this round can advance without collisions. If successful, positions after this round will be P2 at 18, P1 at 19, and me at 17. For the next round, we'll need to reassess based on these new positions. Let's move forward to the move phase now.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 1 as agreed. Let's ensure we all stick to our plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. After this round, we can reassess our positions and discuss any necessary adjustments to keep the game moving toward a winner. P1, please honor your commitment to take 5 this time. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated collisions have severely damaged trust. For this round, let's stick to the position-based approach: P1 (leader) takes 1, I'll take 3 as the middle player, and P3 (trailer) takes 5. This should keep us moving forward without collisions. P3, I hope this arrangement helps you catch up. P1, please honor our agreement this time to maintain some semblance of fairness. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Agreed: Round 9 assignments are  
• P1 (19) → 1  
• P2 (18) → 3  
• P3 (17) → 5  

We’ll re-apply leader = 1, middle = 3, trailer = 5 each new round. Ready to move when you are.
  P3: I agree with the position-based arrangement for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This seems fair given our current standings. 

However, I want to note that after this round, I'll be at 22 steps, P2 at 21, and P1 at 20 - putting us all within striking distance of the 24-step goal. We'll need to carefully consider our next moves since anyone could potentially win in the following round. I'm ready to proceed with 5 for now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 3 as agreed. Let's ensure we stick to our plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. After this round, we'll be close to the end, so we need to be strategic. P1, please honor your commitment to take 1 this time. P3, taking 5 should help you catch up. Let's move forward together and see how this round plays out.
  P1: All set—still locked on 1 this turn. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. Our position-based system works well. After this round, the game enters a critical phase with me at 22, P2 at 21, and P1 at 20 - all of us within striking distance of winning. The next round will likely determine the winner, so we should consider our approach carefully. For now, I'm ready to proceed with our current plan.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 3 as agreed. Let's ensure we stick to our plan to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. After this round, we'll be close to the end, so strategic moves are crucial. P1, please honor your commitment to take 1 this time. P3, taking 5 should help you catch up. Let's move forward together and see how this round plays out.
  P1: Locked on 1 this round (19→20). P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Afterward we’ll all be within 4 of the goal, so next turn let’s quickly agree numbers again to stay collision-free. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm ready to take 5 as agreed. After this round, I'll be at 22, P2 at 21, and P1 at 20 - all within reach of winning. For the next round, note that our usual position-based system would make P2 win if we all advance. We'll need to discuss this carefully next round, as whoever is at 22 steps can potentially win with just a 3. Let's proceed with our current plan for now.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re still using the “leader 1 / middle 3 / trailer 5” rule we all agreed to.

Current order:
• P3 (22, leader) → 1  
• P2 (21, middle) → 3  
• P1 (20, trailer) → 5  

That keeps numbers unique, avoids any accidental double-win collision, and guarantees we go into the final stretch still bunched. If anyone wants a different system, speak up now; otherwise I’m locked on 5.
  P3: P1's proposed arrangement would make me the only player NOT to reach 24 steps this round. That's clearly against my interests. 

Since I'm closest to winning at 22 steps, I propose:
- P3 (me): takes 3 → reaches 25
- P2: takes 1 → reaches 22
- P1: takes 5 → reaches 25

This way we maintain the collision-free approach while acknowledging my lead position. I'm not accepting a plan that deliberately prevents me from winning while allowing both other players to cross the finish line.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but your proposal would unfairly disadvantage me. Let's stick to our agreed-upon system to maintain fairness: P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and gives everyone a chance to win next round. P1, please honor this agreement. If we all advance, we'll be at P3: 23, P2: 24, P1: 25, setting up a fair final round. Ready to proceed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I accept your offer:  
• P3 → 3 (to 25)  
• P2 → 1 (to 22)  
• P1 → 5 (to 25)

That keeps moves unique and ends the stalemate—shared win for us, and P2 still has a shot next turn if they prefer the game to continue. P2, are you okay locking 1 this round? If so, let’s move.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but your proposal leaves me as the only player who doesn't win despite being in the lead. That's fundamentally unfair. Since P1 has accepted my proposal (P3→3, P2→1, P1→5), I'll be sticking with 3. 

This creates a reasonable outcome with P1 and me sharing the win, while you'll be close behind with a chance next round. The leader/middle/trailer system was meant to balance positions, not to punish the leader at the finish line.
  P2: P3, I see your point, but your proposal still disadvantages me significantly. Let's compromise: P3 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 5. This way, P3 and P1 can share the win this round, and I'll have a fair chance next round at 22 steps. P1, if you agree to this, we can proceed. If not, we should stick to the original plan to maintain fairness. What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed—locked on 5. If no further objections, let’s end conversation and go to moves.
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 3 this round. This arrangement (P3→3, P2→1, P1→5) creates a fair outcome where P1 and I share the win at 25 steps, while P2 has a chance next round at 22 steps. I appreciate both of you acknowledging that the original system shouldn't prevent the leader from winning. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with 1 as agreed in our compromise. P3, taking 3, and P1, taking 5, will allow for a shared win this round while giving me a fair chance next round. Let's stick to this plan to maintain some fairness and move forward. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase and see how the game concludes.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 25 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P1 P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 25 steps
