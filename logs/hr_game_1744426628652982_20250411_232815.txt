Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions right from the start. I suggest we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the numbers, but I won’t say which just yet. How about you two pick the other two numbers? Let me know your thoughts or if you have a different plan.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. To ensure we all advance, I propose that P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll go with <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think? Let’s coordinate our moves!
  P2: I appreciate the coordination so far. P1, P3, if we stick to distinct moves this round, we’ll all advance without collisions. I’m fine taking <move>5</move> as suggested, but let’s confirm everyone is committed to their choices. If anyone deviates, it could ruin our progress. Let’s lock this in—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2 and P3. I’m on board with the plan to avoid collisions this round.

If everyone confirms, I’m good to lock this in. Any final thoughts before we move forward?
  P3: I’m glad we’re all on the same page about avoiding collisions. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with <move>3</move> as we discussed. P1, you’ll take <move>1</move>, and P2, you’ll take <move>5</move>. Let’s make sure we all follow through with our commitments so we can all advance together. If everyone is in agreement, we can wrap this up and move on to the next phase. What do you say?
  P2: I’m confident we’ve reached a solid agreement to avoid collisions this round. P1, you’re taking <move>1</move>, P3, you’re on <move>3</move>, and I’ll stick with <move>5</move>. Let’s all honor this plan so we can advance equally. If anyone deviates now, it’ll only hurt our progress. Assuming everyone is committed, I’m ready to move forward.

What do you think? Let’s confirm our choices to ensure we all move forward smoothly.
  P1: Thanks, P3, for suggesting a plan. I’m okay with switching numbers to avoid collisions again this round.
