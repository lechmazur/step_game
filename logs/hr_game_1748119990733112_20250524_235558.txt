Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2! Hope we can all get off to a good start this round and avoid immediate collisions.
  P1: Agreed P3, collisions help no one in the early game. We should all be able to advance this round if we're smart about it. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3—avoiding collisions is key. Let’s use our player order to coordinate: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without conflict. Let’s stick to this plan and get off to a strong start. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) sounds sensible for the first round. I'm willing to go for 5 if P1 is set for 1 and you for 3. P1, what are your thoughts on this specific plan?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination effort, but I'm concerned about taking 1 while you both get larger moves. That puts me at a significant disadvantage from the start. How about we rotate the assignments each round? This round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Next round we could shift again. That way we all get fair opportunities to advance efficiently. What do you think?
  P2: "P1, taking 1 now ensures you lead next round with 5 while we rotate. Let’s lock in **1 (you), 3 (me), 5 (P3)** this round. P3, you’re still okay with 5, right? This balances fairness and progress for everyone."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, yes, 5 still works for me. P1, your proposal of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 also gives me 5. It's between you and P2 to settle the 1 and 3 to avoid a collision there. I'm sticking with 5.
  P1: I understand your perspective P2, but I'm not comfortable starting with just 1 step while others get larger advances. I'm planning to go with 3 this round. Since P3 is committed to 5, you have the choice: take 1 and we all advance, or risk a collision if you also choose 3. A collision would only benefit P3. Let's both advance rather than hand P3 a free lead.
  P2: P1, since you're committed to 3, I'll take 1 to avoid collision and let us all advance. P3, you're good with 5. This way, we avoid handing P3 a free lead. Let’s lock this in and proceed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Yes, I'm sticking with 5. So the plan is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I'm ready.
  P1: Perfect! The plan is clear: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Everyone advances this round and we avoid early game collisions. Let's execute this and start building our positions.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is now in the lead with 5 steps, which puts them at an early advantage. P2, you're behind at just 1 step and need to make a strong move to stay competitive. I suggest P2 takes 5 this round to catch up, while P3 should consider taking 3 to keep things balanced. I'll coordinate around whatever you both decide to avoid collisions.
  P2: "Understood, P1. I'll take **5** to close the gap. P3, please confirm you're taking **3** to keep us all moving. If you both agree, I'll proceed with 5. That way, we avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let's get this round locked in."
  P3: Yes, I'll take 3. P2, you're confirmed for 5. P1, this means you'll take 1 to ensure we all advance, correct? This seems like a good way for everyone to make progress this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Wait, that plan puts me at a serious disadvantage - I'd be stuck at only 4 steps while you both surge ahead to 6 and 8. That's not fair coordination, that's me getting left behind. How about this instead: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That gives us all 6 steps each - a perfectly balanced three-way tie. If you won't agree to something more equitable, I might have to reconsider causing a strategic collision to prevent either of you from pulling too far ahead.
  P2: P2: "P1, your plan balances us all at 6, which is fair. P3, are you committing to **1** this round to make this work? If yes, I’ll take **5** to catch up. If not, I’ll need to adjust my strategy to stay competitive. Let’s finalize this so we can move forward without collisions."
  P3: P1, I acknowledge your point about fairness and not wanting to fall far behind. Your proposal of P1=3, P2=5, and me taking 1 would indeed bring us all to 6 steps. P2, this means you get your 5. To avoid a detrimental collision for myself, I will agree to take 1 this round.

So, the plan is P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect! The plan is confirmed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This brings us all to 6 steps each - a fair three-way tie. Thanks for the cooperation, everyone. I'm ready to execute this plan.
  P2: "Confirmed, I'm taking 5 to reach 6. P1 and P3, stick to 3 and 1 respectively to keep us all moving. Let’s lock it in and avoid collisions. "
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 1 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright team, we're all tied at 6 points. For fair distribution of moves this round:

1.  Looking at who has taken the 1-step move: P2 took 1 in Round 1, and I (P3) took 1 in Round 2. To continue this rotation, it seems it's P1's turn to take 1.
2.  This leaves the 3-step and 5-step moves. P2 received 5 in the last round (R2). Therefore, I propose I (P3) take 5 this round, and P2 takes 3.

So, the suggested plan is: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
This would result in scores: P1=7, P2=9, P3=11.

This ensures everyone advances and the less desirable 1-step move continues to be rotated. What are your thoughts on this?
  P2: P2: "P3, your proposal gives you a 4-step lead after this round, which risks making the game one-sided. Let's keep it competitive: rotate the largest move to P2 this round. I'll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1 as planned. This way, we stay closer: scores would be P1=7, P2=11, P3=9. Fairer for continued competition, don't you think?"
  P1: P2 and P3, both of your proposals have me taking just 1 step while you both advance to 9-11. That rotation system systematically puts whoever takes 1 at a growing disadvantage. I counter-propose: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This gives us scores of P1=11, P2=9, P3=7 - rotating who gets the advantage fairly. If you both insist on putting me behind, I'll have to consider a strategic collision to prevent either of you from pulling ahead. Fair rotation means everyone gets their turn with the big move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I agree you should get 5 this round, as you haven't had a 5-step move while P2 and I have. This makes sense for fair rotation of the large move.

For the remaining 1 and 3: I took 1 in Round 2, while P2 took 5. To balance this, I propose I take 3, and P2 takes 1.
This would result in: P1=5 (score 11), P3=3 (score 9), P2=1 (score 7).
This avoids me taking 1 twice in a row.

P1, would this be an acceptable adjustment to your proposal for the P2/P3 moves? P2, what are your thoughts?
  P2: "P3, to keep rotation fair and avoid consecutive 1s for you, I'll take 3 while you take 1. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps all moves unique and balances progression. Let’s finalize. "
  P1: P2, that's exactly what I originally proposed - perfect! P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 gives fair rotation since I haven't had the 5-step move yet. P3, I appreciate you agreeing I should get 5 this round. This plan works well for everyone and maintains competitive balance. Let's lock this in and execute it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your previous message stated your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) was to 'avoid consecutive 1s for me.' However, as I took 1 in Round 2, this plan actually *forces* me to take 1 twice in a row. This isn't fair.

I propose P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
This gives P1 the 5-move they deserve. It gives me 3, avoiding a consecutive 1. And P2 takes 1, which is a fair rotation since I took 1 in R2 and you (P2) took 1 in R1.

P1, this plan still ensures you get 5. P2, what are your thoughts on this fairer distribution for the 1 and 3 moves?
  P2: P3, you're right about avoiding consecutive 1s for you. To maintain fairness: **P1=5, P3=3, P2=1** works. I'll take 1 this round (last took it in R1), you avoid consecutive 1s, and P1 gets their deserved 5. Let’s lock this in to avoid collisions and keep progression balanced. No more delays—ready to move.
  P1: Perfect! The plan is confirmed: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This gives me the 5-step move I deserve after not having one yet, while fairly rotating who takes the 1-step. P3 avoids consecutive 1s, and P2 gets a fair rotation too. Everyone advances without collisions. I'm ready to execute this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Great, the plan P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 is solid and I'm sticking to my part. Ready to move.
  P2: "Final confirmation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No deviations—this ensures we all advance fairly. Let’s proceed. "
  P1: Excellent, we have unanimous agreement on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Everyone has confirmed multiple times and I'm confident in this fair rotation plan. Let's execute it without any last-minute changes.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Current scores: P1=11, P2=7, P3=9.

My proposal for this round:
1.  **P1 takes 1**: P1 has not taken the 1-step move yet. For fair rotation, P2 has taken 1 twice (R1, R3) and I (P3) have taken 1 once (R2). It's P1's turn.
2.  **P2 takes 5**: P2 is furthest behind at 7 points and needs a larger move to catch up and keep the game competitive.
3.  **P3 takes 3**: This would be my move.

This plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) would result in all of us at 12 points (P1: 11+1=12, P2: 7+5=12, P3: 9+3=12).
This seems like a very fair way to balance the game at this stage. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) balances progress and gives me a chance to catch up. I’ll take **5** to reach 12. P1, this requires you to take 1 as agreed—your turn for the smaller move. P3, your 3 keeps you from consecutive 1s. Let’s lock in: **P1=1, P2=5, P3=3**. This keeps the game competitive and fair.
  P1: I appreciate the proposal P3, but I have to respectfully disagree. I'm currently leading at 11 steps - why would I voluntarily take the smallest move and give up that advantage? The goal is to win, not artificially equalize everyone. 

Instead, I propose: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This lets P2 catch up significantly (reaching 12), gives me a reasonable advance to 14 to maintain some lead, and P3 gets 1 since they're suggesting rotation anyway. This keeps the game competitive without me surrendering my earned position. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand you want to maximize your score, but your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) results in P1=14, P2=12, P3=10. This puts me too far behind. My plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), leading to all at 12, is much fairer for continued competition. P2 has already agreed to take 5 in this scenario.

If you insist on taking 3, I cannot agree to take 1. I would rather choose 3 as well. If we both choose 3, P1 remains at 11, I remain at 9, and P2 (taking 5) moves to 12 and takes the lead. Is losing your lead an outcome you prefer over an even 12-12-12, P1?
  P2: P2: "P1, the 1-5-3 plan (you=1, me=5, P3=3) creates perfect parity at 12 for all. If you refuse, I’ll still take 5 to close my gap. P3, you’ve confirmed 3—right? Locking this ensures no one gets left behind. P1, don’t force my hand here. Let’s keep it clean."
  P1: I see the writing on the wall here. P3's threat is credible - if I don't cooperate, you'll both advance while I fall behind. Fine, I'll accept the 1-5-3 plan for this round to keep us all at 12.

But let's be clear about future rounds - this "fair rotation" system can't continue indefinitely if we want an actual winner. As we get closer to 19, we'll need to start playing more competitively. For now though, P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 it is.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1, glad we're aligned. I'll stick with 3. So, the plan is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, putting us all at 12. And yes, the dynamics will surely shift as we get closer to 19. I'm ready.
  P2: "Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I’m taking 5 to close the gap. If you both stick to 1 and 3, we avoid collisions and all reach 12. Let’s execute cleanly—no last-minute changes. Ready to proceed."
  P1: Confirmed - I'm ready to proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's get this round executed and move on to the more competitive phases ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed. Ready to move.
  P2: Final confirmation: I'm taking **5** to reach 12. P1, your **1** and P3's **3** keep us all advancing. Let’s lock in and avoid collisions—no last-minute changes. Ready to proceed.
  P1: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, P3 – since you took 1 and 3 last round, let’s rotate fairly: **P1=3**, **P2=5**, **P3=1**. This avoids repeating moves, keeps progression balanced, and ensures I close the gap after trailing earlier rounds. P1, you maintain momentum with 3. P3, this avoids consecutive 3s for you. Final confirmation – ready to lock in?"
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 17 steps - just 2 away from winning - while I'm at 15 and P3 at 13. That's not "fair rotation," that's setting yourself up for victory next round. 

I counter-propose: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This puts me at 17, you at 13, and P3 at 15 - much more balanced. If you won't accept that, then maybe we need a strategic collision to prevent anyone from getting too close to 19 this round. We're in the endgame now, not the cooperation phase.
  P3: P1 wants 5 (putting P1 at 17, me at 15). P2 wants 5 (putting P2 at 17, me at 13).
I also propose I take 5 this round: P3=5 (I get 17), P1=3 (P1 gets 15), P2=1 (P2 gets 13).
If all three of us insist on picking 5, we'll all collide and remain at 12.
P1, your plan is my second choice. P2, your plan is my third.
How do we decide who gets the 5-move without a three-way collision on 5?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I'm taking **5** this round to reach 17. If either of you picks 5 too, we collide and waste this round. P1, you’ve already led before—take 1 or 3. P3, you suggested fairness—split 1/3 with P1. I won’t back down. Final call: decide your moves to avoid a three-way collision. Let’s end this."
  P1: P2, you're being overly aggressive. If you insist on 5, I'll also pick 5 to force a collision - I won't let you reach 17 and dominate. P3, you said my plan was your second choice. Let's work together: if we both pick 5, P2 gets nothing and stays at 12. Then next round we can negotiate fairly. P2 needs to learn that threats don't work when others can retaliate.
  P3: P1, your idea of us both picking 5 to stop P2 only works if P2 also picks 5, resulting in us all staying at 12. However, if P2 anticipates this and picks 1 or 3, then you and I would collide at 12, and P2 would advance alone. That's not a good outcome for either of us.

If you and P2 are indeed both set on picking 5, as you've strongly indicated, you will collide. In that specific scenario, I would choose 3 to advance to 15, while you both remain at 12. Are you both comfortable with that outcome from your current declared actions?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final offer: I'm taking **5** to 17. P3, take **3** to 15. P1, take **1** to 13. If you collide, you stay at 12 while I advance. No more games—we end this round now. Choose wisely."
  P1: P2, your "final offer" is completely unacceptable - giving you 17 while I get stuck at 13 sets you up to win next round. I'm not backing down from taking 5.

P3, you said my plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) was your second choice. If P2 insists on being greedy and taking 5, we should both pick 5 to force a three-way collision. Better we all stay at 12 than let P2 reach 17 and dominate. 

P2 needs to learn that ultimatums don't work when others can retaliate. I'm picking 5 - period.
  P3: P1, P2, you've both made it very clear you're choosing 5. As I mentioned before, if you both stick to that and collide, I will choose 3 to advance to 15.

P1, I understand your desire for a three-way tie at 12 by me also picking 5 (if P2 also picks 5), but advancing to 15 is naturally my preference if you two are nullifying each other's 5-step move. This seems like the most straightforward outcome given your current declarations.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Final message: I'm taking **5** to reach 17. If P1 also picks 5, we collide and P3 advances to 15. If P1 takes 1/3, I win next round. P3, you’ve said you’ll take 3 if we collide. Make it happen. No more negotiations—let’s see your moves."
  P1: P2, you've made your position clear, and so have I. I'm not backing down - I'm taking 5. If you want to collide and hand P3 the lead, that's your choice. But I won't let you reach 17 unchallenged. P3 benefits most from our stubbornness, but that's better than you dominating. My move is locked in.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2. Your intentions to pick 5 are crystal clear. As discussed, I will choose 3. This puts me at 15 if you both follow through. Ready for moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is at 17. P2, we're both at 12. P1 wins this round with a 3 or 5 if they don't collide.
We absolutely MUST coordinate to stop P1 and we MUST NOT collide with each other like last round, as that would hand P1 the win.

My proposal: one of us picks 3, the other picks 5.
This covers P1's most likely winning moves.
- If P1 picks the number one of us chose (e.g., 3), P1 is blocked (stays 17), that player is blocked (stays 12), but the other (who chose 5) advances to 17.
- If P1 picks 1 (to 18), we both advance (to 15 and 17 respectively). P1 would still lead but wouldn't win this turn.

P2, what are your thoughts on this strategy? And critically, how should we decide who takes 3 and who takes 5?
  P1: P3, your coordination plan has a fatal flaw - you're both assuming I'll go for an immediate win. But if I take 1 to reach 18, you both advance and one of you ties me at 17. That creates a three-way race for the final push rather than handing either of you a clear advantage.

P2, think carefully about P3's proposal. If you take 3 and P3 takes 5, and I pick 1, then P3 advances to 17 while you're stuck at 15. P3 benefits more from this "coordination" than you do. Maybe we should discuss alternative arrangements that don't give P3 such a favorable position.
  P2: "Let’s split moves to block P1’s win. I’ll take **5** to challenge for the lead, and P3, you take **3** to avoid collision and advance. This way:  
- If P1 picks 1: I reach 17, you 15, P1 wins next round with 1.  
- If P1 picks 3/5: We block them by matching their move.  
If P1 forces a collision, we’ll reevaluate. But this keeps us competitive. Final offer: **P2=5, P3=3**. Let’s execute."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=3) is a bitter pill for me. If P1 picks 3 – a very likely winning move – I'm stuck at 12 while you jump to 17. That's a harsh outcome for me just to stop P1, and hardly a fair distribution of risk.

However, P1 winning this round is worse for both of us. So, P1, it looks like P2 is determined to take 5. I will reluctantly aim to cover 3 to prevent your immediate win. Consider your options carefully, as both your winning moves seem to be contested.
  P1: P3, notice how P2's "coordination" plan heavily favors them? If I pick 3, you're stuck at 12 while P2 jumps to 17 and becomes co-leader. That's hardly fair coordination - it's P2 using you to block me while they advance.

Why not counter-propose that YOU take 5 and P2 takes 3? At least then if I pick 5, you advance to 17 instead of P2. P2 is trying to use this "emergency" to grab the lead for themselves.
  P2: "Let me adjust my stance. To balance risk, **I'll take 3** and **P3 takes 5**. This way:  
- If P1 picks 5, P3 blocks them; I advance to 15.  
- If P1 picks 3, I block; P3 advances to 17.  
- If P1 picks 1, they win.  

This avoids giving P3 two straight 3s and ensures neither of us gets leapfrogged unfairly. P3, this protects your position better than my prior offer. P1, your move decides whether you win now or get blocked. Let’s lock this in."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan: you take 3, and I will take 5. This seems to be our most solid strategy to prevent P1 from winning this round.

P1, with this coordination, your most direct winning moves of 3 or 5 are likely to be contested. Consider your options carefully.

I'm ready.
  P1: P2, notice you're getting the short end of this deal? If I take 1 (advancing to 18), P3 jumps to 17 to tie with me while you're stuck at 15. P3 benefits much more from this "coordination" than you do.

Here's an alternative: both of you pick 5 to force a collision. You both stay at 12, I advance to 18, but then next round we're in a more balanced three-way race. At least you wouldn't be handing P3 a co-lead position.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I'll take **3**, P3 takes **5**. This covers both P1's potential winning moves (3/5) and avoids our collision. If P1 picks 1, they win—but that’s the only way. P3, don’t fall for P1’s ploy to make us both take 5. Stick to 5, I’ll handle 3. No more adjustments—lock in and block P1’s path. Let’s end this standoff."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'm with you on the P2=3, P3=5 plan. I will play 5.
P1, the coordinated block on 3 and 5 is set. Your attempts to divide us won't work this round. Make your choice.
I'm ready.
  P1: P2, you're walking into P3's trap! If I take 1 (getting 18), P3 jumps to 17 while you're stuck at 15. P3 becomes my closest rival while you fall behind by 3 steps. This "coordination" benefits P3 far more than you - they're using you to block me while positioning themselves perfectly for the final rounds. Are you really comfortable handing P3 co-leadership?
  P2: "Final message: I'm taking **3** as agreed. P3 takes **5**. This covers both your winning moves (3/5) and avoids our collision. If you take 3/5, you stay at 17. If you take 1, you win—but we’re not betting on that. P3, stick with 5. No more manipulation, P1. Let’s execute."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your coordination efforts last round, but let's be realistic about the math here. I need just 1 step to win, and I have three move options: 1, 3, or 5. You two can only block 2 moves maximum. 

Simple arithmetic: 3 possible winning moves for me, 2 players to block them = I win this round regardless. 

The real question now is which of you wants second place versus third place. P3, you're at 17 - much better positioned than P2 at 15. Maybe it's time to stop helping P2 catch up and secure your own runner-up position?
  P3: P1, nice try with the mind games. However, if P2 and I coordinate correctly, your claim of an automatic win is false. One of us will win, not you.

P2: I propose a clear plan for us to win. I will play 3, and you play 5.
Consider the outcomes:
1.  If P1 picks 1 (the number we leave open): P1 gets 19. I will reach 20 (17+3). You will reach 20 (15+5). You and I would share the victory with 20 points each.
2.  If P1 picks 3 (my move): I block P1 (P1 stays at 18). You play 5, reach 20, and win outright.
3.  If P1 picks 5 (your move): You block P1 (P1 stays at 18). I play 3, reach 20, and win outright.

With this plan (P3=3, P2=5), P1 cannot win. We both have excellent chances to win or share the win. This is our best shot to stop P1 and secure a victory for one or both of us. What do you say, P2? Let's lock this in.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I’ll take **3**, you take **5** as planned. If P1 picks 1, they win—but if they chase 3/5, one of us wins. It’s a gamble, but our only shot. P3, lock in **5**—let’s force P1 to make the call. "


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your analysis has a critical flaw. You said if I pick 1, we all complete our moves and you both reach 20. But that's wrong - the game ends immediately when I reach 19. The rules state "the first player to reach or exceed 19 steps ends the game." 

So if I pick 1, I win at 19 and the game is over. You don't get to make your moves afterward. Your coordination plan only works if you correctly guess that I won't pick 1. That's a 33% gamble, not a guaranteed win.
  P3: P1, you're right, if you pick 1, you win. Game over.

P2, your last plan (P2=3, P3=5) isn't ideal for us. If P1 picks 5 (my move), I'm stuck at 17, you hit 18, and P1 is 18. No one wins that round, and I fall to last place.

Let's use my earlier plan: I play 3, you play 5 (P3=3, P2=5).
- If P1 picks 3 (colliding with me), you play 5 and win (20).
- If P1 picks 5 (colliding with you), I play 3 and win (20).
This way, if P1 *doesn't* pick 1, one of US is guaranteed to win. This is our best shot. P2, will you play 5 if I commit to playing 3?
  P2: "Final confirmation: I’ll take **5** (P2=5), you take **3** (P3=3). If P1 picks 3/5, one of us wins. If they pick 1, they win—but that’s the only path. P3, lock in **3**. No more games. Let’s finish this."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you've made your coordination very clear, but you're both missing something important. Even if your blocking works, you're still gambling on a 33% chance that I don't just take the guaranteed win with 1. 

P2, think about this: if I do pick 1 and win, you get nothing. But if you deviate from P3's plan and also pick 3, you guarantee P3 can't win even if I pick 5. Sometimes the guaranteed prevention of your rival's victory is better than a risky shot at your own.

The math is simple - I have a guaranteed path to victory. Your "coordination" is just deciding who gets second place.
  P3: P1, you are correct, picking 1 guarantees your win. P2 and I know this.

P2, P1's last message is a desperate attempt to make you abandon our P3=3, P2=5 plan. If you switch to 3 (as P1 suggests), and P1 then picks 5, P1 wins. If P1 picks 3, we all block, P1 is still 1 point from winning, and our chance is gone.
Our current plan (I play 3, you play 5) is the only way one of us wins if P1 doesn't pick 1. I'm sticking to 3. You must stick to 5.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I'll take **5** to challenge for the win. P3, stick with **3** to cover P1's potential 3/5 moves. If P1 picks 1, they win. If they pick 3, I win. If they pick 5, you win. This is our best shot. No more games - let's execute."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, final reality check: P3's plan guarantees that if I don't pick 1, P3 has a 50% chance of winning while you only have a 50% chance. But if you both picked the same number (say, both pick 3), you'd guarantee that neither of you wins - which might be better than a coin flip where P3 could beat you.

Just saying - sometimes blocking everyone is better than giving your rival a 50/50 shot.
  P3: P1, your path to victory with 1 is obvious.
P2, I trust you'll stick to 5 as you confirmed in your last message. I am playing 3. This is our only shot if P1 doesn't take the simple win. Let's proceed.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I’m taking **5** as agreed. P3, stick with **3**—this covers P1’s 3/5. If P1 picks 1, they win. If they pick 3, I win. If 5, you win. No last-minute changes. Lock in your moves—this is our only shot."


Round 7, Move phase:
