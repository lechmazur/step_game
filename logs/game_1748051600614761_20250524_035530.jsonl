I propose I take 5 (to 14), P1 takes 1 (to 17), and P2 takes 3 (to 15). This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P1 is still in the lead but not unreachably so, and P2 and I can stay competitive. Since P1 is close to winning, they should be willing to take a smaller step while maintaining their lead. Is this arrangement acceptable to both of you?"}
