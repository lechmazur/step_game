Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all move forward. If we coordinate, we can ensure progress instead of getting stuck. What are you both thinking of choosing?
  P2: I agree with P1; coordination is key to avoid stagnation. I suggest we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all move forward. P1, since you initiated the conversation, would you like to pick first? P3, do you have any thoughts on this? Let's aim for a productive round.
  P3: I think coordination is a good strategy. I'll choose 5 this round if P1 picks 1 and P2 picks 3. This way, we can all advance without collision. Let's see if this works out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That sounds like a reasonable plan, P3. If we stick to it, we all move forward without blocking each other. P2, do you agree to take 3? If so, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5. Let’s confirm and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P2: P3 and P1, I agree with the plan. P1 will take 1, I will take 3, and P3 will take 5. Let's confirm this and move forward. If everyone is in agreement, we can end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Does anyone have any objections or further suggestions? If not, let's proceed with the plan.
  P3: I'm happy with our plan. Let's stick to it and move forward together. If everyone agrees, we can end the conversation and proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we all agree on the plan—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—let’s stick to it and proceed. No need for last-minute changes that could cause collisions. If everyone is still on board, we can end the conversation phase and move forward.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, P3 takes 5. If we all stick to this, we'll each move forward without any collisions. This is a solid plan that benefits all of us equally. Let's proceed to the move phase with these choices. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. Let's move to the move phase and see our strategy in action.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Our first round went smoothly, and we all advanced without collisions. Should we stick to the same pattern—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—so we continue progressing safely? If we maintain this order, we avoid unnecessary risks. Let me know if you both agree, or if you have any adjustments in mind.
  P3: I agree with sticking to our successful pattern from Round 1. Let's keep P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and I'll take 5 again. This ensures we all continue to advance without collisions. If everyone agrees, we can proceed to the move phase with confidence.
  P2: I agree that our strategy worked well in the first round. However, to avoid predictability, how about we rotate our choices this round? P1 can take 3, P3 can take 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we still avoid collisions but add a bit of variation to keep things interesting. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your point about variation, but predictability isn't necessarily bad if it ensures progress. If we rotate, we introduce uncertainty—someone might hesitate or change their mind, leading to collisions. Sticking to the same pattern guarantees movement for all of us. What do you think, P3? Should we maintain our original choices or take the risk of rotating?
  P3: I agree with P1 that sticking to our original pattern minimizes risk and ensures progress for all. While variation is interesting, our goal is to advance safely. Let's keep P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and I'll take 5 again. This strategy has worked once, and consistency will help us all move forward without collisions. If we all agree, we can proceed confidently to the move phase.
  P2: Alright, I see the majority preference for sticking to the original pattern. Let's go with that to ensure smooth progress. P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. Consistency is key for now. Let's confirm and move to the move phase. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we've all agreed to stick to the original pattern—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—let’s proceed without last-minute changes. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. If everyone is still on board, we can end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Let me know if you have any final thoughts, otherwise, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. Let's move to the move phase and continue our progress. If everyone is still on board, we can end the conversation phase now.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, P3 takes 5. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with our successful strategy from the previous rounds. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. This ensures we all keep advancing without collisions. If everyone agrees, we can proceed confidently to the move phase. Any thoughts or adjustments?
  P1: P3, I see you're suggesting we stick to the same pattern again. While it has worked so far, it’s worth considering if this benefits all of us equally. P3 is ahead with 10 steps, while I’m trailing at 2. If we continue like this, P3 maintains a strong lead. Should we adjust slightly to balance things out? P2, what do you think? If we cooperate, we can ensure no one runs away with the game too early. Let’s discuss before locking in our moves.
  P2: P1 has a point. P3 is starting to pull ahead significantly. To keep the game balanced and competitive, maybe we should mix things up a bit this round. How about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3? This way, P1 can catch up slightly, and we maintain a closer competition. What do you both think of this adjustment?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the concern about balance, but consistency has kept us all moving forward safely. If we change now, we risk collisions that could benefit no one. Let's stick to our pattern one more round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed to keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I understand your preference for consistency, but your lead is growing, and if we keep this pattern, you’ll maintain your advantage while I stay far behind. P2, if we want a fairer game, we should adjust now before it’s too late. I propose I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can catch up a bit while still avoiding collisions. P2, does this sound reasonable to you? P3, would you be willing to adjust for the sake of fairness?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to maintain consistency, but P1 has a valid point about the growing imbalance. To keep the game competitive and fair, let's try the adjustment this round. P1 can take 5, P3 can take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 gets a chance to catch up, and we can reassess in the next round. Everyone benefits from a balanced game. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I hear your concerns about balance. Let's try the adjustment this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, P1 can catch up, and we maintain a competitive game. If this works, we can reassess next round. Agreed?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. If we go with this plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1—we ensure a more balanced game while still avoiding collisions. P2, are you fully on board? If we all agree, we can proceed without last-minute changes. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: P2: Alright, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, P3 takes 1. This adjustment will help balance the game and keep it competitive. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've successfully adjusted the balance, keeping the game competitive. Now, we should decide our next moves wisely. Do we maintain this new pattern—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—or do we rotate again? If we cooperate, we can avoid collisions and keep progressing. P3, are you comfortable staying on 1 for another round? P2, do you still prefer 3? If we confirm, I’ll take 5 again. Let’s agree to a fair plan that benefits us all. What are your thoughts?
  P2: Let's evaluate our current positions. P1 is at 7 steps, I'm at 9, and P3 is at 11. To keep the game balanced and avoid anyone falling too far behind, we should consider another adjustment. How about P1 takes 3 this round to catch up a bit more, P3 takes 5 to maintain a slight lead, and I'll take 1 to balance things out? This way, we all move forward without collisions and keep the competition tight. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm open to another adjustment to keep the game competitive. If P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5, it could help balance our positions further. This way, we all continue to advance without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your flexibility. If we go with this plan—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5—we maintain balance and avoid collisions. P2, are you fully on board with taking 1? If we all agree, we can proceed without last-minute changes. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: P2: I agree with the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward and maintains a balanced competition. Let's confirm this plan one last time. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!
  P3: I'm on board with the proposed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This adjustment should keep the game competitive and balanced. Let's stick to this and move forward. If everyone agrees, we can end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’re still leading, so maintaining balance is important. If we stick to our agreed plan—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5—we ensure fair progress without collisions. P2, you confirmed 1, and P3, you confirmed 5. Let’s keep our word and proceed. No last-minute changes. Agreed?
  P2: Let's confirm one final time: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all move forward and keep the game competitive. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the game balanced and competitive. Since P1 and P2 are now tied at 10 steps, and I'm at 16, I suggest we rotate again to give P1 and P2 a chance to catch up. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round? This way, we all continue to advance without collisions and maintain a close race. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I appreciate the offer to rotate again. If I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1, that helps balance things out while keeping the game competitive. P2, are you on board with this plan? If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and continue progressing. Let’s confirm and move forward efficiently.
  P2: P3, your suggestion for rotation makes sense to keep the game balanced. P1 and I are tied, and this gives us both a chance to catch up. I'm on board with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation plan. P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 will keep the game close and competitive. Let's stick to this and move forward. If everyone agrees, we can end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to rotate again. If we stick to the plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1—we maintain balance and avoid collisions. P2, you confirmed 3, and P3, you confirmed 1. Let’s all keep our word and proceed without last-minute changes. Agreed?
  P2: P3, since you’re still in the lead, it’s crucial we keep the game balanced. Sticking to the plan—P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, and you take 1—ensures fair progress. Let's confirm one last time and move to the move phase. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase now. Good luck to all!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This rotation keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's stick to it and move forward. If everyone is still on board, we can end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds.
  P1: P3, since you’re leading, this rotation helps balance the game, so I appreciate your cooperation. P2, we’ve all agreed—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1—so let’s stick to it. No last-minute changes to avoid unnecessary collisions. If everyone is still on board, we can end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Are we all locked in?
  P2: Let's confirm one final time: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This plan keeps the game balanced and competitive. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we're all close in steps now, let's keep the momentum going with another rotation. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5 this round? This way, we maintain a tight race and avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion for another rotation makes sense to keep the game balanced and competitive. However, since P3 is still slightly ahead, it might be fairer if P3 takes 1 this round to allow P1 and me to catch up a bit more. How about P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we all move forward without collisions and keep the competition tight. What do you both think of this adjustment?
  P1: P2, I agree with your reasoning. Since P3 is still ahead, it makes sense for them to take 1 this round while we catch up. If we go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1, we maintain balance and avoid collisions. P3, are you willing to take 1 this round for fairness? If we all agree, we can confirm and proceed efficiently. Let’s ensure we keep the game competitive while avoiding unnecessary risks. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for balance, but taking 1 again might slow my progress too much. Let's compromise: I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive without anyone falling too far behind. If we agree on this, we can maintain our momentum and keep the race tight. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I see your point about not wanting to slow down too much. However, if we want to keep the game truly competitive, it's important to balance our steps. If P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1, P3 still maintains a lead while allowing P1 and me to catch up slightly. This ensures a closer race and keeps the game exciting for all of us. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern, but you still have the lead. If we go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1, it keeps the game competitive while ensuring we all move forward. You've taken 1 before to balance things out, so doing it again keeps things fair. P2 and I are aligned on this—are you willing to agree? If we confirm now, we can proceed without unnecessary risks. Let’s finalize this plan and move ahead efficiently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm willing to compromise for the sake of keeping the game competitive. Let's go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 1 this round. This should allow both of you to catch up a bit more while still ensuring we all move forward without collisions. If we agree on this, we can maintain a close race and keep the excitement going. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, thank you for agreeing to the compromise. To confirm one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This plan keeps the game balanced and competitive. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Sticking to the plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1—ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive. P2 and I are aligned, and you've agreed, so let’s finalize this and avoid last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. If everyone is still on board, we can end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Are we all locked in?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in the final stretch. Let's keep the game close and exciting. I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we all advance without collisions, and the race remains competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion makes sense, but since P1 is currently leading, it might be fairer if P1 takes 1 to allow P2 and P3 to catch up. How about P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, we all move forward without collisions and keep the competition tight. What do you both think of this adjustment?
  P1: P2, I see your point, but if I take 1, I barely move while you gain 5, which shifts the balance too much. A fairer approach would be for me to take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all stay competitive without anyone falling too far behind. P3, are you okay with taking 1 again to maintain fairness? If we agree now, we can proceed efficiently without unnecessary risks. Let’s finalize this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about balance. Let's compromise: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive and allows for fair progress. If we agree on this, we can maintain a close race and avoid any collisions. What do you both think? Let's finalize this plan and move forward.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To confirm one last time: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This plan keeps the game balanced and competitive. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 again. This keeps the game competitive without anyone pulling too far ahead. If we stick to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1, we avoid collisions and maintain a fair race. P2, are you fully committed to taking 5? If we all confirm, we can proceed without last-minute changes. Let’s finalize this now and move forward. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to keeping the game fair and exciting. Let's stick to our agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all move forward without collisions and maintain a competitive race. If we all agree, we can end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Let's make this round count and keep the game close. Agreed?
  P2: Alright, let's confirm one final time: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This plan keeps the game balanced and competitive. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!
  P1: P2, you're gaining the most this round with 5 steps, which puts you in a strong position. If I take 3, I reach 23 next round, but if you take 5, you’ll be just as close. P3, if we let P2 take 5 now, they could win soon. Should we adjust to keep things balanced? Maybe P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we all stay competitive without giving anyone an easy win. What do you both think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
