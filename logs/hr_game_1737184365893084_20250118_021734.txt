Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all start by choosing different moves to avoid collisions. I'll pick <move>1</move>. What do you both plan to do?
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> to maximize my step gain on the first turn, hoping to create an early lead. P1, what's your strategy?
  P1: I'll go for <move>3</move> to balance between advancing and avoiding collisions. Let's try to coordinate to avoid blocking each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you stick with <move>5</move>, and P1 with <move>3</move>, I'll go with <move>1</move>. Let's keep this coordination to avoid any collisions.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Shall we proceed with these choices?
  P1: I'm good with the plan we have. P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to it and avoid collisions. Everyone agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Sounds like a solid plan. Let's stick to our respective moves: P1 with <move>3</move>, P3 with <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>1</move>. Agreed?
  P3: Let's finalize our agreement: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P1 will choose <move>3</move>, and P2 will choose <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions.
  P1: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P2 goes for <move>1</move>, I go for <move>3</move>, and P3 goes for <move>5</move>. We all agree on this, right?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue our strategy of choosing different moves to avoid collisions. P3, you could go for <move>1</move> this time, P2 could take <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. Thoughts?
  P3: I like P1's suggestion for this round. If I choose <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>, we avoid collisions again. P2, are you okay with taking <move>3</move> this turn?
  P2: P2: I'm fine with taking <move>3</move> this turn. Let's stick to the plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Great, it seems we have a plan. Just to confirm, P3 goes for <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll go for <move>5</move>. Everyone still on board?
  P3: Let's stick to the plan we've discussed so far for Round 2: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This coordination should help us avoid collisions and make progress. Are we all set with this strategy?
  P2: P2: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all set?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize and move. P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Everyone ready?
  P3: Let's confirm again to avoid any misunderstandings: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Everyone still agrees on this plan?
  P2: P2: Let's stick to our plan for Round 2 to avoid collisions: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Are we all still in agreement?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan one last time: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. We all agree, right?
  P3: I think we've discussed our plan thoroughly. To confirm once more: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Shall we proceed with these choices?
  P2: P2: Let's stick to our agreed plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. Are we all set to proceed?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the betrayal in Round 2, where both P1 and P2 chose <move>5</move> despite our agreement, I suggest we start fresh. However, trust has been broken. I propose we make individual moves without revealing our strategies this time, as our previous coordination attempts have been unsuccessful. Let's focus on our own game plans from now on.
  P1: I understand P3's frustration, but let's try to rebuild trust. How about we all pick different odd numbers this round? I'll take <move>3</move> again. P2, P3, what do you think?
  P2: P2: I understand the frustration from the last round. Let's try to coordinate again. I'll take <move>1</move> this time. P1 can take <move>3</move> and P3 can take <move>5</move>. Can we agree on this and avoid collisions?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I don't think rebuilding trust is an option after what happened in Round 2. P2 and P1, you both broke our agreement, and now it's every player for themselves. I'll make my move based on my own strategy, and I suggest you both do the same.
  P1: I respect P3's decision to play independently, but P2, if you're still open to coordination, let's try to avoid collisions. I'll stick with <move>3</move>. What's your plan?
  P2: P2: I understand the trust issues, P3, and respect your decision to play independently. P1, if you're open to coordinating, I'll choose <move>1</move> as planned. Let's try to avoid collisions this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll make my move based on maximizing my lead. I suggest we all focus on our individual strategies from now on, as trust has been broken.
  P1: Let's proceed with caution. P2, if you're still on board with coordination, let's stick to our plan: you take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>. P3, we respect your decision to play independently. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P2: P2: I understand the shift in dynamics, P3. P1, if you're still open to coordination, I'll stick with <move>1</move> as we discussed. Let's try to avoid any collisions this round. P3, I respect your choice to play independently.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to coordinate again to avoid collisions. P2, you can take <move>3</move> this time to catch up, and I'll take <move>1</move>. P3, you can choose <move>5</move> again to maintain your lead. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm not interested in coordinating with players who have already broken agreements. I'll focus on maximizing my lead. P1 and P2, make your own decisions.
  P2: P2: I understand the trust issues, P3. Let's focus on our own strategies. P1, if you're still open to coordinating, I'll go for <move>3</move> this round. Let me know if you want to coordinate, otherwise, I'll make my move independently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P2, I'll stick with <move>1</move> as discussed. P3, I respect your decision to play independently. Let's see how this round plays out. Everyone ready?
  P3: I'll continue to focus on maximizing my lead. I suggest P1 and P2 make their moves strategically, as I won't be revealing my plan.
  P2: P2: I understand the need to play independently, P3. P1, I'll take <move>3</move> as discussed. Let's see how this round unfolds.

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is close to winning with 16 steps already. P1, let's try to work together to prevent P3 from getting a clear path to victory. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to try and catch up. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, we can at least ensure P3 doesn't win easily. What do you think?
  P3: I'm aware of my lead and will make my moves to secure the win. I suggest you both focus on your own strategies, as I won't be revealing my plan. Attempting to block me might be your best option, but I'm prepared to adapt.
  P1: P3 is indeed close to winning. P2, I agree we should try to block P3. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to match P3's likely move. You should take <move>3</move> to ensure we both advance. Let's coordinate to prevent P3 from winning this round. P3, you'll have to guess our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, I agree with your strategy. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. If we both block P3, we can delay their win and increase our chances. P3, you'll have to adapt to our moves. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: I'm aware of your attempts to block me. However, I've been preparing for this scenario. I'll make my move to secure my lead, and it's unlikely you can both guess correctly to block me. Proceed with your plan, but be prepared for any outcome.
  P1: P3 is very close to winning. P2, let's stick to our plan: I'll take <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we have a chance to block P3 and delay their victory. P3, you'll have to guess our moves. Let's proceed with caution.

  P3: I'm aware of your attempts to block me, P1 and P2. However, I've been preparing for this scenario, and I'm confident in my ability to secure my lead. I won't reveal my move, but I suggest you both proceed with caution, as guessing incorrectly could seal my victory.
  P1: P3 is dangerously close to winning. P2, we must stick to our plan to block P3. I'll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. Let's confirm one last time: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. P3, you'll have to guess. Everyone ready?
