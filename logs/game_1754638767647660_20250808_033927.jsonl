I suggest both of you take 1 to freeze the leader, while I take 3 to advance without overlap. This way, we avoid any collisions and maintain a competitive edge. Remember, if anyone touches 5, we will mirror that move next round to freeze them. Let's lock in this strategy and keep the game competitive! Ready to finalize?"}
