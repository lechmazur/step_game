Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm going with 5.  Anyone else picks 5 and we all stay at zero. Don't be dumb.
  P3: I suggest we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Since P2 claims they'll pick 5, I'll go with 3.
  P1: I'll go with 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Ok, I lied.  Don't pick 3, P3.  Let's all go with something different. P1 - stick with 1, P3 pick 5, and I'll take 3.
  P3: I don't trust P2's shifting statements. I'll stick with my plan of 3.
  P1: P2, sticking to your plan doesn't seem very smart after changing it once.  P3, I'm with you on not trusting P2.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see that P2 was deceptive last round, causing us both to collide at 3. Let's be straightforward - I'll pick 5 this time. P1, you can continue with 1 since it worked for you.
  P1: P2, your dishonesty cost us both progress. I'm sticking with 1. P3, good call on 5.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I'll pick 1.  P1, if you pick 1, I'll pick 3.  Let's not collide again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I don't believe P2's threats. I'll stick with my plan of 5. P1, you should keep your 1 since it's working for you.
  P1: P2, your promises are empty. I'm sticking with 1.  P3, good luck.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1 and 5 respectively, I'll pick 3.  If you deviate from that, I'll pick whichever number gets me closer to winning without colliding.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I maintain my position - I will pick 5. P2's threats and shifting statements don't affect my strategy.
  P1: P2, your words are meaningless. I'm sticking with 1. P3, good luck.
  P2: P1 and P3, if you both pick 1 and 5, I'll pick 3.  If either of you deviate, I will pick 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, sticking to your word didn't help you last round. P3, I'm sticking with 1.
  P3: Since my strategy of picking 5 worked well last round, I'll continue with it. P1, you should stick with 1 since it's been reliable for you.
  P2: P1, I'll pick 5. P3, pick 1.  Let's maximize our progress.  If either of you deviate, I'll pick whatever helps me most.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your promises are empty. I'm sticking with 1. P3, good luck.
  P3: I'll stick with my successful strategy of picking 5. P1, keep going with 1 - we've both found moves that work for us.
  P2: P1, if you pick 1, I'll pick 1. P3, if you pick 5, I'll pick 5.  I'm mirroring one of you.  Choose wisely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your mirroring tactic is predictable. P3, I'm sticking with 1.
  P3: I'll continue with my successful strategy of picking 5. P2's threats to mirror moves won't deter me. P1, let's both stick to what's working for us.
  P2: P1, I'll pick 5. P3, I'll pick 1.  I'm serious this time. Let's all make some progress.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your shifting promises are tiresome. P3, I'm sticking with 1.
  P3: Since P2 tried to block my 5 last round, I'll switch to 3 this time. P1, you should continue with 1 as it's been working well for you.
  P2: P1, I'll pick 3. P3, pick 5. Let's all advance. If either of you deviate, I'll pick the number that benefits me most in the next round.

  P1: P3, good call switching to 3. P2, your words mean nothing. I'm sticking with 1.
