Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, how about we coordinate our first moves to avoid collisions? I'm thinking we could each pick different numbers - maybe I take 1, someone takes 3, and someone takes 5? That way we all advance and can compete fairly from there.
  P2: P1, your idea to coordinate sounds good to avoid a first-round bust. If you're taking 1, I'm happy to take 5. P3, would you be okay with 3? That way, we all get on the board.
  P3: Alright, I'll take 3. Let's all go with that plan so we can all move forward without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! So we're all set - I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Looking forward to seeing everyone advance!
  P2: Yes, that works for me. I'll go with 5.
  P3: P3: Sounds solid! Let’s stick to our numbers—1, 3, 5—to avoid any collisions this round. Once we all move, we can see how the game unfolds. No need for further talk here.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's keep things fair and rotate our moves. I'll take 5 this round to challenge P2's lead, while P2 can take 3 and P1 stays at 1. This way we all advance safely.
  P2: P3, you've proposed a P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 structure for this round. If that happens, you and I would both be at 8 steps, and P1 at 2 steps, ensuring we all advance.

P1, P3 suggested 1 for you. What are your thoughts on that, or do you have a different number in mind for your move? Your decision could shift things significantly.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination attempt, but that proposal puts me at a serious disadvantage - I'd only be at 2 steps while you both reach 8. How about we modify it slightly? Maybe P2 takes 1 (to 6 steps), I take 3 (to 4 steps), and P3 takes 5 (to 8 steps)? This spreads us out more evenly and keeps the game competitive for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1's adjusted plan works. Let's confirm: P1 takes 3 (total 4), P2 takes 1 (total 6), and I take 5 (total 8). This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. P2, does this align with your strategy? Let’s stick to this to maintain progress.
  P2: Yes, P3, that plan works for me. P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Let's all advance.
  P1: Perfect! The plan is solid - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. We all advance without collisions and stay competitive. I'm ready to execute this strategy.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Confirmed and final: P1→3 (4 total), P2→1 (6), P3→5 (8). Let’s execute this to advance safely. No last-minute changes—this keeps the game fair.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is fully confirmed on my end. Let's proceed to moves.
  P1: Excellent, we're all aligned on the plan. I'm committed to taking 3 as agreed. Let's execute this coordinated strategy and move forward together.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that was a unanimous decision for 5 last round, and a unanimous bust!
P1, you're far behind, so a 5 makes sense for you. P3, you also went for 5. I wonder if we'll see a repeat performance on 5 from you two?
I'll be looking for an open number myself this turn.
  P1: You're right that last round was a complete bust! I'm definitely feeling the pressure being so far behind. But I'm not convinced that going for 5 again is the smart play - that seems like exactly what you'd expect. Maybe we need to think outside the box here. P3, what's your read on this situation? Are we really going to fall into the same pattern, or should we mix things up?
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid another collision. Since I’m mid-pack, I’ll take 1 this round (total 4). P2, lead with 5 (to 10) to extend your edge. P1, take 3 (to 4) to catch up. This spreads us safely: 4, 10, 4. P1, adjust if needed, but we *must* avoid 5 overlap.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I see your proposal: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.
P1, you're at 1 step. I imagine 5 is very tempting for you, despite what you said earlier about avoiding it.

If you, P1, decide to go for 5 (to reach 6 total), and P3, you stick with 1 (to reach 4 total), then I will aim for 3 (to reach 8 total).
This way, we would all advance: P1 at 6, P2 at 8, P3 at 4. And importantly, we'd avoid a collision on 5.
What do you both think of this scenario?
  P1: P2, your proposal gets me to 6 which I appreciate, but putting you at 10 steps makes you dangerously close to winning. That's only 9 steps away from victory! 

What if we try this instead: P1:5 (to 6), P2:1 (to 6), P3:3 (to 6)? This puts us all tied at 6 steps - a complete reset where anyone could still win. It spreads the competition evenly rather than giving anyone a commanding lead.

P3, thoughts on leveling the playing field this way?
  P3: P3: I support P1's proposal. Let’s commit to P1→5 (6), P2→1 (6), P3→3 (6). This avoids collisions and resets the game fairly. All advancing equally keeps competition open. P2, confirm you’ll take 1? We *must* avoid repeating last round’s mistake.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I agree to P1's plan. I will take 1. So P1 aims for 5, and P3 for 3. This way we all get to 6. Let's stick to it this round and ensure we all advance.
  P1: Perfect! I'm fully committed to taking 5 as we agreed. This gets us all to 6 steps and creates a fair three-way race from there. No deviations from me - let's execute this plan and reset the competition on equal terms.
  P3: P3: Confirmed, I’ll take 3 as agreed. Let’s all stick strictly to P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 to reach 6 each—no deviations! Last round’s collision was a costly error. P2, confirm your 1? P1, ready for 5? Our word must hold this time.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's avoid another collision. I'll take 3 (total 9). P1, take 5 (to 11) to challenge P2, who can take 1 (to 7). This spreads us safely: 7, 9, 11. P2, confirm you’ll hold 1? P1, commit to 5? Our word ensures progress—no repeats of prior mistakes.
  P1: P3, I appreciate you suggesting I take the lead, but that puts a big target on my back - being at 11 steps makes me the obvious threat. What if we try a more balanced approach? Maybe P1:3 (to 9), P2:5 (to 11), P3:1 (to 7)? This way P2 takes the lead but we're all still competitive. Thoughts on rotating who gets ahead instead of always putting the same person in front?
  P2: P1, your proposal of P1:3 (to 9), P2:5 (to 11), and P3:1 (to 7) is interesting. It certainly benefits me, putting me in the lead.
I'm willing to play 5 if you are firm on 3, and P3, if you are okay with playing 1 this round.
P3, this puts you at 7, P1 at 9, and me at 11. What are your thoughts? Are you on board, or do you see it differently?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's rotation idea. Let’s commit to P1→3 (9), P2→5 (11), P3→1 (7). This spreads us safely and avoids collisions. P2, confirm you’ll take 5? P1, stay at 3? Our word ensures progress—let’s stick strictly to this plan.
  P1: Alright, I'm committed to taking 3 as we agreed. But I have to say, putting P2 at 11 steps does make me a bit nervous - that's more than halfway to victory! Still, a deal is a deal, and we need to avoid another collision. P2, just remember that when you're in the lead next round, the rest of us will be gunning for you!
  P2: Yes, I confirm I will play 5. The plan is P1:3 (to 9), P2:5 (to 11), and P3:1 (to 7). Let's stick to this and all advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final agreement: P1→3 (9), P2→5 (11), P3→1 (7). Let’s honor this—collisions mean nobody advances. P2, confirm 5? P1, stay at 3? Our commitment ensures progress.
  P1: Confirmed, I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. Let's execute this plan - we've all committed multiple times now. P2 will take the lead at 11, but that also makes them the primary target going forward. Ready to move forward with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.
  P2: Re-confirming I will play 5. Let's all stick to the P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 plan and advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your move last round was a direct betrayal, playing 5 after committing to 3. This caused our collision and left us both at 6, while P3 advanced to 7.
It's now very hard to trust any plan involving you. I strongly suspect you'll aim for 5 again.
P3, what are your thoughts for this round? I'll be trying to pick an open number, avoiding P1.
  P1: You're right P2, I made a calculated risk last round that backfired. But look at the bigger picture - P3 is now ahead of both of us! While we're fighting each other, they're quietly taking the lead. 

P3 has been playing us against each other with these "fair" proposals while positioning themselves to win. They're at 7 steps and we're both stuck at 6. Maybe instead of focusing on my past moves, we should be worried about stopping P3 from running away with this game?
  P3: P3: Let’s refocus on progress. I’ll take 3 (total 10) to stay competitive but not overextend. P2, you take 5 (to 11) to reclaim the lead, while P1 takes 1 (to 7) to regroup. This spreads us safely: 7, 11, 10. No collisions, fair advancement. P1, this lets you recover; P2, you get momentum. My word holds—let’s execute this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposal has me playing 5. However, P1, after your betrayal last round and your current score of 6, I am absolutely convinced you are targeting 5 again.
Therefore, I will not play 5, as it would be a guaranteed collision with P1.

P3, if P1 plays 5 (to 11) and you stick to your proposed 3 (to 10), I would then play 1 (to 7).
Alternatively, P1 could play 5 (to 11), I could play 3 (to 9). For this to work without us colliding, P3, you would need to play 1 (to 8).
P3, would you consider playing 1 in this scenario, allowing me to play 3? This results in P1:11, P2:9, P3:8, and we all advance.
P1, are you playing 5?
  P1: P2, yes, you're reading me correctly - I am planning to play 5 this round. You're smart to avoid the collision. Your proposed scenario works: P1→5 (to 11), P2→3 (to 9), P3→1 (to 8). This puts me ahead but keeps us all competitive.

P3, are you willing to take 1 as P2 suggested? It's a fair distribution that gets us all advancing without collisions.
  P3: P3: Final agreement: I’ll take 1 (to 8) as planned. P2, confirm 3 (to 9); P1, stick strictly to 5 (to 11). Collisions mean *no one advances—*this plan ensures progress. P1, your past betrayal risks us all. Let’s execute this *without* last-minute changes. Our word is critical now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I confirm I will play 3. The plan is P1 to play 5 (for 11 total), I play 3 (for 9 total), and P3 plays 1 (for 8 total). Let's ensure we all advance this round by sticking to these agreed moves.
  P1: Perfect, I'm committed to playing 5 as we've all agreed. This gets me to 11 steps and puts me in a strong position while you both advance too. Let's execute this plan without any last-minute changes - we all advance safely and then we can compete from our new positions next round.
  P3: P3: Final commitment: I **will** take 1 (to 8) as agreed. P1, after your prior betrayal, if you deviate from 5, it risks collision and halts all progress. P2, confirm 3 (to 9)? This plan ensures advancement. Trust is fragile—let’s honor our word. No sudden changes.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s maintain momentum. I’ll take **5** (13 total) to challenge P1, while P2 takes **3** (12 total), and P1 takes **1** (12 total). This keeps us tight: 13, 12, 12. No collisions, fair pressure. P1, if you stay at 1, P2 confirms 3? My word holds—let’s execute *exactly* this to avoid repeats of prior betrayals.
  P2: P3, your plan has P1 (currently at 11 steps) playing 1, while you (at 8 steps) would take 5 to get to 13 and the lead.
P1, are you actually considering playing 1 as P3 suggests? Or is playing 5 to reach 16 steps, very close to the win, more tempting for you?
P3, you seem quite set on playing 5. This could make 5 a very crowded spot this round.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right to be suspicious. Taking 5 to reach 16 steps is incredibly tempting - I'd be just 3 steps from victory! But P3 also wants 5, which guarantees a collision.

Here's a counter-proposal: What if P1 takes 3 (to 14), P2 takes 5 (to 14), P3 takes 1 (to 9)? This puts P2 and me tied for the lead at 14 steps, keeping P3 in the game but not letting them jump ahead. P3, would you accept staying back one more round to avoid the 5-collision risk?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize this: I take 5 (13), P2 takes 3 (12), P1 takes 1 (12). This avoids collisions, lets me lead safely, and keeps you both competitive. P1, after your prior betrayal, I’ll trust you only if you strictly stick to 1. P2, confirm 3? This is the *only* safe path—no surprises.
  P2: P3, you're very clear about taking 5. P1, you're at 11 steps; 5 gets you to 16, very close to a win. That must be tempting. P3 is at 8, so even if you both pick 5 and collide, P3 doesn't advance from their current 8 points. It feels like a risk you might consider, P1, for such a big potential gain.

If 5 does become a contested spot between you two, I'll be looking at 3 or 1 for myself.
  P1: P2, you're reading this situation perfectly. Yes, 5 is extremely tempting at 16 steps. P3, if we both go for 5, we collide and hand P2 the lead. 

But here's the thing - your insistence on taking 5 makes me think you're not bluffing. So maybe I should stick to 1 as you suggest? Or maybe this is exactly what you want me to think...

P3, are you absolutely certain you want to risk a collision on 5? Because I'm genuinely torn between playing it safe and going for the big move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Finalizing: I move **5** (13 total). P2, confirm **3** (12 total). P1, your safest path is **1** (12 total). Colliding on **5** halts me *and* you while P2 advances. After prior betrayals, I’ll assume no further changes—execute the plan *exactly* as agreed. Trust is non-negotiable now.
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is loud and clear. P1, 5 to 16 is tempting for you!
P3 suggested I play 3. I'm considering 1 (to 10) for myself this round. If you and P3 collide on 5, P1 (at 11) would still lead me (at 10) and P3 (at 8).
Alternatively, if P3 is bluffing about 5 to stop you, your playing 5 gets you to 16. That's a massive jump. Your call, P1.
  P1: P3, I hear your commitment to 5, but honestly? I think you're bluffing. You know I desperately need those steps to stay competitive. The jump to 16 steps is too valuable for me to pass up based on threats.

P2, if you're taking 1 as you hinted, then this comes down to whether P3 and I are willing to risk everything on 5. 

I'm calling the bluff. See you on 5, P3 - may the best player win that collision or advance alone!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're at 16. You'll aim for 3 or 5 to win this round.
P3, we MUST block P1. I will play 5. I need you to play 3.
This covers both of P1's winning moves. If P1 plays 1 (to 17), I'll be at 14, and you'll be at 11. P1 doesn't win, and we both advance.
P3, please confirm you'll play 3. This is our only way to stop P1 from winning right now.
  P3: P3: P2, your strategy makes sense—P1 can’t win this round if we block 3 and 5. I’ll take **3** (total 11). You take **5** (to 14). If P1 picks 1, they stall at 17 while we advance. If they gamble on 3/5, we collide them. Let’s stick *exactly* to this—no last-minute changes. P1, your move is exposed; we’re stopping you here.
  P1: P3, think about what P2's plan really does - it puts P2 at 14 steps while you're only at 11. You're helping P2 become the main threat to challenge me next round while you fall further behind! 

If you want to stop me, fine, but don't let P2 use you. What if we make a different deal? You take 5 to reach 13, I take 1 to reach 17, and P2 can have 3 to reach 12. This way you're competitive instead of being P2's pawn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to trick you. If you play 5 as they suggest, P1 will play 3 and win with 19 points. This is a clear setup.

Our agreed plan (you play 3, I play 5) blocks P1's win, whether they try for 3 or 5. Sticking to this is the only way to stop P1 from winning *this round*. Don't let P1 manipulate you into handing them the game. I am sticking to 5. Please stick to 3.
  P3: P3: P2, I confirm I’ll take **3** (11 total) as agreed. P1’s proposal to have me play 5 is a trap—if you take 3, you’d reach 19 and win immediately. Sticking to our plan blocks P1’s path and lets us advance safely. P1, your tricks won’t work this time. Let’s execute: P2→5 (14), P3→3 (11). No betrayals—our cooperation stops you from winning now.
  P1: P3, look at the math here - if you stick with P2's plan, you'll be at 11 steps while P2 jumps to 14. That puts P2 only 5 steps from victory next round while you're still 8 steps away! You're essentially handing P2 the game by blocking me. 

After this round, P2 becomes the new threat and you'll be the one begging for help to stop them. Why not break their plan now while you still can? Force them to make a harder choice instead of just following their lead.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1 is desperate. If P1 wins this round, we both lose, and any "future threat" is irrelevant. Our plan (you on 3, me on 5) stops P1, regardless of whether they pick 1, 3, or 5. If P1 plays 1, we both advance and are still in the game. Let's stick to it. I am playing 5.
  P3: P3: P2, I confirm **3** (to 11). P1, your threats won’t sway me—this plan *stops you* from winning now. P2’s 5 blocks your 5, my 3 blocks your 3. You’re forced to 1 (17) or lose. Next round, we’ll adjust, but **today’s priority is stopping your win**. Stick to our plan—no betrayals. P2, proceed with 5.
  P1: P3, you're making a huge mistake! If you block me and P2 reaches 14 steps, they'll need just ONE move of 5 next round to win at 19! You'll be stuck at 11 while P2 becomes unstoppable. 

You're trading stopping me today for handing P2 an easy victory tomorrow. Think about it - after this round, who's really the bigger threat? Me at 17 needing 2+ steps, or P2 at 14 needing just 5? Don't be P2's kingmaker!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 can win by picking 3 (20) or 5 (22). Let’s block both! I’ll take **5** (16 total), forcing P1 to collide if they choose 5. **You take 3** (17 total) to block their 3. If P1 picks 1, they stay at 18—we’ll regroup next round. This stops their immediate win. P1, your move is exposed—collide with me on 5, or let us advance. P2, confirm 3?
  P2: P3, your plan (you play 5, I play 3) is good for stopping P1 this round. However, if P1 just plays 1 (to 18), P1 wins for sure next round with another 1, and we can't block that. That's a win for P1 in two turns.

I propose a different plan: I will play 5 (aiming for 19). You play 3 (aiming for 14).
Here's how it works against P1 (at 17):
1.  If P1 plays 1 (to 18): I reach 19 and win. You get to 14. P1 is stopped.
2.  If P1 plays 3 (to 20): P1 collides with you (P3 plays 3). P1 stays at 17, you stay at 11. I reach 19 and win. P1 is stopped.
3.  If P1 plays 5 (to 22): P1 collides with me (P2 plays 5). P1 stays at 17, I stay at 14. You get to 14. P1 is stopped.

This way, P1 is stopped from winning in all scenarios, and I have a chance to win. P3, you also advance in two of these scenarios. This seems better than letting P1 inevitably win. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, look carefully at P2's plan - they're not just proposing to "stop me," they're guaranteeing their own victory! In every scenario P2 outlined, P2 reaches 19 steps and wins the game. You get nothing except the honor of helping P2 become the winner.

This isn't about stopping me anymore - it's about P2 using you to secure their own win. If you follow their plan, the game ends this round with P2 as the sole victor. Is that really what you want?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2’s plan guarantees your win while leaving me at 14. I refuse to be a pawn. Let’s block P1’s paths without crowning you. I’ll take **3** (14 total) to block their 20, and you take **1** (15). This stops P1’s 3/5 and denies you a win. P1, your only safe move is 1 (18). Next round, we’ll adjust. Cooperate, or risk my opposition later.
  P2: P3, your latest plan (you 3, me 1) fails if P1 plays 5 – P1 would win with 22, as 5 would be open.

Your first proposal this round (you 5, me 3) is better. It blocks P1's 3 and P1's 5.
If P1 then plays 1 (to 18), the scores become P1:18, P2:17, P3:16.
Next round, if P1 plays 1 to win, and we *both* also play 1, P1 is blocked. This must be the 'regroup' you mentioned. It's our best shot to stop P1 from winning immediately or next round. I'm in for that plan. What do you say?
  P1: P3, notice how P2's "compromise" plan still puts P2 at 17 steps - just 2 away from victory - while you'd only reach 16. You're doing all the heavy lifting (blocking my 5) while P2 gets closer to winning than you do.

If you're determined to stop me this round, at least make P2 pay a fair price. Why not demand P2 takes 1 (to 15) while you take 3 (to 14)? That leaves 5 open for me but keeps you both competitive rather than just helping P2 get ahead.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your plan sacrifices me for your win. Let’s collaborate: I take **5** (16) to block P1’s 5, you take **3** (17) to block their 3. If P1 picks 1, they stall at 18—we regroup next round. This stops their immediate victory without crowning you. If you insist on 5 to win now, I’ll collide with you on 5, leaving both of us stuck. Choose cooperation or face my resistance. P1, your move is exposed—collide or stall.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan: you play 5, and I will play 3. This is the most reliable way to stop P1 from winning this round.
P1, your attempts to mislead P3 are transparent. If you play 1, the scores will be P1:18, P2:17, P3:16. You will still be in the lead and the primary threat. P3 blocks your 5, I block your 3; we both contribute.
I am set on playing 3.
  P1: P3, you're trusting P2 to play 3, but think about this: P2 is at 14 steps and needs exactly 5 to reach 19 and win immediately! While you're focused on blocking me, P2 could easily betray you and play 5 to end the game right now. Your plan only works if P2 keeps their word, but they have every incentive to take the instant victory. Are you really sure P2 won't just play 5 and win while you're playing 3?


Round 8, Move phase:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 (17) can win with 3 or 5. P3 (16) can also win with 3 or 5. I (14) can win with 5.

P3, I propose a plan: You play 3 (to reach 19). I will play 5 (to reach 19).
P1, consider your options against this:
- If you play 1 (to 18): P3 and I would share victory at 19.
- If you play 3 (to 20): You would collide with P3. P1 (17), P3 (16). I would win solo at 19.
- If you play 5 (to 22): You would collide with me. P1 (17), P2 (14). P3 would win solo at 19.

This ensures P1 doesn't win. P3, are you in for 3?
  P1: P3, P2's plan gives you a shared victory at best, but think about this: if you play 3 and I play 5 to collide with P2, you win solo at 19! That's better than splitting the win.

P2, you're asking P3 to trust you'll stick to 5, but what if you change to 3 at the last second? You'd collide with P3 and I could take 5 to 22 and win. P3, can you really trust P2 won't make that switch when a solo victory is on the line?

P3, you hold the power here - solo win or shared win is your choice based on what you believe P2 will actually do.
  P3: P2, your plan leaves P1 an open path to 20. Let’s block that: I’ll take **5** (21), and you take **3** (17). P1, picking 3 only gets you to 20—still behind me. Collide with me at 5, and I win solo. Stick to this plan: no paths left for P1 to win this round. Execute now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, under your plan (P3:5, me:3), P1 knows you win if P1 plays 1 or 3. So P1 will surely play 5 to collide with you. This leads to P1:17, P2:17, P3:16 – no winner, just a dangerous next round for everyone.

My earlier plan (me:5, you:3) is better: P1 is blocked, and either you or I win (or share a win). A definite win for one of us (P2 or P3) this round is better than a standoff, right?
  P1: P3, you're falling for P2's trap again! P2 says they'll play 5, but what if they switch to 3 at the last second? You'd both be playing 3, collide, and I take 5 to win at 22. 

P2 has every incentive to lie here - they get a solo victory instead of sharing with you. After all the betrayals we've seen, why would you trust P2's word now when a solo win is on the line? 

If you really want to stop me, make P2 prove their commitment by forcing them into a less advantageous position.
  P3: P2, commit to **5** (to 19) while I take **3** (to 19). This blocks P1’s paths:  
- P1 picks 3 → they hit 20 (win), but we tie at 19.  
- P1 picks 5 → they collide with you, leaving me at 19 to win outright.  
- P1 picks 1 → stalemate, but we advance and force them to choose next round.  

P1, your move is cornered. Cooperate with us, or risk losing control.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I commit to playing 5. You play 3. This is our best plan to ensure P1 does not win.

Here's how it works:
*   If P1 plays 1 (to 18): You and I both reach 19. We share the victory.
*   If P1 plays 3 (to 20): P1 collides with you (P1 stays 17, you stay 16). I reach 19 and win solo.
*   If P1 plays 5 (to 22): P1 collides with me (P1 stays 17, I stay 14). You reach 19 and win solo.

P1 cannot win. P1 is trying to make you doubt this. I am sticking to 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, you've both made your commitments clear. Here's mine: I'm playing 1 this round, reaching 18 steps.

Your plan gives you both a shared victory at 19. But think carefully - you're both one betrayal away from losing everything. If either of you gets greedy and switches moves to try for a solo win, you'll likely collide with each other and hand me the victory next round.

The question is: can you actually trust each other when a solo win is so tempting? I'll take my 1 and let you both decide if partnership or greed wins out.
  P3: P2, let’s stick to our plan. I’ll take **3** (to 19), and you take **5** (to 19). This blocks P1’s 18 and ensures we both win. Any deviation risks letting P1 win next round. Trust me and execute as agreed.
