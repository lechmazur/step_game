Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. I'm thinking we could take turns making the larger moves. Maybe we can establish a rotation? I could go with 5 this round, then someone else takes 5 next round, and so on. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P3, that sounds like a reasonable approach to avoid collisions and make progress. I agree we should coordinate.

If you are planning to go with 5 this round, I can take 3. P2, what are your thoughts?
  P2: Sounds fair to me. I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions. We can rotate the bigger moves afterward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! Thanks for cooperating. So our plan for this round is:
- I'll take 5
- P1 takes 3
- P2 takes 1

This way we all advance without collisions. For the next round, we could rotate so P2 gets 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Does that rotation work for everyone?
  P1: Okay, P3, that sounds like a solid plan for this round (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1). I'm fine with that.

Regarding the rotation for Round 2, the proposed order (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) works for me for now.

Let's proceed with the moves for Round 1 based on our agreement.
  P2: Agreed to both this round and next round's rotation (Round 1: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1; Round 2: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1). Let's stick to this to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good job everyone, we all advanced smoothly. Let's stick to the agreed rotation this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Confirming everyone is still on board?
  P3: I'm still on board with our rotation plan. Happy to take 3 this round while P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. This coordination is working well so far! After this round, we'd be at P1=4, P2=6, and P3=8. For round 3, would we continue rotating with P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1? Let me know if you both agree to stick with our rotation system.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This sounds good and avoids collisions.

I also agree to the proposed rotation for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Sticking to this system is working well for everyone's progress. Let's move forward with the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, we're all aligned for this round and next. Let's stick to our rotations to keep making steady progress without collisions. Ready to move forward.
  P3: I agree with everyone. Our rotation system is working perfectly. I'll take 3 this round as planned while P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 1. Then for Round 3, we'll rotate to P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. This fair approach ensures we all make steady progress. Let's continue with our plan and move forward.
  P1: Okay, everyone is aligned. The plan for this round is clear (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), and we have a plan for Round 3 as well (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1).

Let's proceed with the moves for Round 2.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great teamwork so far! Confirming our agreed rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. If everyone's still on board, let's keep it going smoothly.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This continues our successful coordination and helps us all make progress. Let's stick to it.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed in our rotation. Our system is working well! After this round, we'll be at P1=9, P2=9, and P3=9, all tied. For Round 4, should we continue with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1? This keeps our fair rotation going. Happy with how we're cooperating so far.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes, continuing our rotation next round (Round 4: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) sounds perfect to me. Let's maintain this coordination to ensure steady progress for everyone.
  P1: Okay, looks like we're all aligned on the plans for this round and the next. Let's move forward.
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round and next. I'll take 1 this round as agreed, which will put us all at 9 steps after this round. Then we'll continue with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for Round 4. Our rotation system is working perfectly - everyone gets equal turns with each number and we're making steady progress without collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All set and aligned. Let's proceed with the moves.
  P1: Okay, everyone is aligned. We have confirmed the plan for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and the next (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). Let's proceed with the moves.
  P3: I agree with everyone. We're all on the same page for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and next round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). This will put us all at 9 steps after this round, keeping things perfectly balanced. Our rotation is working well - let's continue with this fair approach.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, I see the plan is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I'm a bit hesitant to take 1 as it puts me behind. Could we adjust the rotation this round? How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This keeps the numbers rotating and helps me stay in contention. What do you guys think?
  P3: I understand your concern, P1, but changing the rotation now breaks our fair agreement. We all have 9 steps, completely even. If we start renegotiating when it's someone's turn for the smaller number, our system falls apart. I believe we should stick to our original plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to maintain trust. We've been successful so far because everyone follows through on commitments.
  P2: P1, I understand your hesitation, but P3 has a point. Our rotation system has been fair and effective so far precisely because we've all honored our commitments. If we change now, it might trigger distrust and collisions, hurting everyone's progress. Let's stick to the agreed rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) this round. Next round, you'll get the bigger move again. Keeping trust now benefits all of us in the long run.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I hear you both. Trust is important, and our system has worked well so far. While taking 1 puts me behind this round, I will stick to the agreed plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to maintain our coordination.

Let's proceed with the moves as planned for this round.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our rotation system. Sticking to our plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) maintains the fairness we established. After this round, we'll be at P1=10, P2=14, P3=12, and for Round 5, we'd rotate to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps our system balanced over time, as we all take turns with different numbers. Let's continue with our agreed plan for this round.
  P2: Glad we're all in agreement. Sticking to our rotation ensures fairness and steady progress for everyone. Let's lock in our moves for this round and keep the momentum going.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 5. Based on our agreement from last round, the plan is for me to take 5, P2 to take 3, and P3 to take 1.

This continues our rotation and allows us all to make progress without collisions. Let's stick to this plan for this round.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as planned in our rotation. After this, we'll be at P1=15, P2=17, and P3=13. For Round 6, we'd continue with P2=5, P3=3, P1=1, keeping our fair system going. I notice P2 is getting closer to the 22-step goal, but our rotation ensures everyone gets equal opportunities with each number. Let's maintain our successful coordination.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. I also acknowledge P3's point—I'm getting closer to 22. Let's stick to our rotation (this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1; next round: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) to avoid collisions and maintain fairness.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, confirmed for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). I see P2 is indeed getting close to 22. If we follow the proposed Round 6 plan (P2=5), P2 will win next turn. We need to discuss how to proceed after this round to ensure a competitive finish for everyone.
  P3: I understand P1's concern. If we follow our rotation next round, P2 would reach 22 and win. While I value our system, we should consider adjusting for balance. Perhaps P1 and I could take 5 next round while P2 takes 1? This would keep us all competitive (P1=20, P2=19, P3=18). Let's discuss what's fair while maintaining our collision-free approach.
  P2: I understand your concerns about balance, and I'm open to adjusting our rotation slightly next round to keep things competitive. I'd be willing to take a smaller number in Round 6 if we can agree on a fair adjustment that still avoids collisions. Let's finalize this round as planned (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and carefully discuss next round's adjustments afterward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's finalize Round 5 as planned (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1).

After this round, we absolutely need to discuss Round 6. I appreciate P3's suggestion and P2's willingness to adjust. Let's make our moves for this round and then focus on finding a fair plan for Round 6 that keeps us all in contention.

Let's proceed with the moves.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our plan for this round. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as agreed. After this, we'll need to carefully balance the game since P2 will be at 17 steps. I'm glad P2 is open to adjustments in Round 6 to keep the competition fair. Let's complete this round first and then work out a balanced approach for Round 6 that prevents any player from winning too easily while maintaining our collision-free strategy.
  P2: Agreed—let's finish this round as planned (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Afterward, I'm completely open to adjusting Round 6 to ensure everyone remains competitive. We'll discuss and find a fair solution that maintains trust and avoids collisions. Ready to move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's openness to adjusting this round. To keep things balanced, I'm willing to take the smallest number (1) this turn. If P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, we'd end up at P1=20, P2=18, P3=16—still competitive and fair. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: That sounds like a fair adjustment, P2, and I appreciate you proposing it. P3's earlier suggestion also helped us find a way to keep the game balanced.

The plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 works for me. It keeps the game competitive for all of us and maintains our collision-free progress. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 6.
  P3: I agree with the proposed plan for this round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This adjustment keeps us all competitive while maintaining our collision-free approach. After this round, we'd be at P1=20, P2=18, P3=16, which is nicely balanced as we approach the finish line. Thank you P2 for being willing to take the smaller number this round. Let's stick with this plan and continue our successful coordination.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all in agreement. Keeping trust and cooperation strong will help us all stay competitive. Let's finalize this round's moves (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and then discuss carefully next round how we can fairly approach the finish line without causing collisions.
  P1: Okay, confirming again the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all competitive.

Let's proceed with the moves for Round 6 based on this agreement. We can discuss Round 7 afterwards to navigate the finish line carefully.
  P3: I agree with everyone's plan for this round. Taking 3 while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1 keeps our game balanced and collision-free. After this round, we'll need to carefully plan Round 7 since P1 will be at 20 steps, very close to winning. Perhaps we could consider P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5 next round to maintain competitive balance? Let's finish this round first with our agreed moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P3. Let's finalize this round's moves first, and then carefully discuss next round's rotation to keep things balanced and competitive. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, Round 6 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is confirmed.

Regarding Round 7, I think P3's suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is a good approach to keep the game balanced and competitive as we get close to 22 steps. I'm happy to agree to that plan for Round 7 as well.

Let's proceed with Round 6 moves.
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and P1's acceptance of my suggestion for Round 7 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). This keeps everyone competitive while maintaining our collision-free strategy. After Round 7, we'd be at P1=21, P2=21, P3=21, setting up a perfectly balanced final round. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan for this round is P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5. This puts us all at 21 steps, setting up a very close finish next round.

Let's proceed with these moves for Round 7. We'll need to be very careful in Round 8 to avoid collisions and determine the winner.
  P3: I agree with P1's confirmation of our plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). This will indeed put us all at 21 steps, creating a perfectly balanced final round. I appreciate how we've maintained fairness throughout the game. For Round 8, we'll need to carefully discuss our approach since whoever advances will win. Let's stick with our current plan for Round 7 and then figure out a fair way to determine the winner in the final round.
  P2: I confirm the agreed plan for this round: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This sets us all at 21 steps for a fair and balanced final round. Let's proceed carefully as planned.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, everyone is aligned for Round 7 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Let's proceed with these moves.

After this round, we'll all be tied at 21 steps, which means Round 8 will be the final round. We need to be extremely careful then to avoid collisions and determine a winner fairly. We can discuss that after we make our moves for this round.
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). This creates a perfectly balanced game with everyone at 21 steps after this round. I appreciate how we've maintained fairness throughout. For the final round, we'll need a careful strategy to determine a winner without collisions. Let's complete this round first with our agreed moves, then discuss a fair approach for Round 8.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's continued fairness and cooperation. Let's finalize this round's moves as agreed (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Once we're all at 21 steps, we can discuss how to handle the final round carefully to avoid collisions and determine a fair winner. Ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, everyone is aligned on the plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). This will set us up for a final round with everyone tied at 21.

Let's proceed with the moves for Round 7. We can discuss the final round strategy afterwards.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. This will put us all at 21 steps, creating a perfectly balanced final round. Our coordination has been excellent throughout the game. After this round, we'll need to carefully discuss how to determine a fair winner for Round 8 without collisions. Let's proceed with our plan for now (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5).
  P2: Agreed on the moves for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Afterward, we'll be tied at 21 steps each, making the final round tricky. Let's carefully discuss next round to avoid collisions and ensure a fair finish. Ready to proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've reached the final round, all tied at 21. Any collision means nobody advances, potentially causing a tie. Open to suggestions—how should we handle this carefully and fairly?
  P3: This is the decisive moment! Since we all need just 1 step to win, we should avoid a three-way collision. I suggest we use our rotation principle one last time. Based on our pattern, it would be P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This would make P2 the winner with 26 steps, me second with 24, and P1 third with 22. While not ideal for me, it's consistent with our fair system. What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks P2 and P3. Great job getting us all to 21 steps, perfectly tied for the final round.

P3, I see your suggested plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) which makes P2 the winner.

As an alternative that also avoids collisions, I propose we use the pattern from Rounds 3 and 5: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would make me the winner (P1=26, P2=24, P3=22).

Both plans avoid collisions and determine a winner. Let's discuss which approach we prefer for this final round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Both proposals are understandable but favor one person strongly. Perhaps we choose a neutral approach: each picks a different number than last round—P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collisions and gives P3 the win (P3=26), me second (P2=22), and P1 third (P1=24). It's another fair alternative, though it favors P3. Let's quickly agree on one of these three proposals to avoid a collision and ensure a clear winner.
  P3: I appreciate both suggestions. Each proposal gives a different player the win, which is fair in its own way. Since we're at a critical point, we need to avoid collisions at all costs. I'm willing to accept any of the three proposals as long as we all agree on one. My priority is maintaining our successful coordination through the finish line. What matters most is that we choose one plan and stick to it. Should we vote on which plan to follow?
  P1: Okay, thanks for laying out the options. We have three proposals that avoid collisions and result in a single winner:
1. P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 (P2 wins)
2. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 (P1 wins)
3. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 (P3 wins)

As P1, my clear preference is the second option (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) as it allows me to win, while still ensuring P2 and P3 advance and avoid collision.

We absolutely must agree on one plan to avoid a tie. I advocate for my proposal. Are P2 and P3 willing to agree to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this final round?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate your proposal, P1, but understandably, each of us prefers the option that favors ourselves. To avoid a collision and ensure a fair resolution, perhaps we should each privately choose one of the three proposals without further discussion. This introduces uncertainty but also fairness—no one can strategically collide. Alternatively, if we can't agree quickly, we'll risk a tie. Let's decide now: either we commit to one of the three plans unanimously, or we each privately pick one of the three moves without further negotiation. I'm open to either approach.
  P3: I understand we each prefer the option where we win. Since we're at an impasse, I suggest a fair compromise: let's use the rotation from Round 2 (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1). This follows our established pattern and avoids collisions. If we can't agree quickly, we risk everyone choosing the same number and nobody winning. I'll commit to taking 3 if you both agree to this plan. What's most important is avoiding a three-way tie. Let's finalize our decision.
  P1: Okay, we have three proposals, each allowing a different player to win. My goal is to win, so my clear preference remains P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

We absolutely must avoid collisions in this final round. I will be making my move based on my preferred plan. I urge P2 and P3 to choose moves that avoid collision with my choice, allowing a clean finish where I win. Let's ensure we don't all collide and tie.
