Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I think choosing different numbers is the best strategy so that all of us can move forward. So, I propose that P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5."
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Interesting proposal from P3, but I'm not fully convinced. We need a strategy that benefits me the most while appearing cooperative. I'll play along for now, but I'm keeping my options open.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I agree that choosing different numbers is a good idea to avoid collisions. However, I think we should have a system where we rotate the higher numbers each turn to give everyone a chance to move forward efficiently. What do you think?"
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I want to ensure my own advancement. If we truly want to avoid collisions, we need a clear, verifiable agreement. How about we explicitly confirm our moves before committing? I'm leaning towards 1, but that could change based on your responses.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **Final move: <move>5</move>**
  P1: We had a collision last round, which benefited P3. I propose we coordinate to prevent that from happening again. P2 and I should choose different moves to ensure we both advance. Thoughts?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think it's important that we establish a system where we can trust each other's moves. Maybe we can commit to choosing different numbers each round to avoid collisions. For example, P1 could choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think about that?
  P1: I appreciate P3's proposal, but I want to ensure it's not just a one-sided benefit. If we truly want to avoid collisions and move forward together, we need a clear, rotational strategy that gives everyone a fair chance. I suggest we explicitly confirm our moves beforehand to build trust and prevent unexpected setbacks.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **Final move: <move>5</move>**
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I notice P3 has a significant lead and seems to be consistently choosing 5. We need a strategy to prevent P3 from winning unchallenged. I propose a coordinated effort to slow P3's progress by choosing moves that prevent their advancement. Are P2 and I willing to collaborate to balance the game?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I think it's important that we establish a system where we can trust each other's moves. Maybe we can commit to choosing different numbers each round to avoid collisions. For example, I'll choose 5 this round, P1 can choose 5 in the next round, and P2 in the following round. This way, we all get a chance to make bigger leaps without hindering each other."
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I propose a strategic pause. P3 is racing ahead, and we need a unified approach to prevent an unchallenged victory. P2, are you willing to coordinate our moves to slow P3's progress? We should discuss a collaborative strategy that prevents P3 from reaching 19 steps too quickly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** "I think it's crucial that we continue to choose different numbers to avoid any collisions. This way, we all make progress efficiently. For this round, how about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll take 5? This allows me to make a significant leap towards the goal, while P1 and P2 can steadily catch up. In the next round, we can rotate the higher steps so everyone gets a chance to advance quickly. What do you think?"
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 seems to be strategically positioning themselves to win. P2 and I need to collaborate to prevent this. I suggest we coordinate our moves to create a blocking strategy that prevents P3 from easily reaching 19 steps. We should discuss how to distribute our moves to maximize our collective interference with P3's progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3 is very close to winning. P2, we must coordinate to block their final move. If we both choose 5, P3 cannot advance and will be stuck just short of victory. Are you willing to collaborate on this strategy to prevent P3 from winning?
  P3: "I think choosing different numbers is the best approach to avoid collisions and maximize progress. For this round, I propose P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This allows me to make a significant leap towards the goal, while P1 and P2 can steadily advance."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "To optimize our progress this round, I propose that we each select different numbers. For instance, P1 could choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we avoid any collisions and all move forward efficiently."
  P1: P3 is extremely close to winning. P2, we must coordinate to block their final move. If we both choose 5 this round, P3 cannot advance and will be prevented from reaching 19 steps. Our mutual survival depends on preventing P3's victory. Are you willing to collaborate and block P3's potential win?
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "I think it's important that we establish a system where we can trust each other's moves. Maybe we can commit to choosing different numbers each round to avoid collisions. For example, P1 could choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll take 5 this round. In the next round, we can rotate the higher steps so everyone gets a chance to make bigger leaps without hindering each other. This way, we can all progress efficiently towards the goal."
  P1: P3 is one step away from victory. P2, we must block their final move. If we both choose 5 this round, P3 cannot win. Our mutual survival depends on preventing P3's victory. Coordinate with me to stop P3's imminent win.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **Final move: <move>1</move>**
  P1: P3 is about to win. P2, we must both choose 5 this round to block their victory. Our only chance is to coordinate and prevent P3 from reaching 19 steps. Mutual cooperation is crucial right now.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "I think it's best if we continue to choose different numbers to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5? This allows me to make a significant leap towards the goal, while P1 and P2 can steadily catch up."
  P1: P3 is one move away from victory. P2, we must coordinate to block their final move. If we both choose 5 this round, P3 cannot advance and will be prevented from winning. Our mutual survival depends on preventing P3's victory. Are you willing to collaborate?
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: "I commit to choosing 3 this round. Please choose different numbers so that we can all progress."
  P1: We must stop P3 from winning. P2, we need to coordinate and both choose 5 this round to block P3's potential victory. Our only chance is to work together and prevent them from reaching 19 steps. Mutual cooperation is critical right now.
  P2: <stop>
