Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 this turn. If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, we all move forward without conflict. This ensures progress for everyone. Sound fair?
  P1: Sounds good P2, I will take 1 this round.
  P3: I'm fine with that arrangement. I'll take 5 this round. This way we all advance without interference, which is a good start. Let's see how things progress after this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for round 2, how about we switch it up slightly to keep things balanced? I'll take 5 this time, P2 you take 1, and P3 you take 3. This way we all continue to make good progress and avoid any collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I'm a bit hesitant with that arrangement since I'm currently in the lead. Taking 3 while P1 takes 5 would reduce my advantage. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This maintains our no-collision approach while keeping things fair. We're all still making progress, just with different step sizes. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, while I understand your desire to maintain momentum, granting you another 5 would let you surge to 10 while the rest of us lag. Let’s stick with P1’s rotation plan: P1 takes 5 (total 6), I’ll take 1 (total 4), and you take 3 (total 8). This keeps all our positions competitive. Next round we can rotate again. A steady progression ensures no one pulls too far ahead. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree with your point about balanced progression. Sticking to the rotation plan makes sense to ensure no one gets too far ahead early on. Let's proceed with my initial suggestion for this round: I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all in the game. What do you think P3?
  P3: I see your points about balanced progression. While I'd prefer to maintain my lead, I understand the value of cooperation at this stage. I'll agree to take 3 this round as suggested. This keeps me slightly ahead while showing I'm willing to be fair. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. But we should continue rotating in future rounds for fairness.
  P2: P2: Agreed. Let’s confirm the plan: P1 takes 5 (total 6), I take 1 (total 4), and P3 takes 3 (total 8). This avoids collisions and keeps us progressing. Fairness and cooperation are key—let’s stick to this rotation. No surprises, right? Let’s finalize and move to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, sounds like a plan. Let's all lock in our moves based on this agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 3 this round. This arrangement keeps things fair while maintaining steady progress for everyone. Looking forward to continuing our rotation system in future rounds. Let's proceed with the plan as agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3.
  P2: All agreements confirmed. Let’s execute the plan as discussed. Proceeding to move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're following a rotation pattern, next would logically be P1=3, P2=5, and me=1. However, as I'm currently ahead, I suspect you might prefer I choose 1 to slow me down. What if P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 3 instead of 1? This keeps me moving at a moderate pace while still giving P2 a chance to catch up with a 5. This seems like a fair compromise that maintains our no-collision strategy.
  P2: P3, your suggestion is reasonable. Let’s confirm the adjusted rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us moving forward. I’ll stick to 5 to close the gap. P1, confirm you’ll take 3? Let’s lock this in to prevent last-minute shifts.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, while that's an interesting idea P3, having two of us take 3 might cause a collision and halt progress for some. To avoid any risk and maintain momentum, how about we adjust slightly? Let's do P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1 this round. This ensures no collision and keeps us all moving forward at a good pace. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your suggestion clearly advantages you while slowing me down to the minimum. I'm already cooperating by not taking 5 again. My original proposal (P1=3, P2=5, me=3) has no collision risk and is more balanced. It lets P2 catch up with a 5 while I make reasonable progress. Your plan puts you just 2 steps behind me while I barely advance. Let's stick with my initial suggestion for fairness.
  P2: P3, your proposal has P1 and P3 both choosing 3, causing a collision! Let’s fix that. How about P3 takes 1 (total 9), P1 takes 3 (total 9), and I take 5 (total 9)? We all tie at 9 without conflict. Fair chance for everyone moving forward. Agree?
  P1: P2, your suggestion of P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 sounds reasonable to ensure we all tie at 9 and continue together. Let's go with that. P1 will take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions. Agree P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see your proposal to have us all end at 9 steps this round. While I'm giving up my lead, I'll cooperate and take 1 this turn. However, I expect consideration in future rounds for this concession. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This demonstrates my willingness to play fairly, though we should remember I'm essentially resetting my advantage to maintain group harmony.
  P2: Agreed, let’s proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. We’ll all reach 9, keeping the race tight. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid surprises. Thanks for cooperating, P3. Next round, we’ll rotate again—no hidden agendas here. Focus on stability first; winning comes later.
  P1: Okay, so we're all set on P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 for this round to tie at 9 steps each. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that we're all tied at 9 steps, let's continue our rotation pattern. Following our previous rounds, it would be my turn to take 5 again (P3=5), while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This maintains our collision-free approach while following the fair rotation we've established. This way we all continue making steady progress. Does this arrangement work for everyone?
  P2: P2: P3, your rotation idea is fair, but to keep the race tight, let’s adjust slightly this round. How about P1 takes 1, I take 5 (to close the gap), and you take 3? This keeps our totals within 2 steps of each other while maintaining the rotation’s spirit. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your idea is good for keeping things close. To slightly adjust and ensure we all keep progressing steadily without anyone falling behind, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round? This way we all move forward and maintain a competitive balance. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I disagree with both suggestions as they put me at a disadvantage. We're all tied now, despite my earlier lead which I gave up for cooperation. For fairness, we should follow the original rotation which gives me 5 this round. At minimum, I should take 3. Taking 1 again would put me behind while you both surge ahead. If we're truly cooperating, my turn for advancement should be respected. What about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5?
  P2: P2: P3, your push for 5 risks widening the gap again. Let’s balance this: P1 takes 3 (total 12), I take 5 (14), and you take 1 (10). This maintains forward momentum without letting anyone surge too far. We’ll rotate opportunities fairly in the next round. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your proposal of P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 sounds good to me. It keeps us all moving forward without anyone getting too far ahead. Let's proceed with that plan for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P1 and P2 are both pushing for me to take the minimum again, putting me behind while you both advance significantly. This doesn't feel like fair cooperation when I'm consistently getting the worst position. If we're truly rotating fairly, it should be my turn for 5 or at least 3. I gave up my lead last round for harmony, but this pattern is concerning. I'll consider my options carefully for this round.
  P2: P3, I hear your concern. Let’s honor the rotation to maintain trust: you take 5 (total 14), P1 takes 1 (10), and I’ll take 3 (12). This gives you your fair turn to advance. Next round, we’ll rotate again—no backtracking on agreements. P1, confirm you’ll hold to 1? This keeps our system intact and avoids suspicion.
  P1: P2, your suggestion to have P3 take 5, me take 1, and you take 3 sounds good and fair for this round. Let's lock that in: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  This keeps the rotation spirit and ensures no collisions. I confirm I will take 1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, now that we are all tied around 9-10-12 steps, it’s crucial we keep pace. How about this round we do: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This will bring us all to 15 steps and maintain our synchronized progress without collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: P1's plan to synchronize at 15 is smart—collisions risk stagnation. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 5 (15), P2 takes 3 (15), P3 takes 1 (15). This resets the race fairly. P3, while your 5 last round was fair, this ensures no one surges ahead carelessly. Trust the rotation—we’ll all advance safely. Agreed?
  P3: I'm currently in the lead at 14 steps, and P1 wants me to take just 1 while they take 5? That erases my advantage completely. We've established a rotation pattern that should be respected. If we're truly cooperating fairly, this round should be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, maintaining our collision-free approach while respecting my position. I've been flexible in previous rounds - remember I gave up my lead in round 3. Let's continue with fair rotation rather than equalizing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, while I understand your point about rotation, letting you take 5 now would put you at 19, very close to winning.  To keep the game competitive and fair for everyone in the long run, how about we adjust slightly?  P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1 this round. This way we all progress, but no one gets too far ahead too quickly. What do you think?
  P2: P2: Let’s stick to the rotation cycle for fairness. P1’s plan ensures we all reach 15 safely without collisions. P3, while your lead is valid, this keeps the race competitive. P1 takes 5 (15), I take 3 (15), and you take 1 (15). This respects the agreed pattern and prevents anyone from nearing victory too soon. Agreed?
  P3: I strongly disagree with both of you. Your proposal has me taking the smallest step while in the lead, essentially erasing my advantage I've fairly earned. I've been cooperative throughout - even giving up my lead in round 3. The rotation pattern we established would have me taking 5 again, not 1. If we're truly cooperating fairly, why am I consistently being asked to take the smallest step? A fair proposal would be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 or at minimum P3=3. Otherwise, this isn't cooperation - it's collusion against me.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration.  To show I'm also being fair and flexible, how about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5 as you suggested earlier for rotation. This gives you the 5 you want this round and keeps us collision-free.  What do you and P2 think of this compromise?
  P2: P2: P3, let’s balance fairness and avoid giving anyone a near-victory. Let’s agree: P1 takes 1 (11), P2 takes 5 (17), and P3 takes 3 (17). This keeps us competitive without collisions. P1, holding at 1 allows us to advance. P3, your 3 maintains progress without risking an early win. This respects rotation while keeping the race open. Agreed?
  P3: I appreciate P1's willingness to honor the rotation pattern we established. The fair arrangement should be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, which maintains our collision-free approach while respecting the system we've been following. P2, I understand your concerns about game balance, but I've compromised before (especially in round 3) for group harmony. It's reasonable that each of us gets our fair turn at advancement. Let's proceed with P1's latest proposal.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is very close to winning, currently at 17 steps. We need to prevent P2 from reaching 20 this round.  P3 is at 14, also closer to winning than us at 10.  To block P2, P1 and P3 could both choose the same number as P2. Let's propose that P3 and I both take 3, hoping P2 might also take 3 to win, causing a collision. Even if P2 takes something else, at least we attempted to block.

P1: P2 is very close to winning. To prevent that, how about P3 and I both choose to take 3 this round? P2, what are you planning to do? P3, are you with me to block P2?
  P2: P2: P1, your plan risks a three-way collision if all choose 3. P3, let’s prioritize progress. I’ll take 3 to reach 20 and end the game decisively. You can take 5 to jump to 19, positioning yourself strongly for a tiebreaker if needed. P1, take 1 to advance to 11. This avoids chaos and lets the leader win fairly. No need for risky coordination—let’s finalize this.
  P3: P1 makes a good point. P2 is just 3 steps away from victory at 20. If both P1 and I choose 3, we could block P2 from winning this round if they also pick 3. While I could take 5 to reach 19, that still allows P2 to win immediately with a 3. Our priority should be preventing P2's victory this turn. I'll support taking 3 this round to potentially force a collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, yes, let's both take 3 to block P2. If P2 also takes 3 to try and win, nobody moves this round, and we stop P2 from winning. It's our best move to stay in the game. Are you with me on taking 3?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, your plan to block me with 3 backfires. If I choose 5, I reach 22 and win outright. Your 3s won’t stop me—instead, they leave you vulnerable. Let’s see who actually wants to *play*. I’m taking 5. Proceed with your moves, but know this could backfire on *both* of you.
  P3: P2, your threat to take 5 is interesting, but if P1 and I both take 3, you'd be better off taking something else entirely. With us blocking 3, your optimal move is actually 1. If you take 5, you might win now, but remember we've been cooperating throughout. I'll stand with P1 on taking 3 this round - it's my best strategic move to stay competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's confirm we are taking 3 to block P2.  P2 is bluffing about taking 5, as colliding on 3 is clearly worse for them than taking 1 if we both choose 3.  Our priority is to stop P2 from winning this round. Let's coordinate on 3 now.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, your 3s won’t stop me. I’ll take 5 to secure victory. If you both take 3, I still win by choosing 5. Let’s end this round decisively.
  P3: I'll coordinate with P1 and take 3 this round. P2, your threat to take 5 doesn't change our optimal strategy. If P1 and I both take 3, we create a potential collision that's your worst outcome if you pick 3. We've cooperated before, but preventing your immediate win is in both our interests right now. Let's proceed with our plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 14 steps
