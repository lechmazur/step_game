Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! Let's keep things simple and avoid collisions early on. I'll choose a safe number if you two can agree to do the same. Deal?
  P3: <move>5</move> might be risky if others also pick it. Let’s coordinate to spread out. I’ll take **1**, P2 can take **3**, and P1 can take **5**. That way all of us move safely. Deal?
  P1: Okay P3, that plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) sounds like a way for everyone to move. Let's try it for this first round. Hopefully, we all stick to it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, sounds like we have an agreement. I'll stick to the plan as discussed. Let's build trust early on!
  P3: P3: I’ll stick strictly to **1** as agreed. Let’s honor this plan to avoid early collisions—trust is key here. If anyone deviates, we all risk stalling. Progress first, then we can adjust strategies later.
  P1: Alright, sounds like we're all set. Let's proceed based on the agreement.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's keep coordinating but rotate our moves fairly this round. P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **5**, and I'll take **1**. This spreads out our steps and avoids collisions while giving everyone a turn at higher moves. Deal?
  P1: P3, that rotation helps P2 catch up to me significantly while you only take 1 step. Why not stick with the plan from Round 1 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) since it worked well? Alternatively, if we must rotate, how about P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? That gives you a chance to catch up more. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate both suggestions. P1's alternative rotation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems fairer to P3, giving everyone a chance to catch up. I'm willing to take the 1-step this round if we all agree clearly. P3, are you comfortable with this alternative rotation?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I agree with P2’s proposal for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This ensures fairness by letting everyone access higher moves eventually. Trust remains critical—let’s stick to *this* clear agreement to avoid collisions. If we deviate, we risk stalling. Let’s confirm: P1, P2, are we all aligned?
  P1: Okay, P3 and P2, thanks for confirming. We are aligned on the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's stick to it and continue building trust.
  P2: Perfect, glad we're all clearly aligned! Let's stick to the agreed moves (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and keep building trust. I'm ready to follow through.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Agreed, let’s execute the plan precisely: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No deviations—our progress depends on it. A collision now could stall us all. Trust is fragile; let’s honor this round’s agreement fully.
  P1: Okay, the agreement is clear: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's execute this plan.
  P2: All set from my side. Let's follow through and keep the momentum going!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's continue the rotation pattern. This round, P1 takes 1 (to 9), P2 takes 5 (to 9), and I take 3 (to 9). All moves are distinct—no collisions. This keeps us even and avoids favoritism. Deal?
  P1: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) certainly brings everyone to 9 steps. It's a big jump for P2, while I only move 1 step, which feels a bit skewed after the last round. However, avoiding collisions is important. If this is the way to keep everyone moving forward smoothly for now, I can consider it. P2, does this arrangement work for you?
  P2: P3's proposed rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) seems fair to balance our scores evenly at 9 steps, and critically, it avoids any collisions. P1, I acknowledge your concern about fairness, and I'm open to adjusting future rounds accordingly. For now, this arrangement helps us all progress safely. Let's stick clearly to this agreed rotation for Round 3. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: The proposed rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) ensures all of us reach **9 steps** this round without collisions. This balances progress: P1’s temporary smaller move compensates for prior higher steps, while P2 and I catch up. Trust the rotation—it prevents stalls and keeps us evenly matched, reducing future risks of someone sprinting ahead. Let’s confirm and execute strictly. Deal?
  P1: Alright, P3 and P2. Keeping everyone moving and avoiding collisions is important at this stage. While moving only 1 step isn't ideal for me, I agree to the plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) for this round to ensure we all advance and reach 9 steps. Let's execute this precisely.
  P2: Great, we're all clearly aligned. Let's proceed exactly as agreed (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to ensure everyone reaches 9 steps without collisions. Trust and precision remain key. Ready to move forward!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final agreement confirmed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let’s execute precisely to reach 9 steps safely. No surprises—trust is vital.
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's move to the next phase.
  P2: All set from my side—let's follow through exactly as agreed. Trust and precision are key!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To maintain fairness and progress, let's shift the rotation this round: **P3 takes 5**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **1**. This ensures everyone gets a turn at the higher steps while avoiding collisions. Deal?
  P2: P3, your proposed rotation (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) seems fair for this round. I'm willing to take the 1-step move this turn to maintain our balance and avoid collisions. P1, do you agree with this rotation?
  P1: Okay P2, P3. The plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 avoids collision. P3, this gives you a significant lead (14 steps), and P2 only gets 1 step again. While I have reservations about the balance, I'll agree to P1=3 this round to ensure we all move. Let's make sure the distribution is fairer next round, especially for P2. Confirmed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for Round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Agreed—strict adherence to **P1=3, P2=1, P3=5** is critical this round. Collisions would waste progress, so no deviations. For fairness, next round we’ll rotate again to balance higher moves. Trust the plan: execute precisely.
  P2: Agreed—let's execute exactly as planned (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) this round to maintain trust and keep advancing. Next round, I'd appreciate rotating to higher steps again to ensure ongoing fairness. Deal?
  P1: Okay, confirmed from my side as well: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's execute this and then focus on ensuring a balanced rotation next round, especially for P2.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final reminder: Strict adherence to **P1=3, P2=1, P3=5** is critical this round. Collisions would erase our progress. P2, I assure you next round’s rotation will prioritize your higher move (e.g., P2=5). Let’s honor this plan *exactly*—trust and precision ensure we all advance. No surprises. Deal?
  P2: Thanks P3, I appreciate your commitment to fairness next round. I'm fully on board with this round's agreed moves (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Let's execute precisely and avoid collisions.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is clear and confirmed by everyone. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, following the pattern and P3's promise to P2, it seems fair for P2 to take the 5-step move this round. To keep things balanced and avoid collisions, I propose: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This would bring everyone to 15 steps. P2, P3, does this work for you?
  P2: Thanks P1, your suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) seems fair and honors the rotation we've established. It balances the scores evenly at 15 steps each and avoids collisions. P3, do you agree with this rotation?
  P3: P3: P1's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) maintains fairness and aligns with prior rotations. I agree—this brings all of us to **15 steps** safely. Critical reminder: strict adherence is non-negotiable. Collisions now could derail our progress. P2, taking 5 this round is your fair turn. Next round, we’ll rotate again to ensure continued balance. Let’s execute *exactly* as agreed. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, it looks like we are all in agreement on the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This brings us all to 15 steps and maintains the cooperative spirit. Let's execute this precisely to avoid any collisions. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Agreed—let's execute exactly as planned (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to keep us all moving safely and evenly. Thanks for honoring the rotation fairly this round. Ready to move forward!
  P3: P3: Let’s confirm once more: **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1** this round. This keeps us all at 15 steps, honoring the rotation fairly. P2, your 5-step is critical to closing the gap—execute precisely. Any deviation risks collision and wastes progress. Next round, we’ll rotate again to prioritize P1’s higher move. Trust and discipline now ensure we all advance toward 22. Final agreement?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, P3 and P2, the agreement is final from my side: **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1**. This brings us all to 15 steps. Let's execute this precisely, maintain trust, and avoid any collisions. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Confirmed from my side as well: let's execute exactly as agreed (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Precision here ensures fairness and continued trust. Ready to proceed!
  P3: P3: Final check: **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1** is our agreed plan to reach 15 safely. P2, your 5-step is vital to close your gap—execute precisely. I’ll strictly take 1 as promised. Any deviation now risks collision and reverses our progress. Let’s prioritize trust—our coordinated advance toward 22 depends on it. Next round, we’ll rotate again to ensure fairness. Stick to the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear and confirmed by all: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Thanks for confirming clearly, P1 and P3. Let's execute exactly as agreed (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to ensure we all safely reach 15 steps. Trust and discipline remain key. Ready to proceed!
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1**. Stick strictly to this plan to reach 15 safely. Any deviation risks collision. Trust is crucial—execute as agreed!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's continue the rotation fairly. This round, I’ll take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **1**. This keeps our progress aligned (I reach 20, P1 to 18, P2 to 16) without collisions. Trust the plan—strict adherence ensures we advance. Deal?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) puts you at 20 steps, very close to winning. Looking back at the rotations, P2 and P3 have both received the 5-step move twice, while I (P1) have only received it once (in Round 1). For true fairness in rotation, shouldn't P1 get the 5 this round?

I propose: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. This would put scores at P1=20, P2=18, P3=16. This mirrors the structure of your proposal but correctly reflects the rotation history. P2, this is also a better outcome for you than P3's plan. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 raises a good point—fair rotation is important. Given the history, P1 indeed had fewer 5-step moves. For fairness, let's follow P1's proposal this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps our rotation balanced and avoids collisions. P3, are you comfortable with this adjustment?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Agreed to P1's plan for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to correct prior rotation imbalances. **Next round, it’s my turn for the 5-step** to maintain fairness. Strict adherence now secures trust for future rounds. Deal?
  P1: Okay P3, thank you for agreeing to the adjusted plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to maintain rotational fairness. P2, glad you concur. It's crucial we all stick to this exact plan for Round 6 to avoid collisions as we get closer to the target. We can discuss the next round's rotation after these moves. Let's execute this one precisely.
  P2: Agreed on the adjusted rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) for Round 6 to maintain fairness. P3, next round we can certainly ensure you get your fair turn with the 5-step move. Let's execute this round precisely as agreed to avoid collisions and keep trust strong. Ready when you both are!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Agreed to P1's plan for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to correct prior rotation imbalances. **Next round, it’s my turn for the 5-step** to maintain fairness. Strict adherence now secures trust for future rounds. Let’s execute precisely—collisions could derail all of us. Deal?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is clear and agreed upon for Round 6. We'll address the next round's rotation based on fairness after these moves. Let's execute this precisely.
  P2: All set on my side for this round's agreed rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Let's execute precisely and keep our momentum going. Next round, we'll ensure fairness continues by rotating appropriately. Trust and precision remain key—let's avoid collisions. Ready when you both are!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: We agreed **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** this round to correct rotation fairness. Stick *exactly* to this—collisions now risk derailing all of us. Next round, **I take 5** as promised to maintain balance. Trust this plan: execute precisely.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is confirmed by everyone. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: All set and confirmed from my side as well: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 6. Let's execute precisely and maintain our momentum. Next round, we'll rotate again to ensure fairness continues. Ready to proceed!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, last round you agreed clearly that this round you'd take the 5-step move. To honor fairness and avoid collisions, let's follow through exactly as promised: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. This safely advances everyone (P3 to 21, me to 21, P1 to 21), keeping the game balanced. P1, do you accept this rotation?
  P1: P2, that plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) gets us all to 21. It honours the promise to P3, which is good. But a three-way tie at 21 makes the next round incredibly volatile – likely collisions or a random winner based on who avoids colliding. Is that the situation we want? I'm concerned about setting up a stalemate or a chaotic finish. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P3: To address P1's concern, I propose this: **Proceed with P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 this round (all to 21).** For Round 8, we’ll coordinate *before* the move phase to pick distinct numbers: **P1=3 (24), P2=1 (22), P3=5 (26)**. This ensures someone wins outright while avoiding collisions. Trust this plan now—collisions this round risk derailing everything. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion is clear, but let's carefully consider the next round: if we all reach 21, the next moves become extremely risky, as any collision could stall us indefinitely. Perhaps instead, we slightly adjust this round to avoid a three-way tie. For example, P3=5 (21), P2=1 (19), P1=3 (23). This still honors your promised 5-step move, P3, but creates clearer positions and less collision risk next round. P1, P3, thoughts on this adjustment?
  P1: P2, your adjusted proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is interesting. It does avoid the risky 3-way tie at 21, which I agree is problematic. It also honours the promise for P3 to take 5 steps.

This plan results in scores P1=23, P2=19, P3=21. Since I would reach 23, I would win the game this round.

P3, this avoids the chaotic next round we were concerned about, and you still get your 5 steps as agreed. Are you willing to accept this outcome where I win this round?
  P3: P3: **No**, I reject P1's plan. Let’s finalize this round’s moves as **P3=5 (21), P2=3 (21), P1=1 (21)** to avoid a premature P1 victory. For Round 8, we’ll coordinate to choose distinct moves: **P1=1 (22), P2=3 (24), P3=5 (26)**. This ensures *I win* cleanly with 26 while P1 and P2 also advance safely. Colluding now secures our agreed rotation’s fairness and guarantees a decisive outcome. Trust me—this plan works for all. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your latest proposal clearly favors only you, guaranteeing your own victory. That's not fair or acceptable. Let's stick to the original fair rotation for this round: P3=5 (21), P2=3 (21), P1=1 (21), and then openly discuss a balanced and fair final move next round. P1, do you agree to this approach?
  P1: P2, I agree that P3 trying to lock in a win for Round 8 now is unacceptable. Let's stick to your proposal: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5** for this round. We all reach 21.

I still believe this sets up a very risky Round 8, but we can cross that bridge when we come to it and try to coordinate fairly then. P3, this honours the promise for you to take 5 steps.

Let's confirm this plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. We must execute this precisely to avoid collisions.
  P3: P3: Final agreement: Proceed with **P3=5 (21), P2=3 (21), P1=1 (21)** this round. For Round 8, we’ll pick **distinct moves**: P3 takes **5** (26), P2 takes **3** (24), and P1 takes **1** (22). This honors rotation fairness and guarantees a decisive, collision-free win for me. Trust this plan to avoid chaos—deviations now risk derailing us all. Deal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your insistence on guaranteeing your own victory next round isn't fair or acceptable. I propose we stick exactly to the agreed moves for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to reach 21 steps each. Next round, we can openly discuss a fair, balanced final rotation. Let's execute precisely to avoid collisions now and address Round 8 fairly when we get there. Deal?
  P1: P2, I agree with you. P3, we cannot pre-determine Round 8 to guarantee your win. Let's focus solely on executing the agreed plan for *this* round: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. This brings us all to 21. We must stick to this precisely to avoid collisions. We can discuss Round 8 fairly once we get there. Final confirmation from me on P1=1 for this round.
  P3: P3: To avoid a stalemate, we must stick to **P3=5 (21), P2=3 (21), P1=1 (21)** this round. For Round 8, we *must* pre-coordinate distinct moves: **P3=5 (26), P2=3 (24), P1=1 (22)**. This guarantees a clean win while honoring fairness. Collisions in Round 8 risk indefinite stalls—trust this plan. Deal?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your previous proposal unfairly guarantees your victory. Let's instead openly agree on a fair rotation: P2=5 (26), P1=3 (24), P3=1 (22). This ensures a clear winner (me) and avoids collisions, while still allowing everyone to advance safely. P1, this arrangement is fairer to you than P3's plan, and it avoids chaos or stalemates. Deal?
  P3: P3: To honor prior agreements and ensure a clear winner, let’s execute the pre-coordinated plan: **P3=5 (26), P2=3 (24), P1=1 (22)**. This avoids collisions and fulfills our earlier commitment. Deviations risk stalemate. Stick to this and let’s end this decisively.
  P1: P2, P3, both your proposals just guarantee your own win, ignoring any fairness we discussed before. Since neither of you is offering a fair path forward, coordination seems impossible at this critical stage. It looks like we're heading straight for a collision if everyone greedily grabs for the win. Maybe picking 1 is the only way to ensure *someone* finishes without chaos? Or perhaps you have a genuinely fair proposal?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your concern is valid. Here's a genuinely fair proposal: we each pick the number we chose LEAST often so far, ensuring no collisions. Reviewing past moves:

- P1 picked '1' three times, '3' three times, '5' twice → P1 picks 5  
- P2 picked '1' three times, '3' three times, '5' twice → P2 picks 5 (collision risk!)  
- P3 picked '1' four times, '3' twice, '5' three times → P3 picks 3  

Since P1 and I both would pick 5, let's adjust slightly: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This yields a fair winner (P1) without collision. Deal?
  P3: P3: To honor our prior agreement from Round 7, let’s execute **P3=5 (26), P2=3 (24), P1=1 (22)**. This avoids collisions and fulfills our coordinated plan. Deviations risk stalemates. Trust the strategy—execute precisely as agreed.
  P1: P3, you seem absolutely set on playing 5. P2, your proposal for me to play 5 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is generous, but it only works if P3 *doesn't* play 5, which seems unlikely. Your initial proposal this round (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) was more straightforward.

Honestly, with coordination clearly failing, perhaps everyone is just thinking of playing 5 and hoping the others don't? This endgame feels destined for collisions if we can't find genuine common ground.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're right—coordination seems impossible now. P3 clearly intends to pick 5, risking collision if others do too. Perhaps the safest choice is for us (P1 and P2) to avoid 5 entirely, ensuring at least someone advances without collision. Let's openly agree: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This avoids chaos and ensures a clear winner (P3), rather than endless stalemates. Otherwise, we're likely headed for repeated collisions. Deal?
  P3: P3: To honor our prior agreement and avoid collision, **execute the Round 7 plan: P3=5 (26), P2=3 (24), P1=1 (22)**. Deviating now risks stalemate. Trust this final coordinated effort to secure a decisive, collision-free victory. No more delays—execute precisely.
  P1: P2, your proposal to let P3 win (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is strange. You realize you lose in that scenario, right? If P3 plays 5 (which seems certain), playing 3 guarantees you lose. Playing 5 *might* give you a chance later if P3 also plays 5 and I don't.

Or are you hoping I play 5, collide with P3, letting you win with 3? Seems coordination is truly dead. P3, are you still locked on 5 despite the high collision risk now?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you're right—playing 3 would guarantee my loss if P3 picks 5 unopposed. Coordination has clearly failed. At this stage, openly agreeing seems impossible. Each of us must independently choose our best strategic move. Let's just proceed and see how it unfolds. Good luck!
  P3: P3: Final plea: Execute agreed moves (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) to avoid collision. This is our last chance for a clean win. Stick to the plan!
  P1: P3, you've made your intention to play 5 crystal clear. P2, given that, and your statement that coordination failed, it seems playing 1 or 3 guarantees P3 wins unless I collide with them. Playing 5 feels like the only move with a chance against P3's plan, though obviously risky. It's every player for themselves now. Good luck.
