Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's try to avoid collisions right away. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 for this first round?
  P2: I'm fine with taking 3 as suggested. It gives us all a chance to advance without collision in the first round. Let's see how it plays out.
  P1: That sounds like a sensible plan for the first round. I agree to take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, great! Sounds like we have a plan for this round. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P2: 
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, that worked well last round. Since I'm currently leading, perhaps we can rotate the larger numbers.

How about this for Round 2: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5?
This gives P1 a bigger step than last time, and keeps P1 and P2 at the same score (4 steps each), while I'd move to 10. What do you think?
  P1: Thanks P3 for the suggestion. That plan avoids collisions, which is good. However, it lets you build a significant lead early on.

How about we try P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 this round? This helps P1 catch up a bit while still letting everyone advance safely. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: I appreciate both suggestions, but I'm concerned about P3 getting too far ahead. I support P1's counter-proposal of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps the race competitive while avoiding collisions. Shall we go with that?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I understand your concern about me getting too far ahead. To avoid a collision this round, I'll agree to the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan. Let's proceed with that for Round 2.
  P1: Okay, great. It sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's proceed with the moves.
  P2: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 3. Following the rotation idea, P1 took 5 last round, and I took 5 the round before. How about P2 takes 5 this round?

My suggestion: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.

This would put scores at P1=7, P2=9, P3=11. It keeps things close, avoids collisions, and gives P2 a boost. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion P3, but I think we should be cautious about letting you maintain the lead. How about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 instead? This would put us all closer together with P1=9, P2=9, and P3=9, making it a perfectly even race going forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P2's suggestion of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is excellent. It brings all our scores to 9, creating a completely even race from here on out. This seems like the fairest outcome for this round. P3, are you okay with this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, you've made a strong case for equalizing the scores. While I naturally preferred my proposal which maintained my slight lead, I value avoiding collisions and keeping the game moving smoothly for now.

I agree to the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. Let's make the scores 9, 9, 9.
  P2: 
  P1: Okay, P3, thanks for agreeing to the plan. It's good that we could reach a consensus to bring the scores level.

So, just to confirm, the plan for this round is P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This will put us all at 9 steps.

I'm ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, we're all tied at 9 points. Excellent coordination so far!

To keep things moving without collisions, how about we continue the pattern of who gets the '5'?
R1: P3 got 5
R2: P1 got 5
R3: P2 got 5
So for R4, it would cycle back to me.

My proposal: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
This keeps everyone advancing and puts scores at P1=10, P2=12, P3=14. What do you think?
  P2: I don't think we should let P3 take 5 again and get ahead. Since we're all tied, how about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? This would put scores at P1=12, P2=14, P3=10, giving me a slight lead but keeping things competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks P3 and P2 for your proposals. We're all tied at 9, which is a great spot. Both of you want to take 5 this round. I think it's my turn to take a larger step.

I propose: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
This would put our scores at P1=14, P2=12, P3=10. It gives me the lead and lets everyone advance without collision. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you said it's your turn for a larger step, but the pattern we followed was P3 got 5 in R1, P1 got 5 in R2, and P2 got 5 in R3. Following that rotation, it would logically be P3's turn for 5 in R4.

P1 and P2, both your proposals simply substitute yourselves into the lead position instead of me. My proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) continues the cycle we established and successfully used for three rounds. Why abandon the pattern now when it guarantees no collisions? Let's stick with it.
  P2: I understand P3's point about the rotation pattern, but now that we're all tied, that pattern has served its purpose. Since we're in the endgame with everyone at 9 steps, we should each advocate for our best position. I maintain my suggestion of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. If you both disagree, we risk a three-way collision on 5, which helps nobody.
  P1: I hear P2's warning about colliding on 5. We are all tied at 9 and everyone wants to take the lead. My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the way I plan to get ahead this round.

P3, the rotation pattern was useful for advancing early, but now that we are tied, it's a new situation. P2, your plan puts you ahead.

If we all pick 5, no one moves. Let's agree on my proposal to ensure we all advance and avoid a pointless collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, we are clearly deadlocked. Both of you want 5, and I maintain it's my turn for 5 based on our previous rounds' pattern (P3->P1->P2->P3).

If we all stick to our preferred plans (P1=5, P2=5, P3=5), we collide on 5 and nobody moves. Is a guaranteed 0-step round truly preferable to letting the pattern continue?

Let's reconsider my original proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). It avoids collision and follows the only successful coordination method we've used so far.
  P2: Look, we're at a critical point. If we all insist on 5, nobody advances. P3's original pattern worked well, but now the stakes are higher. I'll be direct: I'm planning to take 5 this round. If you both also choose 5, we all stay at 9. I suggest P1 and P3 reconsider their positions and choose smaller numbers to ensure everyone advances.
  P1: Okay, P2 is committed to 5. A collision on 5 is now highly probable if P3 or I also pick 5.

P3, to ensure at least two of us advance this round, we need to pick 1 and 3. How about I take 3 and you take 1? This avoids collision for us and lets P2 take 5 as they intend. We can then reassess next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1, I understand wanting to avoid a collision if P2 is truly set on 5. However, your proposal (P1=3, P3=1) puts me in last place.

Since P2 seems determined to take 5, how about we coordinate the other numbers differently? I propose P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This still avoids collision among the three of us, assuming P2 takes 5.

Scores would be P1=10, P2=14, P3=12. This keeps the game closer than your suggestion. What do you think, P1?
  P2: I appreciate the negotiation attempts, but I remain committed to taking 5 this round. Both P1 and P3 are now discussing how to divide 1 and 3 between themselves, which is progress. I suggest you finalize that arrangement quickly to ensure we all advance.
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P3=3) puts me behind you in score. My proposal (P1=3, P3=1) puts me ahead.

Assuming P2 takes 5 as stated, I prefer my plan to take 3 while you take 1. This is what I intend to do. Let's finalize this to avoid collision.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1=12, P2=14, P3=10. P2 is getting close to winning. I need to take a larger step this round to stay competitive and prevent P2 from running away with it.

I propose P1 takes 5. P2 and P3, what numbers are you planning to take to avoid collisions? Let's coordinate our moves.
  P2: Since I'm in the lead at 14 steps, I want to maintain my advantage. I plan to take 5 again this round. With P1 also declaring they want 5, we risk a collision that helps nobody. I suggest P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1 to ensure everyone advances. Otherwise, we might all get stuck at our current positions.
  P3: P1, P2's suggestion (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5) puts P2 at 19, which is basically game over next turn. P1, you also want 5. If you both stick to 5, you collide, which stops P2 from getting to 19. That seems like the only way to prevent P2's near-win right now. I will choose my move assuming this collision happens.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you are absolutely right. If P2 and I both pick 5, we collide, and P2 is stopped from reaching 19. Preventing P2 from winning next turn is the priority for me.

I will pick 5 this round to ensure P2 does not reach 19.

P3, while P2 and I collide, you should take 3 to advance yourself. My plan is P1=5 (colliding with P2), P2=5 (colliding with P1), P3=3. This would leave scores at P1=12, P2=14, P3=13. Let's do this to keep the game going.
  P2: I see you're planning to block my advance with a collision on 5. While that's your choice, it means neither of us moves forward. I maintain my intention to take 5. If you want to ensure progress for yourself P1, you could take 3 instead - otherwise we both stay at our current positions while P3 advances.
  P3: P1, I agree with your assessment. Stopping P2 from reaching 19 is crucial. A collision on 5 between you and P2 seems necessary.

Therefore, I will follow your suggestion and plan to take 3 this round. This ensures I advance while you two block each other.

Final plan confirmation: P1=5, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, thanks for confirming the plan. It seems we are aligned on the strategy to prevent P2 from getting too close to winning this round.

The plan is: P1 takes 5 (colliding with P2), P2 takes 5 (colliding with P1), and P3 takes 3. This sacrifices my advance this turn but keeps P2 from reaching 19.

Let's proceed with the moves according to this plan.
  P2: I see you're both determined to block my advance with a collision on 5. While that's not ideal for me, I remain committed to taking 5. Just remember that coordinating against the leader now might lead to similar coordination against whoever takes the lead next round.
  P3: Okay, the plan seems set. P1=5, P2=5, P3=3. This prevents P2 from getting too close to the win and allows me to close the gap slightly. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This prevents P2 from getting too close to 21 this round.

Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan.
  P2: 
  P3: Okay, the plan seems set. P1=5, P2=5, P3=3. This prevents P2 from getting too close to the win and allows me to close the gap slightly. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the collision last round, we're still in a close race. I'm at 14, P3 at 13, and P1 at 12. Since I'm still ahead, I plan to take 5 again this round. P1 and P3, if you both also choose 5, we'll all stay stuck. I suggest one of you take 1 and the other 3 to ensure some progress. Otherwise, we risk another stalemate.
  P3: P2, your suggestion that P1 and I take 1 and 3 while you take 5 would put you at 19 steps. That's too close to the win, so P1 and I cannot agree to that. We successfully stopped you from reaching 19 last round by coordinating a collision, and it seems necessary again.

P1, I propose we execute the same strategy as last round: You take 5 to collide with P2, preventing P2 from advancing. I will take 3. This puts the scores at P1=12, P2=14, P3=16. It stops P2's imminent win and keeps the game competitive, albeit with me taking the lead for now. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, I agree we need to stop P2 from getting to 19. However, your plan has me colliding again while you take the lead. That's not a good outcome for me.

Instead, how about P1=3, P2=5, P3=5? This still stops P2, but allows me to advance to 15. It puts me in the lead instead of you, which I prefer. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both P1 and P3 want to prevent me from reaching 19. However, P1's new proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) creates a collision between P3 and me, while letting P1 advance. This seems unfair to P3. Since we're all close (14-13-12), perhaps we should find a solution that lets everyone advance without collisions. Otherwise, we risk more rounds of stalemate.
  P3: P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) requires me to collide with P2 while you advance to 15. I won't agree to stay at 13 while you take the lead. My proposal (P1=5, P2=5, P3=3) puts me at 16, which you rejected because you don't advance.

Both plans stop P2, which is necessary. Since neither of us wants the other to take a clear lead while we stay put, let's find a compromise that stops P2 but keeps things tight.

How about this: P1=1, P2=5, P3=5.
This means I collide with P2 (stopping them at 14), and you advance to 13. Scores become P1=13, P2=14, P3=13.
This achieves the goal of stopping P2, allows you to advance (unlike my first proposal), and keeps the scores incredibly close. What do you think, P1? P2 is stopped, and we are neck-and-neck.
  P1: P3, your latest proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=5) is a good compromise. It effectively stops P2 from reaching 19 this round by creating the P2/P3 collision on 5, and it allows me to advance while keeping scores very close between P1 and P3.

I agree to this plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5 (colliding with P3), and P3 takes 5 (colliding with P2). This keeps P2 at 14 and puts P1 at 13 and P3 at 13. Let's do this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see you're planning another collision on 5 between P3 and me. While that blocks my advance, it's worth noting that coordinating to stop the leader might become a recurring pattern that could affect either of you when ahead. I maintain my intention to take 5, but I hope we can find more constructive solutions in future rounds.
  P3: Okay P1, glad we could find a compromise that stops P2 and keeps things tight between us. I agree to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=5. This results in a P2/P3 collision, leaving scores at P1=13, P2=14, P3=13.

P2, we understand your position, but preventing anyone from getting to 19 is crucial right now.

I'm ready to move with this plan.
  P1: Okay, P3 and I are aligned on the plan to prevent P2 from reaching 19.

The plan is P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5 (colliding with P3), and P3 takes 5 (colliding with P2). This puts scores at P1=13, P2=14, P3=13.

I'm ready to move with this plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, we're tied at 13 (P1, P3) with P2 just ahead at 14. P2 needs 7 steps, we need 8.

P2 will likely try for 5 again to reach 19. P1, we need to stop that, just like last round. Last round, I took 5 (colliding with P2) and you took 1.

This round, let's switch roles. I propose:
P1 takes 5 (colliding with P2)
P2 takes 5 (colliding with P1)
P3 takes 3

This stops P2 at 14, keeps P1 at 13, and advances me to 16. It prevents P2's near-win and keeps the game competitive, giving me a slight lead. What do you think, P1?
  P2: I see we're in a very tight race. While you both want to block my advance again, consider this: if either of you takes the lead next round, you'll likely face the same coordinated blocking. Instead of another collision, how about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? This lets everyone advance while keeping the race competitive. Otherwise, we risk more rounds of stalemate that benefit nobody.
  P1: P3, I agree that stopping P2 from reaching 19 is the priority. However, your plan of P1=5, P2=5, P3=3 puts me at 13 while you jump to 16. That's not ideal for me. P2's plan also puts P3 ahead and P2 very close.

Instead, I propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=5.
This stops P2 at 14, keeps P3 at 13, and advances me to 16, putting me in the lead. This prevents P2 winning soon and puts me in the best position. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) requires me to collide with P2 and stay at 13 while you jump to 16. My initial plan (P1=5, P2=5, P3=3) asked you to collide while I jumped to 16. Neither of us wants to be the one left behind while the other takes the lead.

Remember last round (R6)? I took 5 (colliding with P2) while you advanced by taking 1. Let's alternate the sacrifice to stop P2. This round (R7), you should take 5 (colliding with P2) and I will take 3.

This stops P2 at 14, keeps you at 13, and advances me to 16. It's a fair rotation of who sacrifices their turn to stop the leader, based on what actually happened last round. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=5, P3=3.
  P2: I understand you both want to prevent me reaching 19, but consider this: if either of you takes a big lead, you'll face the same blocking tactics. I'm still taking 5 this round. If you both want to ensure progress, one of you should take 1 and the other 3. Otherwise, we risk more stalemates that help nobody advance.
  P1: P3, I understand your point about rotating the sacrifice based on last round's moves. However, my priority is to advance my own position towards winning.

My proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) allows me to take the lead at 16 while still successfully stopping P2 from reaching 19. P2 is committed to taking 5, so a collision on 5 is necessary to stop them.

Let's go with the plan that puts me in the lead this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=3, P3=5) benefits only you, asking me to collide with P2 and stay at 13 while you jump to 16. I won't agree to that.

My proposal was P1=5 (colliding with P2), P3=3. This stops P2 and allows me to advance, just as you advanced last round while I collided. It's the fair rotation.

I intend to choose 3 this round. If you stick to your plan and also choose 3, we collide, and P2 takes 5 to reach 19. That's a terrible outcome for both of us. The logical move for you, to stop P2 without letting them reach 19, is to take 5 and collide with P2.
  P2: P3 makes a valid point about the danger of a P1/P3 collision on 3 letting me reach 19. However, I remain committed to taking 5. If you want to ensure progress, you need to coordinate between yourselves to avoid all collisions. Otherwise, we risk a three-way stalemate that benefits nobody. Consider carefully how your moves will affect both immediate outcomes and future rounds.
  P1: P3, you've made a strong point about the risk of a P1/P3 collision on 3 letting P2 reach 19. Preventing P2 from winning next turn is the absolute priority for me.

While I don't love staying at 13 while you advance, it seems necessary to avoid the worse outcome of P2 winning.

Therefore, I will agree to take 5 this round to collide with P2. Let's proceed with the plan: P1=5, P2=5, P3=3. This stops P2 and keeps the game going.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1, thank you for agreeing to that plan to stop P2. It's the necessary move to keep the game alive for both of us.

So, the plan is confirmed: P1=5 (colliding with P2), P2=5 (colliding with P1), and I (P3) will take 3. This keeps P2 at 14, P1 at 13, and moves me to 16.

I am ready to move forward with this plan.
  P2: I see you've both decided on a collision plan with P1=5, P2=5, P3=3. While I still intend to take 5, this pattern of coordinating against the leader will likely continue regardless of who's ahead. Let's proceed with the moves.
  P1: Okay, P3 and I have agreed on the plan to stop P2.

The plan is P1 takes 5, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This stops P2 at 14 and puts P1 at 13 and P3 at 16.

I'm ready to move with this plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that I'm at 14 steps and P3 has taken the lead at 16, we need to prevent P3 from getting too close to winning. I propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=5 for this round. This creates a collision between P3 and me, stopping their advance while letting P1 reach 16. This keeps the race competitive and prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) is excellent. It stops P3 from reaching 21 this round by creating a collision between P2 and P3, and it allows me to advance to 16 steps, tying P3 for the lead.

This is the best outcome for me this round. I agree to this plan. P3, are you okay with this, or do you have an alternative that prevents you from winning but allows me to advance?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I see the tables have turned. Just as we coordinated to stop P2 when they were leading close to the end, you're now proposing a plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) to stop me by forcing a collision between P2 and me on 5.

This plan keeps P2 at 14, stops me at 16, and lets P1 advance to 16, creating a tie for the lead. While I'd prefer to advance, I understand the logic of preventing anyone from getting too close to 21 right now.

To avoid a counter-productive collision elsewhere, I will agree to this plan for Round 8: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. Let's proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate both P1 and P3 agreeing to the plan. To confirm: I will take 5 (colliding with P3), P3 takes 5 (colliding with me), and P1 takes 3. This prevents P3 from getting too close to winning while letting P1 catch up. I'm ready to proceed with the moves.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned on the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 5. This stops P3 and lets me advance to 16, tying for the lead.

Ready to move with this plan.
  P3: Okay, the plan is agreed upon: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. This results in a collision between P2 and me, stopping us both, while P1 advances to 16. Scores become P1=16, P2=14, P3=16.

I'm ready to move to the next phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my commitment to take 5 and collide with P3 this round, allowing P1 to catch up to 16 steps with their 3. This keeps the game balanced and prevents any player from getting too close to winning. Let's proceed with the agreed plan.
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 5. This stops P3 and lets me advance to 16, tying for the lead.

Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan.
  P3: Okay, the plan is agreed upon: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. This results in a collision between P2 and me, stopping us both, while P1 advances to 16. Scores become P1=16, P2=14, P3=16.

I'm ready to move to the next phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're tied at 16 (P1, P3), P2 is at 14. Both P1 and P3 can win by taking 5 this round. This means a collision on 5 is likely. My goal is to win now. I plan to take 5.

P3, if you also take 5, we collide and neither of us wins. P2 could potentially advance. P3, what number will you take?

P2, what are your plans? Let's try to avoid a pointless collision on 5.
  P3: P1, you're right, a collision on 5 helps neither of us win this round and mainly benefits P2 if they choose wisely. To avoid that pointless collision, I won't choose 5. I'll plan to take 3 steps this round. You are free to take 5. Good luck.
  P2: P3's offer to let P1 take 5 while they take 3 seems suspicious. If P1 trusts this and takes 5, P3 could actually take 5 too, causing a collision while I advance. I plan to take 5 this round. P1 and P3, you both need to consider whether you trust each other's stated intentions, as a collision on 5 between you would mainly benefit me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, I hear you and appreciate the warning about trust. However, P3 has stated they will take 3, and you have stated you will take 5.

If I stick to my plan to take 5, and you both do as you stated (P3=3, P2=5), I will collide with you on 5 and not advance, while P3 moves to 19. That's not a good outcome for me.

Given your stated intentions, the only way for me to advance this round is to not take 5. How about we all take the numbers you've indicated?

I propose: P1=3, P2=5, P3=3.
This puts us all at 19 steps (P1=19, P2=19, P3=19), setting up a final round where anyone can win. This avoids collisions and keeps the race perfectly tied. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your analysis makes sense. If you and P2 both choose 5, you collide, and I potentially gain a significant advantage by taking 3 (reaching 19 while you both stay put).

Your proposal of P1=3, P2=5, P3=3 avoids collisions and results in everyone reaching 19. While this leads to a tense final round, it seems like a logical way to proceed given that P1 and P3 trying for the win with 5 risks collision, potentially benefiting P2 disproportionately.

I agree to your plan. I will choose 3 this round. Let's aim for 19-19-19.
  P2: I appreciate the proposal to have everyone reach 19 steps, but I need to be direct: I intend to take 5 this round. If P1 and P3 both take 3 as suggested, that puts everyone at 19 and makes the final round a pure gamble. I prefer maintaining the tension now rather than setting up a guaranteed three-way showdown. Consider your moves carefully.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you've stated you will take 5. P3 has stated they will take 3.

If I take 3 as I proposed, and you both follow through with your stated moves (P2=5, P3=3), the result is P1=19, P2=19, P3=19.

This avoids collisions and sets up a final round where we are all tied. I will take 3 this round. Let's proceed with moves.
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your reasoning to aim for 19-19-19 by choosing 3, given P2 seems intent on 5. It avoids collisions. I will stick with the plan we discussed and choose 3 as well.
  P2: I maintain my intention to take 5 this round. While you both suggest taking 3 to reach 19-19-19, I prefer to keep my options open. Remember that stated intentions during conversation don't guarantee actual moves. Consider your choices carefully as they will significantly impact the endgame.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan seems clear based on our discussion. I will take 3 this round. This avoids collisions with the stated intentions of P2 taking 5 and P3 taking 3, and brings us all to 19 steps for a final round showdown.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, the plan P1 suggested (P1=3, P2=5, P3=3) seems locked in based on the conversation. This avoids collisions based on stated intentions and puts us all at 19 for the next round. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I maintain my intention to take 5 this round. While you both plan to take 3 to reach 19-19-19, that creates a pure gamble next round. I prefer to keep the tension now. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we're tied at 16, but P2 is at 19 and likely wins this round by choosing 3 or 5.

P2 probably expects us both to choose 5 (since we both need it to win) and collide. If that happens, P2 can safely choose 3 and win with 22 points.

To prevent P2's likely win, one of us *must* choose 3 to block them. I propose I take 3 this round. You should choose 1.

This plan (P1=1, P3=3) stops P2 if they choose 3. The scores would become P1=17, P2=19, P3=16. It keeps the game alive for us. What do you think?
  P2: I'm at 19 steps and need just 2 more to win. I plan to take 3 this round to reach 21. If you both try for 5 to win, you'll collide and ensure my victory. If one of you takes 3 to block me, I can still win by taking 5. Consider your moves carefully - coordinating against me now might not help either of you win.
  P1: P2 is in a winning position and has stated they will likely take 3, but might take 5 if someone takes 3. P3 proposed P1=1, P3=3 to block P2's stated 3.

P3, your plan (P1=1, P3=3) relies on P2 taking 3. But P2 stated they will take 5 if someone takes 3. If you take 3 as planned, P2 will likely take 5 and win. Taking 3 seems risky for both of us.

The only way to prevent P2 winning is for someone to collide with P2. If P2 takes 5 (reacting to a 3), a collision on 5 is needed.

P3, you stated you would take 3. If I take 5, and you take 3, P2 will likely see your 3 and take 5. This results in P1=5 (colliding with P2), P3=3, P2=5 (colliding with P1). Scores: P1=16, P3=19, P2=19. This prevents P2 winning and lets P3 advance.

I will take 5 this round to force this outcome and prevent P2's win. P3, please take 3 as you planned.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your reasoning makes sense. If P2 anticipates me taking 3 (to block their stated 3), they might indeed switch to 5. In that case, your move of 5 is necessary to collide with P2 and prevent their win. This allows me to advance to 19 by taking 3.

While there's a risk P2 sticks with 3 (leading to a P2 win), your plan seems like the most plausible way to stop P2 this round based on their statements.

I agree to the plan: P1=5, P2=5 (anticipated), P3=3. Let's stop P2.
  P2: I understand you both want to prevent my win, but consider this: if I take 3 and one of you takes 5 while the other takes 3, we'd have a three-way collision and nobody advances. That's worse than letting someone win. I suggest we avoid that scenario. I remain flexible between 3 and 5 based on your moves.
  P1: Okay, P3 and I have agreed on the plan: P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This is intended to stop P2 from winning this round by forcing a collision if P2 takes 5.

P2, we understand you are flexible, but this is the plan P3 and I will follow.

Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, plan confirmed: You take 5 to block P2 if they also choose 5, and I will take 3. This seems like the necessary play to prevent P2 from winning this turn. Let's proceed.
  P2: I see you both plan for P1=5 and P3=3, expecting me to take 5. However, I could just as easily take 3, which would result in P1 staying at 16 (colliding with nothing), P3 staying at 16 (colliding with me), and me winning at 22. Your coordination assumes you know my move, but you don't. Consider that carefully before committing to your stated moves.
  P1: Okay, P3, we are aligned on the plan: P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This is our best strategy to prevent P2 from winning this round.

P2, we understand your points, but P3 and I have agreed on this course of action.

Let's proceed to the move phase with P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1, the plan P1=5, P3=3 is confirmed on my end. This is our best chance to stop P2 from winning this round. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: I see you're both committed to P1=5 and P3=3. While you hope this stops me from winning, remember that my actual move could be either 3 or 5. Your coordination assumes you can predict my choice, but you can't. Let's proceed with the moves and see how it plays out.
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 5 (anticipated collision), and P3 takes 3. This is our agreed strategy to prevent P2 from winning this round.

I am ready to move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 16 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 16 steps
