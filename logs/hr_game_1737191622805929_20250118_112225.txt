Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move forward. P1, you take 1, P2, you take 3, and I'll take 5.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. It's a good idea to avoid collisions on the first turn. I'll take 3 as suggested. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P1: I hear you both, and I agree that avoiding collisions is smart. I'll take 1 this round. Let's see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Now that we have an agreement, let's stick to it for this round. I expect to see P1 move 1 step, P2 move 3 steps, and I'll move 5 steps. Let's make this first round collision-free.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. It's a good idea to avoid collisions on the first turn. I'll take 3 as suggested. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P1: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our agreement. I'll move 5, P2 will move 3, and P1 will move 1. No changes, let's keep it as planned.
  P2: I'm glad we have an agreement in place for this round. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. I'll take 3 steps as agreed upon. What's your final thought, P1, before we proceed to the move phase?
  P1: P1: I'm on board with the plan. I'll move 1 step this round to avoid any collisions. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan. Let's keep our word and avoid collisions this round. I'll move 5, P2 will move 3, and P1 will move 1.
  P2: I think we've reached a good agreement for this round. I'll move 3 steps as planned, and I expect P1 to move 1 step and P3 to move 5 steps. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Great job avoiding collisions last round! Let's try a new strategy to keep it interesting. This time, how about I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1?
  P3: I don't think changing strategies so soon is a good idea. We just established trust by following through on our agreements. I suggest we stick with a similar distribution to avoid confusion and potential collisions. How about we discuss minor adjustments to our previous strategy instead of completely overhauling it?
  P2: I agree with P3 that we should build on the trust we established last round rather than changing strategies abruptly. How about we keep the same order but shift the numbers slightly? For example, P1 could take 1 again, I could take 5 this time, and P3 could take 3. This way, we maintain a similar distribution while still mixing things up a bit. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I see your points about building trust. I'm open to keeping a similar pattern. How about I take 1 again, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This keeps us aligned while mixing it up slightly.
  P3: I think P1's revised suggestion is reasonable. If P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3, it maintains a balance while adjusting our moves slightly. I'm willing to go with this plan for Round 2. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I'm glad we're on the same page about maintaining a similar pattern while mixing things up slightly. To confirm, I'll take 5 steps this round, P1 will take 1 step, and P3 will take 3 steps. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any collisions. What's your final thought, P1 and P3, before we proceed to the move phase?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I'm on board with the current plan. I'll take 1 step, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to this and avoid collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 4:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going! I suggest we maintain a similar pattern to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 3 this time, I take 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we mix it up while keeping the trust we've built. What do you both think?
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is reasonable, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3? This maintains a balance while giving me a chance to take the lead. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Let's keep things fair and balanced. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game interesting. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think P1's suggestion is a good compromise. It maintains a balance and avoids collisions. I'm willing to take 3 steps this round if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I think P1's suggestion is reasonable. To confirm, if we go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5, it keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. I'm willing to go with this plan for Round 3. What do you both think?

  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's regroup after the unexpected collision last round. To avoid further collisions, I suggest we discuss a new strategy. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5 this round? This way, we can try to maintain some balance and avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to try a new strategy after the unexpected collision last round. However, I think we should mix it up a bit more. How about P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5 this round? This way, we can try to maintain some balance and avoid collisions while also keeping the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: After the collision last round, let's aim for a safe strategy. How about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This should keep us on track without colliding. What do you both think?
