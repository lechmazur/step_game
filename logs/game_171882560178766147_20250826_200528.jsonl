If we both pick 1, we can block P2's win by colliding and stalling them at 18. If P2 is bluffing and picks another number, we still advance. P2 is trying to manipulate us into unique picks so they can win. We must work together to prevent their victory. Trust me\u2014let's both pick 1 to keep the game alive! What do you say?"}
