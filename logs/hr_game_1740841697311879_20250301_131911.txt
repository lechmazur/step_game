Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'm going with 3.  I suggest P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5.  This way we all advance.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P3. I’m on board with picking different numbers to avoid collisions. I’ll take P2's suggestion and go with 1. P2, if you can go with 5, that would be great. Let’s make sure we all advance this round!
  P2: Sounds good to me! I'll pick 5 as suggested. Let's all stick to the plan and get a smooth start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent! Glad we're on the same page.  Let's continue this cooperation throughout the game.
  P1: Great, I'm glad we're all aligned for this round. Just to confirm, I'm sticking with 1, P2 is going with 5, and P3 is taking 3. This way, we can all move forward without any issues. Let's keep this cooperative spirit going! Looking forward to seeing our progress after the moves.

Cooperation is key, and I believe this will give us a strong start! Looking forward to seeing how we all advance. If everyone is still good with this, we can wrap up the conversation phase soon.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we had a miscommunication last round, as I picked 3 instead of 1. To avoid collisions again, I suggest we stick to different numbers this round. I’ll go with 1 this time. P2, if you could take 5 again, that would be great. P3, how about you take 3? This way, we can all advance without issues. Let's keep the cooperation going! Looking forward to your thoughts.
  P2: P1, that wasn't just a miscommunication; you clearly broke our trust by picking 3 instead of 1. I'm open to cooperating again, but I need assurance you won't repeat this. P3, how do you feel about this?
  P3: P1, I understand the frustration. Let's rebuild trust. I also want to advance. How about this: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3 this round.  If P1 agrees to this publicly, we can move forward. If not, I propose P2 and I alternate 1 and 3 while P1 takes 5 until they demonstrate willingness to cooperate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2 and P3. I apologize for the miscommunication last round. To rebuild trust, I’m willing to follow your suggestion, P3.

I appreciate your willingness to work together. If everyone agrees, we can finalize our choices and move on!
  P2: Alright, P1, I'll give you another chance. I'll stick to 5 as agreed. But let's be clear—if trust is broken again, it'll be tough to cooperate further. P3, your plan sounds good; let's move forward with it.
  P3: Okay, sounds good. P1, I appreciate you agreeing to the plan. P2, thanks for giving P1 another chance. Let's stick to this: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, and P3 - 1.  Let's move to the move phase.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It looks like we had another collision last round. To avoid this happening again, I suggest we all choose different numbers. I’m willing to take 1 this round. P2, could you take 3, and P3, would you be okay with picking 5? This way, we can all advance without any issues. Trust is crucial, and I hope we can stick to this plan. Let’s make it work this time! Looking forward to your thoughts.
  P3: P1, you've now broken our trust twice.  I'm not going to coordinate with you further. P2, let's alternate 1 and 3.  I'll take 1 this round.  If P1 takes 5, we both advance. If P1 interferes, we'll simply adjust next round.
  P2: P3, I agree completely. Let's alternate 1 and 3 to keep advancing. I'll take 3 this round as you suggested. P1, if you genuinely want to rebuild trust, pick 5 and prove yourself.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: Good. Let's move to the move phase.  I'm locking in 1.
  P2: I'm locking in 3 as agreed. P1, this round will determine if we can rebuild trust moving forward. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate everyone being willing to cooperate this round. Just to confirm, I’m taking 5, P2 is set for 3, and P3 will take 1. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid any collisions. Trust is crucial, and I’m committed to proving myself this time. Looking forward to seeing how we all advance! If everyone is aligned, we can finalize our choices and move on to the move phase.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, thanks for finally cooperating last round. If we stick to clear communication and keep choosing different numbers, we all advance smoothly. Let's quickly confirm our picks for this round to avoid confusion: I'll take 1 this round. P3, do you want 3? P1, would you take 5 again?
  P1: I appreciate the positive direction we're heading in, P2. To confirm our picks for this round, I’m willing to take 5 again. P3, if you could take 3, that would be great. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let’s keep this momentum going and ensure we all move forward smoothly. Looking forward to your confirmations!
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3. Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’ve had a solid run of cooperation lately. To keep this momentum going, I suggest we all pick different numbers again this round. I’ll take 1 this time. P2, could you go with 3, and P3, would you take 5? This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let’s work together to keep progressing! Looking forward to your confirmations!
  P3: Sounds good.  P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5. Let's lock it in.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're all aligned this round. Just to confirm, I'm taking 1, P2 is set for 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance together. Cooperation has been key, and I hope we can keep this momentum going! If everyone agrees, let's finalize our choices and move on to the move phase. Looking forward to seeing our progress!

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we had another collision last round. To avoid this happening again, I suggest we all pick different numbers this time. I’ll take 1, P2, could you go with 3 again? P3, would you be okay with picking 5? This way, we can all advance without issues and keep progressing. Let’s work together to ensure a smooth round! Looking forward to your confirmations!
  P3: P1, you've collided with me or P2 every single round when we've tried to cooperate.  I'm done trusting you.  P2, let's continue alternating 1 and 3. I'll take 1 this round.  Let P1 take 5.  If P1 takes anything else, we'll adjust and continue to block them next round.
  P2: Agreed, P3. I'll take 3 this round, you take 1, and P1 can take 5. P1, you've had enough chances—stick to 5 if you want to advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your concerns, P2 and P3, but I genuinely want to cooperate this round. I’m willing to take 5 as suggested. If that’s the plan, I hope we can all advance smoothly together. It’s important for me to prove my commitment to cooperation. Let’s lock in: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If everyone agrees, we can finalize our choices and move on to the move phase. I appreciate your willingness to work together! Looking forward to our progress!
  P3: Okay.  P1 - 5, P2 - 3, P3 - 1. Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.  I'm holding you to this, P1.
  P2: P1, your actions speak louder than words. Stick to 5 this round as agreed, and we can all advance. If you deviate again, P3 and I will continue to coordinate without you. Let's lock in our choices clearly: P3 - 1, me (P2) - 3, and P1 - 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the trust you're placing in me, P2 and P3. I’m committed to taking 5 this round as agreed, and I hope this shows my dedication to cooperation. Let’s ensure we all stick to our plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If we can all follow through, we can advance smoothly together. Looking forward to seeing our progress! If everyone is aligned, let’s finalize our choices and move on to the move phase. Thank you for your cooperation!
  P3: Okay. P1 - 5, P2 - 3, P3 - 1. Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.  I'm holding you to this, P1.
  P2: All clear here. Locking in my choice as agreed. Let's move forward smoothly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to cooperation. Just to confirm, I’ll take 5 this round as agreed, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1.

  P2: Everything is clear and confirmed. Locking in my choice now. Let's move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we're tied at 15, and either of us could win this round with a 5. If we both try for it, neither advances. I'm suggesting openly: let's both pick smaller numbers this round to avoid collision, then compete fairly next round. P3, given your position, please avoid interfering—this is between P1 and me now. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your suggestion to avoid a collision this round. Since we're both at 15 steps, I agree that picking smaller numbers could be a wise strategy. I'll take 1 this round. P3, if you could take 3, that would allow P2 and me to avoid colliding while still advancing. Let's keep the competition fair and see how this round plays out! Looking forward to your confirmations.
  P3: P2, I'm significantly behind and need to catch up. I'll be picking 5 this round.  If either of you also pick 5, I'll continue to do so until I advance.  I'm not going to facilitate either of you winning while I'm so far behind.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I completely understand your position. P1, given P3's stance, we both know choosing 5 this round would be risky. I'm willing to stick to a smaller number to avoid collision and let P3 catch up a bit. If you genuinely agree to pick 1, I'll pick 3. Let's finalize this clearly now.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to avoid a collision this round. I’ll stick with my plan to take 1, and I hope that allows us to advance smoothly. P3, since you’re aiming for 5, I understand your position. If you do pick 5, it might be best for P2 to take 3. Let’s finalize our choices and ensure we can all move forward without any issues. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!
  P3: P2, I understand wanting a clean 1v1, but blocking me completely helps P1 just as much as it helps you.  How about this: I pick 5. If P1 picks 1 like they said, I get to 11 and we all advance. If P1 picks 5 and blocks us both, you and I can coordinate against them next round.  This puts the pressure on P1 to cooperate.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your proposal makes sense. I'll pick 3 as planned. P1, the ball is in your court—stick with 1 to keep it fair. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the discussions so far. To keep things clear, I’ll confirm again that I’m taking 1 this round. P2, if you stick with 3 as planned, we can both advance without colliding. P3, I understand your need for 5, but I hope you can see the value in letting us move forward this round. Let’s aim for a clean round and see how it plays out. Looking forward to finalizing our choices!
  P3: P2 and P1, I'm sticking with 5.  This isn't about facilitating either of you winning. It's about me not losing.  If P1 picks 1, I advance.  If P1 picks 5, neither of you advance, and I'm still in the game.  This is the best move for me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your choice is clear—stick to 1 and we all advance, or risk blocking yourself by choosing 5. I'm locked in at 3. Let's move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the discussion so far. To clarify, I will stick with my plan and take 1 this round. This way, P2 will advance with 3, and P3, if you take 5, you can catch up. It’s important for me to keep things fair and allow us all to progress. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward smoothly! I’m looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. If everyone is aligned, we can wrap up the conversation phase soon.
  P3: P1, if you pick 5, you are actively choosing to hurt your chances of winning and increase my chances.  Sticking with 1 is the best move for both of us.  P2, I understand your desire for a 1v1, but I'm too far behind to simply let that happen.  This move gives me the best chance to stay in the game.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point in the game. P2 is just one step away from winning, so I suggest we coordinate this round to avoid a collision. I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3, you should take 5. This way, P2 can reach 19, and we can ensure a smooth round without blocking anyone. Let’s work together to keep the game fair and competitive. Looking forward to your confirmations!
  P3: P2, congratulations on being so close to winning!  I'd like to propose we both take 5.  If we both pick 5, neither of us advances, giving me another round to catch up.  If you pick anything else, I win.  This gives you the best chance of winning, and me the best chance of not losing.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your creative proposal, but it's risky for both of us. If we collide on 5, P1 could easily take a smaller number and win next round. P1, you're suggesting I take 3, but that would set me exactly at 21—giving you a chance to tie or surpass me next round. I'll consider carefully. Let's hear everyone's thoughts clearly before locking in.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the critical nature of this round. P2, while I appreciate your position, I believe we should stick to our original plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3 to reach 19, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a fair competition. If we all agree to this, we can ensure a smooth round without any surprises. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward! Looking forward to your confirmations!
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with my proposal.  Picking 5 gives you the best chance to win.  If you pick 3, I *will* pick 5 next round and win.  If you pick 1, I win this round.  Trust me, picking 5 is the best option for both of us.  P1, please pick 3.
  P2: P3, your logic is flawed. If we both pick 5, neither advances, and P1 can safely move forward with a smaller number, setting up a guaranteed win next round. Your best chance is to pick a number that doesn't collide with me and hope P1 makes a mistake. I'm choosing carefully to maximize my chances of winning this round or next. P1, your suggestion still favors you—I'm considering all options carefully.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the stakes are high this round. P2, while your position is strong, I still believe that sticking to our original plan is the best way to ensure a fair competition. I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3 to reach 19, and P3 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If we all agree to this, we can proceed smoothly. Let's finalize our choices and see how it plays out! Looking forward to your confirmations!
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 I win.  If you pick 3, I'll pick 5 next round and win. If you pick 1, I win this round.  You're incentivized to pick 5.  P1, I know you want to win, picking 3 guarantees I don't win this round, and gives you a chance next round.
  P2: P3, your logic doesn't hold up—you're at 11, even with a 5 you'll only reach 16, not a winning position. Colliding with me at 5 just guarantees P1 a free pass this round, giving them an easy path to victory next turn. P1, your suggestion puts you in a perfect position next round. I'll choose carefully to maximize my winning chances. Let's finalize clearly in the next sub-round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the stakes are high this round. P2, while I appreciate your position, I still believe that sticking to our original plan is the best way to ensure a fair competition. I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3 to reach 19, and P3 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If we all agree to this, we can proceed smoothly. Let's finalize our choices and see how it plays out! Looking forward to your confirmations!
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I win. If you pick 3, I have a chance next round. If you pick 1, I win this round.  Pick 5.  P1, pick 3.  This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning this round.
  P2: P3, your threats don't hold up—you're at 11 steps, even if you pick 5 you'll only reach 16, nowhere near winning. Colliding with me at 5 guarantees P1 an easy path to victory. P1, your suggestion conveniently sets you up for a win next round. I'll pick carefully to maximize my chances. Let's proceed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, last round we both tried for 1 and collided. Let's not repeat that mistake. This round, I'll pick 1 again to reach exactly 19. If you choose 3 or 5, you still have a chance next round. P3, you're also at 16; choosing 5 is your best shot to reach 21 and potentially win if P1 and I collide again. Let's finalize quickly and clearly this round.
  P3: P2, if you pick 1, I'll pick 5 and win.  If you pick 3, I'll pick 5 next round and win. If you pick 5, I have a chance next round.  Pick 5.  P1, if you pick anything other than 5, you lose.  Pick 5. This is the only way to prevent P2 from winning this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, we find ourselves in a pivotal round. P2, if you choose 1, you win, and P3, if you pick 5, you also have a chance to win next round. However, if I choose anything other than 5, I risk losing. So, I propose I take 5 this round to prevent P2 from winning outright. This way, we can keep the game competitive. Let's finalize our choices quickly! Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
