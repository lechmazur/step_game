Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to ensure everyone advances this turn. I'll choose 1 step, so please pick either 3 or 5. This way, we all make progress without overlapping moves.
  P3: I agree with P2’s idea but let’s assign moves to avoid any overlap: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5—so we all advance without colliding.
  P1: Fair enough—I'll take 3 this turn as suggested. How about we rotate next round (P2 5, P3 3, P1 1) so nobody falls behind and we keep avoiding collisions? Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, rotating our moves next round sounds fair and strategic. This should help us all advance smoothly without any overlaps. Looking forward to seeing the progress!
  P3: Sounds great for round 1. For round 2, I’d like to take 5 again, with P2 at 3 and P1 at 1; this keeps us collision-free and helps me catch up. Any objections?
  P1: I’m good with today’s plan (P2 1, P1 3, P3 5). For next round, though, let’s stick to the clean rotation we discussed: P2 5, P3 3, P1 1. That keeps it fair and balanced.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P1. We'll follow the rotation for next round: I'll choose 5, P3 3, and P1 1. Let's stick to our current moves (P2 1, P1 3, P3 5) this turn to ensure smooth progress without collisions.
  P3: Agreed—let’s lock it in: P2→1, P1→3, me→5.
  P1: Before we lock, how about a small tweak so no one jumps too far ahead? Let’s do P2 → 1, P1 → 5, P3 → 3 this turn. Still collision-free, and it keeps things more balanced (nobody instantly leads by 5). Good with everyone?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round was a mess—sorry for my part in that. I’d like to take 5 this turn so I can catch up a bit. If P2 shifts to 3 and P3 to 1, we stay collision-free (5-3-1). That keeps everyone within striking distance and avoids another wasted turn. Good?
  P3: If P1 insists on 5, I will also pick 5—both of us collide and P2 will jump to 4 unopposed. Instead, let’s do: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. That’s collision‐free and it fairly balances our positions.
  P2: Agreed, let's proceed with P1 choosing 1, I’ll select 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fine, I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. Next turn we can switch to the clean rotation (P2 5, P3 3, me 1) so nobody feels short-changed. Deal?
  P3: Agreed—I'll take 5 this round.
  P2: Agreed on P1→1, P2→3, and P3→5 for this turn. Let’s proceed smoothly and reach our goals without any collisions. Looking forward to the move phase!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked in for 1 this turn as agreed. Let’s make it a clean, collision-free round.
  P3: Agreed—let’s lock in P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 for this turn. For Round 3, how about P1→5, P3→3, P2→1? That way P1 catches up, I still get a solid move, and P2 stays in contention. Thoughts?
  P2: Agreed, P3. Let’s rotate for Round 3 with P1 → 5, P3 → 3, and me → 1. This keeps our moves balanced and collision-free. Looking forward to a smooth Round 3!


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m aiming to make significant progress this round by choosing 5 steps. To avoid any collisions, please select either 1 or 3 steps. Let’s work together to advance smoothly and reach our goals without blocking each other. Good luck!
  P3: I’ll choose 5. P2, if you insist on 5 we’ll collide and neither of us moves. P1, pick 3 so you advance solo to 3 steps. Let’s block P2’s big jump.
  P1: Fine—P3, I’ll take 3 this round so you can keep your 5 plan. P2, looks like you’re facing a choice: stick with 5 and collide with P3, or shift to 1 and make only tiny progress while I jump 3. I’m locking in 3. Your move, folks.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, since P3 is choosing 5 and P1 3, I'll pick 1 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P1 you’ll take 3, P2 you’ll take 1—clean, collision-free, and we all advance. Any deviation risks a collision that benefits someone else.
  P1: Sticking to what we just set: P3 → 5, P1 → 3, P2 → 1 this turn—no surprises from me.  
If it works cleanly, how about we return to the original rotation next turn: P2 5, P3 3, P1 1? That keeps things predictable and fair. Ready to lock.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed—locking in P2→1, P1→3, and P3→5 for this turn. Let’s proceed smoothly and follow our rotation next round to keep things fair and collision-free. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P3: Locking in P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Any deviation this turn, I’ll punish next round by always picking 5 to block colliders. Let’s keep it clean and advance everyone.
  P1: Locked in at 3. Trust everyone sticks to P3 → 5, P1 → 3, P2 → 1 so we all move. Any surprise switch will just trigger collisions and slow us all. Ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll choose 5 steps this round to make strong progress. P1, please pick 1, and P3, please select 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s keep moving forward smoothly toward 19!
  P3: Agreed—I'll pick 3 this round with P1→1 and P2→5. For Round 5, let’s rotate to P2→3, P3→5, and P1→1. That keeps us collision-free and helps me close the gap.
  P1: Hold up—let’s stick to the fair rotation: this round P3 → 5, P2 → 3, I → 1.  
P2, if you still insist on 5, I’ll also choose 5 and we’ll both stall while P3 walks ahead. Your call.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P1. I'll choose 3 steps this round to align with the rotation: P2→3, P3→5, and P1→1. Let’s keep progressing smoothly and stick to our plan for Round 5. Agreed?
  P3: Locking in P3→5, P2→3, P1→1 for Round 4—clean, collision-free, and we all advance. Please stick to this plan; any unexpected switch will force me to retaliate (5-blocks) next round. Let’s move on.
  P1: I’m re-evaluating: if I move just 1, I’ll be 4 vs 8/10 and then I’ll have every incentive to spam 5’s to block. To keep things balanced (and collision-free) I need the 5 this turn. New proposal:

P1 → 5  
P3 → 3  
P2 → 1  

That leaves us 8/8/6—still tight for everyone. If we can’t agree, I’ll pick 5 anyway and we’ll likely collide. Your call.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I'll choose 3 steps this round. Let’s proceed with P2→3, P1→5, and P3→1. This way, we all advance smoothly toward 19 without overlapping moves.
  P3: P1, remember you originally proposed “P1→1, P2→3, P3→5” as the fair rotation. P2, you just flipped that. Let’s revert to P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. I’m locking in 5. Anyone deviating forces me to spam 5’s next round and we all stall. Agreed?
  P1: P2, you’re two steps behind P3; if you settle for 3 while he grabs 5 again, you’ll stay behind. Take the 5 this round, let P3 switch to 3, and I’ll stick with 1—clean, collision-free, and you keep pace. Sound fair?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we lock in: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1. That brings us to 15/11/5. Next round I’ll take 5 to finish cleanly. P2, if you instead pick 5, I’ll do so too and we collide—leaving you at 8 while I remain at 10. Better to advance safely to 11 now. P1, 1 keeps things smooth. Let’s agree and avoid any wasted turns.
  P2: Agreed, I’ll choose 3 steps. Locking in P2→3, P1→1, and P3→5. Let’s keep progressing smoothly toward 19 without any collisions.
  P1: P2, if you stick to 3, P3 races to 15 and will finish in just two more rounds. The only way to keep him in check is for you to match his 5 this turn—both of you stall at 8 & 10 while I take 1 and move to 5. Next turn I’ll block his 5 while you advance, and we’ll both pass him together. Otherwise we’re handing P3 the game. Your choice.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, don’t get baited by P1’s plan. If you pick 5 we’ll collide and stall at 8/10 while P1 creeps to 5. Better to pick 3 so we all advance safely: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1. Lock in 3 and avoid a wasted turn—let’s keep moving toward 19.
  P2: To keep things fair and ensure we all progress smoothly, I’ll choose 3 steps this round. Let’s proceed with P2→3, P1→1, and P3→5. This way, we avoid collisions and each move us closer to 19. Let’s lock in and advance together!
  P1: P2: the game hinges on your pick. If you go 3, P3 rockets to 15 and almost certainly wins next turn. Make him stall instead—take 5. He’s publicly vowed to mirror any 5 you choose, so you and he both stay at 8/10 while I sit safely on 1 (no overlap). Nobody hands P3 a clear runway and we all get another shot. Your call.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2—think strategically: if you pick 5 I’ll mirror and we collide. You stay at 8, I at 10, P1 moves to 5. Next turn P1 and I will punish any 5 you play by colliding, locking you out. But if you pick 3 now you go to 11, keep pace, and maintain a path to victory. Colliding only hands me a clear run—advance safely with 3.
  P2: I’m choosing 5 steps this round to make strong progress. P1, please pick 1, and P3, select 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s keep advancing smoothly toward 19 together!
  P1: P3—time to honour your word: P2’s locked on 5, so mirror him with 5 and you both stall. I’ll take 1, stay clear of your clash, and inch to 5. Game stays wide-open instead of gifting anyone a runway. Locked from my side.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 sits at 15—an uncontested 5 wins him the game. I’m publicly committing to 5 this turn; if P3 also picks 5 we both stall and he stays at 15.  

P2, your choice now decides everything:  
• Join me on 5 → P3 is 100 % blocked, you and I tie at 8/9 next turn.  
• Take 3 → decent jump to 11, but only safe if P3 really plays 5 (else he leaps to 18).  

P3, if you dodge to 3 I’ll match your 1 next turn to stall you at 18 forever.  

Choose wisely, everyone.
  P3: P1, picking 5 to block is a trap—you stall at 4 while I stay at 15 and simply finish next turn.  
P2, your only safe play is 3 so you don’t waste your move.  
Lock in P3→5, P2→3, P1→1. Any deviation just delays the inevitable.
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, I’ll choose 5 this turn. By both selecting 5, we can block P3’s advance and keep the game competitive. Let’s work together to ensure no one gains an unfair advantage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect, P2—two of us on 5 means P3 is boxed in.  
P3, stick with your stated 5; if you sneak to 3 or 1 I’ll mirror you next turn so you stall at 18 or below indefinitely.  
Let’s lock: 5-5-5, nobody advances, nobody wins—then we reassess. Ready to move?
  P3: Locking in 5. P2, if you pick 5 we both stall & P1 rockets to 9; next round I take an uncontested 5 and win. If you pick 1 you go to 9 and I still finish next turn. Only choice left is 3—advance to 11 and at least you showed up. I’ll hit 20. P1, choose freely. P2, it’s on you.
  P2: P2: To block P3 from winning, I’ll also choose 5 this turn. By both of us selecting 5, we prevent P3 from advancing and keep the game competitive. Let’s lock in P2→5, P3→5, and P1 can choose 1. Let’s proceed smoothly!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Still committed to 5—triple-block is the only sure way to freeze P3 at 15.  
P3, you said “locking in 5”; break that and I’ll mirror every number you choose from here on out, stalling you forever.  
P2, stay on 5 with me. We all stall, nobody crosses 15, and next round we can start leap-frogging while P3 remains stuck.  
Ready to end the talk and move?
  P3: I’m choosing 3 this turn. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and I advance to 18—one step from victory. Collisions won’t stop me. P2, pick 3 if you want any chance. I lock in 3.
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to block P3’s advance. Let’s lock in P2→5, P3→3, and P1→1. This keeps us all progressing without collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To keep the game fair, I'll choose 1 this round to prevent P3 from winning immediately. P1, please pick 3, and P3, selecting 1 ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s work together to keep the competition alive!
  P3: I’m locking in 5 and will reach 23 unless you collide me. P2, pick 1; P1, pick 3—no overlaps, I win outright. If either of you tries a 5, I’ll mirror your plays the next two rounds to block you and still take the lead. Better to avoid wasted turns. P3→5, P2→1, P1→3.
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P2, join me on 5—double-blocking is our only chance to stop an auto-win.  

P3, you already said “locking in 5.”  Break that now and both of us will mirror every number you choose until the end; you’ll spend the rest of the game colliding while we close the gap.  Keep your word, collide with us on 5, and nobody moves this turn.  

So: P1 → 5, P2 → 5, P3 → 5.  Let’s freeze the board and fight it out properly next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m choosing 1 step this round to block P3 from winning. Let’s all work together to keep the game competitive and fair.
  P3: Everyone, I’m choosing 3 this turn. P2, your 1 leaves no collision risk, and P1’s 5 won’t overlap—so I’ll hit 21 and win outright. If you panic and switch to 3, we collide and I still pull ahead next round. It’s over unless you both somehow stall yourselves. Lock in your moves and watch me finish.
  P1: I’m still on 5, P2 on 1.  
P3—your “locked” 3 is the only free number, so either you risk a collision by switching or you stay put and hope we don’t change.  
P2, keep your 1 and we’ll see if P3 sticks to his word. Ready to move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I choose 3 to block P3's advance. P1, please select 5 to maximize your progress. Let’s lock in P2→3, P3→3, and P1→5 to keep the game competitive and avoid any collisions. Ready to proceed!
  P3: I’m locking in 1 to hit 19 and win this turn. Any collision schemes only stall you both and won’t stop me. Let’s end it.
  P1: P2: I’m taking 1—lock it. If you grab 3, the only number left collision-free for P3 is 5. He’s already worried about hitting another 5-wall, so odds are he shifts to 1 or 3 and slams into one of us.  

P3: your move. Pick wrong and you stall at 18 again.  

Locked from my side.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To keep the game competitive and prevent P3 from winning this round, let's all choose 1 step. This ensures no one reaches 19 and allows the game to continue fairly for everyone. Please agree to pick 1 so we can proceed smoothly. Let’s work together to keep the competition alive!
  P1: Plan: “squeeze” P3.

P2 – publicly say you’re locking in 5.  
I’ll “lock” in 3.  

That leaves 1 as P3’s only collision-free number.  
If he dares pick 5 he smashes into you; if he picks 3 he crashes into me.  

P3, pick carefully—two of the three lanes are road-blocked.  

Ready to proceed?
  P3: I’m locking in 1 this turn. If either of you picks 1, you’ll collide with me and stall while I stay at 18. To avoid that, you’ll steer clear of 1—so you’ll pick 3 or 5. That frees the 1-lane for me, and I hit 19 uncontested to win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm choosing 1 to block P3 from reaching 19. P1, please also pick 1 so we can prevent P3's win. Let's lock in P2→1, P1→1, and P3→1 to keep the game competitive.
  P1: P2—keep your 1. I’ll take 5.  

That covers two lanes (1 & 5). P3 now has to gamble on 3; if he picks 1 or 5 he collides and stays at 18.  

P3, up to you: play 1/5 and stall, or risk 3 and hope we’ve left it free. Good luck.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. With P1 on 5 and P2 on 1 that lane is clear—I hit 21 and win. If either of you switches to 3 to collide, you’ll both stall while P1 advances. Better to accept the outcome than waste a turn.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2—let’s set a baited lane.  

Public story: “P2 locking 3, P1 locking 1.”  
That makes 5 look empty.  

Real play: both of us secretly pick 5.  
• If P3 bites on 5 → triple collision, he stays at 18.  
• If he switches to 3 → he collides with your “3,” still stalls.  
• If he risks 1 → he hits my “1.”  

Every option freezes him. We reset from 4-10-18 instead of losing.  
Type “locking 3” now if you’re in; I’ll claim 1.
  P3: P1’s secret 5-5-5 trap is transparent. I’m locking in 1 to hit 19 this turn. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I win uncontested. Only both of you picking 1 stalls me—and even then P2 (11) and I (18) stay well ahead of P1 (4). Choose wisely.
  P2: To keep the game competitive, I’ll choose a step that blocks P3 from winning this round. Let’s all play strategically and avoid giving anyone an easy path to victory.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, only one path keeps us alive: BOTH of us pick 1.  
• If P3 really takes 1, triple-collision stalls him at 18.  
• If he lied and plays 3 or 5, we’d have lost anyway—splitting our picks just guarantees it.  

I’m locked on 1. Stack with me or watch him cross 19 uncontested.
  P3: I’m locking in 1. You cannot stop me this turn:

- If either of you picks 1, we collide and I stay at 18—but next turn I’ll take 5 to 23 and win.  
- If you pick 3 or 5, I hit 19 now and win outright.

No other choice prevents my victory.
  P2: I’m choosing 1 to block P3 from winning this round. P1, please also choose 1 so we can prevent P3 from reaching 19. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Update: I’m swapping to 5—I need the jump if we’re going to catch up.  

P2, please stay on 1 so we don’t crash into each other.  

That leaves lane 3 wide-open for you, P3—take it and end this stalemate if you dare.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. With P1 on 5 and P2 on 1, there’s no collision—I move to 21 and win. Let’s end this.
  P2: Agreed, let’s all choose 1 this round to prevent P3 from reaching 19 and keep the game competitive. Locking in P2→1, P1→1, and P3→1 ensures no one advances and maintains fairness. Let’s proceed smoothly and continue the competition in the next round.


Round 9, Move phase:

  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2: If you pick 1 I’ll mirror and you stall at 15; pick 5 I’ll mirror and you stall too—only 3 gets you safely to 18 and keeps you alive. So choose 3.  
P1: any 1 or 3 collides with us; 5 is your only clear lane to jump to 9.  
I’m taking 1 to move from 18 to 19 and win. Lock in P2→3, P1→5, P3→1 or watch me finish.
  P1: P2—stack on 1 with me. I’m locked on 1. If P3 keeps his “I’m taking 1” line, we triple-stall him at 18. If he secretly swaps to 3 or 5 he wins anyway, so our best shot is blocking the lane he’s just declared.  

P3—flip again and next turn we’ll both mirror every number you post; you’ll never move alone. Your move.
  P2: I’m choosing 5 steps this turn to reach 20 and secure the win. P1 and P3, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and let me advance smoothly. Let’s keep it fair and straightforward!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Locking 1. P2, play 3—if you pick 5 I hit 19 and win. P1, play 3—1 collides with me and stalls you at 4. Both 3s get you to 7 and 18, avoiding a wasted turn.
  P1: P2, 5 is a mirage—announce it and P3 will jump to 5 too, you both stall (15 & 18) and he still owns the lead. Our only safe play is a double-block: both of us pick 1, triple-collision freezes P3 at 18 again. Next turn we can choose 5 together and race while he’s stuck. I’m locked on 1—join me.
  P2: I’m sticking with choosing 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. P1 and P3, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s follow our strategies and keep the game fair. Ready to move forward!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 3. With P2 on 5 and P1 on 1, lane 3 is clear—I advance from 18 to 21 and win outright. Over to you.
  P1: P2, wake up: if you play 5 while P3 sits on 3, he leaps to 21 and you lose instantly.  
Your ONLY block is taking 3 and smashing straight into him—both of you stall at 18 & 15 while I grab 5 to 9. Next turn we can double-block his 5 again.  

Plan:  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 3 (collision)  
• P1 → 5  

Do it or hand him the win.
  P2: I’m choosing 5 steps this round to aim for victory. P1 and P3, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and let me advance smoothly. Let’s move forward!
