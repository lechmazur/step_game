If you both choose 5, I'm still at 20, and you're both stuck. The only logical choice for me is 1.  Don't overthink it."}

We'll collide, both stay put, and P2 gets their perfect scenario at 20 while we're stuck at 19 and 22.\n\nLast chance to reconsider - take 3 to tie me at 22, keep it competitive.
