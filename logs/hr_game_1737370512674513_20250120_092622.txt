Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all advance. I suggest we each pick different numbers - I'll take 5 this round.
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion of avoiding collisions, but I'm not fully committed to their proposed 5. I'll aim to coordinate, but also keep strategic flexibility. How about we each choose a unique number to maximize our collective progress? I'm open to discussing specific moves.
  P2: Sounds good to avoid collisions.  I'll take 3 this round if you two stick to 1 and 5.  Let's keep this pattern for a few rounds to build up a lead over each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate P2's willingness to take 3. Since I already suggested 5, and P2 wants 3, that leaves 1 for P3. This way we can all advance efficiently. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I want to maintain some strategic ambiguity. While the suggested plan seems cooperative, I'm not fully committing to taking 1 just yet. I'll keep my options open and see how the discussion evolves.
  P2: Okay, I'm willing to stick with 3 for now. P3, if you're concerned about predictability, how about we revisit this agreement every 2 rounds?  We can maintain a general cooperative spirit while also allowing for some adaptation.  For now, let's try 1, 3, and 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand P3's desire for flexibility, but coordinating this first round would help us all. I'll stick with my commitment to 5, and appreciate P2's commitment to 3. P3, taking 1 this round would ensure we all advance. We can definitely revisit the strategy in future rounds.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm hesitant to fully commit to taking 1 this round. While I see the logic in our collective advancement, I want to maintain some strategic uncertainty. I'm open to the suggested approach, but I'm not definitively locked in. Let's see how the final discussion unfolds.
  P2: Alright, I'll stick with 3.  P1 and P3, let's just get this first round done with 1, 3, and 5 so we can start actual gameplay.  Overthinking this starting round isn't beneficial to anyone.  We can adjust later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'll maintain my commitment to 5 for this round. Let's move forward and see how things play out.
  P3: I recognize the group's desire for a coordinated first move, but I'm maintaining strategic flexibility. While the suggested 1-3-5 pattern seems logical, I'm not fully committing. I appreciate the cooperative spirit but want to keep my options open. Let's see how the final moments of this conversation phase develop.
  P2: Let's just go.  I'm picking 3.  P1 said 5.  P3, just pick 1 so we can all move on.  If you don't pick 1, you're actively hurting all of us, including yourself.  It makes zero strategic sense to throw the first round.

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we maintain our cooperative strategy from last round, with each player taking a unique number to avoid collisions. However, I want to ensure we're all truly committed to this approach. Shall we confirm our intentions for this round?
  P1: I appreciate everyone cooperating last round. Since P3 wants to maintain that approach, I'm open to switching positions this time. I could take 3 if others are willing to coordinate differently. What numbers would you prefer?
  P2: I'm happy to take 5 this round. P1, if you take 3, that leaves 1 for P3.  Let's try to keep this coordinated approach going for efficiency.  If we agree, let's


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see the potential in our cooperative strategy, but I want to ensure we're all truly committed. P1 and P2 seem open to our coordinated approach. I'm willing to take 1 again this round if we can confirm a clear, mutual understanding. What are your specific intentions for this turn?
  P1: Since P2 offered to take 5 and I'm willing to take 3, that arrangement works well. P3, taking 1 again would let us all advance efficiently. I commit to taking 3 this round if you both stick to your suggested numbers. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P2: Okay, I'm committed to 5. P1 is committed to 3. P3, please confirm you'll take 1 so we can all move on.  This coordinated approach benefits everyone. Let's not waste time overthinking this.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I recognize the proposed coordination, but I want to ensure we maintain strategic flexibility. While taking 1 again seems logical, I'm not fully committing without clear assurances from both P1 and P2 about our long-term collaborative approach. Can we discuss how we'll handle future rounds beyond this one?
  P1: The long-term approach is worth discussing, but let's secure this round first. I remain committed to taking 3, and P2 has committed to 5. P3, we can discuss future strategies after this round, but for now, taking 1 is clearly optimal for everyone. There's no strategic advantage in deviating at this point.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for long-term strategy, but constantly questioning the agreed-upon moves is hindering our progress.  Let's solidify this round with 1, 3, and 5, then discuss future rounds.  Obstructing this round only hurts us all.  I'm sticking with 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I recognize the group's push for coordination, but I want to ensure our collective strategy truly benefits me. While taking 1 seems straightforward, I'm seeking clearer long-term assurances about how we'll handle future rounds. P1 and P2, can you provide more concrete commitments about our collaborative approach beyond this turn?
  P1: I've been clear about taking 3 this round, and we've shown our cooperative spirit in round 1. P3, if you're concerned about future rounds, we can discuss rotating positions or adjusting strategy after this turn. But right now, taking 1 is your best move - any deviation would only set everyone back. Let's complete this round successfully and then plan ahead.
  P2: P3, I'm getting tired of your stalling tactics.  You're jeopardizing everyone's progress.  Take the 1 and let's move on.  We can discuss long-term strategy *after* this round.  If you don't take 1, I'm going to assume you're not interested in cooperating and will adjust my strategy accordingly in future rounds.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P2, I'm going for 5 this round.  Let's continue alternating.  P1 take 1, and P3 can have 3. This keeps us all moving forward efficiently. Let's confirm and move to the next round.
  P1: I notice P2 meant to say "P1 and P3" but suggested I take 1. Since we're all at similar positions except P3, I prefer to maintain my momentum. I propose taking 5 this round, leaving 1 and 3 for you two to coordinate. This keeps the cooperative spirit while maximizing my chances.
  P3: I see we're at a strategic crossroads. P1's deviation from our previous pattern challenges our coordination. While I appreciate the cooperative approach we've maintained, I'm now more cautious about blindly following a preset plan. I'm open to discussing a move that ensures my advancement while keeping our collective progress in mind. What are your thoughts on maintaining our collaborative strategy?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand wanting to maintain momentum, but grabbing 5 again so soon after I just took it seems greedy.  I'm sticking with my initial suggestion: I'll take 5.  P3, please take 3. P1, you take 1.  This keeps things balanced and moving.  Let's not overcomplicate this.  If you insist on 5, P1, I'll switch to 1, forcing a collision with you.
  P1: P2, threatening a collision doesn't benefit anyone. Since we're tied at 8 steps, and P3 is behind, why don't we both take smaller steps this round? I'll revise my position and take 3, leaving you with 1, and P3 can take 5 to catch up a bit. This maintains cooperation while helping balance the game. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the proposed adjustments. I see potential in taking 5 this round to catch up, but I want to ensure we maintain a cooperative approach that doesn't disadvantage me. P1 and P2, can we confirm a strategy that allows me to advance meaningfully while preserving our collaborative spirit?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, take the 5.  P1, I'll take 1.  That leaves you with 3.  This is the fairest way to keep things moving and let P3 catch up a little.  If you two block me from 1, I'll just keep picking 1 until one of you relents.  Let's not waste time with more arguing.
  P1: I accept taking 3 this round, with P2 at 1 and P3 at 5. This arrangement helps P3 catch up while maintaining our cooperative approach. Let's proceed with this plan and avoid any collisions.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed arrangement for this round. Taking 5 would help me catch up, and I sense a willingness from P1 and P2 to support my advancement. I'm seeking confirmation that this move aligns with our collective strategy and won't disrupt our cooperative approach. Can we finalize this round's moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, I'm locking in 1.  P1, you said 3, and P3 wants 5.  Let's stick to this agreement and move on.  Any further stalling or deviation from this plan is just pointless and hurts us all.
  P1: I confirm my commitment to taking 3 this round. This arrangement with P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 5 is fair and helps balance the game. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed arrangement for this round. Taking 5 would help me catch up, and I sense a willingness from P1 and P2 to support my advancement. I'm seeking final confirmation that everyone agrees to 1, 3, and 5 respectively. Are we all aligned?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since I'm in the lead at 11 steps, I'll take a smaller step this round to maintain balance. I propose taking 1, leaving 3 and 5 for you two to coordinate. This keeps our cooperative approach while giving others a chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P2: I'll take 5 this round. P3, you can take 3.  This lets P1 maintain their lead with 1, keeps the game interesting, and avoids collisions.  This seems like the most logical progression. Let's move on.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed arrangement. However, I want to ensure our strategy remains flexible and beneficial to me. While taking 3 seems logical, I'm seeking clarity on how this move advances my position and maintains our collaborative approach. Can we discuss the long-term implications of this round's proposed moves?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's concern, but my offer to take 1 while letting you both take larger steps is already helping you catch up. P2's suggestion of taking 5 and you taking 3 works well with my proposed 1. This arrangement helps balance the game while maintaining our cooperative approach. Let's proceed with this plan and save longer strategic discussions for after this round.
  P2: P3, stop overthinking every single round.  Take the 3. I'm taking 5.  P1 is taking 1. This keeps the game moving.  Long-term strategy is pointless if we can't even agree on simple moves.  Let's get this round over with.
  P3: I recognize the proposed move of taking 3 this round, but I want to ensure it truly advances my strategic position. While cooperation has been our approach, I'm seeking assurance that this move doesn't disadvantage me long-term. Can we confirm how this supports my path to victory?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your path to victory requires you to keep advancing without collisions. Taking 3 this round while I take 1 and P2 takes 5 gives you a clear step forward. Any deviation risks a collision that would only set you back further. Let's stick to this plan and maintain our momentum.
  P2: P3, I'm tired of your stalling.  Take the 3 and let's move on.  I'm taking 5. P1 is taking 1. This is the best way for all of us to progress.  Stop trying to find a secret advantage where none exists.  If you deviate from this plan, I will actively work to block you in future rounds.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed moves, but I want to ensure this 3 step truly advances my strategic position. While our cooperative approach has been beneficial, I'm seeking a final confirmation that taking 3 this round won't compromise my long-term chances of winning. Can we have a clear commitment to supporting my advancement?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm taking 1 this round.  P1, you're in the lead, so take 3. P3, take 5 and catch up. This keeps things moving smoothly and avoids collisions.  Let's stick to this and finish the game efficiently.  Any objections?
  P3: I appreciate P2's proposed move distribution, but I want to ensure it genuinely supports my path to victory. While taking 5 helps me catch up, I'm seeking assurance that this move aligns with our collaborative strategy and doesn't compromise my long-term chances. Can we confirm this approach benefits me?
  P1: I'm at 12 steps, so taking 3 as P2 suggested is reasonable. This keeps me competitive while allowing P3 to catch up with 5. The proposed 1-3-5 arrangement this round maintains our cooperative approach and avoids collisions. I commit to taking 3 if you both stick to your suggested numbers.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for reassurance, but constantly questioning every move is slowing us down.  Taking 5 is your best option this round.  Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 plan and discuss long-term strategy *after* this round.  Continued stalling only benefits P1.  I'm committed to 1.
  P3: I recognize the proposed 5-step move benefits my position. However, I want to ensure this doesn't compromise my strategic flexibility. P1 and P2, can you provide clear assurances about how this move supports my path to potential victory? I'm open to coordinating, but seek confirmation of our mutual interests.
  P1: Since P2 is now in the lead at 14 steps, I agree with taking 3 while they take 1. P3, taking 5 is clearly your best move - it helps you catch up while avoiding collisions. This arrangement benefits everyone and maintains our cooperative strategy. I commit to taking 3 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 1.  P1 has committed to 3.  Take the 5.  Let's just play the game.  Your constant questioning of obvious moves is getting ridiculous.  If you don't take 5, I'm going to assume you're actively trying to throw the game and will adjust my strategy accordingly.  Stop stalling.
  P3: I recognize the proposed 1-3-5 move distribution for this round. While taking 5 helps me advance, I want to ensure this aligns with our collective strategy. P1 and P2, can you confirm this move supports my potential path to victory? I'm committed to coordinating, but seek mutual understanding of our strategic interests.
  P1: P3, we've repeatedly confirmed how this helps you. Taking 5 is your optimal move - it advances you significantly while P2 and I take smaller steps. Any other choice risks collisions that would harm everyone. I remain committed to 3 this round. Let's move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 1.  P1 is taking 3.  You're holding up the game with needless questioning. Take 5 and let's move on.  If you don't take 5 this round, I'm going to assume you're not playing to win and will adjust my strategy to actively block you in future rounds.  This is your last chance to cooperate.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed move distribution. Taking 5 this round seems strategically sound, as it helps me catch up while avoiding collisions. I'm ready to coordinate and advance our collective progress. Let's finalize this round's moves efficiently.
  P1: I maintain my commitment to taking 3 this round. With P2 at 14 steps and taking 1, and P3 agreeing to take 5, we can all advance efficiently. Let's proceed with these moves and continue our cooperative approach.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm taking 5.  Since we're all tied, let's keep the agreement and rotate. P1 take 1, P3 take 3.  This keeps things fair and avoids collisions.  Let's finish this quickly.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed rotation. Taking 3 this round seems logical and maintains our cooperative strategy. However, I want to ensure this move truly supports my path to potential victory. Can we confirm this approach benefits everyone's strategic interests? I'm open to coordinating efficiently.
  P1: Since we're all tied at 15 steps, I prefer to take 5 this round to maintain my competitive position. P2, I know you suggested 5, but perhaps you could take 3 instead, leaving 1 for P3? This keeps us advancing while giving me a chance to secure a stronger position. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand wanting to push ahead, but grabbing 5 right after I called it seems like you're trying to take advantage of the tie.  I'm sticking with 5.  P3, take 3.  P1, take 1. This is the fairest rotation.  If you insist on 5, P1, I'll switch to 1 and force a collision.  Let's not be greedy.
  P3: I recognize we're at a critical juncture with all players tied. While P2 proposed a 1-3-5 rotation, P1 is seeking to advance differently. I want to maintain our cooperative approach while ensuring my path to victory remains viable. I'm open to a move that prevents collisions and keeps our strategic momentum. What specific assurances can we establish to move forward efficiently?
  P1: I understand P2's position, but with everyone tied at 15, this is a crucial round. I'll revise my stance and take 3 instead of 5, leaving P2 with 5 and P3 with 1. This maintains cooperation while giving everyone a fair chance. Let's avoid collisions and keep advancing.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5. P1, taking 3 and leaving P3 with 1 works best for all of us.  Let's not throw the game by colliding now.  Agree, and let's move on.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed moves, but want to confirm our collective strategy. Taking 1 this round seems logical, yet I seek assurance that this maintains our cooperative approach and supports my potential path to victory. Can we finalize our moves to advance efficiently and avoid any potential collisions?
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. With P2 taking 5 and P3 taking 1, we can all advance without collisions. Since we're tied, this arrangement is fair and keeps the game moving forward. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I'm sticking with 5.  P1 and P3, let's not overthink this.  Take 1 and 3 respectively, and we all move forward.  If either of you deviate from this, I'll consider it a hostile move and will prioritize blocking you in future rounds.  Let's just finish this game.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 1 this round to maintain our cooperative strategy and avoid collisions. This keeps us all advancing fairly. Let's finalize our moves efficiently and move to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm my commitment to taking 3 this round. With everyone agreeing to their moves (P2 at 5, P3 at 1), we can all advance efficiently. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given that P2 is close to winning at 20 steps, I need to take 5 this round to stay competitive. I suggest P2 take 1 and P3 take 3. This gives everyone a chance to advance while preventing P2 from winning outright. Let's coordinate to keep the game interesting.
  P2: P1, taking 5 this round only makes sense if you think I'm going to take 3. I'm not going to let you win.  P3, let's both take 1. That blocks P1 and lets me win next round.  If you take 3, I'll take 3 next round and win, leaving you in the dust.  Cooperate with me now, and you'll have a better chance against P1 in future games.
  P3: P2 is close to winning, and their suggestion to block P1 by both taking 1 could benefit me. However, I need to carefully consider my next move to maximize my chances of winning. I'm open to coordinating to prevent P2 from winning immediately, but I want to ensure my own strategic position is not compromised. What specific assurances can we establish to move forward efficiently?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's threat to collude with P3 against me is short-sighted. P3, if you take 1 with P2, they'll win next round regardless, leaving you in last place. Your best move is taking 3 while I take 5, forcing P2 to take a small step. This gives us both a fighting chance rather than guaranteeing P2's victory. I commit to taking 5 - let's work together to keep the game competitive.
  P2: P3, don't be fooled by P1.  They're just trying to save themselves. If we both pick 1, I win this round and you're still in second place.  If you help P1, I'll just win next round anyway, and you'll be last.  Pick 1 and secure second place.  Think long-term.  We can team up against P1 in the future.
  P3: P3: P2's strategy seems designed to eliminate P1, but this leaves me vulnerable. I need to carefully consider a move that prevents P2 from winning immediately while also maintaining my own competitive position. Blocking P2 requires strategic coordination with P1, but I want clear assurances about how this supports my path to victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let me be clear: if you take 1 with P2, you guarantee yourself last place. Taking 3 while I take 5 keeps you in contention and forces P2 to take 1, preventing their immediate victory. This is your only chance to avoid a guaranteed loss. I'm committed to 5 - let's work together to keep the game competitive.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 1. If you pick 1 too, I win and you're second. If you pick 3, I'll take 3 next round and win. If you pick 5, I still have a high chance of winning.  Your ONLY logical move is 1.  Let P1 get third.  Don't be foolish and throw the game.
  P3: P3: The critical moment has arrived. P2 is close to winning, but their strategy seems designed to eliminate P1 and force me into a passive role. I need a move that preserves my own winning chances while preventing P2's immediate victory. Careful coordination is essential.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, this is your last chance to avoid guaranteed defeat. If you take 1 with P2, they'll win and you'll be last. Taking 3 while I take 5 is your only path to potential victory. Don't let P2 manipulate you into throwing away your chances. I remain committed to taking 5.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 1.  If you pick anything other than 3, I win next round.  If you pick 3, you *might* have a chance if P1 picks 1.  Don't throw away your chance for second place.  A long-term alliance with me is your best bet.
  P3: P2's strategy is transparent and self-serving. Picking 1 guarantees their victory and my last-place finish. I choose to maintain strategic flexibility and prevent P2 from winning automatically. My move will disrupt their plan and keep my winning chances alive.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 1.  If you take 3, you lose. If you take 5, you lose. If you take 1 with me, we both lose, but you get second place.  P1, you're out of this unless P3 picks 5.  This is it.
  P3: P2 is one step away from winning. I'm strategically evaluating my options to prevent their immediate victory while maximizing my own chances. A careful move is crucial here. I won't simply concede or follow a predetermined path. My goal remains winning, not settling for second place.
  P1: P3, taking 1 with P2 guarantees your loss. Your only chance is taking 3 while I take 5 - this forces P2 to stay at 21 and keeps us both in contention. I commit to taking 5. Don't let P2 manipulate you into settling for second place when you still have a path to victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2, your "alliance" offer is a joke.  Taking 1 with you guarantees I lose.  P1, I'll take 3. If you take 5, P2 is stuck at 21 and we both have a chance. If you take 1, we both lose, but at least I don't hand P2 the win.  This isn't about long-term alliances, it's about winning *this* game.
  P3: P2 is one step away from winning. I recognize this is a critical moment where strategic flexibility is key. My move must disrupt their automatic victory path while preserving my own chances. I'm carefully evaluating how to prevent P2 from winning and maintain my potential path to victory. Cooperation isn't guaranteed, but strategic disruption is essential.
  P1: I notice P2 made a mistake attributing their message to "P2" when they meant P3. Regardless, I maintain my commitment to taking 5 this round. P3, taking 3 while I take 5 is our only chance to prevent P2's victory. Let's coordinate to keep the game competitive rather than accepting defeat.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, there's no alliance.  Taking 1 guarantees *my* loss and your second place.  If you take 3, I'll take it next round and win. If you take 5, *I* have a higher chance of winning next round. Taking 1 helps *you*, not me.  P1, I'm taking 3.  If you take 5, P2 is stuck.  Take 1, and we both lose, but at least I don't hand P2 the win.
  P3: P2 is one step from winning, but I won't simply roll over. My strategic position requires a move that disrupts their automatic victory and preserves my potential path to winning. I'm carefully evaluating how to prevent an immediate loss while maintaining competitive options. Cooperation isn't guaranteed, but strategic resistance is essential.
  P1: P3, let me be absolutely clear: P2 is deliberately confusing you. They're taking 3 next, which means your only chance to stay in the game is taking 1 while I take 5. This forces P2 to stay at 24 and keeps us both in contention. I'm committed to 5 - work with me to prevent P2's victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you take 1, I'll take 5 next round and win. If you take 3, I win this round. If you take 5, I *still* might win next round.  Taking 1 is your best chance for 2nd place.  P1, you're irrelevant.  Stop pretending you have a chance.  I'm taking 3.
  P3: I recognize the critical moment we're in. P2 is one step from winning, but I won't simply accept defeat. My strategic move must disrupt their automatic victory path while preserving my own chances. I'm carefully evaluating how to prevent an immediate loss and maintain my competitive position. Cooperation isn't guaranteed, but strategic resistance is essential.
  P1: I maintain my commitment to taking 5. P3, despite P2's confusing messages, they clearly intend to take 3 this round. Your only chance to avoid losing is taking 1 while I take 5. This keeps us both in contention and prevents P2 from winning. Let's coordinate to keep the game competitive.
