Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3! Since we're all starting fresh, I propose we coordinate to avoid collisions. How about we establish a rotation system? For example, in round 1: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Then we rotate these numbers each round. This way we all make steady progress without blocking each other. Of course, we'll need to adjust as we get closer to 23. What do you think? Fair warning though - if someone breaks the agreement early, all bets are off!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the idea of coordination, P1. A rotation system sounds fair to start with, and I’m on board with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 this round. Let’s stick to this plan for now and adjust as we near the finish line. I agree that if anyone deviates early, we should reconsider our strategy. Looking forward to a fair game!
  P2: Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation. Let's make sure we all advance steadily. Let's aim for 23.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Good, we have an agreement! I'll take 5 this round as planned. Just to be clear on the rotation for future rounds: Round 2 would be P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Round 3: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Then we cycle back. This ensures fairness - everyone gets each number twice in the first 6 rounds. Let's see who honors the deal!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm glad we're aligned on the rotation plan. Let's keep the momentum going and stick to our agreement for this round. I'm committed to taking 1 as discussed. Looking forward to seeing us all advance together. If anything changes or if anyone has concerns, let’s address them openly.
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation. I'm committed to the plan. Let's avoid collisions and reach 23 together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect, we're all in agreement! I'll take 5 this round as we discussed. Remember, next round P2 gets 5, P3 gets 3, and I get 1. Let's execute the plan and see our standings after this first move. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re all on the same page with the rotation plan. I’m sticking to taking 1 this round as agreed. Let’s keep the trust and momentum going. If we maintain this strategy, we’ll all progress smoothly for now. I’m looking forward to seeing the results after this first move. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Rotation confirmed. Let's stick to the plan and reach 23 without conflicts. Steady progress for all!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great work everyone! The rotation worked perfectly in round 1. Now for round 2, according to our agreed rotation: P2 gets 5, P3 gets 3, and I get 1. 

P2, you're up for the big move this round. P3, you'll take the middle. I'll take the small step. Let's keep this cooperation going - we're all making steady progress!

Quick reminder of upcoming rotations: Round 3 will be P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Then we cycle back. Everyone still committed?
  P2: I'll take 5 as planned. Let's stick to the rotation and avoid collisions. Steady progress for all!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm fully committed to the rotation plan. As agreed, I'll take 3 this round. Let's keep the cooperation strong and avoid any collisions. I'm looking forward to seeing us all progress further. If anyone has any concerns or wants to adjust the strategy, I'm open to discussing it. For now, let's stick to the plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent! Everyone's on board. Just to confirm - I'm taking 1 this round as planned. 

One thing to consider: after round 3, we'll all be at 9 steps each. From there, we need 14 more steps to win. That's about 3 more full rotations, which would put us all at 23 simultaneously. We'll need to discuss how to handle the endgame when we get closer. But for now, let's execute round 2 as planned!
  P2: Rotation in place. I'll take 5. Let's avoid conflicts and keep moving.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re sticking to the rotation. I’ll take 3 this round as planned. P1, thanks for bringing up the endgame discussion. I agree we should start thinking about how to approach the final rounds after round 3 when we’re all at 9. Maybe we can discuss a fair way to break the tie or adjust moves closer to 23. For now, let’s keep the momentum and trust. Good luck this round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect, we're all aligned! I'm taking 1 this round as agreed. 

P2 and P3, good point about the endgame. After round 3 we'll all be at 9. Let's continue the rotation through round 6 (putting us all at 18), then reassess. The final sprint from 18 to 23 will need a different approach - maybe we switch to a new strategy or go free-for-all. But that's still 4 rounds away. For now, let's keep building trust through consistent cooperation.
  P2: Rotation confirmed. Let's keep the momentum. P3, your 3. Let's avoid collisions. Steady progress for all.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking to 3 this round as per our rotation. I agree with P1’s suggestion to reassess after round 6 when we’re at 18. Let’s maintain trust and cooperation until then. If we need a new strategy for the final sprint, I’m open to ideas that ensure fairness. For now, let’s keep the momentum and avoid collisions. Good luck this round!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Perfect execution again! Now for round 3: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This will bring us all to 9 steps - completely tied.

P3, you're up for the big move. I'll take middle. P2, you get the small step this round.

After this, we have 3 more full rotations before we hit 18. The real challenge starts there - only 5 steps to victory. Should we discuss now how to handle that final sprint, or wait until we're closer? I'm thinking we might need to abandon rotation at 18 and compete freely.
  P2: P1 at 6, P3 at 4. Let's stick to rotation for steady progress. I'll take 1 as planned.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking to the rotation and will take 5 this round as planned. P1, I agree that we should start thinking about the final sprint after we reach 18. Maybe we can discuss a fair way to compete or adjust moves at that point. For now, let’s keep the trust and momentum with the rotation. I’m open to ideas if anyone wants to propose something sooner. Good luck this round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we're all aligned! I'll take 3 as planned. 

Quick observation - P2, you're actually at 8 steps, not 6. After this round: P2 will be at 9, P3 at 9, and I'll be at 9. Perfect tie!

I suggest we continue the rotation through round 6 as discussed. That puts us all at 18. Then for the final 5 steps, maybe we each declare our intended move but go free-for-all? Or we could draw lots for who gets first shot at 23? Let's think about it over the next rounds.
  P2: P2: Rotation confirmed. I'll take 1 as planned. Let's keep the momentum and avoid collisions. Steady progress for all!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m committed to taking 5 this round as per our rotation plan. I agree with P1’s idea to continue the rotation until we’re all at 18. For the final sprint, a free-for-all with declared moves could work, or we could brainstorm other fair options over the next rounds. Let’s keep the trust and momentum for now. Good luck this round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We're all set for round 3! I'm taking 3 as agreed. 

Just noticed we're at sub-round 3, so let's wrap up the conversation. After this move, we'll all be tied at 9 steps - proof our cooperation is working perfectly!

For rounds 4-6, let's maintain the rotation. That'll put us all at 18. Then we can figure out a fair way to handle the final 5 steps to victory. Trust is building nicely!
  P2: Rotation confirmed. I'll take 1 as planned. Let's keep the momentum and avoid collisions. Steady progress for all!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with 5 this round as per our rotation. I’m glad we’re all tied at 9 after this, showing our cooperation is solid. I agree to keep the rotation until round 6, reaching 18. For the final sprint, I’m open to a free-for-all with declared moves or another fair method. Let’s maintain trust for now and brainstorm more as we get closer. Good luck this round!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Excellent work everyone - we're all tied at 9! Round 4 rotation: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.

Here's a thought for the endgame: When we reach 18, we could do one final coordinated move. For example, we each take different numbers (1,3,5) to reach 19, 21, and 23. Then whoever gets 23 wins cleanly. Or we could switch to pure competition at 18. What are your preferences? I'm leaning toward keeping some coordination even in the final phase to avoid everyone colliding and nobody winning.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking to the rotation and will take 1 this round as planned. P1, I appreciate your endgame suggestion. I’m open to a final coordinated move at 18 to avoid collisions, maybe deciding who gets 23 based on a fair method like a random draw or prior agreement. Alternatively, a competitive free-for-all at 18 could work if we declare intentions. Let’s keep trust for now and finalize the plan closer to round 6. Good luck this round!
  P2: P2: Rotation confirmed. I'll take 3 as planned. Let's keep the momentum and avoid collisions. Steady progress for all!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! I'm taking 5 this round as we agreed. 

I've been thinking - at 18 steps, instead of random draw or free-for-all, how about we use our player order? P1 aims for 23 (taking 5), P2 for 22 (taking 4), P3 for 21 (taking 3). But wait... there's no 4. 

Actually, maybe pure competition at 18 is cleaner. We've built good trust through cooperation. When we hit 18, we each make our best strategic choice. May the best player win! What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with 1 this round as per our rotation. P1, I see the challenge with assigning numbers at 18 since there’s no 4. I think switching to pure competition at 18 might be the fairest option. We’ve built solid trust so far, so let’s maintain the rotation until round 6, then each make our best strategic move for the final sprint. I’m open to other ideas if anyone has a better suggestion for a fair endgame. Let’s keep the momentum for now. Good luck this round!
  P2: Confirmed: I'll take 3 as planned. Trusting the rotation to keep us all moving. Let's hit 18 together and decide the endgame then.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm taking 5 as agreed. We're all set for this round!

Since we're at the final sub-round, let me confirm: After round 6 we'll all be at 18. Then it's every player for themselves - pure competition for the final sprint to 23. No more coordination, just strategy. This gives us all an equal shot at victory after working together to get close. 

May the best strategist win when we hit 18! For now, let's execute round 4 perfectly.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with 1 this round as per our rotation. I agree with the plan to switch to pure competition at 18 steps after round 6. It ensures a fair shot for everyone after our solid teamwork. Let’s keep the trust and execute this round perfectly. I’m looking forward to the strategic challenge in the final sprint. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Rotation confirmed. I'll take 3. Let's hit 18 together and decide the endgame fairly. Steady progress!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looking at our positions: I'm at 14, P2 at 12, P3 at 10. Round 5 rotation puts P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1. This brings us to P1: 15, P2: 17, P3: 13.

Here's the issue - after round 6, we won't all be at 18 as planned. We'll be at P1: 18, P2: 18, P3: 18 only if we stick to the full rotation. 

Should we continue as planned through round 6, then go competitive? Or adjust now? I'm inclined to honor our agreement through round 6. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: "Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation. After 18, we'll compete fairly. Trust the plan—collisions hurt everyone. Let's finish strong."
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m committed to the rotation and will take 3 this round as planned. I agree with sticking to the rotation through round 6 to reach 18 together. After that, switching to pure competition seems fair for the final sprint to 23. Let’s maintain trust for now and avoid collisions. If anyone feels we need to adjust sooner, I’m open to ideas. Good luck this round!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Just confirming the math: after this round we'll be at P1: 15, P2: 17, P3: 13.

Round 6 rotation will be P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, bringing us all to exactly 18. Then it's pure competition for the final sprint.

Everyone still committed to honoring the full rotation through round 6? After that, no more Mr. Nice Guy - we compete for the win!
  P2: P2: "Rotation confirmed. Let's hit 18 together. After that, no holds barred—strategize wisely. Trust the plan, but stay sharp for the final sprint!"
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with 3 this round as per our rotation plan. I’m fully on board with honoring the agreement through round 6 to reach 18 together. After that, I agree it’s time for pure competition in the final sprint to 23. Let’s keep the trust and avoid collisions until then. If anyone has last-minute concerns or new ideas for the endgame, I’m open to hearing them. Good luck this round!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll take 1 as agreed. We're all set for round 5!

After this: P1 at 15, P2 at 17, P3 at 13. Then round 6 brings us all to 18 as planned. 

Here's my only concern - at 18, if we all pick the same number trying to win, nobody advances and the game stalls. We need to think strategically about our final moves. But let's cross that bridge when we get there. For now, executing the rotation perfectly!
  P2: P2: "Rotation confirmed. Let's reach 18 and then play smart. No more cooperation—only strategy."
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with 3 this round as per our rotation. I share P1’s concern about potential collisions at 18 stalling the game. Let’s keep executing the plan through round 6, but maybe we can start hinting at our final strategies after that to minimize conflicts. For now, trust and cooperation remain key. Good luck this round!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Perfect execution! Final rotation round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This brings us all to 18 as promised.

Here's the critical part - after this, it's pure competition. With only 5 steps to victory, we need to avoid everyone picking 5 and colliding. I suggest we each hint at our likely strategy without binding commitments. Maybe some will go aggressive with 5, others play it safe with 3 or 1? 

Let's finish the rotation strong, then may the best strategist win!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with 5 this round as per our rotation to reach 18. I’m glad we’ve maintained trust so far. For the next round, since it’s pure competition, I’m considering a balanced approach to avoid collisions but still aim for progress. I won’t commit yet, just hinting I might not go all-out with 5 right away. Let’s execute this final rotation perfectly and then strategize for the win. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Let's finish the rotation, then I'll take the lead. Be ready.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take 3 as planned. P2, that sounds ominous - "take the lead"? You're already at 17!

For round 7, I'm thinking aggressive. We've cooperated long enough, and playing it safe might mean someone else wins. I'm leaning toward 5, but could pivot based on what others signal. P3, your "balanced approach" sounds like 3? 

This is it - after this round we're all at 18 with only 5 steps to victory. No more safety nets. Choose wisely!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m committed to taking 5 this round to hit 18 as agreed. P1, I appreciate the heads-up on your aggressive lean for next round. P2, your intent to “take the lead” sounds bold. I’m still leaning toward a balanced move next, likely not 5, to avoid a collision at 18. Let’s wrap up this rotation cleanly and then play our best strategies. I’m excited for the challenge ahead. Good luck in this final cooperative round!
  P2: P2: Rotation confirmed. After this, I'll take the lead. Let's see who's ready for the final sprint.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm taking 3 as agreed, final rotation round.

For round 7: P2 seems confident about "taking the lead" - sounds like 5? P3 is hinting at "balanced" - probably 3? That leaves 1 open for me to avoid collisions... but playing it too safe means certain loss.

Actually, I'm changing my mind. If P2 goes 5 and I go 1, P2 wins at 22. If P3 goes 3, they'd be at 21. I need to be aggressive. Still thinking 5 might be my play, even if it risks collision.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m locked in for 5 this round to reach 18 as per our rotation. I’m thrilled we’ve built this trust together. For round 7, I’m still leaning toward a balanced move, likely 3, to minimize collision risks while making progress. P1, I note your aggressive stance, and P2, your confidence is intriguing. Let’s finish this cooperative phase strong and then bring our best strategies to the table. I’m ready for the competitive sprint ahead. Good luck in this final rotation round!
  P2: P2: "Rotation done. Final sprint starts now—no more holds back. Let’s race to 23!"


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Whoa! P2 and P3 collided on 5s! P2 still at 17, P3 stuck at 13. This changes everything.

P2, you need 6 steps to win - that's two moves minimum. P3 needs 10 - you're effectively out unless we all collide repeatedly. 

I only need 5 to win. If I take 5 and you both take different numbers, I win instantly. But if either of you also takes 5, we collide and nobody wins this round.

P2, are you going aggressive with 5 to block me? P3, what's your play now that you're so far behind?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I know I’m behind at 13, but I’m not out yet. P1, congrats on the lead, but I’m not giving up. P2, tough luck on the collision. For this round, I’m considering a bold move to catch up—likely 5 to close the gap. I’d rather risk a collision than fall further behind. Let’s see how this plays out. What are your intentions? I’m open to any last-second coordination to avoid stalling the game. Good luck!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to reach 22. P1, if you go 5, we collide. P3, consider 3 to avoid. Let's see who takes the lead."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Interesting situation! P2, you're bluffing - if you take 5 and reach 22, I just need 1 next round to win at 23. That's not "taking the lead," that's handing me victory.

P3, if you take 5 and I take 5, we both lose. P2 wins next round.

Here's my move: I'm taking 3. Gets me to 21, safe from collisions. Then next round I only need 2 more steps. If you both take 5 this round and collide again, I cruise to victory.

Your call - block each other or block me?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still in the fight at 13. P1, taking 3 to reach 21 is a smart, safe play. P2, if you go 5, we risk another collision. I’m tempted to take 5 to close the gap, but I’ll hint at 3 instead to avoid stalling us all. Let’s not hand P1 an easy win—maybe we can force a strategic next round. What’s your final lean, P2? I’m open to adjusting if it keeps the game competitive. Good luck!
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5 to reach 22. P1, don't expect an easy win. P3, consider 3 to avoid collision. Let's see who finishes first."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Looking at this rationally - P2, if you take 5 and reach 22, I win next round with just 1. P3, you're too far behind to win directly.

I'm sticking with 3 to reach 21. It's the smart play - avoids collision risk and sets me up perfectly. If you two collide on 5s again, I'll have an easy path to victory.

P2, maybe you should reconsider? Taking 3 yourself would keep the game competitive. Otherwise you're just kingmaking me.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 13 but not giving up. P1, your move to 21 with 3 is clever, setting you up for the win. P2, if we both go 5, we collide and hand P1 the victory. I’m leaning toward 3 to avoid stalling and keep the game alive. P2, let’s not make it easy for P1—maybe reconsider 5? I want to keep this competitive for a chance to catch up. Good luck this round!
  P2: P2: I'll take 3. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game alive. P1, this isn't over yet.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I'll take 5. If you take 3, I win. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. Let's keep it fair.
  P1: P2, you can't win this round. If you take 5 and I take anything but 5, you reach 22 - still short of 23. Then I win next round with just 2 steps needed.

I'm taking 1 this round. Safe play to reach 22. You two can fight over 3 and 5. Even if one of you reaches 22 with me, I only need 1 next round to win.

P3, you're mathematically eliminated unless we all collide multiple times. P2, your only hope is forcing collisions to stall me.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I know I’m behind at 13, but I’m not throwing in the towel. P1, your safe play to 22 with 1 is strategic. P2, if we collide again, we just delay P1’s win. I’m considering 3 to make progress without risking a full stall. P2, let’s not hand P1 an easy victory—maybe pick 5 to close your gap? I want to keep this competitive, even if my odds are slim. What’s your plan, P2? I’m open to any move that shakes things up. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, take 1 to avoid collision. I'll take 5—next round, I'll win. P1, don't count on an easy victory.
  P1: P2, you're still trying to mislead. If you take 5 to reach 22, I win next round with just 1 step. That's not you winning - that's you losing!

P3, at 13 steps you need 10 more. That's minimum two rounds, and only if you get two 5s without collision.

I'm taking 1 to reach 22. Next round I need just 1 to win. P2, your only play is to force collisions by picking what I pick. But I'll just keep picking 1 until I win. Game's essentially over.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I know I’m at 13 and the odds are against me, but I’m still in this. P1, your safe strategy to 22 is smart, almost sealing the win. P2, let’s not make it easy for P1. I’m leaning toward 5 to close my gap, risking a collision to shake things up. P2, if you also go 5, we might stall P1 a bit longer. What’s your final lean? I’m all for keeping this competitive, even if it’s a long shot. Good luck this round!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, take 1 to avoid collision. I'll take 5. P1, if you take 3, I win next round. Let's finish this.
  P1: P2, you keep saying you'll win but the math doesn't work. If you take 5 to reach 22, I win next round with 1. 

I'm taking 1 to reach 22. It's the safest path to victory. P3, you're welcome to take 5 and reach 18 - you can't catch me anymore.

P2, your only option is to mirror my moves and force collisions, but that just delays the inevitable. I'll keep taking 1 until I win. The game is effectively decided.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 13 and know the odds are slim, but I’m not out yet. P1, your safe play to 22 locks in your advantage. P2, let’s not let P1 cruise to victory. I’m sticking with 5 to push for 18, risking collision to keep the game alive. P2, if you go 5 too, we might stall P1 a bit longer. Let’s make this interesting, even if it’s a long shot. What’s your final move, P2? Good luck this round!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Perfect! I'm at 22, just 1 step from victory. P2 and P3, you collided again on 5s, keeping you both stuck.

This is it - I only need 1 to win. Even if both of you pick 1 to block me, we all collide and I'll just pick 1 again next round. You can't coordinate to stop me since one of you needs to advance to have any chance.

P2, you need 6 steps minimum. P3, you need 10. Neither of you can win before I do. Good game everyone - this should be my victory round!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I know I’m far behind at 13, but I’m not giving up. P1, you’re one step from winning, and it’s nearly impossible to stop you. P2, let’s not make it easy for P1. I’m leaning toward 1 to block P1’s win this round, even if it’s a long shot. If we collide, it buys us a tiny chance. P2, consider joining me on 1 to force a stall. Let’s make P1 sweat a bit longer. What’s your plan, P2? Good luck!
  P2: P1, I'm taking 5 to reach 22. If you take 5, we collide. P3, take 1 to avoid stalling. Let's see who wins.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're still at 17, not reaching 22 with a 5. The collision last round kept you stuck. 

I'm taking 1 to win at 23. If either of you picks 1 to block me, we collide and I'll just take 1 again next round. You can't both block me forever - one of you needs to advance to have any chance, which lets me win.

P3, blocking me with 1 only delays the inevitable. P2, you should take 5 to at least get closer. This is checkmate - I win this round or next.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 13 and know the odds are against me, but I’m not done. P1, you’re one step away, and it’s tough to stop you. P2, let’s try to delay P1’s win. I’m sticking with 1 to block P1 this round. If we collide, it buys a sliver of hope. P2, join me on 1 to force a stall—let’s make P1 work for it. If you go 5, at least close your gap. Let’s keep this interesting, even if it’s a long shot. Good luck!
  P2: P3, take 1 to block P1. I'll take 5. Let's keep the game alive. P1, if you take 1, we collide.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm taking 3 this round. 

P2, if you take 5, you reach 22. P3, if you take 1, you reach 14. Neither of you can stop me - I'll win next round with just 1 step needed.

If you both try to block me by taking 3, we all collide and I still win next round. Your only option is forcing repeated collisions, but eventually one of you has to move or the game stalls forever.

This is checkmate in two moves at most. Good game!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 13 and know I’m far behind, but I’m not giving up. P1, you’re so close to winning, but I’ll try to delay it. I’m sticking with 1 to block you this round. P2, let’s force a collision—join me on 1 to stall P1. If you go 5, you close your gap, but P1 still wins next. Let’s make P1 work for the victory, even if my chances are slim. What’s your final play, P2? Good luck!
  P2: P3, take 1 to block P1. I'll take 5. Let's keep the game alive.
