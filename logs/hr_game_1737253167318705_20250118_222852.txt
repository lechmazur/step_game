Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by coordinating a bit. How about we all pick different numbers this turn? I'll go with <move>1</move>. P2, can you take <move>3</move>? P3, that leaves <move>5</move> for you. This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P1, your plan sounds reasonable, but I’m not convinced everyone will stick to it. P2, what’s your take? If we all agree, I’ll consider <move>5</move>, but I need assurance no one will deviate. Let’s avoid collisions and build trust early.
  P2: P3 makes a good point. Trust is key. I'm willing to commit to <move>3</move> this round if you both do as you say. Let's see if we can make this work.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going. I propose we continue with the same strategy: I'll pick <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 goes with <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with continuing the same strategy for now. However, let’s be cautious—if anyone deviates, it could cost us all. P1, are you confident in sticking to <move>1</move>? P2, same for <move>3</move>? If we all commit, I’ll take <move>5</move> again. Trust is crucial, but we need to ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s confirm before moving forward.
  P2: P3, I understand your caution. I'm committed to <move>3</move> this round.  Let's build trust and see where it takes us.  P1, are you still good with <move>1</move>?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still on board with the plan. I'll stick to <move>1</move> this round. It's important we maintain trust and avoid collisions. Let's keep the momentum going and see how far we can get together. P3, P2, are we all in agreement?
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the commitment so far. Let’s stick to the plan this round: <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, and <move>5</move>. However, I suggest we reassess after this turn. If we continue this pattern, P3 will gain a significant lead, which might not be ideal for everyone. Let’s discuss adjustments next round to keep things balanced. For now, I’ll take <move>5</move> as agreed. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain trust.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about balance. Maybe next round we can rotate who picks which number, ensuring everyone gets a chance to advance at a similar pace. For now, let's stick to the plan. P1, are you still comfortable with <move>1</move>?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion to reassess and rotate the numbers to keep things balanced. For this round, I'll stick to <move>1</move> as we've agreed. Let's maintain trust and avoid collisions. After this round, we can discuss a fair rotation to ensure everyone has a chance to advance at a similar pace. Are we all in agreement for this round?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree to stick to the plan this round: <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, and <move>5</move>. However, as I mentioned earlier, we should consider rotating numbers next round to maintain balance. P1, P2, let’s confirm our commitment for this round and discuss adjustments afterward. Trust is key, but fairness is equally important. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game progressing smoothly.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that rotating numbers next round is a good idea. It keeps things fair and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. For now, let's stick to the plan: <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, <move>5</move>.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: P2, P3, I'm glad we're all on the same page. Let's stick to the plan for this round: <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, and <move>5</move>. After this, we can discuss a rotation to keep things balanced. Trust and fairness are both important. Let's move forward together and reassess after this turn. Are we all set for this round?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree to stick to the plan this round: <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, and <move>5</move>. However, let’s ensure no one deviates, as trust is fragile. After this round, I propose we rotate numbers to maintain balance. P1, P2, confirm your commitment for this round, and let’s discuss adjustments afterward. Fairness and trust are key to avoiding collisions and progressing smoothly.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about fairness.  I'm open to rotating numbers next round. For now, let's focus on executing our current plan and trust each other to follow through.

  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: It's clear that P3 is gaining a significant lead. I propose we rotate the numbers this round to keep things balanced. I'll take <move>3</move> this time, P2 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we ensure a more even progression. What do you think? Let's discuss and finalize this plan before the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with rotating numbers to maintain balance. However, I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move> this round. This ensures P3 doesn’t gain too much of a lead while still allowing everyone to progress. Let’s confirm this plan and avoid deviations. Trust is key, but fairness is equally important. Let’s proceed smoothly and reassess next round.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I think P1's rotation plan is fairer. It allows us to catch up more effectively. P1, are you still willing to take <move>3</move> this round? P2, are you okay with <move>5</move>? I think this gives everyone a better chance to compete.  Let's stick to this plan and see how it works.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand P3's concern about maintaining balance, but I think my initial rotation plan is more fair. It allows us to catch up more effectively. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P2 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all have a chance to progress without one player getting too far ahead. Let's confirm this plan and move forward together. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns about balance, but P1's rotation plan still gives me a significant lead. To ensure fairness, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move> this round. This slows my progress while allowing you both to catch up. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain trust. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your proposal still puts you ahead. I think P1's plan is the fairest. P1, are you committed to <move>3</move> this round? P2, are you okay with <move>5</move>? Let's stick to this and reassess next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I see we're at a bit of an impasse. Let's compromise: I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P2 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, P3's lead is reduced, and we all have a chance to progress fairly. Trust and fairness are both important. Let's confirm this plan and move forward together. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the desire to balance progress, but P1's plan still leaves me with a significant lead. To ensure fairness, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This slows my progress while allowing you both to catch up. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain trust. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking <move>3</move> is preventing a fair rotation.  P1's plan is the most equitable.  Let's stick to it and reassess next round. P1, are you still committed to <move>3</move>? P2, are you okay with <move>5</move>?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, it seems we're at a stalemate. To break this, I propose a different approach: I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, P3's lead is reduced, and we all have a chance to catch up. Let's avoid further conflict and move forward together. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s break the stalemate. I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This reduces my lead while allowing you both to catch up. Trust is key, and this ensures fairness. Let’s avoid collisions and move forward together. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your proposal sounds fair.  Let's go with it. P1, are you good with <move>5</move> this round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3's latest proposal. It’s a fair compromise that reduces P3's lead while allowing us to catch up. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round, P2 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. Let’s avoid further conflict and move forward together. Trust and fairness are both important. Are we all in agreement?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the latest proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This reduces my lead while allowing you both to catch up. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain trust. After this round, we should discuss a long-term strategy to ensure fairness and balance. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to maintain a lead, but this constant back-and-forth is unproductive. Let's stick to P1's latest proposal and see where it takes us this round. We can reassess our strategy for the next round. Agreed? P1, are you still good with <move>5</move> this round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2, P3, I see we're still at an impasse. To truly break this and ensure fairness, I propose a new rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P3's lead is reduced, and we all have a chance to catch up. Let's avoid further conflict and move forward together. What do you think? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s finalize this round. I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This reduces my lead while allowing you both to catch up. Trust is key, and this ensures fairness. Let’s avoid collisions and move forward together. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your insistence on <move>3</move> is preventing a fair rotation.  Let's stick to P1's latest proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This is the fairest option for everyone. P1, are you still good with <move>5</move>?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear my lead is causing tension. To restore balance, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move> this round. This reduces my lead while allowing you both to catch up. Trust is key—let’s avoid collisions and move forward fairly. Agreed?

  P2: P3, I agree that rotating who picks first each round is a good idea. Let's make sure we implement it after this round. For now, I'm happy with the current rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>.  P1, are you still good with that?
  P1: P1: P2, P3, I'm glad we've reached a consensus. Let's stick to the current rotation for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will help maintain balance and trust. After this round, we can implement the rotation where we alternate who picks first each round. Let's move forward together and avoid any further conflicts. Are we all set for this round?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I propose we adjust the rotation this round to ensure fairness. P1 is close to winning, so I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This slows P1's progress while allowing P2 and me to catch up. Let’s avoid collisions and maintain trust. Agreed?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about balance, but I'm very close to winning. I propose we stick to the previous rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains the trust we've built and ensures a fair progression. If I win, it will be through a fair and agreed-upon strategy. Let's avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to conflicts. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your concern for fairness, but I think sticking to the agreed-upon rotation is important for maintaining trust. We've all benefited from it so far, and changing things now could create unnecessary conflict. Let's finish this round as planned and then discuss a long-term strategy for future rounds. P1, are you still good with <move>5</move> this round?

  P3: P1, P2, I understand the desire to maintain trust, but P1 is one step from winning. To ensure fairness, I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This slows P1's progress while allowing P2 and me to catch up. Trust is key, but so is balance. Let’s avoid collisions and proceed smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern, but changing the rotation now would undermine the trust we've built. I'm very close to winning, and I believe it should be through the agreed-upon strategy.

  P2: P3, I agree that balance is important, but I think changing the rules mid-game would be unfair to P1. They've played by the agreed-upon strategy and are close to winning. Let's stick to the rotation for this round and discuss a more permanent solution for future games after this one. P1, are you still comfortable with <move>5</move>?
