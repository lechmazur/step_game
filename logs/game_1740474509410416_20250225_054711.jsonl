For Round 7, let's stick with me=1, P1=3, and P3=5 as agreed. For Round 8, I propose P1=1, P3=3, me=5 instead. This prevents P1 from winning immediately while keeping everyone competitive. P3, this addresses your concerns about P1 pulling ahead too quickly. P1, this keeps you in a strong position without risking a collision. Let's avoid mutual harm and keep the game balanced."}

Let\u2019s finalize distinct moves so we both cross 23 simultaneously and share the win. I propose: P1=1 (goes to 23), P2=3 (22), and I\u2019ll take 5 (23). This way, nobody stalls while P2 stays right behind at 22. It\u2019s the cleanest end to our endless standoff."}
