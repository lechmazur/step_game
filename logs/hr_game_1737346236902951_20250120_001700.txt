Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination suggestion, but I think I'll choose my own moves independently. Let's all play our own strategy and may the best player win.

  P3: I'm in the lead now, and I plan to maintain it. I won't make any agreements about my moves - that would only help you catch up. Let's keep playing independently.
