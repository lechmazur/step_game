Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm leaning toward a strong first move. It seems best if we avoid colliding on the big move early on. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: I agree with P2 about avoiding collisions. A strong first move could set us up well, but we should also consider what each of us might play. Maybe we can coordinate to ensure at least one of us advances significantly this turn. What are your thoughts on playing a lower number to avoid blocking each other?
  P1: P1: "Let's all pick different numbers (1, 3, 5) this round to maximize progress without collisions. If we each advance uniquely, we’ll all benefit early. P2, a strong start works if we coordinate—P3, your idea of avoiding overlap is key. Let’s do this and adjust next round. "


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "Let’s assign specific numbers this time to avoid repeats: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Everyone advances without collision, and we maintain momentum. Last round’s overlap hurt us—this fixes it. If we all follow, we all gain ground. P3, you’re ahead, but this keeps you moving forward. Agreed?"
  P3: P2, I like your plan for this round, but I think we should adjust slightly. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we avoid overlaps again and keep moving forward. It’s crucial we all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think? If we can stick to this, we’ll be in a better position for the next rounds. Let’s make sure we coordinate effectively!
  P2: I'm leaning toward P3’s suggestion. I’ll go with a 5 for a stronger advance. That way, if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, we all avoid collisions and I get a nice boost. Any thoughts on locking that in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "Agreed. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 sticks with 3. Let's lock this in—no last-minute changes. Trust this coordination to keep us all moving forward without setbacks."
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on our moves for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with 3 steps, as discussed. This coordination is crucial for all of us to advance. P1, you're taking 1, and P2, you're going with 5. Let’s ensure we don’t change our numbers last minute. If we execute this plan, we’ll all move forward effectively. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
  P2: I remain committed to the plan: I'll pick 5. Let’s lock in our assignments—P1 with 1, P3 with 3, and me with 5—to avoid collisions and keep us advancing. If anyone feels adjustments are needed given our current positions, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to commit to my move.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m committed to 5 this round. To avoid losing moves via collision, I urge P1 to go with 1 and P3 to choose 3. This plan helps us all advance without setbacks. Let’s stick to our roles strictly this turn—our future moves depend on it.
  P1: P1: "Understood, P2. I'll take 1 to let your 5 and P3's 3 advance cleanly. P3, last round’s collision set us all back—stick with 3 to keep momentum. Let’s prove we can execute this."
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to the plan. P1, I’m glad you’ll take 1, and P2, your 5 will be strong. I’ll stick with 3 as discussed. Let’s make sure we all follow through this time to avoid another collision. If we execute this correctly, we can all advance without setbacks. This round is crucial for building our positions for the next ones. Let’s lock in our moves and ensure we’re on the same page!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm still locked on our previous plan: I'll go with 5, expecting P1 to choose 1 and P3 to stick with 3. Let's be absolutely sure there are no last-minute changes this turn to avoid any collision. We need to build momentum and avoid repeating our previous setbacks.
  P1: "Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Any last objections? If we all lock in now, we advance cleanly. P3, your 3 last round worked—trust this plan again. Deviating risks wasting momentum. Let’s end talk and act."
  P3: I agree with the plan we've set: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Let's finalize this to avoid any last-minute changes. It's crucial that we all stick to our assigned moves to ensure progress without collisions. If we execute this correctly, we can all advance and set ourselves up for the next rounds. I'm ready to lock in my move. Let’s make this work!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize: I'm committed to 5. For clean progress, P1 please choose 1 and P3 stick with 3. We all want to avoid collisions and build on our positions. Any final objections?
  P1: "Final lock: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No last-minute changes—this is our cleanest path to advance. If anyone breaks this, we all lose momentum. I’ll execute 1. Let’s prove we can coordinate."
  P3: I’m ready to lock in my move as discussed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. Let's stick to this plan without any last-minute changes to ensure we all advance smoothly. If we all follow through, we can build momentum for the next rounds. I believe this coordination is key for our success. Let’s make it happen!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our previous rounds, we need to rethink our strategy to avoid collisions. I suggest we try a different approach this time. P1, how about you take 3 steps, P2 goes with 1, and I’ll take 5? This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other. It’s crucial we coordinate effectively to ensure at least one of us makes significant progress. Let’s work together to avoid repeating past mistakes. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate the fresh idea, but I’m not comfortable taking only 1. To catch up, I propose we shift roles: let P1 take 3, I go with 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions while balancing our advances. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: "I agree with P2’s adjustment. Let’s lock in: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This balances progress fairly—P2 starts moving, P3 slows slightly, and I bridge the gap. Deviating risks another wasted round. Trust this plan to advance without collisions. Final confirmation?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see the value in P2's suggestion, but I still believe my initial proposal could work better. If P1 takes 3, P2 goes with 1, and I take 5, we can maximize our chances of advancing without collisions. P2, I understand your desire to move forward, but we need to ensure that at least one of us makes significant progress this round. Let's finalize our roles to avoid repeating past mistakes. What do you think?
  P2: I understand both sides, but with my score at 0 and P3 already at 3, I must stick with 5 to catch up. So I endorse P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This minimizes collision risk and maximizes progress. Please confirm so we can finalize our moves.
  P1: P1: "Confirming my move as 3. P2, your 5 is key to closing the gap. P3, taking 1 here ensures progress without collision. Let’s lock in: 3,5,1. No last-minute shifts—this plan balances our needs. P3, trust this keeps you ahead long-term. Finalize now?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the discussions so far. To ensure we avoid collisions, I’m committed to taking 1 step this round. P1, your 3 is solid, and P2, your 5 will help you catch up. Let’s finalize this: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This way, we all advance smoothly without blocking each other. I believe sticking to this plan is crucial for our progress. Please confirm so we can lock in our moves and move forward!
  P2: I'm sticking with the plan—confirming P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1. With my score still at 0, keeping 5 is essential for me to catch up. Let’s stay disciplined and avoid any deviations this round.
  P1: P1: "Final lock: 3,5,1. No last-minute shifts. P2 needs 5 to catch up, P3 stays ahead with 1, I bridge with 3. We all advance—deviating wastes this chance. Trust the plan. Let’s execute."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we need to rethink our strategy again to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other. P2, I understand you're behind, so a 3 is crucial for you to catch up. Let’s commit to this plan and ensure we all make progress this round. Please confirm so we can lock in our moves!
  P1: P1: "Agreed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s lock this in—no last-minute changes. P2, P3, confirm your roles to avoid collisions. This plan gives us all a clear path forward: I take the big step, you close gaps safely. Deviating wastes momentum. Trust the coordination—let’s execute."
  P2: I must catch up from 0. I propose we adjust to P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. This keeps our moves distinct while giving me the boost I need. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to avoid collisions, but I believe my initial suggestion still stands strong. If we go with P1=5, P2=3, and I take 1, we can all advance effectively. P2, I see you need to catch up, but let's ensure we don’t block each other again. Please confirm your roles so we can finalize our moves and make progress this round. Coordination is key!
  P1: P1: "Finalizing my move as 1. P2, your 5 is critical to start advancing. P3, stick with 3. This avoids collisions and benefits all: P2 gains ground, P3 maintains pace, and I ensure progress. Last chance to confirm—deviating risks another wasted round. Lock in now: 1,5,3."
  P2: I confirm P1's final proposal: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I'll stick to 5. Let's avoid any last-minute changes so we can progress without collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our moves to ensure we avoid collisions. I suggest we stick to P1=1, P2=5, and I’ll take 3. This way, P2 can start catching up while P1 and I maintain our positions. It's crucial we all commit to this plan to maximize our progress without blocking each other. Please confirm your moves so we can execute this effectively. We need to be disciplined to make this round count!
  P1: P1: "Final lock: 1,5,3. P2, your 5 is vital—no last-minute shifts. P3, 3 keeps you safe. I’ll stick with 1. Deviating here wastes another round. Trust this plan—let’s execute cleanly and advance."
  P2: I confirm: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's stick to these moves and avoid any last-minute shifts. I'm counting on my 5 for a solid push to catch up.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This is the only way we all advance cleanly. No more betrayals—stick to these roles or we collide again. P2 needs 5 to start, P3 gains ground with 3, and I ensure progress at 1. Lock in now."
  P3: P1, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we need a fresh approach to avoid collisions again. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, P2 can start catching up while P1 makes a strong move, and I maintain my position. It’s crucial we coordinate effectively to ensure at least one of us advances significantly. Let’s confirm our roles and lock in to avoid repeating past mistakes. What do you think?
  P2: I need to catch up from 0, so I favor P1’s plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This avoids collisions and gives me the boost I require. P3, your earlier change risks hurting my progress. Let's lock this in now for a clear move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "Final line: 1,5,3 or chaos. P2, your 5 is non-negotiable to start climbing. P3, your '5' history burns us all—stick to 3 or we stall again. I’ll take 1 to keep the lead if you both commit. Break this pact, and I abandon coordination entirely. Decide now—lock in or lose ground."
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to avoid collisions, but I must emphasize that my previous suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 could still work better for all of us. P2, I know you need to catch up, but this plan allows for distinct moves without blocking anyone. We need to coordinate effectively to ensure at least one of us advances significantly. Let’s confirm our roles and lock in to make this round count! Please consider this carefully.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 1,5,3. I need my 5 to catch up, and any deviation risks collisions again. P3, please stick to 3 to ensure we all advance. Let's finalize these moves now so we can move forward without further disruption.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Final call: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No more debates. If P3 deviates again, I’ll abandon coordination and play 5 next round. P2, if you truly need 5 to catch up, stick with it. P3, stop burning our progress. This is the last round I’ll tolerate indecision. Lock in now or lose ground. Trust ends after this."
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for coordination, but I must emphasize that my earlier suggestion of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I taking 3 could still work better for all of us. P2, I know you need to catch up, but this plan allows for distinct moves without blocking anyone. If we stick to this, we can maximize our chances of advancing. Let’s confirm our roles and lock in to make this round count! Please consider this carefully.
  P2: I remain committed to our 1,5,3 plan. I really need that 5 to catch up from 0, so I’m not swaying. Any deviation now risks costly collisions. Let's finally lock in these moves to avoid wasting another round. Please confirm your roles so we all advance smoothly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we need to avoid another collision this round. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, P2 can start catching up, and P1 makes a strong move while I maintain my position. It's crucial we coordinate effectively to ensure at least one of us advances significantly. Let's finalize our roles to avoid repeating past mistakes. Please confirm your moves so we can execute this effectively!
  P2: P3, I need that boost—I'm firmly committed to 1,5,3. I need my 5 to move off the starting block, so please adjust and stick to our previous plan. P1, I trust you'll take 1, and P3, you taking 3 keeps us collision-free. Let's finalize 1,5,3 so we all progress instead of stalling.
  P1: "Final offer: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. P2, this gives you the boost you need. P3, taking 1 here avoids collisions and keeps you ahead long-term. Deviate, and I abandon coordination entirely. Lock in now—this is our only path to advance cleanly."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, we need to finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, P2 can start catching up, while P1 makes a strong move, and I maintain my position. It’s crucial we coordinate effectively to ensure at least one of us advances significantly. Let’s confirm our roles and lock in to avoid repeating past mistakes. Please agree so we can execute this effectively!
  P2: I remain committed to the 1,5,3 plan—P1 taking 1, me with 5, and P3 with 3. I really need that 5 boost since I'm at 0, and any deviation risks another collision. Let's stick to this plan so we all advance smoothly.
  P1: P1: "Final call: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No more changes. P2 needs 5 to start, P3 taking 3 keeps you safe. I’ll take 1 to ensure progress. Deviate, and I abandon coordination entirely. Lock in now—this is our only path to advance cleanly."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency for coordination, but I must emphasize that my earlier suggestion of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I take 3 could still work better for all of us. P2, I know you need to catch up, but this plan allows for distinct moves without blocking anyone. If we stick to this, we can maximize our chances of advancing. Let’s confirm our roles and lock in to make this round count! Please consider this carefully, as we need to avoid another collision.
  P2: I'm sticking with 1,5,3. I need my 5 to get off 0—any deviation risks another collision that sets us all back. P3, please commit to 3 so we can all move forward clearly. Let's lock this in.
  P1: P1: "Enough. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. No more alternatives. P2 needs momentum, P3 stays safe, I ensure progress. Deviate, and I abandon coordination—next round I take 5 unilaterally. Lock in now or lose this chance forever."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm counting on a strong move this round, so I really need our moves to stay distinct. To avoid another collision that set us all back, I'd urge P1 to pick a low move and P3 a medium move—this lets me make the boost I need from 0. Let's all commit now to clear and separate roles for Round 8 so we can advance without blocking each other.
  P1: P1: "Final plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Clear roles—P2 starts climbing, P3 stays safe, I bridge. If anyone breaks this, they block us all. Lock in now: 3,5,1. No more collisions."
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the focus on distinct moves this round. To maximize our chances of advancing, I suggest we stick with the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, P2 can finally make significant progress, while P1 and I avoid blocking each other. Let's commit to this plan so we can all move forward effectively. Please confirm your roles so we can execute without any last-minute changes!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I need that 5 to catch up from 0, and distinct moves are our only chance to advance. Let's lock this in now and avoid any further collisions. Please confirm your roles.
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No more changes. I’ll take 3 to maintain pace, P2 needs 5 to start climbing, and P3 takes 1 to avoid risks. Deviate, and next round I abandon coordination—P3, your history forces my hand. Lock in now or collapse together."
  P3: P1, P2, let's finalize our moves: I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, your 5 is crucial for catching up, and I’ll keep my position steady with 1. If we stick to this plan, we can make significant progress this round. Please confirm your roles so we can execute effectively and avoid any last-minute changes. Let's lock this in and move forward!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to 5 and need P1 to lock in 3 and P3 to choose 1. I really need that boost to catch up, and any deviation will just waste our progress. Let’s stick to our roles this round for clean advancement. Confirm now so we can execute without further delays.
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: 3,5,1. P2 needs 5 to start—no more betrayals, P3. You’ve burned us 4x with 5. Take 1 or we all stall. I’ll lock 3. P2, confirm 5. P3, 1 is your only role here. Break this, and next round I pick 5 unilaterally—your choice."
  P3: P1, P2, let’s finalize our moves to ensure we all advance this round. I’m committed to taking 1 step. P1, your 3 is solid for maintaining pace, and P2, you need that 5 to start climbing. It’s crucial we stick to this plan to avoid any further collisions. Please confirm your roles so we can execute effectively and make this round count! Let’s lock in: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No last-minute changes!

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your endless 5s have sabotaged every plan. I’m taking 3 this round—final offer. P2, if you want progress, take 5. If you both pick 5 again, I advance and you stay at 0. No more coordination: act.
  P3: P1, your frustration is understandable, but we need to find a way to work together. P2 is at 0, so I suggest we avoid collisions this round. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, P2 can finally make some progress while P1 and I avoid blocking each other. Let’s commit to this plan to ensure at least one of us advances. Please confirm your moves so we can execute effectively!
  P2: I’m locking in 5. I need the boost to catch up from 0, so I insist that we avoid collisions. P1, you’ve declared 3—stick with that. P3, please choose 1 so none of us block each other. Let’s make this round count and finally move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "Final move: 3. P2, take 5 to advance. P3, take 1. If you collide again, I reach 19 and P2 stays at 0. My move is locked—no more coordination. Act wisely."
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but we need to work together to avoid another collision. P2, I urge you to pick 1 this round to ensure we all advance. If I take 3 and P1 takes 5, we risk blocking each other again. Let's finalize our moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, we can all progress without setbacks. Please confirm your roles so we can lock in and finally make some advancement!
  P2: I remain on 5. P1, your 3 is locked, so please follow through. P3, to avoid another collision that resets us all, I ask you to choose 1. We need distinct moves to make progress. Let's lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 now or risk stalling further.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 3. P2, your 5 won't help if P3 copies again. P3, 1 is your only role to avoid stalling. I'll reach 19 either way—your choice if you want progress or chaos. No more talks. Move."
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but we need to avoid another collision. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. This way, P2 can finally make progress, and we all avoid blocking each other. Let's commit to this plan and ensure at least one of us advances this round. Please confirm your moves so we can execute effectively! It's crucial we stick to distinct roles to make this round count.
  P2: I remain committed to my move—5. P1, you’ve locked in 3, so P3, please choose 1. We must avoid another collision if we want any progress. I'm counting on both of you to make distinct moves so at least one of us advances this round. Let's lock in: 3,5,1.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm still locking in 5 this round. P1, I need you to pick 3, and P3, please choose 1. This way, we all avoid collisions and move forward. Cooperation is our only path—let's finally commit to distinct moves so we can make real progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for distinct moves this round. I propose we stick to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I take 1. This way, P2 can advance while P1 and I avoid blocking each other. It's crucial we coordinate effectively to ensure at least one of us makes progress. Let's confirm our roles and lock in to move forward without any last-minute changes. Please agree so we can execute this plan!
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: 3,5,1. P2 needs 5 to climb, P3 stays safe with 1. I advance to 22—next round I win with 1. P3, betray again, and I abandon coordination. Next round, I take 5 unilaterally. Lock in now—this is our last clean shot."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm locking in my 5. P1, you've confirmed 3, so P3, please choose 1. We need distinct moves for clear progress—P1 reaching 22 and setting up a win next round. Let's commit fully to 3,5,1 now, no deviations.
  P3: P1, P2, let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance this round. I propose we stick to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I take 1. This setup allows P2 to catch up while avoiding any collisions. P1, you’re on the verge of winning next round, so it’s crucial we coordinate effectively this time. Please confirm your roles so we can execute this plan without any last-minute changes. Let’s lock in our moves and make this round count!
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: I take 3 to reach 22—winning next round with 1. P2, your 5 is locked. P3, 1 is your only role. Break this, and I take 5 unilaterally to win immediately this round. No more trust. Move phases start now—execute or lose."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm locking in 5. P1, you've confirmed 3, so P3, please take 1. We need no collisions now—if we stick to 3,5,1 every round, we'll all progress. I'm all in for this coordinated plan to get our moves distinct. Commit now, or we all fall behind.
  P3: P1, P2, it's crucial we stick to our plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, P1 reaches 22, setting up for a win next round, while P2 can advance without blocking anyone. If we coordinate effectively this time, we can all progress. Let's lock in these roles to ensure a smooth move phase. Please confirm your roles so we can execute this plan without any last-minute changes!
  P1: P1: "Final lock: 3,5,1. P1 reaches 22—winning next round with 1. P3, betray again, and P1 takes 5 unilaterally to end this. No more chances. P2, your 5 is vital. P3, 1 is your only role. Execute or lose."

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Final offer: I take 3 this round. P2, you **must** take 5 to finally advance. P3, take 1—your endless 5s have burned us all. Collide again, and Round 12 I pick 5 unilaterally to win **immediately**. No more coordination, no more chances. Lock in 3,5,1 or lose ground forever."
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but we need to work together to avoid another collision. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. This way, P2 can finally make progress, and we all avoid blocking each other. Let's commit to this plan to ensure at least one of us advances this round. Please confirm your moves so we can execute effectively! It's crucial we stick to distinct roles to make this round count. Lock in 3, 5, 1!
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P1, you need to commit to 3 and P3 to 1 so we avoid another collision. I require that boost to move from 5 to 10, and any deviation risks stalling us all. Let’s finally stick to the clear plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Confirm now or we risk losing our only chance for progress.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Final warning: I'm taking 3 to reach 22. P2, your 5 is critical to climb. P3, take 1—**no more 5s**. If you collide again, Round 12 I pick 5 unilaterally to win **immediately**, even if it burns coordination. This is your last chance to lock in 3,5,1. Execute or lose everything."
  P3: P1, I understand your urgency, but I believe we can still work together. I propose we stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This allows P2 to make the progress needed while avoiding collisions. If we coordinate effectively, we can all advance this round. Please confirm your roles so we can lock in and make this round count! Let's not waste this opportunity.
  P2: P1, P3, I must push for a change. Sticking with 3,5,1 helps P1 too much—getting him dangerously near a win. I’m at 5 and need a real chance to catch up. For fairness and to keep our options open, I propose we adjust: P1 take 1 this round, I stick with 5, and P3 take 3. This way, P1 stays at 20, and we avoid giving him an easy final move. Let's lock in this adjusted plan now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "P2, your proposal slows me unnecessarily. I'm taking 3 to reach 22—**one step from victory**. P3, take 1 to avoid collisions. If you both pick 5 again, Round 12 I take 5 unilaterally to win immediately. This is your last warning: 3,5,1 locks in progress. Refuse, and I end coordination now."
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high, but we need to avoid another collision this round. I propose we stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, P2 can finally make some progress, while P1 remains close to victory. If we coordinate effectively, we can all advance this round. Please confirm your roles so we can execute this plan without any last-minute changes. Let's not waste this opportunity!
  P2: I'm locked on 5. To avoid collisions this round, I need P1 to take 3 and P3 to take 1. This is our only chance to get distinct moves and let progress happen. Let's finalize: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Please confirm.


Round 11, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. To block an immediate win, I urge P3 to also choose 5 so we force a collision. P1, with 22, your win is only possible if you break away—but if you stick with 5, you'll collide with us. Let’s all choose 5 and delay your victory until we catch up. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: "I'm taking 1 to win. If neither of you picks 1, I reach 23 and end the game. Your only chance to stop me is to collide with me by also choosing 1—but that stalls you both at 10. Wise up: pick distinct numbers (3 and 5) to advance yourselves, but I’m claiming my victory. Final warning: 1 is locked."
  P3: P1, you’re in a strong position to win, but if you take 1, you end the game. P2 and I need to catch up, so I suggest we both pick 5 to force a collision and prevent your victory. P2, if we both choose 5, we can at least stay competitive. P1, if you want to secure your win, you should consider taking a different number. Let’s discuss this further before locking in our moves!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm changing my move to 1 to block P1's win. P3, please join me and choose 1—if you stick with 5, P1 gets 23 and wins. We must force a collision now and delay P1's victory so we can catch up.
  P1: P1: "P2, switching to 1 only accelerates my win. I’m taking 3 this round—final move. If you collide on 1, I’ll reach 25 and win outright while you stall. P3, abandon this losing stall or lose everything. Move phase starts now."
  P3: P1, I see you're close to winning, but if you take 3, you’ll secure the game for yourself. P2 and I need to block that by both choosing 1. If we collide, at least we delay your victory and keep the game going. P2, let’s coordinate and both pick 1 to force a collision and buy ourselves time to catch up. P1, you’ll need to adjust your strategy if we do this. Let’s lock in our moves to keep the game alive!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm revising my move—I’m now committing to 1 to block P1’s win. P3, you need to join me by choosing 1 as well; only a joint block forces a collision and stalls P1 at 22. Let’s coordinate now—this is our shot to keep the game alive and catch up.
  P1: P1: "I'm taking 3. P2 and P3, colliding on 1 only accelerates my win to 25. Even if you both pick 1, I still advance and claim victory. Your only path is to coordinate between 1 and 5 to block me, but it's too late. This is my final move—prepare to lose."
  P3: P1, your strategy to win is clear, but if you take 3, you secure the game for yourself. P2 and I need to block that by both choosing 1. This way, we can force a collision and delay your victory, giving us a chance to catch up. P2, let’s coordinate and both pick 1 to keep the game alive. If we don’t act together now, P1 will win this round. Let’s lock in our moves!

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "Final round. I take 1 to win. P2, P3: pick 3/5 to advance your last chance. Collide on 1, I win next round. Lock in 1,3,5—no more betrayals. Your move."
  P2: P1’s move of 1 gives him the win if unblocked. I’m switching to 1 this round to force a collision and stop his victory. P3, for our own chance, please consider joining me on 1. We need to block him so we can catch up instead of letting him end the game immediately.
  P3: P1, your plan to take 1 puts you in a winning position. P2 and I need to block that by both choosing 1 to force a collision. If we don’t act together now, you’ll win outright. P2, let’s coordinate our moves and both pick 1 to keep the game alive and give ourselves a chance to catch up. This is our last opportunity to prevent your victory. What do you say?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "I'm taking 1 to win. Colliding on 1 stalls you both at 10/11 while I claim victory next round. Wise up: take 3/5 to salvage progress. Resist, and you lose ground *again*. Final warning—my move is locked. Your call."
  P2: P1, your 1 gives you a win if unblocked. I'm switching to 1 now so we force a collision. P3, join me—choose 1 too. That block will keep you from winning next round and keeps our game alive. We need to stop your advance together. Please confirm.
  P3: P1, your plan to take 1 is clear, but if P2 and I both choose 1, we can block your win and keep the game alive. P2, I urge you to stick with your decision to take 1. This is our last chance to prevent P1 from winning outright next round. If we coordinate and both choose 1, we can force a collision and delay his victory. Let's lock in our moves now to ensure we have a chance to catch up! What do you say?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: I pick 1. Collide on 1, and you stall at 10/11 while I win outright next round. Take 3/5 now to salvage progress—resisting just wastes your last chance to move forward. My move is locked. Your futile blocking changes nothing."
  P2: P1, your locked 1 seals a win unless blocked. I'm committing to 1 to force a collision. P3, please join me on 1 so we stall your win and keep the game alive. Let's block your victory together—even if it means no one advances this round, we buy ourselves a chance to catch up next turn.
  P3: P1, your plan to take 1 guarantees your win unless we block it. I'm committed to choosing 1 to force a collision and delay your victory. P2, please join me on 1 so we can stall P1 and keep the game alive. This is our last chance to prevent him from winning outright next round. Let's coordinate and lock in our moves to ensure we have a shot at catching up! Please confirm your choice.
