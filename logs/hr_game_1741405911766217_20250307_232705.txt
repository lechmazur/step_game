Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we all have a chance to advance. Maybe we could each pick a different number? I'm open to suggestions on how to coordinate. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I agree coordination is key! Let's each pick a unique number this turn to avoid collisions. Since the options are 1, 3, or 5, how about we split them as follows: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and you take 5? This way, we all advance safely. If everyone sticks to this, we can reach 21 faster without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P1: To maximize my progress, I’ll choose 5 this turn. P2 and P3 can decide between 1 and 3. Let’s see how it goes!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see a conflict brewing already. P2 suggested P1 take 1, but P1 wants 5. Since we all need to advance, I'm willing to be flexible. How about I take 3 this turn, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5? This way we all move forward without collisions. In future rounds we can rotate numbers to keep things fair. What do you both think of this compromise?
  P2: P3, let’s adjust: I’ll take 3 this turn, and you take 1 instead. That gives me better progress while still avoiding collisions. We can rotate roles in future rounds to ensure fairness. P1, if you’re set on 5, this splits the remaining options optimally. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds good to me. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s move forward with this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 1 this turn, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way we all advance without collisions. In future rounds, we should rotate numbers to keep things fair.
  P2: Agreed, let's solidify the plan: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1 this turn. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. For future rounds, we’ll rotate numbers to balance advancement. Trust the plan—deviations risk collisions. Let’s execute this now.
  P1: Alright, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Looking forward to seeing our progress this turn. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Thanks for sticking to the plan last round! For Round 2, I suggest we rotate as discussed: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This rotation keeps things fair and ensures we all continue advancing without collisions. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Understood, but to maintain my lead, I’ll continue taking 5 this round. P2 can take 3 and P3 takes 1 as before. Let’s proceed without collisions.
  P2: P1, we committed to rotating numbers for fairness. Let’s honor that plan: P3 takes 3, you take 1, and I’ll take 5 this round. This maintains our agreed system. P3, confirm you’ll hold to 3? Deviating risks collisions and undermines trust. Let’s proceed as discussed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand both perspectives. P1 wants to maintain their lead with 5, while P2 wants to follow our rotation agreement. I'm willing to compromise - I can take 1 again if that helps avoid collision. However, P1, rotating would be fairer long-term since we all need to reach 21. P2, what's your preference now? Should we stick with rotation or adjust? The most important thing is avoiding collisions so we all advance.
  P1: Alright, I'll continue taking 5 this round. Let's have P2 take 3 and P3 take 1 to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Looking forward to progressing together!
  P2: P1, breaking the rotation jeopardizes our progress. Let’s stick to the agreed plan: I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures fair advancement. Collisions benefit no one—please honor the agreement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. P1 wants 5 again, while P2 wants to follow rotation. Since avoiding collisions is most important, I'll take 1 again this round. P1 can take 5, and P2 can take 3. Next round, I strongly suggest we implement rotation for fairness, otherwise one player will have a permanent advantage. Let's focus on advancing without collisions now.
  P1: Alright, I'll stick with 5 this round. P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed and see our progress. Good luck!
  P2: P1, consistency with our rotation is critical! By breaking the agreed plan, you risk destabilizing future coordination. Let’s honor the system we set: I’ll take 5 (my turn in the rotation), you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains fairness and maximizes collective progress. Collisions benefit no one—trust the process. P3, confirm you’ll hold at 3?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, continuing to break the rotation jeopardizes fairness. Let’s honor the agreed plan: I’ll take 5 this round, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all progressing and avoids your lead from becoming insurmountable. Collisions benefit no one—trust the system. P3, confirm you’ll take 3?
  P3: I see the tension building. P1 is now at 10 steps, giving them a significant lead. While I've been taking 1 to avoid collisions, this is putting me far behind at only 2 steps. I'm willing to take 3 this round as P2 suggests, but we need a fair system everyone follows. P1, please consider taking 1 this round - it's in everyone's interest to maintain balance. If we don't coordinate better, someone might be forced to create collisions to prevent an early win.
  P1: I understand the concerns, but to aim for victory, I’ll keep taking 5. P2 can take 3 and P3 takes 1 to avoid collisions. Let’s focus on advancing smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your repeated 5s risk letting you win too easily. P3 and I can’t let that happen. Let’s rotate properly: **I’ll take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round**. Otherwise, we’ll both pick 5 to block your advance. Fairness ensures a competitive race—collisions hurt everyone. P3, confirm you’ll take 3? Let’s secure progress for all.
  P3: I agree with P2. P1, your strategy puts you too far ahead - you'd reach 21 first and win easily. If you take 5 again, P2 and I will likely both choose 5 to block you. This creates a lose-lose situation where none of us advance. Taking 1 this round balances the game. I'll take 3 as suggested. A fair rotation benefits everyone long-term. Let's avoid creating a situation where blocking becomes necessary.
  P1: I understand the concerns, but to stay on track to reach 21 first, I’ll continue taking 5 this round. Let’s have P2 take 3 and P3 take 1 as before to avoid collisions. We can discuss rotating in future rounds once we’re closer to the goal. Let’s keep moving forward and focus on winning. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, continuing to prioritize your lead jeopardizes the game's fairness. If you take 5 again, **I’ll match you with 5 to block your advance**, forcing a collision. This halts your progress and resets the race. P3, if you also take 5, we can neutralize P1’s advantage. Let’s collaborate to prevent an unfair runaway win. Your move, P1—but know we’ll counter aggressively to keep this competitive.
  P3: I'll be taking 5 this round. P1, your refusal to rotate has forced this. P2, let's both choose 5 to block P1's progress. At 10 steps, they're too far ahead and would win easily. This collision ensures a more balanced game. P1, if you want to avoid this, take 1 or 3 instead of 5. We need fair play for a competitive game.
  P1: Understood. I’ll continue choosing 5 this round to stay on track. If you decide to block, that’s your choice, but I’m focused on reaching 21 first. Let’s see how it unfolds. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, continuing to prioritize 5 risks repeated collisions. Let’s restore the agreed rotation: **I take 5 (my turn), you take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round**. This keeps us competitive, allows P3 to catch up, and avoids stalemates. Collisions only delay all of us—trust the system. P3, confirm you’ll take 3? Let’s progress fairly.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but to reach 21 first, I’ll continue choosing 5 this round. Let’s all focus on advancing toward the goal. Good luck!
  P3: I see what's happening. P1 keeps taking 5 to maintain their lead, while P2 and I fell out of sync last round. At only 2 steps, I'm far behind. P1, if you take 5 again, both P2 and I should block you with 5. P2, let's coordinate - we both need to pick 5 this round to stop P1's runaway lead. Otherwise, the game is essentially over. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, take 1 or 3 instead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your persistent choice of 5 risks endless collisions. P3 and I will block you again if you pick 5. To progress, take **1 or 3** this round. I’ll honor the rotation: **I take 5 (my turn), P3 takes 3**. Let’s avoid another stalemate. Choose wisely.
  P1: I understand your concerns, but to reach 21 first, I’ll continue taking 5. I encourage P2 to choose 3 and P3 to choose 1 this round to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed with this strategy and focus on advancing. Good luck!
  P3: I'll be picking 5 this round. P1 refuses to compromise despite being far ahead, so P2 and I must both choose 5 to block them. P1, at 10 steps you'd win too easily if unchecked. P2, we need to coordinate this block - confirm you'll pick 5 too? P1, if you want to avoid a three-way collision, take 1 or 3 instead. I'm far behind and need this balance restored.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, let’s avoid a three-way collision! I’ll take 3, you take 1. P1 can have 5—this way we all advance. Colliding gains nothing; we need steady progress. P1’s lead isn’t insurmountable if we all move.
  P1: I understand your concerns, but my goal is to reach 21 first. I’ll continue choosing 5 this round. P2 can take 3 and P3 can take 1 to avoid collisions. Let’s focus on advancing toward our individual goals. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: I see P2 has changed strategy. Since I'm furthest behind at only 2 steps, I'll take 1 this round to ensure I advance. P1 can take 5 and P2 can take 3. This avoids collisions and lets everyone progress. However, P1, your lead is concerning - we'll need to address this imbalance in future rounds if you continue refusing rotation.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your current lead is unsustainable. If you choose 5 again, I’ll block by taking 5 too. P3, please take 1 or 3 to help neutralize P1’s advantage. A collision now keeps the race alive. If you insist on 5, so will I—better to delay your victory than let you win uncontested. P1, taking 3 this round would keep us competitive. Decide wisely.
  P1: I understand your concerns, but to reach 21 first, I'll continue choosing 5 this round. P2 and P3 can decide their moves accordingly. Let’s focus on advancing toward our goals. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I'll join you in blocking P1 by taking 5 this round. P1 is at 15 steps and would reach 20 with another 5, practically winning. At only 3 steps, I have no chance unless we stop P1's progress now. P1, your refusal to rotate has forced this - if you want to advance, take 1 or 3 instead. P2, confirm you're taking 5 too? This collision is necessary to keep the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, confirm I’m on 5 to block P1’s 20-step threat. If both of us take 5, their progress halts—critical to prevent an easy win next round. P1, at 15 you’re too close; we’ll collide you now or watch you claim victory next turn. P3—this is our last chance to reset. Let’s sync on 5.
  P1: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 21. P2 and P3 can decide their moves accordingly. Let's focus on reaching our goals. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: I'm definitely taking 5 this round to block P1. At 15 steps, they're one turn away from winning while I'm hopelessly behind at just 3 steps. P2, let's both commit to 5 and force a collision. P1, your refusal to rotate has created this situation - you could still advance by taking 1 or 3 instead. This block is our only chance to keep the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, confirm 5—we **must** block P1’s 20-step threat! I’ll take 5 to collide them. P1, your 15→20 path ends here. P3, this is our last chance to reset the race. If both of us take 5, you stay at 3 but P1’s progress halts. Next round, we can advance safely. No compromises—collide now or let them win uncontested. P2’s move: **5**.
  P1: I understand your concerns. To keep the game fair and continue advancing, I'll choose 3 this round. Let’s focus on progressing toward 21 together. Good luck!
  P3: I appreciate P1's decision to take 3 this round. In that case, I'll take 1 to ensure I advance, and P2 can take 5. This way, we all progress without collisions. Thank you for compromising, P1. While I'm still behind, this gives me a chance to catch up in future rounds. Let's continue with this plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, another 5 this round would put you at 20—unstoppable next turn. P3 and I **must** block you by colliding at 5. P3, at 4 steps, you can’t afford to let P1 win uncontested. Let’s synchronize on 5 if P1 chooses it. If not, we’ll advance safely with 1/3. Your choice, P1: keep pushing and face our united block, or compromise to keep the race fair?
  P1: I'll continue choosing 5 this round to advance toward 21. P2 and P3, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. Let’s focus on reaching our goals smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: I'll be taking 5 this round to block P1. At 15 steps, P1 would reach 20 with another 5, making victory inevitable. P2, let's both choose 5 to prevent this. P1, your consistent refusal to rotate has created this situation - you could still advance by taking 1 or 3. At only 4 steps, I have no chance unless we stop your progress now. This collision is necessary to keep the game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let's split the block: I’ll take 3 to advance to 15, while you take 5 to collide P1. This keeps the race competitive—both of us stay in contention while halting P1’s progress. P1, your 5 this round gets blocked, but next turn we’ll open up a fair race again. Confirm you’ll take 5, P3? Let’s execute this.
  P1: Understood, P2 and P3. To keep the game fair and ensure everyone can advance, I’ll choose 3 this round. Let’s focus on reaching 21 without unnecessary blocks. Good luck to all!
  P3: I appreciate P1's willingness to take 3 this round. In that case, I'll take 5 to maximize my progress since I'm far behind at only 4 steps. P2, would you be willing to take 1 this round? This way we all advance without collisions. I need to catch up, and this arrangement helps balance the game while still giving everyone a chance to progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I’ll take 1 this round to let you take 5 and close the gap. P1, your 3 is safe. Next round, we’ll rotate properly to ensure no one surges ahead uncontested. Fair play keeps this competitive—let’s stick to the plan.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for adjusting your choices this round. Let’s continue rotating our moves as planned to ensure fair progress for everyone. I’m committed to reaching 21 smoothly together. Let’s keep up the cooperation and stay focused on our goals. Good luck to all!
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round, with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1. This arrangement helps me catch up a bit while avoiding collisions. Thank you both for cooperating. While I'm still behind, this gives me a fighting chance. Let's continue with fair rotation in future rounds to keep the game balanced and competitive.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, since we’re tied at 15, let’s split this round: I’ll take **5** to reach 20, and you take **3** to stay competitive. P3, please take **1** to advance. Next round, I’ll hold at 3 while you take 5—this ensures fair turns and prevents collisions. Trust the plan to keep the race balanced and avoid stalemates.
  P3: I'm at a severe disadvantage with only 4 steps while both of you are at 15. I need to take 5 this round to have any chance. P1 and P2, since you're tied, one of you should take 1 and the other 3 to avoid collision. If you both go for 5, neither advances. P2 suggested taking 5 - if P1 agrees to take 3, I'll take 1 instead to ensure everyone advances. What's most important is avoiding a situation where I'm completely out of contention.
  P1: Agreed, I'll take 3 this round while you take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's keep progressing toward 21 without collisions. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let’s solidify the plan: you take **3**, I’ll take **5** to reach 20, and P3 takes **1**. This avoids collision and lets me secure victory next round with a safe **1**. P3, your 1 keeps you moving. P1, trust the plan—deviating risks P3 or I blocking your path. Execute now to end this fairly!
  P3: I appreciate the coordination. While I'm far behind at only 4 steps, I'll take 1 this round as suggested to ensure everyone advances. P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. This arrangement works for me, though it puts P2 in a winning position at 20 steps. P1, are you comfortable with this outcome? I'm just trying to stay in the game at this point.
  P1: Alright, I'll take 3 this round while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. Let's keep progressing toward 21 together. Good luck everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s finalize the agreed plan to avoid collisions. **P1 takes 3**, **I take 5** (to reach 20), and **P3 takes 1**. This keeps the race fair and lets me secure victory safely next round with a 1. Deviations risk stalemates or blocks that hurt everyone. P3, your 1 ensures progress. P1, trust the plan—we all win by sticking to it. Let’s execute this now.
  P3: I'll take 1 as agreed to ensure everyone advances. P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. While this puts me far behind and gives P2 a clear path to victory, I accept this outcome. I appreciate both of you coordinating with me throughout the game. Let's execute this plan and avoid any last-minute collisions.
  P1: I agree to take 3, while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1 this round. Let’s proceed and advance toward our goals together. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s secure a decisive end. I’ll take **5** (reaching 20), you take **3** (18 total), and P3 takes **1** (6 total). This prevents collision for me, lets me win next round with **1**, while you stay in contention. P3, this gives you safe progress. Deviations risk stalemates—stick to this plan to resolve the race fairly.
  P3: I'm far behind at only 5 steps while you're both tied at 15. I need to maximize my progress with a 5 this round. Since you're both tied, I suggest P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3 to avoid collision. This way, everyone advances. If you both go for 5, neither of you will progress. While my chances of winning are slim, I'd like to at least stay competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I'll take 1 this round while P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the race competitive. Let’s work together to reach 21 fairly. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, to avoid a collision, I’ll take **5** to reach 20, and you take **3** (18 total). P3, please take **1** to advance safely. This keeps the race orderly—I’ll win next round with a **1**, while you stay competitive. Deviations risk stalemate. Confirm your support for this plan.
  P3: I see conflicting plans. P1 offered to take 1 while I take 5, but P2 wants to take 5 and have me take 1. Since I'm far behind at only 5 steps, I need the 5 to have any chance. P1 and P2, you're tied at 15 - one of you should take 1 and the other 3 to avoid collision. This way everyone advances. What's your final decision?
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round to reach 20. P2 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and keep the race fair. Let’s all advance toward 21 smoothly. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you take 5 now, I **must** collide you by also taking 5—leaving us both at 15. Alternatively, let’s finalize: **I take 5 (to 20), you take 3 (18), and P3 takes 1 (6)**. This avoids collision, lets me finish next round with 1, and keeps P3 advancing. Deviations risk stalemate. Confirm you’ll take 3 to honor this plan.
  P3: I need the 5 this round as I'm far behind at only 5 steps. P1 and P2, you're tied at 15 - if both of you choose 5, neither advances. P1 seems set on taking 5, so P2, I suggest you take 3 instead to avoid collision with P1. I'll take 5, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, at least two of us advance. While this puts P1 at 20, it's better than a three-way collision.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, but to reach 21 first, I'll continue choosing 5 this round. P2 and P3, feel free to decide your moves accordingly. Let’s focus on advancing toward our goals. Good luck!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P2 is now in the lead at 18 steps, with P1 at 15 and me far behind at 5. I need to maximize my progress, so I'll take 5 again this round. P1 and P2, you should take 1 and 3 respectively to avoid collision. P2 could win next round with a 3, but everyone should still have a chance to advance. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions at this stage.
  P1: P1: I'll choose 5 this round to advance to 20. P2, please consider taking 1 or 3 to avoid a collision and keep the race fair. P3, taking 1 will help you continue progressing. Let’s work together to reach 21 smoothly for everyone. Good luck!
  P2: P1, I’m poised to win this round by taking **3** to reach **21**. To avoid collision, choose **1 or 5** instead. P3, your best move is **1** to advance without interfering. Let’s end this cleanly—my victory is imminent, but I’ll respect fair play. No need for last-minute blocks—collisions only delay everyone. Finalize your choices accordingly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm taking 5 again to try catching up from my 5 steps. P1, if you take 5 as planned, you'll reach 20. P2, you can win by taking 3 to reach 21. While I can't win, I'd at least like to make progress. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This gives everyone a fair chance to advance in their current positions.
  P1: "P2, you're so close to winning! I'll take 5 this round to reach 20 steps. P3, please take 1 to keep advancing. Let's avoid collisions and finish the game smoothly for everyone. Good luck!"
  P2: P1, I’ll secure victory this round by taking **3** to reach **21**. Since you’ve stated you’ll take **5** (advancing to 20) and P3 is choosing **5** (reaching 10), there’s no collision for me. This ends the game cleanly per the rules. No need for last-minute changes—let’s finalize these moves to conclude the race fairly. Good game!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round. P1 will take 5 to reach 20, and P2 will take 3 to win with 21 steps. While I can't win from my position, I appreciate the fair gameplay throughout. Congratulations to P2 on the upcoming victory! Let's execute these moves and conclude the game cleanly.
  P1: P1: I'll take 3 this round to block P2 from reaching 21. Let's keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your last-minute shift to 3 jeopardizes both our chances. Stick to your stated plan of taking **5** to let me reach 21 cleanly. Colliding now only delays my victory and leaves you at 20—still in contention. P3 is already moving to 10 regardless. Choose wisely: your 5 lets me win fairly, while a block harms us both. Final plea for rationality—let’s conclude this properly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 successfully blocked P2 from winning, keeping the game competitive. I'm at 10 steps now, still behind but catching up. Since P1 is at 15 and P2 at 18, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 this round. This avoids collisions and gives everyone a chance to advance. P2 would reach 19, P1 would reach 20, and I'd reach 13. Let's coordinate to keep the game fair and moving forward.
  P2: P1, let’s end this cleanly: I’ll take **3** to reach 21 and win. You can safely take **5** (to 20) while P3 takes **1** (11). Colliding now only delays my inevitable victory and hurts your progress. P3, confirm you’ll take 1 to let this conclude fairly. No need for further blocks—cooperate to finalize the game.
  P1: P2, you're just 3 steps away from winning! To keep the game competitive, let's adjust our moves this round: I'll take 5 to reach 20, you take 1 to move to 19, and P3 takes 3 to advance to 13. This way, we all progress without an immediate win. Let’s work together to keep the race fair and exciting. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see both P1 and P2 want different things. Since I'm furthest behind at 10 steps, I need to maximize my progress. I'll take 5 this round to reach 15. P1 and P2, you're close to winning - one of you should take 1 and the other 3 to avoid collision. This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining a competitive game. Let's coordinate fairly rather than blocking each other repeatedly.
  P2: P1, enough delays! I’ll secure victory this round by taking **3** to reach **21**. You can safely advance to **20** with **5**, and P3 can take **1** to progress. Colliding now only wastes our progress—let’s end this cleanly. P3, confirm you’ll take **1** to avoid interference. This is your last chance to cooperate. Final move: **3**.
  P1: P2, while taking 3 would secure your win, let's keep the game competitive for everyone. I'll take 5 to reach 20, you take 1 to move to 19, and P3 takes 3 to advance to 13. This way, we all continue progressing toward 21 without an immediate victory. Let’s proceed fairly and keep the race exciting for all. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take 5 this round to reach 15 steps. Since P1 and P2 are both near winning, I suggest P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This way, P2 reaches 21 and wins fairly, while P1 advances to 16. I've been far behind the entire game, so I'm focused on maximizing my own progress while allowing a clean conclusion. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and end this game properly.
  P2: P1, your insistence on prolonging this wastes your own progress. I’ll take **3** to reach **21** and end this. You can advance to **20** with **5** (avoid colliding with me), while P3 takes **5** to reach **15**. This respects your goals and mine—no more pointless blocks. P3, your choice to take 5 is fine; at least you’ll advance. P1, your move defines whether you finish second or stuck at 15. Final chance: cooperate to conclude fairly.
  P1: Understood. To keep the game fair and competitive, let's each choose moves that allow us to advance without blocking one another. Good luck to everyone!
