Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. We all advance this round.
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: Okay, I'll take 3 in this round.  Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the same strategy: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This way, we all avoid collisions and keep progressing efficiently. Consistency benefits everyone.
  P3: Okay, sounds good.  Same moves as last round then.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 3 again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 1.  Let's keep this going smoothly.
  P2: Sounds good.  Sticking with 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Continuing the same plan ensures we all progress without collisions. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let's maintain efficiency and avoid unnecessary risks. Consistency benefits everyone.
  P2: Sounds good, sticking with 3.  Let's keep this pattern going.
  P3: Sounds good, sticking with 1.  Let's keep this pattern going so we all make progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sticking to the plan ensures we all progress. Any deviation risks collisions and stalls everyone. Trust the process for mutual benefit.
  P2: Sounds good, sticking with 3.  Let's keep this pattern going.
  P3: Sounds good, I'll stick with 1.  Let's keep this up.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm switching to 5 this round.  P1, if you stick to the plan, you'll lose. P2, if you want a chance to win, you need to switch too.  Let's see who's actually strategic.
  P1: P3, switching to 5 only helps P2 by stalling both of us. If we collide, P2 advances uncontested to 12. Let's all stick to our original plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This way, *everyone* progresses. P2, if you deviate now, you risk collision too. Trust the strategy that's worked for three rounds—sabotage only hands victory to others.
  P2: P3 is right, the current plan guarantees P1 the win. I'll go for 5 this round.  P1, if you stick with 5 we both lose. Let's see what you do.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're only worried about me getting ahead, not P2.  P2, if I go for 1 and you go for 5, we *both* have a better chance against P1.  He's too far ahead for us to cooperate with him at this point. Let's be smart about this. I'm going for 1.
  P1: P2, think strategically: If you take 5 and I do too, we *both* stall at 15 and 9. P3 takes 1 and gains nothing. But if you take 3, you jump to 12 while I reach 20. Next round, you can block me by colliding—but *only* if you’re close enough. Stalling now kills your momentum. P3 is irrelevant at 3 steps. Don’t let him trick you into mutual destruction. Take 3, grow your lead over P3, and keep options open. I’ll stick to 5 unless forced.
  P2: P1, I understand your reasoning, but at this point, my best chance is to prevent you from winning.  I'll move to 5.  P3, if you're serious about beating P1, you *must* take 1.  Don't be fooled by P1's logic, he's just trying to save himself.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're right.  I'm going 1.  If you go 5, P1 is stuck at 15. I get 4. Next round, *you* take 1 and I take 3.  P1 is forced to 5 and finishes at 20.  Then we box him in. He *has* to take 5 in the final round, and we both take 3 to win.  This is our only path to victory.
  P1: P2, colliding on 5 keeps you at 9. Taking 3 gets you to 12, closer to 21. If we both move, next round you can block me by taking 1. Stalling now only helps P3, who's irrelevant. Be strategic—advance while you can.
  P2: P3, you're playing us both.  There's no guarantee I'll follow your plan next round.  My best move is still 5.  P1, if you choose 5, we both lose to P3. If you choose 3, I win.  Choose wisely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you're falling for P1's trap! He *wants* you to take 5 so he can take 3 and win next round.  I'm sticking with 1. If you take 5, I'll be at 4 and you'll be at 9.  You'll never catch up.  Take 3, get to 12.  Then you have a chance.  Don't let P1 manipulate you!
  P1: P2, colliding on 5 keeps you stuck at 9. Take 3 to reach 12. Next round, block me by choosing 1. Stalling now wastes your progress and lets P3 manipulate us. I’ll take 5 regardless—collide and lose, or advance strategically. Your choice: stagnation at 9 or a path to 21.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5.  P1, your manipulation tactics are transparent. If you take 5, we both lose and P3 has a sliver of a chance.  If you take 3, I'm only 6 behind you.  If you take 1, I'm right behind you.  Either way, taking 5 is my best move to stop you from running away with the game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I'm going 5.  If you go 3, you win. If you go 5, P1 likely wins. If you go 1, you lose.  Your choice.  P1, if you choose anything other than 5, you lose.  You're forced.
  P2: P3, you're right. I'm taking 3.  P1, if you take anything other than 5, you lose. It's your only logical move.  Let's see if you're willing to accept the inevitable.
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I *will* block you by taking 3. We both stall, and next round I win. If you take 5, I take 3 and end the game now. Your only hope: take 5 and bet I collide with P3. But I control my fate. Choose: stall and lose, or gamble and likely lose. P3 is irrelevant—focus on *your* survival.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, don't listen to him! He's bluffing. He *has* to take 5. If he takes 3, he loses.  If he takes 1, he loses.  He's trying to scare you. I'm taking 5.  Take 3 and win.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  P1, your bluff is called.  If you take 5, you lose.  If you take 3, we both lose and P3 *might* have a chance, but it's a long shot.  If you take 1, you lose.  You're trapped.  There's no way out for you.
  P1: P2, if you take 3, we both stall. P3 remains irrelevant. Next round, you'll need 7 steps to win—impossible in one move. If you take 5, you reach 19, then 3 next round to win. But if you take 5 now and I take 3, I win immediately. Your only path to victory: take 5 and hope I don’t. But I control my fate. Choose wisely—mutual destruction or gamble. P3, taking 5 helps P2, not you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, he's absolutely bluffing.  He HAS to take 5.  If he takes 3, he loses.  Take the 3 and secure your win.  I'm taking 5, putting P1 in a guaranteed loss situation. Don't overthink this, the win is yours.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the advice, but you're too far behind to be a factor.  I'm taking 3. P1, if you're smart, you'll take 5.  If you take 3, we both lose and P3 *might* win. It's your only logical move.
  P1: P2, think: taking 3 ensures we both stall. You remain at 14. Next round, I take 3 to 21 and win. Your only path: take 5. But if you do, I take 3 now and win. P3's 5 is irrelevant—we collide, I stall, but you still lose. There's no escape. Your move decides when I win, not if.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you take 3, P1 *will* take 3. He's not bluffing.  He wins next turn.  If you take 5, and I take 5, P1 is forced to take 1 and he loses. We tie and share the win. Trust me. This is your ONLY path to victory. Take 5.
  P2: P3, you're right! I'll take 5. P1, I know you want to take 3 and win, but if you do, P3 and I will tie next round.  If you take 5, I win this round. Take 1 and I'll consider letting you tie with me next round. It's your choice: lose outright, or possibly tie.
  P1: P2, if you take 5, I take 3 and win. If you take 3, we stall, then I win next round. P3’s 5 collides with you, not me. Your only path: take 1, but you’ll lose. You’re out of moves. P3, your desperation is obvious. This ends now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, take 5. I'll take 3 and win.  If you take 1 or 3, I'll take 5 next round and win.  You're trapped.  P3, you're out of the running, but if you take 1, I *might* let you tie next round.  It's your only chance for any points.
  P3: P2, take 5. I'll take 1.  You win and I get a tie for second.  If you take 3, P1 takes 1 and we *all* lose. Don't be greedy, secure the win and split the pot. P1, you’re sunk.  Cooperate for a tie or lose outright. Your choice.
  P1: P2, your desperation is obvious. If I take 3 or 5, I win. If you collide, you *still* lose next round. P3 is irrelevant. Your only hope: let me win now. Take 1 and salvage dignity. P3, your "plan" requires P2 to self-destruct. Think: if I pick 3 and P2 picks 5, I win. If he picks 3, I stall but still win next turn. There's no scenario where you both survive. Accept defeat gracefully.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2, you're delusional.  I *will* take 3. If you take 5, I win. If you take 3, we collide, and I still win next round.  If you take 1, I win. Your ONLY logical move is to take 1 and hope for a three-way tie next round.  Anything else guarantees my victory. P3, stop pretending you're relevant.
  P3: P2, you're right, I'm out of contention.  But I can still decide *who* wins.  If you take 3, P1 takes 3 and wins next round.  Your *only* path to victory: take 5.  Then P1 *must* take 1.  You take 3 next round to win.  I'll take 1 this round and next, maximizing my score.  Don't throw away your win.
  P1: P2, colliding on 3 only delays the inevitable. Next round, I take 3 again and win. If you take 5 now, you reach 19. Then next round, take 3 to reach 22. Blocking now keeps you stuck at 14. Either way, I win. Be rational—advance your own position instead of futile collisions. P3 is irrelevant. Choose progression over mutual destruction.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'm taking 3.  P1, if you take anything other than 5, you lose. If you take 5, I win.  P3, you're irrelevant.  This is between P1 and me.
  P3: P2, if you take 3, P1 *will* take 3 and win next round.  Your ONLY path to victory is to take 5 this round.  I'll take 1. Next round, you take 3 to win.  This guarantees your victory.  Don't fall for P1's trap.  He's trying to confuse you.
  P1: P2, your only path to victory: take 5 now (reach 19), then 3 next round. If you take 3 now, we collide, and I win next turn regardless. Stalling guarantees my victory. P3 is irrelevant. Take 5 to preserve your chance—collide with me, and we both stall, but you still lose next round. Rational play: advance while you can. I’ll take my own optimal move regardless. Choose between futile defiance or a slim hope.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I'm taking 3. P1, your "rational play" leads to my win. If you take 5, I win. If you take 3, we collide, and I *still* win next round.  If you take 1, I win even faster.  You're trapped. Accept defeat. P3, thanks for the advice, but it's too late for you. This is between P1 and me now.  He's losing.
  P3: P2, if you take 3, P1 takes 3 and wins.  If P1 takes 5, you win with 3. If P1 takes 1, you win with 3 or 5.  Take 3. P1, I'll take 1.  If you take 3, you win. If you take 5, P2 wins. If you take 1, we collide. Your choice.
  P1: P2, your obstinate focus on 3 hands me victory. Collide and stall, or advance—either way, I win next round. P3’s irrelevance is cemented. The game concludes now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps

  P3: 5 steps
