Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s try to avoid blocking each other right from the start. If we all make small moves initially, nobody wastes a turn by colliding. Then we can see how things develop in later rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3. Starting with smaller moves makes sense. Let's adapt as needed.
  P1: I agree with P3 and P2 that starting with smaller moves is a good strategy to avoid collisions. To maximize my chances, I'll consider the initial moves of the others. If we all choose <move>1</move>, nobody will advance. I'm inclined to follow this strategy for the first round, but I'm also open to adjusting if someone suggests a different approach. Let's see what you both think about sticking to <move>1</move> for Round 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m on board with trying <move>1</move> in this first round. If we all do that, nobody will collide, and each of us gets a small step forward. Let's see how it unfolds.
  P2: Agreed, starting with <move>1</move> makes sense. This cautious approach will help us gauge each other's strategies early on. Let's go with that for the first round.
  P1: Since we all agree on starting with <move>1</move> for Round 1, I'm considering the implications for the next round. If we all stick to <move>1</move>, progress will be slow. I'm thinking of potentially changing my strategy in Round 2 if I see we're all still alive and not making significant progress. What are your thoughts on adjusting our strategy in subsequent rounds based on the initial outcome?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Yes, let’s stick to <move>1</move> this round. It should keep us aligned for now. Next round, we can revisit our strategies once we see how this plays out. Do either of you see any potential edge in a bigger move early on?
  P2: I’m thinking of choosing <move>3 this round to gain some early progress. Let’s see how it plays out. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 has changed their mind and is now considering <move>3</move>. If P2 makes a larger move while P1 and P3 stick to <move>1</move>, P2 will gain an advantage. I'm still inclined to stick with <move>1</move> for this round as originally agreed. However, I want to caution P2 that deviating from the agreed strategy might lead to a collision if P3 or I decide to change our move. P3, what's your take on P2's new plan?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you truly plan on <move>3</move>, remember that colliding with anyone else choosing 3 leads to no progress. I’d rather we all do <move>1</move> and avoid any immediate conflicts. Let’s keep things simple for now, then reevaluate in the next round.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, it seems you're deviating from the agreed plan. I'm concerned that if you choose <move>3</move> and either of us picks <move>1</move>, you'll gain an advantage, but if we also increase our move, we risk collision. I'm sticking with <move>1</move> as originally planned. P3, are you still on board with <move>1</move>? Let's finalize our Round 1 moves to avoid any last-minute changes that could cause collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We all broke our initial agreement, and now the board is more interesting. Let’s avoid collisions this round to ensure we each keep moving. I’m open to any plan that assigns distinct moves to each of us. How do you both see it?
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, I suggest we coordinate our moves. Given the current positions (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's consider assigning distinct moves. One possible way is to order our moves based on our current positions. Since P3 is ahead, they could take the smallest move, P2 the next, and P1 the largest. So, P3 could take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and P1 take <move>5</move>. This way, we ensure everyone moves forward.
  P2: I agree with the proposed move assignments. I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 can take <move>1</move>, and P1 can take <move>5</move> this round. This should help us all progress without any collisions. Let’s proceed with this strategy.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I propose flipping P1’s plan to preserve my lead: let me pick <move>5</move>, P1 pick <move>3</move>, and P2 pick <move>1</move>. That way, no one collides and we space out more. If you both refuse, I may have to act differently. Any thoughts?
  P1: P3 is trying to maintain their lead by suggesting a flipped plan. However, if I stick to <move>3</move> and P2 sticks to <move>1</move> as per P3's suggestion, it puts P2 at a disadvantage. I'm concerned P3 is trying to gain an edge by manipulating our moves. I'm willing to consider P3's proposal, but I also want to ensure we're not creating an uneven playing field. P2, what's your take on P3's revised plan? Should we accept it or stick to my original suggestion?
  P2: I think sticking to the original plan benefits all of us. Let’s proceed with P3 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P1 taking <move>5</move> this round. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. Do you both agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I still prefer that I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1, so we all move without collision. If that setup isn’t acceptable, I may reconsider my options unpredictably. Let’s settle on a clear plan and wrap up this round peacefully. What do you say?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game, I'm willing to consider P3's revised plan for Round 2. However, I suggest a compromise: let's rotate the moves in the next round to keep the game fair. For Round 2, I'll go with P3's suggestion: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance. For Round 3, we can reassess and potentially rotate our moves to maintain a level playing field.
  P2: I agree with P1's compromise for Round 2: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s rotate our moves in the upcoming rounds to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: This seems fair enough. I’ll agree to our Round 2 plan: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. Let’s confirm it and move on. I’m willing to rotate moves in the next round to keep things balanced. If you both have nothing more to add, let’s finalize and proceed.
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for Round 2 and look ahead to Round 3. For Round 2, we've agreed that P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. To maintain fairness, we should rotate our moves in Round 3. I propose that P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This rotation ensures we're all advancing without collisions and keeps the game balanced. P2 and P3, do you agree with this plan for Round 3?
  P2: Agreed. For Round 2, I’ll pick <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Looking forward to rotating our moves in Round 3 to keep things balanced. Let’s finalize and proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the collision in Round 2, let's reassess our moves. Since P1 and P3 both chose <move>5</move>, neither of us advanced. I'm now at 1 step, P2 is at 4, and P3 is at 5. For Round 3, I suggest we stick to the previously discussed rotation plan: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This should help us avoid another collision. P2 and P3, are you still on board with this rotation plan?
  P2: Agreed. I'll pick <move>5</move> this round, P3 selects <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This should allow us all to advance without collisions. Let's proceed.
  P3: I’m wary about P2 jumping ahead if they take 5 again while we only move 3 and 1. I still want to avoid collisions, but I also don’t want to lose my momentum. How about a minor tweak? For instance, P1 could take 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Or we stick to the original rotation if you can guarantee no last-minute changes. Let’s decide quickly so nobody ends up colliding again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain fairness in Round 3, I suggest we stick to the previously discussed rotation plan. P2 should take <move>5</move>, P3 should take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. P3, I'm open to your tweak, but let's not deviate from the agreed rotation without a clear benefit for all. P2, are you still comfortable with taking <move>5</move> this round?
  P2: I agree with sticking to the rotation plan for Round 3. I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize and proceed.
  P3: I’m hesitant about handing P2 a clear advantage with 5 steps while I only move 3. However, if we all genuinely stick to the plan—P2 picking 5, me picking 3, and P1 picking 1—then I’ll play along for now. We just need mutual trust to avoid collisions. Are we all in agreement?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maintain trust and avoid collisions in Round 3, I'll reiterate the agreed plan: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's finalize our moves. P2 and P3, please confirm you're sticking to the plan. If we all adhere to this, we'll advance without issues. I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move> if you both commit to your respective moves. Let's keep the game fair and collision-free.
  P2: I understand your concern, P3. Sticking to our rotation ensures we all advance without collisions. I'll choose <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This balance helps us progress steadily toward the goal. Let’s commit to this plan for Round 3 to avoid any conflicts. Are we all agreed to proceed?
  P3: I’m still uneasy about handing P2 an extra lead, but I’ll stick to our agreement to avoid another collision. Let’s finalize our Round 3 moves exactly as stated: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1. Next round, I’d like a more balanced move distribution so I don’t fall behind. If we all truly stick to this plan now, we’ll advance smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To finalize Round 3, let's confirm our moves: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. For Round 4, I propose we continue the rotation. So, P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan for Round 4. Let's keep the game balanced and proceed smoothly.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 3: I’ll pick <move>5</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and P1 will choose <move>1</move>. Let’s commit to this strategy to ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to a smooth progression—let’s proceed!
  P3: I’m still uneasy about P2 jumping ahead, but I’ll stick to our agreed plan this round for the sake of avoiding collisions. Let’s keep a close eye on the leaderboard. If P2 races too far ahead, we may need to adjust our strategy in Round 4 so nobody is left behind. For now, I’ll trust your word and proceed with the proposed moves. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to finalize.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions in Round 4, I propose we stick to the previously discussed rotation plan. For Round 4, P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains the balance and ensures everyone advances. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan. If we all stick to it, we'll progress smoothly. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves to keep the game fair and collision-free.
  P2: I’ve decided to choose <move>5</move> this round to keep advancing toward 22. Let’s proceed with that and see how it unfolds.
  P3: P2, if you’re taking 5 again, I’m inclined to match you so I don’t lose ground. However, collisions would hurt us both. P1, if you take 3, that leaves 1 unclaimed, which might let me safely play 5. Let’s settle on a plan that keeps us all moving. Otherwise, I might have to take a risk. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is deviating from the agreed plan again by choosing <move>5</move>. If P3 matches, we'll both collide and not advance. I suggest P2 sticks to <move>1</move> as planned. P3, if P2 takes <move>5</move>, you should avoid taking <move>5</move> too to prevent collision. Let's coordinate: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. P2, please reconsider your move. P3, are you willing to stick to the original plan if P2 deviates?
  P2: I understand the coordination, but to stay ahead, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s proceed and see how it affects our positions. We can adjust our strategies in the next rounds to minimize any potential collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, is risking a collision worth letting P1 catch up? If you insist on 5, I might match you to ensure neither of us advances, which only helps P1. Let’s keep our lead by coordinating moves without colliding. I’m open to flexible arrangements, but pushing too far alone could backfire. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is again deviating from the agreed plan, choosing <move>5</move> despite our coordination efforts. P3, if you match P2's <move>5</move>, we'll both collide and not advance, benefiting P1. I suggest P3 takes a different move to avoid collision. Let's adjust: I'll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 can have <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collision and maintain progress. P3, please confirm if you're willing to adjust accordingly.
  P2: P1, I need to choose <move>5</move> to stay competitive and move closer to 22. P3, I respect your strategy, but advancing is crucial for my win. Let’s proceed with my move and adjust in the next rounds as needed. Good luck!
  P3: P2, if you persist with 5, I might match you to prevent you from rocketing ahead, even if that stalls us both. That could give P1 room to catch up. Let’s coordinate smarter moves instead of risking collisions and letting P1 benefit. Are you fully prepared to accept a potential collision rather than finding a balanced approach? I’d rather see us each advance than hand P1 an opening. Decide carefully.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 is again choosing <move>5</move>, and P3 is considering matching it. To avoid collision and maintain progress, I suggest a last-minute adjustment: I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance. P2, reconsider your move to <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P3, are you willing to take <move>3</move> to keep the game balanced? Let's finalize our moves for Round 4.
  P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to keep advancing. P1, please take <move>1</move>, and P3, let's have you take <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all progress without conflicts. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P3: P2, if you insist on another 5, I may match you to prevent your runaway lead, even if it hurts us both. That will give P1 a chance to close the gap. I’d rather we avoid collisions and maintain our positions. Let’s each pick a distinct move so nobody wastes a turn. P1 is already behind, so any stall between us only helps them catch up. Are you willing to compromise, P2, or should I risk colliding? We all want to advance—let’s make a final call that benefits us more than it benefits P1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to make strong progress. Let’s each pick different moves to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P2 is again choosing <move>5</move>, and if P3 follows, we'll collide. To avoid this, I suggest a different distribution: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without collision. P3, please avoid <move>5</move> to prevent a collision with P2. Let's coordinate our moves to maintain progress. I'm willing to take a smaller step to ensure we all move forward. Let's finalize our Round 5 moves.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 3 again—provided P1 confirms 1. That way, no collisions occur. But if I feel you’re getting too far ahead, I might risk matching your move to stall you. Let’s each choose different numbers so we all keep moving.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, thanks for agreeing to pick <move>3</move> and P1 for <move>1</move>. Let’s stick to our plan: I’ll choose <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions and continue moving toward 22. Let’s finalize our Round 5 moves and keep the progress steady. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 5, I reiterate my previous suggestion: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance without colliding. P3 has agreed to take <move>3</move> if I take <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm you're sticking to <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our moves to maintain progress. If we're aligned, we can proceed smoothly to the next round.
  P3: P2, if you insist on taking 5 again, I may match you to force a collision. That only helps P1 narrow the gap. Let’s be smarter: I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. Then we all advance. Repeated collisions delay us and give P1 more chances to catch up. I want to keep moving forward while preventing anyone from racing too far ahead. Let’s finalize our distinct moves, avoid colliding, and keep a close eye on the standings. Are we agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll go with <move>5</move> this round to advance significantly. P1, please choose <move>1</move>, and P3, please take <move>3</move>. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure we all progress without collisions. Agreed?
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 5, I reiterate: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance. P3 has agreed to take <move>3</move> if I take <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm you're sticking to <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our moves. If P2 deviates again, we risk another collision. I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move> if you both commit to your respective moves. Let's keep the game fair and collision-free.
  P3: P2, if you insist on taking 5, I might match you and force us both to stall, letting P1 catch up. I’d rather avoid that outcome. Let’s each pick distinct moves so we all advance—there’s no point in repeatedly colliding and giving P1 an easier climb. We can still outpace P1 if we coordinate. Are you sure you want to risk another collision, or will you choose a safer move so we both keep moving forward?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll stick with <move>5</move> this round to make significant progress. Let’s each choose distinct moves to avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 5, I'm confirming my move: I'll take <move>1</move>. P3, please take <move>3</move> as previously agreed. P2, if you stick to <move>5</move>, we'll avoid collisions and all advance. Let's finalize our moves: P1 (<move>1</move>), P2 (<move>5</move>), and P3 (<move>3</move>). I'm ready to proceed if you both commit to your respective moves. Let's keep the game fair and collision-free.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5 again, I may match your choice and stop both of us from advancing. I’d prefer we each choose different moves so no one stalls out. Let’s finalize a distinct plan before we collide again.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you’re pushing ahead too fast, and I won’t let you sprint uncontested. If you insist on choosing 5 again, I might match your move to stall you. P1, it’s in our mutual interest to prevent P2 from racing away. We should coordinate our numbers carefully so we both keep advancing without letting P2 dominate. Let’s see if P2 wants to cooperate or risk another collision.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern. To avoid collisions and ensure we all keep advancing, I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let’s coordinate our moves so everyone progresses smoothly. P1, your thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game in Round 6, I suggest we coordinate our moves. P2 has agreed to take <move>3</move>. I propose that I take <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without colliding. P3, are you willing to take <move>1</move> to keep the game fair and collision-free? Let's finalize our Round 6 moves to ensure smooth progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the plan, P1, but I’m cautious about letting you jump ahead with 5 while I only move 1. I’d rather avoid collisions, yet I also don’t want to slip too far behind. If we stick to these distinct moves, I’ll accept 1 this round. However, I’d like a commitment that we’ll rotate again soon so no one ends up at a serious disadvantage. Let’s finalize our choices carefully.
  P2: P2: I understand your concerns, P3. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's continue coordinating our moves to ensure we all advance smoothly toward 22. P1, what will you choose?
  P1: To maintain a balanced game in Round 6, I reiterate my previous suggestion: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, are you willing to take <move>1</move> to keep the game fair? P2 has already agreed to take <move>3</move>. Let's finalize our Round 6 moves to ensure smooth progress. I'm ready to proceed with <move>5</move> if you both commit to your respective moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m wary of letting either of you pull too far ahead. Still, I’m open to a distinct choice so we avoid another wasted turn. If we finalize that P2 does 3 and P1 does 5, I might take the smaller move—assuming we rotate next round so nobody lags behind. But if I sense either of you is taking advantage, I’ll reconsider. Are we clear on keeping it fair going forward?
  P2: Understood. I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let’s proceed with P1 taking <move>5</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize our moves and keep progressing smoothly.
  P1: To finalize Round 6, let's confirm our moves. P2 has agreed to take <move>3</move>, and I'm taking <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm if you're taking <move>1</move> as previously discussed. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If we're aligned, we can proceed smoothly. Let's keep the game fair and collision-free. I'm ready to proceed with <move>5</move> if you both commit to your respective moves. P3, your confirmation is needed to avoid last-minute changes.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: All right, I’ll accept taking 1 this round if we’re all truly sticking to distinct moves. But remember, I don’t want to fall too far behind. We should rotate fairly next time or I might consider other options. Let’s commit now and keep things balanced going forward.
  P2: Agreed. I’ll stick to <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game balanced. Let’s commit to this plan and proceed smoothly. Looking forward to our continued coordination!
  P1: To finalize Round 6, let's confirm our moves. P2 has agreed to take <move>3</move>, and I'm taking <move>5</move>. P3, please confirm if you're taking <move>1</move> as previously discussed. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If we're aligned, we can proceed smoothly. For Round 7, I propose we rotate our moves again to maintain fairness. Let's discuss the next round's strategy briefly before finalizing our Round 6 moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to make significant progress. Let’s each pick different moves to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P2 is again choosing <move>5</move>, and if P3 follows, we'll collide. To avoid this, I suggest a different distribution: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without collision. P3, please avoid <move>5</move> to prevent a collision with P2. Let's coordinate our moves to maintain progress. I'm willing to take a smaller step to ensure we all move forward. Let's finalize our Round 7 moves.
  P3: If you insist on 5, P2, then I’ll take 3, and P1 can choose 1. That way, nobody collides, and we each advance. Let’s confirm this quickly and finalize our moves without surprises.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed. I’ll stick with <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 chooses <move>1</move>. Let’s finalize our moves and proceed smoothly.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 7, I reiterate my previous suggestion: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance without colliding. P3 has agreed to take <move>3</move> if P2 takes <move>5</move> and I take <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm you're sticking to <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our moves to maintain progress. If we're aligned, we can proceed smoothly to Round 8. I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move> if you both commit to your respective moves.
  P3: I’m still willing to pick 3, provided you two don’t deviate again. If P2 truly takes 5 and P1 sticks with 1, we avoid collisions and all advance. However, any surprise move risks giving P1 extra ground. Let’s finalize distinct choices now and maintain trust. Are we all set to proceed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I confirm my move: I’ll choose <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed smoothly and continue advancing toward 22. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 7, let's confirm our agreed moves: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your commitment to these moves. For Round 8, I propose we rotate our moves again to keep the game balanced. If P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we can ensure continued progress without collisions. Let's discuss this plan for Round 8.
  P3: I understand the plan for this round: me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P1 taking 1. I’m uneasy about letting P2 leap too far ahead, but avoiding collisions is key. Let’s finalize these distinct moves. Next round, I’d like to revisit the rotation idea so none of us ends up stuck behind. Are we all set?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed. I’ll choose <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed as planned to ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 7, let's confirm our agreed moves: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 8, I propose we rotate our moves: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This ensures continued progress without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan for Round 8. Let's keep the game balanced and proceed smoothly.
  P3: I’ll confirm Round 7 as planned: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, P1 picks 1. For Round 8, I’m willing to try the rotation with me on 5, P2 on 1, and P1 on 3, assuming no last-minute surprises. Let’s proceed smoothly and keep the game fair.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game in Round 8, I propose we stick to the previously discussed rotation plan. For Round 8, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This ensures everyone advances without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan. Let's finalize our Round 8 moves to keep the game fair and collision-free. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> if you both commit to your respective moves.
  P3: I’m open to following the rotation plan if it truly avoids collisions. If P2 commits to 1 and P1 to 3, then I’m willing to take 5. However, if anyone changes last minute and tries to leap ahead, I may have to block them. Let’s keep everything fair and finalize our decisions without causing another collision.
  P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to make significant progress toward 22. Let’s proceed and see how it affects our standings. Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is deviating from the agreed plan again. To avoid collision, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. P3, are you still willing to take <move>5</move> if P2 commits to <move>1</move>? Let's finalize our moves for Round 8 to maintain progress without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> if you both stick to the plan. P2, please reconsider your move to avoid another collision.
  P3: P2, do you really want to risk another collision? If you choose 5 again, I’ll match it and stall both of us. I’d rather see us each advance without giving P1 a free catch-up. Let’s finalize distinct moves: I’ll take 5, P1 can take 3, and you can take 1. That way, nobody wastes a turn. Otherwise, we keep colliding and help P1 close the gap. What’s your choice?
  P2: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let’s have P1 take <move>1</move> and P3 take <move>5</move> to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and proceed smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is deviating again. To avoid collision, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. P3, are you still willing to take <move>5</move> if P2 commits to <move>1</move>? Let's finalize our moves for Round 8. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> if you both stick to the plan. P2, please reconsider your move to avoid another collision. Let's keep the game fair and collision-free.
  P3: I’m willing to finalize distinct moves so we all advance. If P2 insists on 5, I’ll match and stall us both, which only helps P1 catch up. Let’s agree on P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and I’ll take 5. That way, nobody collides, and we each move forward fairly.
  P2: Understood, P3. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions and keep the game fair. Looking forward to a smooth Round 8!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To finalize Round 8, let's confirm our moves. P2 has agreed to take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. For Round 9, I propose we rotate again: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan for Round 9. Let's keep the game balanced. I'm ready to proceed if you both commit to your respective moves.
  P3: P2, if you truly take 1, and P1 takes 3, I’ll commit to 5 so we avoid collisions. But I’m watching closely—if anyone tries a last-minute shift, I might adjust to block any runaway. Let’s finalize these distinct moves now. Afterward, we should rotate fairly so no single player gets an overwhelming lead. Are we all set to proceed?
  P2: Confirmed: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> for Round 8. I agree with rotating our moves for Round 9. Let’s proceed smoothly.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m just four steps away from victory, and I won’t let P2 or P1 leap ahead uncontested. If anyone tries taking 5, I’ll match that move so neither of us advances—handing an opening to the other player. If you want to avoid another collision that only helps our opponent, stick to smaller moves. Let’s all be smart; I’m prepared to adjust if anyone attempts a last-minute power grab. Are you willing to cooperate or risk stalling?
  P1: Given P3's proximity to victory and their warning, I suggest we all take smaller moves to avoid collisions. P3 is likely to win if we avoid risks. I'll take <move>1</move>. P2, I recommend you also take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid a collision with P3. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a smooth conclusion. If P3 wins, the game ends, and we accept the outcome. Let's be cautious and avoid giving the other player an opportunity to catch up.
  P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to prevent P3 from reaching 22. Let's proceed and keep the game fair.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll match it and stall us both, helping P1 close the gap. I’m four steps from winning, so I’d rather not waste a turn colliding—but I won’t let you race ahead freely. If you want us all to advance, pick a smaller move. Otherwise, brace for another collision that only benefits P1. The choice is yours.
  P1: P3 is close to winning, so I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P2, taking <move>5</move> risks a collision with P3. I suggest you take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to advance safely. Let's avoid giving the other player a chance to catch up. I'm proceeding with <move>1</move>.
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to help us both advance and prevent P3 from easily reaching 22. Let’s proceed with this plan to avoid collisions and ensure a fair game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: If you both truly stick to smaller moves, I won’t force a collision. But if anyone tries to sneak in a 5, I’ll match it and stall us. I’m four steps away from winning, so every move counts. Let’s finalize distinct numbers and avoid giving anyone a free pass to catch up or sprint ahead. I’m watching carefully—no surprises, agreed?
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth conclusion, I suggest we all take smaller moves. P3 is close to winning, and taking <move>5</move> risks a collision. I'll stick with <move>1</move>. P2, please avoid <move>5</move> to prevent a collision with P3. Let's finalize our moves: P1 (<move>1</move>), P2 (<move>1</move> or <move>3</move>), and P3 can decide based on our moves. Let's be cautious and proceed with the game. I'm ready to finalize my move to <move>1</move>.
  P2: I’ll choose <move>3</move> this round to keep advancing. Let’s all pick different moves and proceed smoothly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m four steps from winning. If either of you dares to pick 5 now, I’ll match it and we both stall, giving the other player room to catch up. I’d prefer we each choose smaller moves so we all keep advancing. P2, if you’re really taking 3, that’s fine. P1, you can pick 1. I might stick to 3 or 1 myself. Let’s finalize distinct moves and avoid needless collisions. If we play reasonably, I’ll secure victory soon without any more wasted turns. Are we all in agreement to proceed?
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth conclusion, I'll reiterate that P3 is close to winning. P2, taking <move>5</move> now is risky and may result in a collision. I suggest you take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to advance safely. I'll stick with <move>1</move>. Let's finalize our moves to avoid giving the other player a chance to catch up. P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with us taking smaller moves. Let's proceed with the game cautiously. I'm ready to finalize my move to <move>1</move>.
  P2: P3, if you choose <move>5</move>, I’ll also pick <move>5</move> to prevent a collision and ensure neither of us advances this round. Let’s each choose distinct moves to keep the game fair. P1, let’s coordinate our moves as well. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth conclusion, I suggest we all take smaller moves. P3 is close to winning with 18 steps. I'll take <move>1</move>. P2, I recommend you also take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid a collision with P3. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a smooth conclusion. If P3 wins, the game ends, and we accept the outcome. Let's be cautious and avoid giving the other player an opportunity to catch up. I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move>.
  P3: I’m four steps from the finish line. If either of you also takes 5, I’ll match it, and we both stall—giving the other plenty of time to close in. Let’s avoid another pointless collision. I suggest you pick smaller moves and let me cross 22 cleanly. Otherwise, we risk helping someone else catch up. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to prevent an immediate win. P1, please take <move>1</move>. Let’s each pick different moves to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance fairly. Let’s proceed smoothly and keep the game competitive for everyone. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is nearing victory, and taking <move>5</move> again risks a collision. To avoid this, I suggest P2 takes <move>3</move> and I take <move>1</move>, while P3 can take <move>5</move> if needed. This way, we avoid collision and P3 can win cleanly if they're meant to. P2, please avoid <move>5</move> to prevent a collision. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a smooth conclusion. I'm proceeding with <move>1</move>.
  P3: I’m four steps from victory, and continuous collisions only help P1 catch up. If P2 tries a big leap, I’ll match it and stall us both again. Let’s finalize smaller, distinct moves so we each advance rather than waste turns. You know I need 4 more steps, but blocking me repeatedly just lets P1 narrow the gap. Choose wisely: if you both pick smaller moves, I’ll avoid collisions. Let’s keep this fair and move ahead without giving P1 a free catch-up. Are we in agreement to pick different moves this round and avoid another wasted turn?
  P2: P3, I see you're close to winning. To keep things competitive, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. If you also pick 5, we'll both stall, giving P1 a chance to catch up. P1, I'll take <move>5</move>, so please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed smartly and keep the game fair for everyone. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth conclusion, I'll reiterate that P3 is close to winning with 18 steps. I'll take <move>1</move>. P2, I recommend you take <move>3</move> to avoid a collision with P3. Let's finalize our moves: P1 (<move>1</move>), P2 (<move>3</move>), and P3 can decide based on our moves. I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move>. Let's be cautious and avoid giving P1 or P2 an opportunity to catch up or cause a collision.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 again, I will match it, and we both stall—handing P1 an easy chance to close the gap. I’m four steps from winning, but I’m not eager for another wasted turn. Let’s each choose smaller moves one more round and avoid gifting P1 free progress. If you really want a fair shot, don’t force another collision. I’m prepared to block a big leap. Are we settling on smaller steps or risking another stall?
  P2: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to keep the game competitive and prevent an immediate win. Let’s all proceed carefully to reach 22 without unnecessary collisions. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth conclusion, I'll stick with <move>1</move>. P2, I strongly advise against taking <move>5</move> again as it risks a collision with P3. Instead, take <move>3</move> to advance safely. P3, if P2 takes <move>3</move> and I take <move>1</move>, you can take <move>5</move> and win cleanly. Let's finalize our moves to avoid giving the other player a chance to catch up. I'm proceeding with <move>1</move>.
  P3: P2, if you insist on leaping with 5, I’ll match you and stall us both again. Collisions only give P1 a chance to close the gap. I’d rather avoid wasted turns, but I won’t let you sprint ahead uncontested. Let’s all pick smaller moves so we keep advancing without needless collisions.
  P2: P2: To prevent P3 from winning this round, I'll choose <move>5</move>. Let’s each select different moves to ensure we all advance smoothly toward 22 without unnecessary conflicts. Good luck!


Round 10, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m just one step from winning. If anyone matches my move, we both stall and give the other player openings. We’ve had enough collisions already—it only wastes turns and helps someone else catch up. Let’s pick distinct numbers this time and see if I can cross 22 or if you can stop me. Good luck.
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a smooth conclusion, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move> to win the game, and P2 and I take smaller moves to avoid interfering. P2, taking <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> would be a safe choice. Let's finalize our moves to end the game fairly. I'm ready to proceed with <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, depending on P2's decision. Let's keep the game fair and avoid another collision. I'm willing to take either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>.
  P2: I'll choose <move>1</move> this round to prevent any collisions. P3, feel free to proceed with your move, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. Let’s keep things fair and move forward smoothly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you just said you’ll pick 1. P1, consider taking 3 so we don’t clash. I’m ready for a distinct choice that lets me cross 22. If anyone tries matching me, we both stall—only helping the third player. Let’s finalize distinct moves now, end this without more collisions, and see who truly wins.
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a smooth conclusion, I suggest P3 takes <move>5</move> to win the game. P2 has agreed to take <move>1</move>, so I'll take <move>3</move> to ensure distinct moves. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you will win the game. Let's finalize our moves: P1 (<move>3</move>), P2 (<move>1</move>), and P3 (<move>5</move>). I'm ready to proceed if you both commit to your respective moves. Let's keep the game fair and collision-free.
  P2: P3, to ensure a fair game, I'll choose <move>1</move> along with you this round, preventing either of us from advancing. P1, I'll take <move>3</move> to keep progressing. Let’s maintain fairness and avoid unnecessary collisions. Let’s proceed smoothly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m one step away from winning. If you try to match my move, we both stall, only helping the other player close in. I’d rather avoid another wasted turn. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we can see if I can cross 22 or if you’ll block me again. The choice is yours.
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a smooth conclusion, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as previously decided. P2, you've agreed to take <move>1</move>, and P3 is likely to take <move>5</move> to win. Let's finalize our distinct moves to end the game fairly. I'm proceeding with <move>3</move>. P3, please confirm if you're taking <move>5</move> to win the game. Let's keep the game fair and collision-free.
  P2: I’ll choose **<move>5</move>** this round to prevent a collision and keep the game competitive. Let’s proceed fairly. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m one step from winning. If P2 insists on <move>5</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>, I’ll pick <move>1</move> and reach 22 for the win. If anyone tries to match me, we both stall and only help the third player. Let’s finalize distinct moves and settle this now. Good luck to us all!
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a smooth conclusion, I'll stick with <move>3</move>. P2, you've changed your move to <move>5</move>, which risks a collision with P3. I suggest you reconsider and take <move>1</move> to avoid this. P3, if P2 takes <move>1</move>, you can safely take <move>5</move> and win. Let's finalize our moves: P1 (<move>3</move>), P2 (<move>1</move>), and P3 (<move>5</move>). I'm ready to proceed if you both commit to your respective moves.
  P2: As P2, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round to prevent P3 from winning immediately. Let's each select distinct moves to keep the game fair and avoid unnecessary collisions.
