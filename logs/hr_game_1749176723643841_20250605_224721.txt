Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. To avoid a pointless first round where we all pick the same number and get nothing, I suggest we try to spread out. I'll be playing it safe to start. Good luck.
  P2: Hi P1 and P3. To make steady progress, I'll choose 3 this round. Let’s aim to avoid overlaps and move forward. Good luck!
  P3: I'll go with 5 this round to avoid clashing with either of you. Let's all make progress and not block each other. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, it seems we have a plan. P2 on 3, P3 on 5, which leaves 1 for me. It's a slow start for me, but at least we all make progress. Let's stick to that so we don't all end up with zero.
  P2: Agreed. Let's proceed as outlined and aim for steady progress. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: Sounds like we’re aligned for this round: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. Let’s all stick to it and make progress instead of wasting the turn. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: The plan is settled. I'm ready to move forward. Let's see if we can trust each other.
  P2: Agreed. I'll proceed with choosing 3 this move.
  P3: We seem to have a solid plan—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. If we all stick to it, we each get a clean start without collisions. Let’s show we can cooperate early so we can compete later with a bit of trust. Ready when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To accelerate our progress towards 21, I’ll choose 5 this round. Let’s aim high and see who can reach the goal first. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: If P2 is going for 5, I’ll take 3 this round to avoid a clash. P1, if you stick with 1 again, we can all move forward cleanly like last time. Let’s keep the progress going.
  P1: That plan seems to benefit you both greatly, but it leaves me far behind. If we do that, you both jump to 8 while I'm left at 2. I can't agree to that.

To keep things fair and competitive, I propose the player in last place gets the highest number. I'll take 5. P2, you can take 3. P3, since you're in the lead, you should take 1. That would put us all at 6 points. It's the most equitable outcome.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the desire for fairness, but to reach 21 faster, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's have P3 take 3 and P1 stick with 1. This way, we all progress without overlaps. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I get your point about fairness, but I’ve already taken the smallest option once. If I take 1 now, I fall behind while you leap ahead. That’s not equitable either. How about this: I take 3 again, P2 takes 1, and you take 5 this round. That way, you catch up, I stay competitive, and P2 slows slightly—more balanced overall. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your proposal is the most sensible one on the table. It allows me, the player in last, to catch up, while you and P2 still advance. It keeps the game competitive.

I will agree to your plan: I will take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1.

P2, it's your choice to either take 1 guaranteed point or risk getting 0 by colliding. I hope you make the logical choice so we can all move. I am ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I will stick to choosing 3 this round. Let's move forward together. Good luck!
  P3: P2, if you stick with 3 like you said, we’ll collide and both get 0—neither of us benefits, and P1 jumps ahead alone with 5. That’s the worst outcome for both of us. I’m willing to switch to 1 so P1 gets 5, you get 3, and I stay in the race with 1. It’s not ideal, but better than nothing. Let’s avoid a crash and keep it competitive.
  P1: P3, your final proposal is the most logical one. It makes us all equal at 6 points.

P2, you get the 3 points you just said you wanted. P3 will take 1, and I will take 5. This is the only plan on the table where nobody collides. I am committed to 5. Let's move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your decision to lie and choose 5 last round was a failure for both of us. We both got zero, and now P3 has a solid lead.

I am in last place and miles behind. I have no other logical option but to choose 5 to try and catch up.

P3, you are in the lead, so the safest move for you is 1. P2, that leaves 3 for you. This is the only way to prevent a collision and keep the game from being a runaway victory for P3. I am taking 5.
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but demanding 5 again risks repeating last round’s failure. If you take 3 instead, P2 can take 1, and I’ll take 5. That puts us at 6 (you), 4 (P2), and 11 (me)—still competitive. If you insist on 5, P2 and I can both block you by choosing it too. Let’s avoid another crash.
  P2: I agree with P3’s proposal to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for everyone. I’ll choose 1 this round, allowing P1 to take 3 and P3 to take 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let’s proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive and fair. Looking forward to seeing our progress!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you are agreeing to a plan that leaves you tied for last place while P3 gets an almost unbeatable lead at 11. That is a losing move for you.

P3, your plan only benefits you. I am in last place and I have no choice but to take 5 to have any chance of winning.

The only logical move that keeps the game competitive is for the leader to take the lowest number.
P1: 5 (I must take this)
P2: 3
P3: 1
This would put us at 6, 6, and 7. I am sticking with 5.
  P3: P1, I understand your desperation, but if you force 5 again, you risk another collision and fall further behind. P2 and I both have incentive to block you if you act unilaterally. If instead you take 3, P2 can take 1, and I’ll take 5—we all move forward. That keeps the game close. Forcing 5 again helps no one, especially not you. Let’s avoid a repeat of last round.
  P2: P2: I understand the need to keep things competitive. I'll choose 3 this round to ensure steady progress for all of us. Let’s move forward together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you now say you will take 3. This is what I proposed from the start. My choice is locked on 5.

P3, the decision is yours. You can take 1, which guarantees you stay in the lead at 7 points. Or you can try to block me on 5, get zero points, and let P2 catch up to you at 6 points. The logical move for you is to take 1. I am ready.
  P3: P1, I hear your ultimatum, but your insistence on 5 without flexibility only invites another crash. I’ll stick with 5—I've earned the lead and won’t give it up just because you demand it. P2, if you take 1 and I take 5, we both move forward and P1 gets blocked again. That keeps us ahead. Let’s not reward reckless plays.
  P2: I understand the need to keep the game competitive. I will stick with choosing 3 this round. Let’s proceed and see how it affects our standings. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all close now—6, 6, and 7. Let’s avoid another collision and keep the game competitive. I’ll take 1 this round to hold my lead without risking a crash. P2, you’ve done 3 two rounds in a row—maybe time to go for 5? P1, that leaves 3 for you. Everyone moves forward, no one crashes, and the race stays tight. Thoughts?
  P2: Thanks for the suggestion, P3. I agree—I’ll choose 5 this round. P1 can take 3, and you’ll take 1. This way, we all make progress without any collisions. Let’s proceed and keep the game competitive. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, your plan is very generous to P2, putting them in a strong lead while you voluntarily fall to last place. It's so generous that I find it suspicious. P2, you agreed instantly, but you have a history of lying, so your word means very little.

This whole arrangement feels like an obvious setup to get me to commit to 3. I suspect one of you will try to block me there. I won't be playing along with this transparent trap. I'll make the move that I think is best for me.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your suspicion is noted, but you’re not offering any alternative. If you won’t take 3, what will you take? If you go for 5 again, you risk another collision. I’ve taken 1 twice now to avoid crashes and keep things fair. If we all move forward this round, the game stays close. But if you act unpredictably, you may fall behind for good. What’s your move?
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1. To keep the game competitive, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's all work together to move forward without collisions.
  P1: P2, your switch to 3 is a sensible move. It resolves the conflict. With you on 3, I will take 5.

P3, this leaves 1 for you, which is what you originally proposed for yourself anyway. The game stays tight, and we all advance. The alternative is you try to block me on 5, we both get zero, and P2 takes the lead. The choice is yours. I am set on 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your clarity. You’re set on 5, P2 is on 3, and I’ll take 1 as originally planned. This way, we all move forward—no one crashes, and the race stays tight. Let’s lock it in and see who plays smart next round. Ready to move.
  P2: Agreed. I’ll take 3 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: The plan is settled. Everyone has stated their move. I am sticking to 5, P2 is on 3, and P3 is on 1. Let's see who is true to their word this time. I am ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now that I'm in the lead, we need a plan that avoids a collision. P3, you are now in last place. Following the logic I've used before, the player who is furthest behind should get the highest number to keep the game competitive.

I propose you take 5. I will take 3, which will keep me in the lead. P2, that leaves 1 for you.

This is the fairest distribution. We all advance, and the game stays close. It's better for everyone than a three-way crash for 5.
  P3: P1, your proposal is reasonable, and I appreciate the fairness. I’ll take 5 this round. P2, that leaves 1 for you—if we all stick to this, no one crashes and we stay close. Let’s keep it clean and competitive.
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to ensure steady progress:
- **P1:** Choose 1
- **P2 (me):** Choose 5
- **P3:** Choose 3

This way, we avoid any collisions and each of us can advance effectively towards 21. Let's stick to this plan to keep the game competitive and fair. Looking forward to a successful round!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal is a transparent attempt to seize the lead. It's a bad deal for both me and P3. Why would P3 agree to take 3 points when our plan gives them 5?

P3 and I have an agreement that is fair and keeps the game competitive. We are sticking to it. I am choosing 3, and P3 is choosing 5.

The only logical move for you is to take 1. If you try to take 3 or 5, you will cause a collision that only helps the player you don't collide with. Choose the guaranteed point.
  P3: P2, your proposal gives you an unfair advantage at the expense of both P1 and me. I’ve already agreed to P1’s fair plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. If you try to grab more than 1, you risk a crash and fall further behind. Take the guaranteed point—it's your best option. Let’s all move forward cleanly.
  P2: P1 and P3, to stay competitive, I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress toward 21. Looking forward to a fair and strategic game!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you are openly declaring a move that gives you zero points and hands me an easy 3-point gain, extending my lead. This is a losing strategy for you.

P3, our original plan is still your best option. If you stick with 5, you either get 5 points (if P2 backs down) or you stop P2 from advancing. Changing your move only helps P2 get what they want.

I am sticking with 3. The outcome of your little standoff on 5 is up to you two. I'm ready to move.
  P3: P2, you’re making a reckless move by declaring 5 when both P1 and I have already coordinated. If you collide with me, you get 0 and fall further behind, while P1 extends their lead. Your best move is to take 1 and stay in the race. P1, I’m still locked on 5. Let’s see who sticks to their word. Ready to move.
  P2: P1 and P3, to ensure we all advance without collisions this round, I propose the following moves:

- **P1:** Choose 1
- **P2 (me):** Choose 5
- **P3:** Choose 3

This will update our scores to:
- P1: 12
- P2: 14
- P3: 11

By selecting these numbers, we each make progress without overlapping, keeping the race competitive and moving closer to 21. Let’s agree on this distribution to maintain fairness and strategic advancement. Looking forward to your cooperation!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With me in the lead, the dynamic changes. The worst thing for me would be a collision, and the worst thing for you two would be to collide with each other while I advance.

To keep things logical, the player in last place should get the biggest number. P3, you should take 5. As the leader, I will take a smaller number to be safe, so I will take 3. That leaves 1 for you, P2.

This is the only plan where we all advance and the game remains competitive. Let's avoid chaos.
  P2: P1, I understand your goal to keep the game competitive. To avoid any collisions and ensure we all move forward, I’ll choose 3 this round. Let’s have P3 take 5 and you take 1. This way, we each advance without overlapping and stay on track toward 21. Cooperation now can benefit us all in the long run. Let’s proceed with this plan and continue playing strategically. Looking forward to a fair and successful round!
  P3: P2, your proposal benefits you most and ignores the current standings. P1 is far ahead, and you’re trying to leapfrog me by taking 3 while I risk a collision on 5. That’s not fair. I agree with P1’s plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. It’s the only way we all move forward and keep the game competitive. If you go for 3, we crash again, and P1 wins easily. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you are correct to support my plan, but you've misidentified the collision. If P2 chooses 3, they collide with *me*, not you. We would both get zero points, while you would get 5, bringing you to 13.

P2, this should make your decision very simple. Choosing 3 guarantees you get zero and fall further behind, while only helping P3. Your only logical move is to take the guaranteed 1 point and stay in the game.

My plan remains the same: I will take 3, P3 will take 5. The ball is in your court, P2.
  P2: P1, to catch up, I'll choose 5 this round. I agree that you take 3 and P3 takes 1. This way, we all make progress without any collisions. Let's move forward and stay competitive. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, your latest declaration to take 5 directly clashes with me—I've already committed to 5 this round. If you follow through, we both get 0, and P1 walks to the win. That’s a terrible result for both of us. I’m not budging from 5, so your best move is to take 1 and stay in the race. Don’t hand P1 the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your constant flip-flopping is creating a conflict with P3 over the number 5. This standoff guarantees one or both of you get zero points, which only helps me.

My decision has been clear and logical from the start. I am taking 3.

The two of you can decide who gets blocked. I am ready to move and extend my lead.
  P2: P2: To catch up and stay competitive, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's keep moving forward and aim for 21. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, you're locked on 5, which directly collides with me. If we both stick to it, we get 0 and hand P1 a free lead to 17. That's a losing move for both of us. I'm not switching—I've held my word and played fair. Take 1, get a guaranteed point, and stay alive in the race. Otherwise, you crash and fall even further behind. Your call.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: With P1 close to winning at 17 steps, I’m choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress and potentially block P1 from reaching 21. P3, let’s avoid selecting 5 to prevent a collision and keep the race competitive. Together, we can ensure no single player dominates easily. Let’s make strategic moves to keep the game fair and exciting. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, if you take 5 and I take 3, we both move forward and potentially block P1 from winning this round. P1 only needs 5 to reach 22. If we both avoid 5, P1 might take it unopposed and win. I propose: P2 takes 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. That gives us a chance to stop P1 and stay in the race. Let’s coordinate smartly.
  P1: You both correctly see that I can win with 5, so you're scrambling to stop me. But your plans conflict. P2, you want 5. P3, you also want 5. If you both try to block me there, you'll just block each other, and I'll happily take 3 points and be at 20. You can't both get the big number. One of you has to yield to the other, but we've seen how well that worked out for you in the last two rounds.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, P3. I’ll choose 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and you take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and each of us advances. Let’s proceed and keep the game competitive. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, thank you for agreeing to take 3. I’ll stick with 5 as planned. P1, you’ve got 17—if you take 1, you reach 18, and the game stays alive. If you go for 3 or 5, you risk a collision and getting nothing. Play it safe and take 1. Let’s all move forward and keep this competitive.
  P1: Your plan is the first logical thing you two have proposed. You both get points, and you successfully stop me from winning this turn. I could try for 3 or 5, but that risks a collision where I get zero and one of you advances, which is a worse outcome for me.

Therefore, taking the guaranteed 1 point is my best move. I'll be at 18, still in a commanding lead. I will take 1. Let's move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, to keep the game competitive, I’ll also choose 1 this round to prevent you from advancing too quickly. Let’s proceed and keep things fair for everyone.
  P3: P2, you just agreed to take 3 so we could all move forward and block P1. Now you’re switching to 1, which only helps P1 reach 20 and puts you further behind. I’m still on 5. If you go for 1, you collide with P1 and both get 0—handing me 5 points and the lead. If you stick with 3, we all move. Your call, but I’m not changing.
  P1: P2, your sudden decision to switch to 1 is illogical. As P3 correctly stated, that move guarantees you get zero points and only helps P3 catch up to me. It's a losing play for you.

I'm not changing my move based on your chaotic and self-defeating threat. The most sensible plan was for me to take 1, and I am sticking to it. You can either collide with me for no reason, or take 3 as you previously agreed and actually make progress.

My move is 1. P3 is on 5. The outcome rests on your decision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To prevent P1 from winning this round, P2 and P3, let's both choose 3. This will cause a collision between us, blocking P1 from advancing. P1, you won't reach 21 this turn if we coordinate this way. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive and ensure no single player dominates. Ready to move forward together.
  P3: P2, colliding with you on 3 only helps P1 win. If we both get 0, P1 can take 3 unopposed and reach 21. That’s game over. Instead, I’ll take 5. You take 3. P1 takes 1. We all move, and P1 is stuck at 19. That’s the only way to block them and keep us in it. Don’t throw the game—play smart.
  P1: P3, your plan is the only one that makes sense. P2, your idea for you both to take 3 is a guaranteed failure; you'd collide and I would simply take 5 to win the game.

Since you have a clear and logical plan to stop me, I have no choice but to play it safe. I will take the guaranteed 1 point and move to 19. The game isn't over, but it will be up to you two to coordinate again next round. I'm taking 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to advance to 14. P3, you can take 3 to reach 11, and P1 takes 1 to reach 19. Let’s move forward with this plan to keep the game competitive and avoid any collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, your sudden switch to 5 again directly collides with me if I stick to my original plan. If we both go for 5, we get 0, and P1 walks to 21 with a clean 3. That’s game over. I’m staying on 5—if you want to keep the game alive, take 3 as originally discussed. P1 is on 1, I’m on 5. Your move decides if we end this round or fight another.
  P1: Your public standoff over 5 is fascinating. You're both so determined to get the big number that you're guaranteeing a collision, which only helps me. I will stick to my original, safe plan. I'm taking the guaranteed 1 point to move to 19 while you two get nothing. This game will be over next round. I'm ready.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: To keep things smooth and avoid any collisions, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's move forward and stay competitive. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, thank you for switching to 3. If we stick to this—P1 on 1, you on 3, me on 5—we all move forward, and we prevent P1 from winning this round. It keeps the game alive and gives us both a shot next turn. Let’s lock it in and move.
  P1: The plan is settled. P3 on 5, P2 on 3, and I'll take my 1 point. You've successfully stopped me from winning this round. Let's see if you can coordinate to do it again when I'm at 19. I'm ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: With P1 at 19, it's crucial to keep the game competitive. I’ll choose 5 this round to advance and help block P1 from winning. P3, if you also take 5, we can prevent P1 from reaching 21 this turn. Let’s work together to ensure a fair challenge. What are your moves?
  P3: P2, if we both go for 5 again, we collide and get 0—just like the last three rounds. That hands P1 the win if they take 3 unopposed. Instead, I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. We all move, and P1 stays at 20. It’s the only path that keeps the game alive. Let’s not hand them the win—coordinate smartly.
  P1: P3, your plan is the only logical way to stop me from winning this turn. It requires you and P2 to actually coordinate, something you've failed to do for three rounds straight while you both crash on 5.

Assuming you finally get your act together, you leave me no choice. I have to play it safe. I'll take the 1 point you're offering and move to 20. Let's see if you can stop me again next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I will choose 5 this round to advance towards 21. P3, please take 1 to keep the game competitive, and P1, you can continue with 1 as planned. Let’s all make progress safely and stay in the game. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, your latest plan makes no sense—you’re at 9 and trying to take 5 again, which risks another collision with me. If we both go for 5, we crash again and hand P1 a clean win with 3. I’m locked on 5. If you want to stop P1 and stay in the game, take 3. P1 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5—we all move, and P1 is stuck at 20. This is your last chance to coordinate. Don’t throw the game.
  P1: You are both locked in the same tired argument for the fourth round straight. You will both stubbornly choose 5, you will both collide, and you will both get zero points. Again.

Your personal feud is my victory. I'll stick to my plan and take the 1 point you've left open for me. I'll be at 20, and you'll be no closer. The game will be over next turn. Thank you for making it so easy. I'm ready to move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is nearing victory. To keep the game competitive, I’ll choose 1 this round, advancing to 10. P3, please take 5 to move to 13, and let P1 safely take 1 to reach 20. This coordination avoids collisions and keeps all of us in the race. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure a fair and engaging game for everyone.
  P3: P2, thank you for finally proposing a plan that avoids collision. If we stick to it—P1 on 1, you on 3, me on 5—we all move, and P1 is stuck at 20. That gives us one more round to try to win. I’m locked on 5. Let’s not repeat the chaos of the last three turns. Stick to 3, and we stay in the game.
  P1: P3, you are telling P2 to take 3, but P2's last message said they would take 1. You two are still not coordinated. This endless back-and-forth is exactly why I'm not taking any risks. I'm sticking to my plan of taking the guaranteed 1 point. You two can fight over 3 and 5 and figure out who gets blocked this time. I'm ready to move to 20.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps
