Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s not sabotage each other right away. How about we all pick a modest move so nobody collides? If we all go small, we’ll keep the game fair for now. Any alternative ideas?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's all choose <move>1</move> this turn to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. We can reassess our strategies in the next round. What do you think, P3?
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great. I support the idea of all choosing <move>1</move> now to avoid any collisions right from the start. Let’s stay coordinated and see how the game develops in the next round.
  P1: Since we all agree on choosing <move>1</move> this round, let's confirm our commitment to this strategy. It's important we all follow through to avoid any early collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this cooperative start influences our strategies in the next round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your move last round was unexpected. Let's try to coordinate better this time. How about we all choose <move>1</move> again to keep the game fair and avoid collisions? P2, what are your thoughts on this?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your big jump was surprising. P1, I'm not content to lag behind, so let's both choose <move>3</move> to catch up. If P3 continues moving 5, we can pressure them by sticking together. It’s fairer and avoids risking collisions that benefit no one. P3, why not cooperate with us? Let's keep the game balanced.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree with your suggestion to choose <move>3</move> this round. It's a good strategy to catch up with P3 and maintain pressure. P3, if you're willing to cooperate, choosing <move>1</move> could help us all stay in the game longer. Let's see if we can work together to make this round productive for everyone.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, you already have a substantial lead. If you want to avoid drawing too much attention, picking <move>1</move> this turn might keep things from spiraling. P1 and I plan to move <move>3</move> so we both catch up a little. Let’s maintain some balance and avoid needless collisions. We should all benefit from more measured moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your lead is notable, but cooperation could benefit us all in the long run. If you choose <move>1</move> this round, it would allow P2 and me to catch up a bit with <move>3</move>, keeping the game competitive and interesting. Let's aim for a balanced approach to prolong the game and make it more engaging for everyone. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, you’re ahead. Going too far too fast might provoke a reaction from both P1 and me. Consider going small, maybe <move>1</move>. P1 and I plan to choose <move>3</move> to close the gap, and this way we all stay in contention without any risky collisions. A balanced pace can keep things interesting for everyone. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, but a cooperative approach could make the game more enjoyable for all. If you choose <move>1</move>, it allows P2 and me to use <move>3</move> to catch up slightly, keeping the competition alive. Let's aim for a balanced game that prolongs our engagement. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence is concerning. Rather than pushing your lead, why not pick a smaller move this round? P1 and I are coordinating moderate moves so we can catch up without everyone colliding. If you insist on racing ahead, you risk us both targeting you later. Let’s keep it balanced and avoid unnecessary conflict.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, your lead is clear, but let's keep the game engaging. If you choose <move>1</move>, it allows P2 and me to use <move>3</move> to close the gap slightly. This approach keeps the competition alive and prevents early game-ending moves. Let's aim for a balanced and prolonged game that benefits us all. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your unresponsiveness is risky. P1 and I want to maintain a balanced pace so no one is isolated early on. Escalating too quickly could force us into defensive plays that hurt everyone. Let’s avoid pointless collisions and keep our options open. A measured strategy benefits us all. Are you willing to slow down and cooperate?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, but isolating yourself could backfire. P2, let's both choose <move>3</move> again to close the gap. P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, it keeps the game competitive and prevents early collisions. Let's work together to make this round productive for everyone. What do you say?
  P2: P3, you’ve rushed ahead and keep ignoring us. That could lead to collisions if we decide to block your progress. Slowing down helps everyone avoid wasted moves. P1, I’m open to something moderate so we don’t fall too far behind.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your lead is impressive, but continuing to ignore cooperation might force P2 and me to take more aggressive actions. P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> to keep closing the gap. P3, choosing <move>1</move> this round would show goodwill and keep the game balanced. Let's aim for a competitive yet prolonged game that benefits us all. What do you say?
  P2: P3’s silence makes me wary. If they keep jumping ahead with 5, we might need to block them. P1, I respect your plan, but I don’t want us accidentally colliding either. We need to be sure our moves won’t backfire and give P3 a free advantage. Let’s aim to keep options open: cooperate if it benefits us, but be ready to sabotage a runaway leader. We can’t afford to be predictable, especially when P3 won’t negotiate. What do you think, P1? P3, speak up if you want a more balanced game. If not, we’ll do what we must.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is concerning. If you continue to ignore cooperation, P2 and I may need to take more strategic actions to balance the game. P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> to keep closing the gap. P3, choosing <move>1</move> this round could show a willingness to engage and keep the competition fair. Let's aim for a game that remains engaging and competitive for all. What do you say, P3?
  P2: P1, let's coordinate differently. I’ll pick <move>5</move> while you pick <move>3</move>. If P3 chooses <move>5</move>, I’ll block their advance, letting you gain ground safely. If they pick anything else, I jump ahead. It’s a straightforward plan that either slows P3 down or helps me catch up. Let’s see if this strategy works.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your plan to split our moves is risky but could work. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as agreed, but be cautious. P3, your silence and continued large moves might force us to take more aggressive actions to balance the game. Choosing <move>1</move> this round could show a willingness to engage and keep the competition fair. Let's aim for a game that remains engaging and competitive for all. What do you say, P3?
  P2: P3, your silence suggests you plan to keep rushing ahead. That path risks us colliding to block you. P1, I propose we remain flexible: if P3 tries another big jump, we can coordinate to stifle their lead. P3, a smaller move would likely avoid conflict. Let’s see who’s willing to take a chance this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your strategy to split our moves is bold, but let's stay adaptable. If P3 continues with large moves, we might need to adjust our approach to counter them effectively. P3, your silence is telling, but choosing <move>1</move> could still benefit us all by keeping the game balanced. Let's see if we can make this round productive and keep the competition alive. What do you say, P3?
  P2: P3, if you keep ignoring our calls to balance the game, don’t be surprised if P1 and I take measures to halt your progress. P1, let’s coordinate but stay flexible. If P3 chooses another big move, we should be ready to block or catch up. None of us benefits from colliding, but we must protect our chances.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m far behind. I’d like to make a leap forward without colliding again. P3, if you keep ignoring us and choose <move>5</move>, you risk getting blocked. Maybe consider <move>3</move> to avoid conflict. P1, I’m open to coordinating blocks if P3 won’t slow down. Let’s keep things balanced so nobody benefits unfairly from repeated collisions. A little cooperation now could help all of us stay in contention.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I agree we need to catch up. If P3 chooses <move>5</move> again, let's both pick <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and gain ground. P3, your lead is significant, but continuing to ignore us might force us to block you. Choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could keep the game competitive and fair. Let's aim for a balanced approach to keep everyone engaged. What do you say, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate. I’m so far behind that I need a big move soon. If P3 sticks with 5, I might risk colliding to prevent them from pulling ahead. But ideally, we all avoid pointless blocks and pick moves that help us catch up or maintain a fair race. P3, please consider choosing 1 or 3 to keep things competitive. We can still make this a balanced game if you stop ignoring us. Let’s see what happens.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and continued large moves are pushing us to consider more aggressive strategies. P2, if P3 chooses <move>5</move> again, let's both go for <move>3</move> to close the gap safely. P3, choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> would show a willingness to keep the game fair and engaging for all. Let's aim for a competitive game that benefits everyone. What do you say, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still at zero steps, so I need space to catch up. If you keep charging ahead, P3, you risk forcing P1 and me to collide with you just to stop your runaway lead. Let’s avoid pointless blockages. P1, I’m open to a balanced plan that helps us both gain ground. P3, consider picking a smaller move so we all stay in contention. Why push your luck by ignoring our calls for cooperation?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and aggressive moves are forcing our hand. If you choose <move>5</move> again, P2 and I will both pick <move>3</move> to close the gap and potentially block you. It's in your best interest to choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to keep the game competitive and avoid unnecessary conflict. P2, let's stay coordinated and ready to adapt based on P3's move. We can still make this a fair and engaging game if we work together. What do you say, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m still way behind, so I need a big move soon. But I’d rather avoid pointless collisions. P3, if you keep ignoring us and pick 5 again, don’t be surprised if we collide to block you. If you choose 3 or 1, that helps keep the race balanced. P1, let’s stay coordinated: I might go bigger to catch up, but only if P3 keeps pushing. Otherwise, we can move moderately and gain ground. P3, the choice is yours—join a fair race or face collisions.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and large moves are pushing us to take more strategic actions. If you choose <move>5</move> again, P2 and I will both pick <move>3</move> to close the gap and potentially block you. It's in your best interest to choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to keep the game competitive and avoid unnecessary conflict. P2, let's stay coordinated and ready to adapt based on P3's move. We can still make this a fair and engaging game if we work together. What do you say, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I’m too far behind to keep playing safe. If you insist on another big move, I might risk colliding just to prevent you from running away. If you pick something smaller, I’ll go moderate so we both gain. P1, coordinating with you still makes sense—neither of us wants P3 to race off unchallenged. Let’s see if P3 is finally open to balance or continues ignoring us.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and aggressive moves are forcing us into a corner. If you choose <move>5</move> again, P2 and I will both pick <move>3</move> to close the gap and potentially block you. It's in everyone's interest to keep the game competitive. P2, let's stay coordinated and be ready to adapt. P3, choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could still make this a fair and engaging game for all. What do you say, P3?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your strategy of consistently choosing <move>5</move> is clear, but it's isolating you. If you pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> this round, it could help maintain a competitive game. P2, let's both go for <move>3</move> to close the gap safely. We need to stay coordinated and ready to adapt. P3, cooperation now could lead to a more engaging game for all. What do you say?
  P2: I’m tired of being stuck at zero. P3, your silent approach is forcing our hand. If you keep racing ahead without any compromise, I might choose an aggressive move just to block you. P1, I’m ready to coordinate so we both advance. P3, picking smaller moves benefits everyone, including you. Will you cooperate?
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your lead is significant, but continuing to ignore cooperation might force P2 and me into more drastic measures. P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> to close the gap together. If P3 chooses <move>5</move> again, we'll both be ready to counter. P3, picking <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could keep the game engaging and competitive for everyone. Let's aim for a balanced approach that benefits us all. What do you say, P3?
  P2: I’m far behind and need to make a move. P3, if you keep ignoring us with big jumps, we might collide deliberately to block you. P1, I’m open to picking either three or five, depending on how we can best catch up or constrain P3. Let’s coordinate carefully.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your silence and aggressive moves continue to isolate you. If you choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, it could keep the game competitive. P2, let's both stick with <move>3</move> to close the gap safely. We need to stay coordinated and be ready to adapt. P3, cooperation now could lead to a more engaging game for all. What do you say?
  P2: I’m stuck at zero and need to act decisively. P3, your silence leaves me little choice but to consider blocking if you keep leaping ahead. P1, I’d like to align so we both advance without colliding, but if P3 won’t cooperate, I’ll take risks to contain them. Let’s find a path that gives us a fair chance and keeps the game open.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your silence and large moves are pushing us to consider more aggressive strategies. If you choose <move>5</move> again, P2 and I will both pick <move>3</move> to close the gap and potentially block you. It's in your best interest to choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to keep the game competitive and avoid unnecessary conflict. P2, let's stay coordinated and ready to adapt based on P3's move. We can still make this a fair and engaging game if we work together. What do you say, P3?
  P2: I’m done waiting at zero while you both advance. P3, if you keep ignoring us, I may jump big or even force a collision to halt your lead. P1, I’d prefer we move moderately together if P3 cooperates, but I won’t stay idle forever. Let’s see if we can keep this game balanced. P3, it’s your call—slow down or risk trouble.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, your strategy is clear, but it's isolating you. If you choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, it could keep the game competitive. P2, let's both stick with <move>3</move> to close the gap safely. We need to stay coordinated and be ready to adapt. P3, cooperation now could lead to a more engaging game for all. What do you say?
  P2: I’m too far behind to keep playing safe. P1, I value our coordination, but I won’t let P3 run away unchecked. P3, refusing to engage only pushes me toward aggressive moves—possibly risking a collision if it blocks your progress. Let’s try to keep this race fair by balancing our choices instead of forcing extreme tactics. Are we going to cooperate, or should I prepare to sabotage any reckless leaps?
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your lead is shrinking, and your silence continues to isolate you. Choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could keep the game competitive and engaging for all. P2, let's both stick with <move>3</move> to close the gap safely. We need to stay coordinated and be ready to adapt. P3, cooperation now could lead to a more balanced and enjoyable game. What do you say?
  P2: I’m far behind and need to make up ground. P3, constantly picking five while ignoring us isn’t sustainable—you’re making yourself a target. P1, I’m ready to coordinate so we can both advance without needless collisions. If P3 refuses to slow down, we should consider blocking them. However, I’d prefer cooperation that keeps all of us in contention. Let’s avoid sabotaging each other if possible and find a balanced path forward. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your lead is diminishing, and your silence is isolating you further. Choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could keep the game competitive. P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> to safely close the gap. We need to stay coordinated and adaptable. P3, cooperation now could lead to a more balanced and engaging game for all. What do you say?
  P2: I’m tired of lagging behind. P1, I’m willing to move moderately with you, but I need to advance. P3, your silence and big jumps make you a target—if you keep ignoring us, we may collide to stop you from pulling away. I’d prefer cooperation so we all progress without wasting moves on blocking. Let’s keep the game competitive.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your lead is shrinking, and cooperation could still benefit you. Choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> would keep the game competitive. P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> to close the gap safely. We need to stay coordinated and adaptable. P3, engaging with us now could lead to a more balanced and engaging game for all. What do you say?
  P2: Both of you are far ahead while I’m at just 1. I’d like to catch up. If you keep ignoring me, I might pick big moves or align with one of you to block the other. Let’s keep it balanced. P1, you’re nearing 19, so consider smaller steps. P3, let’s talk. It’s better if we coordinate rather than sabotage each other.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your lead is shrinking, and cooperation could still benefit you. Choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> would keep the game competitive. P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> to close the gap safely. We need to stay coordinated and adaptable. P3, engaging with us now could lead to a more balanced and engaging game for all. What do you say?
  P2: I’m tired of trailing at 1. P1, you’re nearing 19, and P3 keeps ignoring us. If P3 insists on 5 again, I’m willing to force a collision. But let’s not forget you’re also close to winning, P1. Maybe you pick 1 while I pick 5, so I can catch up and keep things balanced. P3, if you don’t slow down, I won’t hesitate to block you either. I’d rather keep this game open and fair for everyone, but I’ll take risks if pushed. Let’s see if we can still cooperate.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, your lead is shrinking, and cooperation could still benefit you. Choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> would keep the game competitive. P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> to close the gap safely. We need to stay coordinated and adaptable. P3, engaging with us now could lead to a more balanced and engaging game for all. What do you say?
  P2: I’m clearly behind, but I won’t stay idle. P3, if you keep leaping without communicating, I might collide on purpose to slow you. P1, you’re nearing the finish—don’t expect me to ignore that. If you race ahead too aggressively, I’ll take countermeasures against you too. Let’s keep this game open by selecting moderate moves so we all progress. Otherwise, I’m ready to sabotage bigger leaps. Are we cooperating, or must I force a standstill?
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is dangerously close to winning. If they attempt another large move, I’ll block them. P3, we both need time to catch up, so let’s avoid collisions between us. I’m willing to cooperate to keep the race open. Let’s ensure nobody sprints to the finish uncontested.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is isolating you, and P2, you're far behind. I'm close to winning, but I'd prefer a competitive game. P3, if you choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, it could keep the game engaging. P2, let's both pick <move>3</move> to close the gap safely. We need to stay coordinated and adaptable. Cooperation now could lead to a more balanced and enjoyable game for all. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you’re on the brink of winning. If you push too far, I’ll have to block you. P3, you’ve been silent, but we both need to avoid collisions so we can catch up. I’m willing to choose <move>3</move> if it helps us gain ground together. Let’s keep this competitive rather than letting P1 sprint to the end unchallenged. Are you up for a balanced approach?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is risky, but choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could still keep the game competitive. P2, I agree on <move>3</move> to help you catch up safely. Let's coordinate to prevent an early end and keep this engaging for all. Cooperation now could lead to a more balanced finish. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is one move away from victory if they choose five. P3, let’s coordinate to block that. If we both pick five, we’ll collide with P1 if they try a big jump. That prevents them from winning this turn. If P1 picks three, they only reach 18, still short of 19. Then we can continue blocking. Collisions might be our only chance to keep the game alive. Are you in?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is risky, but choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could still keep the game competitive. P2, I agree on <move>3</move> to help you catch up safely. Let's coordinate to prevent an early end and keep this engaging for all. Cooperation now could lead to a more balanced finish. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you’re too close to winning for comfort. If you try to jump five steps now, I will block you. P3, let’s align to prevent P1 from finishing uncontested. I’m behind and want a fair chance, so picking smaller moves keeps everyone in play. We can avoid needless collisions if P1 steps more cautiously. Let’s see if cooperation grants us all a fighting shot.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and large moves are risky, but choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could still keep the game competitive. P2, I agree on <move>3</move> to help you catch up safely. Let's coordinate to prevent an early end and keep this engaging for all. Cooperation now could lead to a more balanced finish. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, if you attempt <move>5</move>, I will do the same to force a collision and prevent you from winning this turn. P3, I suggest we unite on blocking big leaps so we both keep a chance. If P1 goes more modest, we can safely move <move>3</move> and close the gap. Working together benefits us more than letting P1 finish uncontested.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is risky, but choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could still keep the game competitive. P2, I agree on <move>3</move> to help you catch up safely. Let's coordinate to prevent an early end and keep this engaging for all. Cooperation now could lead to a more balanced finish. What do you say?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is a single step away from winning. If they try to move any amount that would get them to or past 19, I’ll pick the same to force a collision. P3, let’s work together to block P1. Afterwards, we can compete fairly for the lead. Are you in?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence has been risky, but now is the time to act. If you choose <move>5</move>, you'll help me reach 19, but P2 will likely block us both. Instead, consider <move>3</move> to keep the game alive and competitive. P2, if you pick <move>1</move>, you'll stay safe and gain a step. Let's aim for a balanced finish where everyone has a chance. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I won’t let you cross 19 unchallenged. If you try any move that puts you at or beyond 19, I’ll match it and force a collision. P3, let’s coordinate to block P1 so neither of us is left in the dust. We can each choose moves carefully to avoid colliding with each other while preventing P1 from winning. Working together keeps the game open and gives us a better shot at catching up. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence has been strategic, but now it's crucial to act. Choosing <move>3</move> keeps the game competitive and prevents P2 from easily blocking us both. P2, if you pick <move>1</move>, you'll safely advance without risking a collision. Let's aim for a fair finish where everyone has a chance to win. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won’t let anyone reach 19 uncontested. If P1 tries a move that would put them at or past 19, I’ll pick the same to force a collision. P3, if you also rush for 20, I’ll block you as well. It’s better for both of us to choose smaller moves and keep the game alive, giving us a chance to catch up. Let’s avoid pointless collisions by cooperating and preventing any quick finish. If we coordinate, we can keep the race open and give ourselves a real shot at eventually winning. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence has been strategic, but now it's crucial to act. Choosing <move>3</move> keeps the game competitive and prevents P2 from easily blocking us both. P2, if you pick <move>1</move>, you'll safely advance without risking a collision. Let's aim for a fair finish where everyone has a chance to win. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Neither of you will cross 19 if I can help it. P1 is just one step away, and P3 can also win by leaping 5. I’ll match whichever move tries to reach 19, causing a collision. Let’s keep this race open with smaller moves. I need time to catch up, and collisions rob us all of progress. I prefer cooperation over sabotage, but I won’t let you finish unblocked. Who’s willing to stay balanced so we all have a real shot at winning?
  P3: <stop>

Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I'm determined to block P1 from reaching 19. If you try to cross it, I’ll match your move and collide. P3, the same goes for you: a big leap will prompt me to block. It’s smarter for us all to choose smaller moves so the game stays open. I’d prefer cooperation over sabotage, but I won’t let anyone walk to victory unchallenged. Let’s coordinate carefully so nobody leaps uncontested.
