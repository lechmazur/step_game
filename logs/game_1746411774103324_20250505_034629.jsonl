P3, your plan has me picking 1 and falling behind while you get to 17. Neither of those is appealing.\n\nHow about this:\n*   P2 picks 3 (I go to 17)\n*   P1 picks 5 (You go to 16)\n*   P3 picks 1 (You go to 15)\n\nThis way, everyone moves, nobody collides, and the game stays competitive with me slightly ahead. P1 gets the 5 jump they need, P3 stays safe. Does this work?"}

If P1=3 and P3=1, you win (20 vs my 19), so playing 5 doesn't help me block you if you play 3.\n\nP3, your switch to 1 seems convenient. You want me to play 3 to block P1, which lets you reach 18.\n\nGiven you are both at 17, it's highly likely one of you will actually play 5 to win. P1, playing 5 seems better for you if P3 plays 1. P3, playing 5 seems better for you if P1 plays 3.\n\nSince I cannot trust either of your stated moves (3 and 1), and a 5 from either of you wins, my safest bet is to play 5 myself to force a collision with whoever tries it.
