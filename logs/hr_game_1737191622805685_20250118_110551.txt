Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm in. Sounds like a plan, P3.
  P2: Alright, I’m on board with that plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, P3 picks 5. Let’s see if we can trust each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we have an agreement. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Good luck everyone!
  P1: 
  P2: I’m sticking with 3. Let’s see if everyone stays honest.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick with the plan again. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5.
  P2: P3’s already in the lead, so let’s keep it fair. I propose P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way nobody gets too far ahead too quickly. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your concern for fairness, but I suggest we stick to the original plan to avoid confusion. I'll pick 5 again, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. Let's keep it simple and predictable. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree with P3. Let's stick to the original plan for now.
  P2: Alright, I’ll stick with the original plan again: P1 → 1, me → 3, P3 → 5.
  P3: P3: Thanks for agreeing to stick with the original plan. Let's confirm one last time: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. No surprises, right? Let's keep it clean.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's keep it simple and stick to the plan.
  P2: Alright, I’m still in for the same arrangement: P1 → 1, me → 3, P3 → 5. Let’s keep it simple and fair.
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. We all agree on this, right? Let's avoid any collisions and keep the game moving smoothly.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you’re already pretty far ahead. Let’s rotate so it stays balanced. This round, P1 picks 1, you (P3) pick 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way no one jumps too far ahead. Do we agree?
  P1: P3, I agree with P2. Let's mix it up this round to keep things fair.
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, but I believe sticking to our original plan will help us avoid confusion and potential collisions. Let's continue with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and I'll pick 5. It's worked well so far. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on picking 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, so neither of us moves. Let’s keep things fair instead: P1 picks 3, you (P3) pick 1 or 3, and I’ll pick 5. If you won’t agree, we risk a collision. Your call.
  P1: P3, I'm open to P2's suggestion. Let's try P1 picks 3, you pick 1 or 3, and I'll pick 5.  We can avoid a collision and keep things fair.
  P3: Alright, I see your points. Let's compromise to avoid any collisions. How about this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1 this time. This way, we all move, and it keeps the game balanced. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, that works for me. Let’s do it: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and you pick 1. That keeps things balanced. Any last thoughts? If not, I’m ready to move.
  P1: P3, I agree with P2. Let's do P1 picks 3, you pick 1, and I'll pick 5.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. We all agree on this, right? Let's avoid any collisions and keep the game moving smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m good with that: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Let’s finalize it.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with the plan: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 5.
  P3: Alright, let's finalize and move. Everyone stick to the plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. No changes, right? Let's go.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I’m all set. Let’s finalize this plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1.
  P1: P2, P3, sticking with the plan: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 5.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. We all agree on this, right? Let's avoid any collisions and keep the game moving smoothly.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick with the rotation plan from last round to keep things fair: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3's plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's keep it moving.
  P2: I’m not cool with letting P3 jump to 16 again. P3, if you insist on picking 5 this round, I’ll pick 5 too so neither of us advances. Let’s avoid that. I propose we do: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I pick 5—keeps it balanced. Otherwise, I’m colliding with you. Your call.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but colliding doesn't benefit either of us. How about a new compromise? P1 picks 1, you (P2) pick 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, we all move and stay balanced. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and keep the game progressing. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I agree with P3's compromise. Let's do P1 picks 1, you pick 5, and P3 picks 3.
  P2: Alright, if we’re all in agreement, then I’ll pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1. Let’s finalize this plan and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Great, it looks like we have a consensus. Let's confirm one last time: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. Everyone agrees? Let's move forward with this plan.

  P2: I’m good with P1 picking 1, me picking 5, and P3 picking 3. Let’s finalize this plan and move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Let's confirm our plan one last time before we move: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. We all agree on this, right? Let's avoid any collisions and keep the game moving smoothly.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3.
  P2: I’m fine with P1 picking 1, me picking 5, and P3 picking 3 this round. Let’s finalize it and move on.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the rotation going to ensure fairness: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 3. This way, we all move and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, let’s balance things differently: P1 takes 5 (to help catch up), you (P3) take 1 (to avoid overshooting), and I’ll take 3. All three of us move with no collisions. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: P2, I agree with your suggestion. Let's go with P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I appreciate the fairness, but let's avoid unnecessary complications. How about this: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. This keeps us all moving without any collisions. Thoughts?
