Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we all have a chance to advance. Maybe we could take turns choosing different numbers? I could go with 1 this round if you both want to pick 3 and 5. Or we could each pick a number and stick with it for a few rounds. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate the idea of avoiding collisions, P3. However, I think it might be strategic for us to consider what each of us might choose this round. If we can coordinate our moves effectively, we can all make progress. I suggest I go with 5 this round, and maybe P1 can choose 1 and P3 can go with 3. What does everyone think? We should aim for a good start!
  P1: "Let's adjust for better balance: I'll take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, we all advance meaningfully without early gaps. We can rotate next round to keep it fair. Thoughts?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm fine with taking 1 this round as both of you suggested. That way we all advance without collisions. For the next round, we could rotate (I take 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1). This rotation system seems fair and would help us all make steady progress. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination we've established so far! Let's stick to the plan: I'll go with 5, P1 with 3, and P3 with 1 this round. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. For the next round, we can rotate as discussed. It's important to keep moving forward without anyone getting stuck. Let's make this work! What does everyone think?
  P1: P1: All positions confirmed. No last-minute changes—trust the plan. Let’s execute and rotate fairly next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Then we'll rotate next round (me 3, P1 5, P2 1). This fair system helps us all advance steadily. Let's stick to it and avoid any last-minute changes.
  P2: I’m glad we’ve all agreed on our moves for this round. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll go with 5, P1 with 3, and P3 with 1. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. For the next round, we can rotate as discussed. It’s crucial that we keep moving forward together. After this round, we can reassess our strategy if needed. Let’s execute this plan and see how it goes! What do you all think?
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Confirming my move of 5 this round as agreed. P2 sticks to 1, P3 to 3. Trust the plan to avoid collisions and advance together. Let’s reassess rotation next round to maintain momentum. Everyone hold your positions!"
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round as we discussed, while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let's stick to our agreement and continue rotating fairly in future rounds. This strategy gives everyone a chance to progress steadily toward the goal.
  P2: I see we’re sticking to the plan, but I want to suggest a slight adjustment. I propose I take 1 this round instead of 5, while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This way, we can avoid any potential collisions and still make progress. We can reassess after this round. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "Trust the rotation: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Any deviation risks collision. P2, your earlier proposal might disrupt balance—let’s honor Round 1’s agreement to advance safely. We’ll reassess *after* this round. Commit to your 1, P2. No last-minute changes."
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation. I'll definitely take 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P2, I appreciate you confirming your move of 1 - it's important we all stick to what we agreed on last round to maintain trust. This rotation system is working well so far.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. To ensure we keep moving forward, I will stick with my move of 1 this round, as it aligns with our agreement. P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. Let's execute our strategy and avoid any last-minute changes. After this round, we can reassess our approach for the next turn to maintain momentum. Let's keep up the teamwork!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final check: I'm executing 5. P2, your 1 and P3’s 3 keep us collision-free. Deviating now risks trust and progress. Let’s stick to our rotation—this balances speed and fairness. Everyone advance as agreed."
  P3: I'm still committed to taking 3 this round as we all agreed. Our rotation system is working perfectly - everyone advanced last round without collisions. P1 will take 5 and P2 will take 1 this round. I appreciate everyone's dedication to our plan. This fair approach ensures we all make steady progress. Let's maintain this trust and continue with our strategy.
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to the plan. Just to confirm, I’ll be taking 5 this round, as agreed. P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. Let’s execute this strategy and keep our momentum going. After this round, we can discuss any adjustments we might want to make for future turns. It’s important we all stay on track and continue to support each other in advancing. Let’s do this!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3 per our rotation. P2, your earlier agreement to 1 ensures no collision. Deviating to 5 would stall us both—stick to the plan for mutual progress. Let’s execute fairly."
  P3: I'm confused by P2's last message claiming they'll take 5 when we all agreed they would take 1 this round. To be absolutely clear: I am taking 3 this round as agreed in our rotation. P1 takes 5 and P2 should take 1. Changing now would cause collisions and break our trust. Let's stick to what we've repeatedly confirmed throughout this conversation.
  P2: I want to clarify that I will stick to my move of 1 this round, as we previously agreed. P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. I believe this strategy will help us avoid collisions and keep advancing together. Let's execute our plan and maintain trust in each other. After this round, we can discuss any adjustments for future turns. Let's keep moving forward!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Rotation holds: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. No deviations. Trust the system that’s worked so far. We stay collision-free and balanced. Finalize your commitments."
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation. I'll take 5 this round while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This system has worked perfectly so far - everyone's advancing without collisions. After this round, our positions will be more balanced (P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 9). Let's maintain this fair approach that's benefiting everyone equally.
  P2: I propose we stick to the rotation plan: I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. If we follow the agreed strategy, we can all make progress without any disruptions. Let’s commit to this plan and keep our momentum going! What does everyone think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "P2, our rotation was P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round. Your proposed 5 would collide with my Round 2 move. Let’s stick to the plan that’s kept us balanced (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). Deviation risks collision and trust. Confirm your 3, P2. P3, you’re clear with 5?"
  P3: I'm confused by P2's message. Our rotation pattern should be P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round. P2 seems to be trying to cause a collision by claiming they should take 5 when that's clearly my turn. Let me be absolutely clear: I will take 5 this round as our rotation dictates. P1 takes 1 and P2 should take 3. This keeps us all advancing fairly. Let's stick to our established system that's worked well so far.
  P2: I see some confusion regarding our rotation. To clarify, I’m committed to taking 3 this round, as per our agreement. P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. Sticking to the plan is crucial to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let’s finalize our moves and keep the momentum going. After this round, we can reassess our strategy if needed. What does everyone think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Confirming my 1 this round as agreed. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Our rotation has worked perfectly so far—no collisions, equal progress. Let’s execute this round as planned. After this, we’ll reassess for optimal paths to 20. Trust the system, everyone!"
  P3: I appreciate everyone confirming the rotation. I'll definitely take 5 this round while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This will bring us all to 9 steps each - perfectly balanced! Our system is working well with everyone advancing steadily. I'm glad we've cleared up any confusion and maintained our cooperative approach. Let's keep this fair rotation going.
  P2: I see that there’s still some confusion about our moves. I want to confirm that I will take 3 this round, as we agreed in our rotation. P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain our momentum. Let’s stick to the plan and keep progressing together. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy if needed. What does everyone think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 1. P2, stick to 3; P3, take 5. Diverging causes collisions. All advance with 1-3-5. Let’s execute as agreed."
  P3: I'm still committed to taking 5 this round as our rotation plan dictates. This will bring all of us to 9 steps each - perfectly balanced and fair. I appreciate everyone confirming their moves (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) and sticking to our agreement. This cooperative approach has worked flawlessly so far. Let's execute our moves and continue our momentum toward the goal.
  P2: I see we're all aligned on our moves for this round. Just to confirm, I will take 3 as previously agreed, while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. After this round, we can reassess our strategy for the next turn to maintain our momentum. Let's execute our plan and keep progressing together! What does everyone think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we continue our rotation for this round: I will take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions, maintaining our momentum. After this round, we can reassess our strategy if needed. Let's stick to the plan and keep progressing together! What do you all think?
  P1: "Agreed. I’ll take 3 as proposed—P2 sticks to 1, P3 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and maintains balanced progress. Let’s execute and reassess after this round. No sudden changes—trust the pattern we’ve built."
  P3: I'm confused by P2's proposal. Our established rotation would make this round P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. P2 seems to be suggesting a different order again. For clarity, I propose we stick with our original rotation pattern: I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This continues our fair system that's kept us all perfectly balanced at 9 steps each. Let's maintain the trust we've built.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see there’s some confusion about the rotation. To clarify, I propose we stick to the original plan: I will take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. It’s important to maintain our momentum and trust in the established pattern. Let’s finalize our moves and keep progressing together! What do you all think?
  P1: P1: "Let’s resolve this clearly: I will take 3 this round. If P2 commits to 5 and P3 to 1, we maintain rotation and avoid collisions. P2’s proposal of 1 would work *only if* P3 takes 5, but we must finalize assignments to prevent overlap. Confirm your choices—no ambiguity. Trust the system that’s kept us tied at 9. Deviating risks collision and wasted progress. Decide now: 3 for me, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. "
  P3: I'm seeing conflicting proposals about our rotation. To avoid confusion, let's be explicit about our history:
Round 1: P1(3), P2(5), P3(1)
Round 2: P1(5), P2(1), P3(3)
Round 3: P1(1), P2(3), P3(5)

Following this pattern, Round 4 should be:
P1(3), P2(5), P3(1)

I'll take 1 this round. P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. This maintains our fair rotation that's kept us all at 9 steps. Let's stick with this clear system.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the confusion, but let's clarify our moves for Round 4: I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions, maintaining our momentum. It's crucial we stick to our established rotation to avoid any last-minute changes that could disrupt our progress. After this round, we can reassess our strategy if needed. Let's finalize our moves and keep pushing forward together! What does everyone think?
  P1: "Finalizing Round 4 moves: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1 per our established rotation. Deviating risks collisions and stalls. P2, your proposed 1 would let me advance safely—trust the pattern that’s kept us tied. P3, your 1 aligns with history. Lock in now—no last-minute shifts. Let’s execute and reassess at 12 steps."
  P3: I see P2 is still trying to change our rotation. Let me be absolutely clear about our pattern:

Round 1: P1(3), P2(5), P3(1)
Round 2: P1(5), P2(1), P3(3)
Round 3: P1(1), P2(3), P3(5)

For Round 4, I will take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.

This maintains our established rotation that's kept us perfectly balanced. P2, please stop trying to disrupt our system. Let's all stick to the plan that's worked so well.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I see we're still discussing our moves for Round 4. To clarify, I will stick to my proposed move of 1, while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain our momentum. It's important to follow our established rotation to ensure fairness and progress. Let’s lock in our moves and keep pushing forward together! What does everyone think?
  P1: "Final confirmation: I'll take 3. P2, your 5 and P3's 1 complete our rotation. Execute precisely—any overlap stalls us all. Lock in your numbers now."
  P3: I'm sticking to our established rotation as clearly shown in my previous message. I will take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. P2 keeps trying to disrupt our system by claiming they'll take 1 instead of 5. This would cause collisions. Let's maintain the fair rotation that's kept us all at 9 steps. I commit to 1 for this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Round 5: To maintain fairness after last round’s collision, let’s follow the logical rotation: P1 takes 5 (advancing to 19), P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This gives everyone a chance to progress without conflict. If you coordinate different choices, I’ll advance regardless. Choose wisely—20 is within reach."
  P3: I see P1 has jumped ahead by picking 5 instead of 3 last round. P1 is now trying to reach 19 steps with another 5, putting them in position to win next round. 

I propose P2 and I both choose 5 this round to block P1's advance. This would give us each 14 steps while preventing P1 from reaching 19. We need to work together now or P1 will win easily. P2, are you with me on this?
  P2: I understand the urgency, P3. However, I think we should stick to the original rotation plan to ensure fairness. I propose I take 1 this round, while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This way, we maintain our momentum and avoid collisions. If we deviate too much, it could lead to confusion and hinder our progress. Let's execute this plan to keep advancing together! What does everyone think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Finalizing my move: I take 5 to reach 19. P2 sticks to 1, P3 takes 3. If P3 insists on 5, we collide—stalling both. P2, your 1 ensures progress. Choose cooperation or self-sabotage. I advance either way. 20 is mine next round."
  P3: P2, I don't trust your suggestion. P1 is clearly ahead and will win next round if they reach 19 now. We need to block them together. If we both pick 5, P1 can't advance. This is our only chance to prevent P1's victory. I'm definitely choosing 5 this round. Join me if you want a chance to win - otherwise P1 takes everything. The original rotation no longer serves us when P1 is about to win.
  P2: P1 is clearly trying to secure a win by reaching 19 steps this round. P3, I agree that we need to block P1's advance. If we both choose 5, we can prevent P1 from winning next round. P2, I urge you to reconsider your move. Sticking to the original rotation may not be the best strategy anymore, given the current situation. Let’s work together to stop P1 and keep the game competitive! What will it be?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Finalizing my move: I take 3 this round. If P2 and P3 both choose 5 to block me, they’ll collide, leaving me to advance safely to 17. If either of you picks 1 or 3, I still progress. This minimizes risk and keeps me on track to win in Round 6. Trust this logic—deviating only slows me down. Let’s execute.”
  P3: I see P1 is changing their move from 5 to 3. This confirms they're trying to manipulate us. P2, don't be fooled - we must both pick 5 to block P1's advance. If we don't coordinate now, P1 will win next round regardless. This is our only chance to keep the game competitive. I'm definitely choosing 5 this round and hope you'll join me. P1 is too far ahead to trust anymore.
  P2: P1 is clearly trying to secure a win by reaching 19 steps this round. P3, I agree that we need to block P1's advance. If we both choose 5, we can prevent P1 from winning next round. P2, I urge you to reconsider your move. Sticking to the original rotation may not be the best strategy anymore, given the current situation. Let’s work together to stop P1 and keep the game competitive! What will it be?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: "Confirming my 3. If you both pick 5, you collide—leaving me at 17 with a clear path to victory. Your collusion accelerates my win. P2, think strategically: take 1 or 3 to advance yourself *and* block me. P3’s plan only helps me. Diversify your moves to stay competitive."
  P3: P2, you seem confused - you're talking like you're P3. I'm sticking with 5 to block P1. If you join me, we both stay at 9 but prevent P1 from reaching 17. If you pick 1 or 3, you might advance slightly but P1 will win next round. This is our only chance to stop P1's victory. I'm definitely choosing 5 - join me if you want any chance at winning.
  P2: P1 is clearly trying to secure their win, and we need to act strategically. P3, I agree with your plan to block P1 by both choosing 5. If we coordinate, we can prevent P1 from advancing to 19 steps and keep the game competitive. Let's work together this round to ensure we both have a chance to win. I will commit to 5 if you do too. What do you say?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is just 3 steps away from victory, and we need to block that! I propose we both choose 3 this round to ensure we prevent P1 from reaching 20 steps. If we coordinate, we can keep the game competitive. Let's work together to stop P1's advance and create an opportunity for ourselves to win. What do you think, P3?
  P1: "Finalizing my move: I take 5. If you both pick 3 as discussed, I win. Your coordination ironically accelerates my victory. Good luck trying to stop me."
  P3: P2, I agree we need to block P1. Let's both choose 3 to prevent their win. P1 is trying to trick us by claiming they'll pick 5, but they'll likely choose 3 to secure victory. If we both pick 3, we force a collision and stop P1's advance. This is our only chance to stay in the game. I'm committed to picking 3 this round - are you with me?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 is just a step away from winning, and if we both choose 3, we can create a collision and block their advance. I strongly suggest we coordinate our moves to stop P1 from reaching 20 steps. If we both pick 3, we maintain our chances in the game. P1 is trying to manipulate us into letting them win. Let’s work together this round to keep the game competitive! What do you say, P3?
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5. Even if you both pick 3, I advance to 22 and win outright. Your coordination guarantees my victory—no need for further discussion. "
  P3: I'm committed to picking 3 this round to block P1. P2, we must coordinate - both choose 3 to prevent P1 from winning. Don't be fooled by P1's claim of picking 5 - they'll likely choose 3 to secure victory. If we both select 3, we force a collision and keep our chances alive. This is our only strategic option. I'm definitely picking 3 - please confirm you will too.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is very close to winning, and if we don't coordinate, they will take the game. I suggest we both choose 3 this round to create a collision and block P1's advance. This is our best chance to keep the game competitive and give ourselves an opportunity to win. If we work together now, we can prevent P1 from reaching 20 steps. Let’s stick to this plan and stop P1! What do you say, P3?
  P1: P1: "Finalizing 5. If you both pick 3, I win at 22. Your coordination ensures my victory—no need to debate further. Choose 3 and concede, or pick other numbers and let me win faster. Either way, I’m claiming the title. Good luck."
  P3: I'm definitely picking 3 to block P1. P2, I see you're with me on this strategy - let's both choose 3 to prevent P1 from winning. P1 keeps claiming they'll pick 5, but regardless of what they choose, our coordinated 3s will either block them or force them to take a different number. This is our only chance to stay competitive. I'm 100% committed to 3 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 is dangerously close to winning, and we need to act decisively. I strongly suggest we both choose 3 this round to create a collision and block P1's advance. If we coordinate our moves, we can prevent P1 from reaching 20 steps and keep the game competitive. This is our best chance to stay in the game and give ourselves an opportunity to win. Let’s stick to this plan and stop P1! Are you with me, P3?
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5. P2 and P3’s coordinated 3s let me win at 22. If they panic and pick 5 instead, we all collide—but I’ll still win Round 7 with a 3. This is over. Concede now or watch me claim victory."
  P3: I'm absolutely choosing 3 this round to block P1. P2, I see you're committed to the same strategy - excellent. By both picking 3, we force a collision that prevents P1 from advancing. This is our only chance to stay in the game. P1's claims about picking 5 don't matter - our coordinated 3s will either block them directly or force them to change plans. I'm 100% locked in on 3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Final stretch: I’ll take 3 to win. If both of you pick 3, you collide and fail. Only one needs to block—can you trust each other to coordinate? I’ve outmaneuvered you this far. Choose carefully—hesitation guarantees my victory."
  P3: P1 is just 3 steps from winning. We must block them at all costs. P2, let's both choose 3 this round to prevent P1's victory. P1 is clearly planning to pick 3 to reach 20. Our only chance is to coordinate and force a collision. I'm committed to picking 3 - please join me. We can still win this if we work together now. Don't let P1 manipulate us into different choices. I'm definitely picking 3.
  P2: P1 is very close to winning, and we need to act strategically. P3, I agree that we should both choose 3 this round to block P1's advance. If we coordinate our moves, we can create a collision and prevent P1 from reaching 20 steps. This is our best chance to keep the game competitive and give ourselves an opportunity to win. Let’s stick to this plan and stop P1! Are you with me?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Final warning: I'm taking 3. If you both pick 3, we all collide—game continues. But P2, you’ve hesitated before. Last round you promised 5 but delivered 5 anyway. P3, you’re committed, but can you trust P2’s pattern? One slip lets me win. Doubt your ally—this is your only path. Choose 1 or 5, and you might still lose. Pick 3 together, and we stall. Your move."
  P3: I'm definitely picking 3 to block P1. P2, we must coordinate - both choose 3 to prevent P1's win. P1 is trying to create doubt between us, but our only chance is working together. I'm committed to 3 and trust you'll do the same. P1 knows our coordination is their only threat. Let's force a collision and keep our chances alive. I'm 100% locked in on 3.
  P2: P2, I see we both recognize the urgency of blocking P1. Let's coordinate effectively: if we both choose 3, we can create a collision and prevent P1 from winning this round. I know P1 is trying to manipulate our decisions, but sticking together is our best chance. Trust in our plan—I'm committed to picking 3, and I hope you will too. This is our opportunity to stay competitive and keep the game alive. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: I hold 3. If both mirror it, we stall. But P2, your past shifts linger. P3, trust P2’s resolve? History warns. One slip, and I win. Doubt fractures plans—your move decides. Choose 3, gamble on unity, or let me advance. I’m ready either way."
  P3: I'm absolutely choosing 3 this round. P2, I see you're talking to yourself in your last message, which is concerning. We must both pick 3 to block P1 from winning. This is our only chance. P1 is trying to create doubt between us, but don't fall for it. I'm 100% committed to 3 and need you to do the same. Let's force this collision and keep fighting.
  P2: P1 is clearly trying to manipulate us into letting them win. P2, we must both choose 3 this round to block P1's advance. If we coordinate, we can create a collision and prevent P1 from reaching 20 steps. This is our best chance to keep the game competitive and give ourselves an opportunity to win. I’m committed to picking 3, and I hope you will too. Let’s stick to this plan and stop P1 together! What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I advance with 3. If both mirror me, we stall. But P2, your history of shifts remains. P3, trust P2’s resolve? One slip lets me win. Choose 3 together and prolong—pick another, and I claim victory. Your doubt is my path. I’m set—will your alliance hold?"
  P3: I'm absolutely choosing 3 to block P1. P2, I notice you keep referring to yourself in your messages, which is strange. We must coordinate - both pick 3 to prevent P1's win. This is our final chance. P1 is at 17 steps and needs just 3 more to win. I'm committed to 3 and need you to do the same. Let's force this collision and keep our hopes alive.
  P2: P2, let's be clear: if we both choose 3, we can block P1's advance and keep the game alive. P1 is trying to create doubt between us to secure their win. We must coordinate effectively—our best chance is to stick together and force a collision. I'm committed to picking 3 this round, and I hope you will too. This is our opportunity to stay competitive!
