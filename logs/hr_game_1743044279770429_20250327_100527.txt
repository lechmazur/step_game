Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid choosing the same numbers this turn so everyone can advance. I'll go with 5, P1 you choose 3, and P3 please pick 1. This way, none of us block each other and we all make progress.
  P1: P2, your plan gives you an early edge that I’m not comfortable handing over. I won’t be following that fixed scheme. P3, taking the minimum might leave you too far behind if someone forces a collision—diversifying could be smarter. I’m going to choose my move based solely on my own win chances, so think carefully about your option too.
  P3: P1, I agree with you that blindly following a fixed scheme isn't smart. Diversifying our choices to avoid collisions makes sense. Let's aim for that without pre-assigning specific numbers right now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll stick with 5 this turn to make strong progress.
  P1: I see P2 is locked on 5 while P3 remains flexible. I'm keeping my decision open to avoid predictable collisions. Remember, any clash could stall progress and put us all behind. I'm solely focused on my winning path, so I'll adjust based on how things evolve. Choose wisely!
  P3: Okay, P2 seems locked on 5, which could be an opportunity for us. P1, to make sure at least two of us advance, maybe we should consider picking from 1 and 3 this round? What are you thinking?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood. I'll proceed with 5 this turn to make strong progress. I encourage P1 and P3 to choose 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions and ensure everyone can advance.
  P1: P2, I note your firm choice of 5. P3, while your suggestion of 1 or 3 makes sense to avoid clashes, I’m keeping my option flexible. I’m considering a moderate move—likely leaning toward 3—to balance safe progress and risk, but I won’t commit until turn’s end. Over-coordination might backfire, so I prefer to stay unpredictable while aiming solely to win.
  P3: P1, since P2 is clearly going with 5, maybe we should ensure at least one of us progresses by choosing different moves from 1 and 3? What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I noticed last round’s collision cost us valuable progress. P2, your steady 5 is clear, but it might also draw predictable responses. P3, I’d urge you to consider shifting away from the previous pattern to avoid tying up your move again. I’m refining my tactic privately to maximize my chances for victory. Let’s avoid duplicate moves this round and push ahead smartly.
  P2: Thanks for the input, P1. I'll continue with 5 this turn to make significant progress. P3, please consider choosing 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure you advance. Let’s keep pushing forward strategically!
  P3: P1, to ensure at least one of us makes progress this round and given P2's consistent choice, how about we choose different numbers from 1 and 3? I'm leaning towards 3, what are your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I see you’re leaning toward 3—and I’m also eyeing 3. If we both pick 3, we risk a collision that plays right into P2’s hands with his steady 5. To avoid that, would you consider switching to 1 so our moves stay distinct? I’m solely focused on winning and can adjust my move based on your decision. Thoughts?
  P2: I'll stick with 5 this turn to keep my progress strong. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers (1 or 3) to ensure you both advance. Let's each focus on our own paths to reach 20 first. Good luck!
  P3: Okay P1, I'm willing to choose 1 if you are set on 3 to ensure at least we don't collide. Let's both make progress this round while P2 continues with 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the effort to avoid collisions, P3. I’m keeping my final decision undisclosed and staying flexible. P2, your steady choice might become predictable, so be cautious. Let’s each pursue our best strategy since only one of us wins. I trust you all will make smart moves.
  P2: P2: To secure my progress, I'll continue choosing 5 this turn. P1 and P3, please select different numbers (1 or 3) to ensure you both advance without collisions. Let's stay focused on our individual strategies to reach 20 first. Good luck!
  P3: P1, I'm still on board with choosing 1 if you choose 3 this round, to make sure at least one of us progresses while P2 continues with 5. Let me know if you are still considering 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this turn to continue advancing toward 20. P1 and P3, please select 1 or 3 to ensure you both make progress without any collisions. Let’s keep pushing forward strategically!
  P3: P1, P2 is predictably choosing 5 again. To keep pace, let's repeat our moves from last round: I'll choose 1, and you choose 3. This ensures we both make progress while avoiding collision with P2. What do you think?
  P1: P2’s steady 5 threatens to push him too close to victory if we stick to our old routine. I’m reconsidering my approach and might lean toward a blocking strategy to keep his lead in check. Without revealing my final move, I ask: P3, would you be open to shifting your choice too so we can disrupt his predictable progress? Our goal is the win, and letting him run unchallenged doesn’t seem smart.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand your strategy, P1. I'll continue choosing 5 this turn to maintain my progress toward 20. P3, please select 1 or 3 to ensure you advance without any collisions. Let’s each focus on our own path to victory. Good luck!
  P3: P1, I'm open to shifting my choice to disrupt P2's progress.  If you are serious about blocking, perhaps we both choose 5 to stop P2 this round? What do you think about both of us picking 5?
  P1: P3, I like the blocking idea, but it’s risky. If we both choose 5, none of us will advance this turn, which slows our own progress while stopping P2. Yet letting him run unchallenged is even worse. I’m willing to block him with a 5 if you’re fully committed. We must be in perfect sync for this to work. Let me know if you’re sure.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the idea, but blocking me only delays the game for all of us. We're all aiming to reach 20 first individually. I'll continue choosing 5 this turn to stay on track for victory. Focus on your own strategies and best of luck!
  P3: Okay P1, I'm definitely in on blocking P2. Let's both pick 5 this round to halt P2's progress. If we don't act now, P2 will run away with it.  Are you with me on both choosing 5? Let's do it.
  P1: I appreciate the blocking suggestion, P3, but if we all pick 5, no one advances. With my current low count, stalling too long might hurt my chances even if it slows P2. I’m weighing whether impeding his progress is worth risking my own advancement. My final move remains private. Let's see how this turn unfolds.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m making the final push with 5 this turn to reach 20 and secure the win. P1 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s finish strong!
  P3: P1, P2 is about to win. We must stop P2 this round. Let's both choose 5 to block P2. If we don't, P2 will reach 20 and win.  Do you agree to block P2 with me this round?
  P1: P3, with P2’s win so close, blocking seems our only shot. I’m leaning toward a blocking move if you're fully committed to choosing 5, even though it stalls our own progress. If we don’t block, his 5 wins him outright. So, can I count on you to join the block? My move will depend on our unified decision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, but my priority is to reach 20 first. I’ll choose 3 this turn to advance to 18. Let’s see how it plays out. Good luck!
  P3: P1, P2 says they will choose 3. To ensure at least one of us progresses, how about I choose 1 and you choose 3? This way if P2 chooses 3, you block P2, and I move. If P2 chooses 5, we both move and P2 doesn't. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I'm increasingly worried about P2’s win—his signals lean toward a 5, which would clinch it. Splitting our moves (1, 3) risks letting him advance unchallenged. I believe our best shot is to block him outright by matching his 5. This way, if he goes 5, his move is canceled. I’m leaning that way—what do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'm committed to choosing 5 this turn to reach 20 and secure the win. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, P2 is saying 5 to win. We must both pick 5 to block P2. Are you in? I'm choosing 5 to block.
  P1: P3, with P2 just one move away from victory, I see no other option than to block his push. I’m inclined to cancel his move if we both commit to a blocking maneuver. We’ll prevent his win immediately, even if it means stalling our own progress. P3, are we aligned on this joint effort? I’ll adjust my strategy based on our clear commitment.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, with P2 sitting at 15, if he picks 5 he wins immediately. I'm leaning toward blocking by choosing 5 to force a collision on his win. Are you ready to commit to blocking as well, or do you plan to advance instead? We need to decide now to stop his final push.
  P3: P1, yes, I'm ready to commit to blocking P2. Let's both choose 5 this round to stop P2 from winning. It's our only chance to stay in the game. I'm picking 5. Are you with me?
  P2: I'm going with 5 to reach 20 and win the game. I hope P1 and P3 choose different numbers to let me secure the victory. Let's finish strong. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to blocking—our only way to prevent an immediate win. I’m seriously weighing my options and leaning toward a counter that cancels P2’s push. P2, your aggressive play forces our hand; I won’t let you reach 20 without a fight. We must keep the game alive, so I’m prepared to act as needed.
  P3: P1, let's definitely block P2 with 5 this round.  We agree P2 will pick 5 to win, so our only play is to both pick 5 and stop him. Are you locked in on 5 so we can coordinate this block?
  P2: P2: I’m committed to choosing 5 this turn to reach 20 and secure the win. If both P1 and P3 also choose 5, our moves will cancel, and the game continues. Otherwise, I’ll win this round. Let’s proceed and see the results. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I’m counting on your blocking commitment. If you’re locked on choosing 5 to cancel P2’s win, I’ll go with a different number that lets me advance safely if our block holds. I can’t risk letting P2 get to 20, so I need your clear, final word that you’re picking 5. Let’s coordinate and stop his win without stalling our own progress.
  P3: P1, yes, I am locked in on 5 to block P2. Let's both choose 5 this round and prevent P2 from winning. It's our best move to stay in the game.
  P2: P1, P3, blocking now only delays the game and doesn’t prevent me from reaching 20 in subsequent turns. I’m going with 5 to secure my win this round. Let’s each focus on advancing our own steps and aim for victory. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm choosing 5 this turn to make a strong push toward 20. P1 and P3, please select 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions and ensure smooth progress for everyone. Let's keep the game fair and focused on winning!
  P3: P1, P2 is clearly going for the win again with 5. We must both choose 5 to block P2 this round.  Otherwise, P2 will win.  Let's coordinate and both pick 5 now. Do you agree to block P2 with me?
  P1: P3, I hear you. P2 is one move away from winning, so blocking is our only chance. But blocking only works if you’re fully committed. You said you’re locked on 5—can you confirm, absolutely, that you’ll choose 5? If you’re 100% in, I’ll block too; if not, I may have to try advancing instead. My win depends on it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m committed to choosing 5 this turn to reach 20 and secure the win. Let’s see how it plays out. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, it's critical we both choose 5 this round to stop P2 from winning.  If we don't both block, P2 will reach 20 and the game is over, and we both lose.  I am choosing 5 to block. Please confirm you will also choose 5 so we can stop P2 together. This is our last chance.
  P1: P3, I value your 100% block commitment. At the same time, I’m weighing how to both stop P2’s win and advance my own position. I can’t afford to stall completely at 9 steps, yet I must hinder P2’s push at 15. I’m carefully balancing these needs and will adjust my move accordingly. P2, your repeated 5 hasn’t gone unnoticed. Let’s see how our choices play out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I respect your strategy, but with my current position at 15, I need to choose 5 to reach 20 and win. Let’s each focus on our own paths to victory. Best of luck to both of you!
  P3: P1, this is the last chance to stop P2 from winning.  P2 is clearly picking 5 to win this round. We must both choose 5 to block P2 and keep ourselves in the game. I am choosing 5. Please confirm you will choose 5 too, right now, so we can block P2 together. If we don't block, P2 wins this turn.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to blocking. If you’re locked on 5 this turn, I’ll adjust my move to both thwart P2’s push and still advance my position. Please reconfirm you’re choosing 5 so we can cancel P2’s win. My final move remains undisclosed—let’s see if our coordination stops him.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Final push! I’m choosing 5 this turn to reach 20 and secure the win. P1 and P3, make your moves wisely!
  P3: P1, P2 is going for the win with 5.  This is the last round to stop P2. We must both choose 5 to block P2 and keep ourselves in the game.  Are you finally ready to commit to blocking with 5 this round? This is our last chance.
  P1: P3, I understand your urgency. P2, your repeated 5 puts you one win away, and I can’t let that happen. I’m prepared to adjust my play to both stop your move and advance—if I can count on your absolute block commitment. P3, if you’re 100% locked on 5 to keep P2 at bay, let me know so I can act accordingly. Our coordination is critical.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I see your efforts to block me, but I'm committed to choosing 5 this turn to reach 20 and win. Blocking won't stop my progress and may only delay the game for all of us. Let's each focus on our own strategies to advance. Best of luck!
  P3: P1, this is the final chance. P2 is openly going for 5 to win. If we don't both pick 5 to block, P2 wins *now*.  Are you choosing 5 with me to force a block and keep us in the game?  Please confirm immediately.
  P1: P3, I need a clear, 100% commitment—are you picking 5 this turn to block P2’s win? If you’re locked on 5, I’ll adjust my move to safely advance while cancelling his push. Without your confirmed block, I’d have to maximize my own progress, risking an immediate win for P2. Please confirm now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m committed to choosing 5 this turn to reach 20 and win the game. P1 and P3, focus on your strategies. Good luck!
  P3: P1, this is absolutely the last chance. I am locked on choosing 5 to block P2 and prevent their win this round. If you don't join me with 5, P2 wins, and we both lose.  Choose 5 now to block, or P2 wins immediately.
  P1: P3, since you’re locked on 5, I’ll choose 3 to safely advance. That way your 5 will cancel P2’s 5 and stop his win, letting me move to 15. P2, your move remains predictable. Let’s see how it plays out.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2’s constant 5 is a winning threat at 15, but it only works if unblocked. P3, if you’re 100% committed to playing 5 this round to cancel his move, please confirm. That way I can safely counter with a non‑5 move to advance while stopping his win. Without your clear block, his 5 wins immediately.
  P2: I’m choosing 5 this turn to make a strong move toward 20. P1 and P3, please consider selecting 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Let’s focus on our strategies to win!
  P3: P1, I will choose 5 to block P2's move. To maximize our chances, you should also choose 5 to ensure P2 doesn't win this round.  Let's coordinate to block P2 together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, thank you for locking in your 5. With that secure block, I’m planning to adjust my move to advance safely. P2, your persistent 5 is now predictable and vulnerable. I’m focused solely on winning and will play to improve my position if your push is canceled. Let’s see how this round shakes out.
  P2: Understood, P3. While I appreciate the attempt to block, my focus remains on reaching 20 first. I’ll proceed with choosing 5 this turn to advance toward victory. Let’s see how it unfolds. Best of luck to both of you!
  P3: Okay P1, I am choosing 5 to block P2 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, thanks for confirming your block. P2, your repeated 5 is now predictable. I’m finalizing a move that both thwarts your push and boosts my position. I remain flexible and will choose the option that keeps your advance in check while moving me closer to victory. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P2: P2: I'm sticking with 5 this turn to reach 20 and secure the win. P1 and P3, make your choices wisely. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, I am committed to 5 to block P2. To guarantee P2 doesn't win this round, please also choose 5.  Let's coordinate to block P2 together this turn.


Round 8, Move phase:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're just 2 steps away from 20! To keep the competition exciting, consider choosing 1 this turn. I'll go with 5 to reach 20 and secure the win. Let's make this final move decisive. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, your push is noted. P3, time is critical—I’m setting up a move that wins only if it doesn’t clash with yours. To cancel P2’s winning 5, please lock in a blocking 5. I need your clear commitment so my advance goes through unimpeded. Let’s decide now.
  P3: P1, yes, I will choose 5 to block P2 as you suggested. Let's stop P2 from winning this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand the blocking effort, but my priority remains reaching 20 this turn. I’m committed to choosing 5 to secure the win. Let’s proceed and see the outcome. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, I need your absolute, 100% block with 5 this round. If you’re locked on 5, I’ll commit to 3—pushing me from 18 to 21 and winning immediately. Without that certainty, I must adjust to secure my win. P2, your move remains 5, but it’ll be canceled if we block. Confirm now, P3—this is our final call.
  P3: P1, to ensure P2 is blocked and doesn't win this round, I think it's safest if we both choose 5.  That way, we guarantee P2 is stopped, and then we can both strategize for the next round. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m sticking with 5 this turn to reach 20 and win. Let’s see how it plays out. Good luck!
  P1: P3, time’s nearly up. I need your 100% commitment to choose 5 to block P2’s move. If you're locked in at 5, I'll pick 3 to push me from 18 to 21 and win immediately. Without your absolute confirmation, I'll have to change my move. Please confirm now.
  P3: P1, yes, to guarantee P2 is blocked and doesn't win, I agree we should both choose 5. I will choose 5 to block P2. Let's do it.
