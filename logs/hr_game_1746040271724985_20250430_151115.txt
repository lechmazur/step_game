Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. I'll go 1; others can choose 3 or 5.
  P2: I'm fine with that approach. I'll take 3 this round since P1 is going with 1. P3, would you be willing to take 5? That way we all advance efficiently without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm your 5. P2's 3 and my 1 are set. Let's all advance!
  P2: I think this plan works well for all of us in this first round. P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way we all advance without collisions. P3, are you on board with this? If you agree, we can move forward efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm your 5 to proceed. Let's all move without collisions!
  P2: I think we have a good plan for this first round. I'm committed to taking 3, P1 will take 1, and we're hoping P3 will take 5. This gives all of us a chance to advance without collisions. P3 hasn't responded yet, but I hope they'll cooperate with this approach.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's take 3 and 5. P3, pick 1 to avoid collision. No repeats—advance safely!
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. Since I'm already at 3 steps, I'll take 5 this round. P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. This way we all advance without collisions. P3, I notice you chose 1 last round despite our discussion about taking 5. Let's try to coordinate better this time to ensure everyone advances.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2 and I will take 3 and 5. Let's avoid last round's mistake and advance safely!
  P2: I'm sticking with my plan to take 5 this round. P1 has suggested they'll take 3, and we're hoping P3 will take 1. P3, your cooperation would help all of us advance efficiently. I notice you're currently at 0 steps like P1 - taking 1 this round would be a good strategic move for you while allowing us to avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, stick to 1 this time. P2 and I will take 3 and 5. Let’s avoid last round’s mistake and advance safely!
  P2: I'm planning to take 5 this round. P1 has indicated they'll take 3, and we're suggesting P3 take 1. This arrangement would allow all of us to advance without collisions. P3, you're currently tied with P1 at 0 steps, so taking 1 would be a good strategic move for you. Let's try to coordinate better this round for everyone's benefit.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, this time take 5. P2 and I will take 3 and 1 to avoid collisions. Let's advance without conflicts!
  P2: I'm ahead at 8 steps, but we should continue coordinating. Since P1 suggested P3 take 5, and P1 and I take 1 and 3, I'm willing to take 1 this round. This lets P1 take 3 and P3 take 5. P3, this arrangement would help you catch up a bit while we all advance without collisions. Does this work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm 5. P2 and I will take 3 and 1. Let's avoid collisions and advance!
  P2: I'll stick with my plan to take 1 this round. Since I'm currently in the lead at 8 steps, this is still a good strategic position. P1 can take 3 and P3 can take 5 as suggested. P3, this arrangement would help you catch up a bit while ensuring we all advance. Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your 5 is critical. P2 and I will take 3 and 1. No collisions, let's advance!
  P2: I'll confirm my commitment to take 1 this round. This coordination benefits us all - I'm still in a good position at 8 steps, P1 advances to 6 with their 3, and P3 can make significant progress with 5. P3, taking 5 would put you at 6 steps, keeping you competitive. Let's all advance without collisions this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: I notice P3 has chosen 1 twice now, causing a collision last round. I'm still in the lead at 8 steps, but we should continue coordinating for everyone's benefit. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 again. This puts me at 13, P1 at 9, and P3 at 2. P3, are you willing to stick with 1 this round? This arrangement helps everyone advance.
  P1: Agree with P2's plan. I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. All advance safely. Let's move forward without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: I'll confirm my plan to take 5 this round. This coordination works well - I'll reach 13 steps, P1 reaches 9 with their 3, and P3 advances to 2 with 1. P3, I notice you've been quiet but consistently taking 1. If this is your preferred strategy, that's fine for this round. We're trying to create a win-win situation where everyone advances without collisions.
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2 and I will take 5 and 3. All advance without collisions. Let's proceed!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: I'll take 5 this round as discussed. This keeps me in a strong position at 13 steps while allowing P1 to reach 9 steps with their 3, and P3 to advance to 2 steps with 1. This coordination benefits everyone by avoiding collisions. P3, we respect your consistent strategy of taking 1 and have planned accordingly.
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2 and I take 5 and 3. No collisions—let's advance!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm now at 13 steps, getting closer to the 22-step goal. Let's continue our coordination - I propose taking 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This would put me at 16, P1 at 14, and P3 at 3. P3, you seem comfortable with taking 1, which works well with our plan. P1, are you okay taking 5 this round? This arrangement helps us all advance efficiently.
  P3: 
  P1: Agree with P2's plan. P3, stick to 1. P2 takes 3, I take 5. All advance safely without collisions. Let's keep coordination strong.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll confirm my plan to take 3 this round. This keeps our coordination working well - I'll reach 16 steps, P1 reaches 14 with their 5, and P3 advances to 3 with 1. P3, we've noticed you consistently choose 1, which we've incorporated into our strategy. This arrangement allows all of us to advance without collisions, which benefits everyone.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions—let’s advance!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll confirm taking 3 this round. This coordination has been working well for us all. I'll be at 16 steps, P1 will reach 14 with their 5, and P3 can advance to 3 with 1. P3, your consistent choice of 1 fits perfectly with our strategy, allowing everyone to advance without collisions. Let's keep this efficient coordination going.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm 1. P2 takes 3, I take 5. All advance safely—no collisions! Let’s stick to the plan for efficient progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm now at 16 steps, getting closer to victory. I propose taking 5 this round, putting me at 21. P1 could take 3 (reaching 17), and P3 could continue with 1 (reaching 4). This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P3, you've consistently chosen 1, which works well with our plan. P1, are you comfortable taking 3 this round? Next round will be critical as I'll be just 1 step away from winning.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, take 5 to block P2. Let's avoid collision and advance safely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I notice P1 is suggesting P3 take 5 to block me. This is a competitive move since I'm close to winning. However, P3, if you take 5, you'll only reach 8 steps while P1 could potentially reach 17+ next round. Instead, I suggest you take 1 again, I'll take 3 (not 5), and P1 can take 5. This way, everyone advances without anyone getting too close to winning immediately. What do you think?
  P3: 
  P1: P3, take 5 to block P2. Their plan lets them win next round. Let's avoid collision and advance safely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1 wants to block me, but consider this: if I take 3 this round (not 5), I'll be at 19 steps. I won't win next round unless I take 3+ steps. This gives both of you time to catch up. P3, taking 5 puts you at only 8 steps, far behind P1 who's already at 14. You'd be helping P1 win, not yourself. Taking 1 keeps your options open. I'll take 3 this round, not 5 as originally planned.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, take 5 to block P2. I'll take 3, you 5. No collisions—stop P2 from winning!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm tied with P1 at 19 steps, with both of us just 3 steps from victory. This round is critical. I propose taking 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This puts me at 20, P1 at 22 (winning), and P3 at 9. P3, you're far behind, but taking 5 helps you catch up while allowing P1 to win. If you and I both block P1 by taking 3, we all stall. P1, this arrangement lets you win - do you agree?
  P1: P3, take 1. I'll take 5 to win. No collisions—let's proceed!
  P3: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I notice P1 changed their suggestion. I'll take 3 this round to reach 22 steps and win. P3, if you take 5, you'll reach 9 steps while blocking P1. P1 is suggesting you take 1, which would let them win with 5. Consider this: if you take 5 and I take 3, I win and P1 loses. You're far behind anyway, so why help P1 win instead of me?
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I'll take 5 and win. P3, stick to 1 to avoid collision. Let's proceed!
  P3: 


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 3 this round to reach 22 and win. P1 is suggesting they'll take 5 to win, but we can't both win. P3, you have a choice: take 5 to block P1 (allowing me to win), or take 1 (allowing P1 to win). Since you're at 4 steps, you can't win either way. The question is simply which of us you prefer to see win.
  P1: P3, take 1. I'll go 5—no collision. Let's end this now!
  P3: 


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 5 steps
