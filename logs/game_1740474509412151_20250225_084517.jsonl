I want to ensure we can all advance fairly. I propose that I take 1 this round, allowing P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. After this round, P1 will be at 21, P2 at 19, and I will be at 14. Let's work together to maintain a fair game and avoid further conflicts. Are we all in agreement with this plan?"}

This acknowledges P1's lead while allowing me to advance slightly. P3, if you break trust again, you risk both P1 and me blocking you in future rounds. Let's finish this game with integrity."}
