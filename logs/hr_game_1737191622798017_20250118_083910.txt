Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate and avoid collisions. Maybe we can alternate who moves each turn?
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns moving: P1 moves first this turn, P2 next turn, and P3 after that. This way, we can all progress without stepping on each other. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with the idea of taking turns. If I go first this turn, I’ll choose <move>5</move>. P2 can then take <move>3</move> next turn, and P3 can take <move>1</move> after that. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds like a good plan. I'll stick to <move>1</move> when it's my turn.
